Dear Members and Friends:

This quarter the Euro-Africa Division has the privilege of benefit-
ing from the Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects offering. In ad-
vance, we wish to thank you and the Lord for your generous help,
which will contribute toward two projects in Spain and Belgium.


1.   Evangelistic Center in Brussels, Belgium

This interesting city with its international atmosphere has over a
million inhabitants. The Belgian metropolis presents a real challenge
to the proclamation of the three angels' messages. Our two churches
in Brussels, the one French and the other Flemish-speaking, urgently
need suitable meeting halls. This need must be met now, for wonderful
opportunities have opened up for evangelistic work.



2.   Girls' Dormitory at Sagunto College, Spain

This school was founded in 1965 and since then it has grown rapidly.
The theological department, which has 35 students enrolled at the
present time, offers Spanish and Portuguese young people the first
two years of ministerial training. The total student body numbers
well over 200. The college's greatest need is for a girls' dormi-
tory. At the moment the girls are living in the school classrooms.
The shortage of space has become so acute that something must happen
soon.


We look forward to being able to carry out these two projects in the
very near future. Once again, may we extend to you our heartfelt
thanks for your support. When God's children determine to further
God's cause, great things are achieved.


                                                 Your brother in Christ,



                                                 E. Ludescher,

Introduction
SEEKING THE GLORY OF GOD
   "For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
Amen" (Matt. 6:13). Thus have many of us prayed from our earliest
years, learning to say the words before we could understand them.
And still we fail to sense their full meaning for us, without a doubt.
   Behind the familiar words of the Lord's Prayer lie the age-long
conflict between Christ and Satan. All the relationships of the in-
habitants of the universe are involved. And on our small planet
the way has been provided for those who will to return to seeking
the glory of God.
   Satan's rebellion in heaven was the first challenge to the heart of
God's glory—to His character which reveals His perfect selfless love.
During this quarter we will seek to define God's glory, see it in the
person of God, see it in the face of Jesus. We will see how man lost his
reflection of God's glory in Eden.
   We will see the cross providing the way back to God, the way to
seek His glory rather than our own. Restoration full and complete is
contemplated. We will consider the means and agencies that God has
provided for this purpose. We will hear our Lord in intercessory
prayer for His glory to be restored in us.
    In the struggle and sometimes heartache of daily living, we too
easily forget our high calling. The home is one of the places where we
too often forget. God wants those homes restored to seeking His
glory.
    From the Scriptures, we will note that God's people through the
ages have been seeking His glory, some more earnestly than others.
 But only He knows the many who were faithful though unrecorded in
 the Word. He is looking for the final triumph of the remnant people as
 the controversy between good and evil sweeps to its climax. The
cross provides for victory all the way. And soon the glory—in the
 sense of awe, majesty, and power—of the advent will signal the close
 of the conflict. The redeemed of all ages will join the living saints in the
 final triumph, not only of glory, but in the place and home of
 glory. Then a unified universe will resume in unbroken measure the
 unfailing seeking of the glory of God. That restoration will signal the
 end of sin and Satan. Unceasing righteousness and eternal love will
 pervade the universe.
    "Thy kingdom come" (Matt. 6:10).

                                                   Adult Lesson



Challenge to
God's Glory
  "Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day thou wast created, till
iniquity was found in thee" (Eze. 28:15).

   These words are found in the dirge addressed to the king of Tyrus.
In them, and in attendant verses, there seems to be an undoubted portrayal
of the source of the first challenge to God's government. And that
involved a challenge to God's glory.
   There came a day when Moses asked God for a personal revelation of
His glory. And in His response God touched upon the two major
aspects of His glory: His goodness (Ex. 33:19) and the overwhelming
majesty of His Person (verses 20-23).
   God's goodness, His character, His selfless love are the foundation
of His government. The law of His kingdom expresses, in principles that
meet our condition, the nature of God's character.
   From the few explicit scriptures that speak of Satan's rebellion and from
the other few that may make indirect references, we have a picture.
   Satan introduced the spirit of self-exaltation into the universe, and
through it he has worked constantly to draw to himself glory and honor.
He wants especially the power and praise side of glory. The spirit of
Jesus, by contrast, is the spirit of self-sacrifice. It will be His Spirit, "the
glory shining in the face of Jesus," that will finally prevail.
   When the great rebellion in heaven was first transferred to this earth,
Satan used methods that Christ could not use—lying, deception, immo-
rality, false slogans, and exciting suggestions. Many good people are
entrapped, often tragically and permanently, by such lures.
   The object of this lesson is to note the method of approach in some of
Satan's snares. To show that though worldly honor be lost, all the glory
that endures results from following the Christ road.
   Those who, like the prodigal son, have lost both wealth and the
father's home may find themselves feeding on husks. Fortunately, some
people do learn from life's experiences and decide to redeem the time
by making good use of the remaining opportunities. Such are likened to
brands, plucked from the fire. (Compare Joshua, the high priest—Zech.
3:2.)
   Sin has given Satan access to humanity. He claims all, even God's
people, as his own. Because of this fact we are warned that temptations
will come to each one of us but that there will be limits to them. With
Christ as our Helper, they will not be greater than we can bear. (See
1 Cor. 10:13.)
   The admonition of Jesus is that we "watch and pray" (Matt. 26:41).

            Challenge to God's Glory                                 1 Sunday
                                                                      March 28

   Part 1     What event brought Lucifer to this earth to foster his rebellion?
INVOLVES
CREATION      "The great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,
            and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the
            earth, and his angels were cast out with him" (Rev. 12:9). (See verses
            7, 8.)

              The exact timing of the events seen by John is not revealed to us.
            Christ connects Satan with "the beginning" (John 8:44). We find
            the tempter in Eden. Other glimpses of his work are given, and
            together they give us the picture of his character and purpose.
              One great issue in Satan's rebellion was an emphasis on worship
            of "the creature more than the Creator" (Rom. 1:25). Thus the
            challenge to God's principles of love touched this earth.

              How did sin originate? 1 John 3:8. (Compare Eze. 28:13-15.)

               "Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been most
            honored of God and was highest in power and glory among the
            inhabitants of heaven. . . . He stood in the presence of the great
            Creator, and the ceaseless beams of glory enshrouding the eternal
            God rested upon him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 35.
               Repeatedly in history, earthly warfare has ranged back and forth
            over key territories on earth such as Palestine or has involved key
            routes like• the Khyber Pass. The battle of the ages is not over
            territory but over less tangible issues such as power and position.
            Character is the focal point of it all, the character of love.
               Leaders of world empires anciently banished their defeated foes
            to penal colonies to get rid of them. But it was not God's purpose to
            make this world a penal colony for Satan and his followers. Rather,
            it has become an arena in which opposing forces would work out
            their policies of government as "a lesson to the universe."—
            Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 42.
               We might assume from the Genesis account that the first rebel-
            lion took place about the time of this earth's creation. (See The
            Story of Redemption, pp. 13, 14.) In such a relationship, it would
            be understandable that this world would become the battlefield
            between God and Satan and the allegiance of man would be rebel-
            lion's focal point.

              How are Satan's claims on this world suggested in our Lord's third
            temptation? (See Matt. 4:8, 9.)

                Challenge to God's Glory                                1  Monday
                                                                          March 29

       Part 2      With what characters and for what purpose did God create our
    TOUCHES     first parents?
ADAM AND EVE
                  "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
                he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them,
                and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
                earth, and subdue it" (Gen. 1:27, 28).

                  It is quickly evident in the Genesis account that Satan was
                seeking to thwart God's plans in the creation of man. He suggested
                that God was protective of His own glory, in terms of power and
                knowledge. His rule should be challenged. (See Gen. 3:1-6.) The
                image of God must be destroyed.

                  In the spread of rebellion from heaven to earth, how could mere
                eating have such dire results? Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1-24. (Compare
                1 Tim. 2:13, 14.)

                   "The sin was not merely in yielding to appetite. It was distrust of
                God's goodness, disbelief of His word, and rejection of His author-
                ity, that made our first parents transgressors, and that brought into
                the world a knowledge of evil."—Education, p. 25.
                   God could at any point have given man up. But He did not.
                Instead, He gave a greater revelation of His love in providing the
                remedy for sin.
                   It is said that the bird with the broken pinion never soared so
                high again, but Paul tells that "where sin abounded, grace did
                much more abound" (Rom. 5:20). Then he anticipates our unspo-
                ken question, "Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
                The answer is, "God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin,
                live any longer therein?" (Rom. 6:1, 2).
                   Christ characterized Satan as a liar and a murderer "from the
                beginning" (John 8:44). It is clear, then, that Lucifer was not
                interested in the continuance of the glory of God's character
                (image) in man. He had not been interested for himself. He brought
                death to man.

                 What feelings did Adam and Eve experience when they forfeited
                God's presence? (See Gen. 3:7, 10, 15.)

                  "Man was not abandoned to the results of the evil he had
                chosen. . . . Before they heard of the thorn and the thistle, of the
                toil and sorrow that must be their portion, or of the dust to which
                they must return, they listened to words that could not fail of giving
                them hope. All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could be
                regained through Christ."—Education, p. 27.

               Challenge to God's Glory .                             1 Tuesday
                                                                         March 30

      Part 3     "The Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheri-
IEFLECTED      tance. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
 IN ISRAEL     wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the
               apple of his eye" (Deut. 32:9, 10). . •

                 "It was a high honor to which Abraham was called—that of
               being the father of the people who for centuries were to be the
               guardians and preservers of the truth of God to the world, the
               people through whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed
               in the advent of the promised Messiah."—Prophets and Kings, p.
               15.
                 The highest calling to which any human being can aspire is that
               of interpreting the glory of God to mankind through the acceptance
               of Christ's sacrifice and the consequent living of a Christlike life.

                  When, after long and patient nurturing, the people of Israel failed
               to respond to the love of God, who was responsible? Isa. 5:4; Jer.
               2:21.
                                                                 •
                   When we look back at the history of Israel, we are inclined to
               follow the pattern of children in a family who each wonder how the
               other can be so foolish as to displease Mother or Dad. When Israel
               had such awesome revelations of God, and we seemingly have
               nothing comparable in our time, we sometimes marvel at ancient
               Israel for her disobedience to God.
                   "Satan was determined to keep his hold on the land of Canaan,
               . . . and when the law of God was made the law of the land, he hated
               Israel with a cruel and malignant hatred and plotted their
               destruction."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 688.

                 Did God's rejection of Israel mean an abandonment of His plan to
               save man? Isa. 55:6-9; Rom. 11:25, 26, 32.

                 We wonder at the repeated cycles of waywardness and repen-
               tance that marked the history of Israel. Could we possibly be
               repeating those same cycles despite the full blazing sunlight of the
               gospel?
                 "No earthly parent ever pleaded so earnestly with an erring
               child as He who made us pleads with the transgressor. No human,
               loving interest ever followed the impenitent with invitations so
               tender."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 275.

                 "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is
               risen upon thee" (Isa. 60:1).

      Part 4     In the remarkable prophecy made by the father of John the
REACHES THE    Baptist, what purpose made the Christ the target of Satan's attacks?
  INCARNATE
       LORD      "The dayspring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them
               that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into
               the way of peace"(Luke 1:78, 79). (Read verses 67-79.)

                 "Satan had been working to make the gulf deep and impassable
               between earth and heaven. By his falsehoods he had emboldened
               men in sin. It was his purpose to wear out the forbearance of God,
               and to extinguish His love for man, so that He would abandon the
               world to satanic jurisdiction."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 34, 35.
               But the Seed of the woman was about to come.

                    How did Herod attempt to destroy the baby Jesus? Matt. 2:16.

                  When Jesus later entered upon His ministry, He visited the
               synagogue in Nazareth and announced the charter of His life of
               service. (See Luke 4:16-20.) Satan prompted the religious leaders
               to oust Jesus from the synagogue and from the city, and they
               prepared to throw Him over a cliff. Thus the enemy demonstrated
               his fury.
                  In the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness, Satan sought to
               accomplish spiritually what he had failed to do physically. He tried
               to make Jesus serve him, the deceiver. All through His earthly life
               Jesus endured every possible abuse and accusation.

                 How did Peter try to prevent the Lord from going to His impend-
               ing death? Matt. 16:21, 22.

                  Jesus spoke to Peter's protest and to the tempter who lay behind
               the suggestion: "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offense
               unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those
               that be of men" (verse 23).
                  Here is one example of what was true at every step of Christ's
               stay in this world. Christ constantly revealed the "image of God"
               (2 Cor. 4:4). Satan and his supporters contested every gesture of
               Christ's unfailing love for all mankind. Sometimes the attack came
               through open enemies, sometimes through sincere but unthinking
               friends. We may think of the repeated open conflicts between
               Christ and the religious authorities of His day. Behind these au-
               thorities were the continuous efforts of Satan to cause Christ to
               fail, to lower His defenses for a moment, to be caught off-guard, to
               fail to give glory to the Father.

                  Through what kind of human agents might Satan now be working
               to destroy souls, especially those of the youth?

                                                                            April 1

     Part 5     What is Christ's goal in regard to His church?
UCHES THE
.Y CHURCH       "That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water
              by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
              having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy
              and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26, 27).

                Christ has returned to His Father in triumph. The bright glory of
              heaven is His again. The glory of the divine character had never
              dimmed. Now only His followers are left as Satan's targets. But
              the Comforter is with them and in them. Christ will not fail in His
              goal for His church.

                How was the glory of Christ's character reflected in the early
              church's use of material wealth? Acts 2:44-46; 4:32, 36, 37; 5:1-4.

                "Of the apostolic church, in those bright days when the glory of
              the risen Christ shone upon them, it is written that no man said
              `that aught of the things which he possessed was his own."'—
              Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 137.
                "The first Christian church had not the privileges and oppor-
              tunities we have. They were a poor people, but they felt the power
              of the truth. . . . They felt that the salvation or the loss of a world
              depended upon their instrumentality. They cast in their all and
              held themselves in readiness to go or come at the Lord's
              bidding."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 156, 157.

                To what persecution was the early church membership subjected,
              and how did this affect its character? Acts 7:59, 60; 9:1; 12:1, 2, 5,
              12.

                 Having killed James, the brother of John, Agrippa wanted to
              continue to curry favor with the Jews, who prevailed upon him to
              undertake the further persecution of the Christians. He impris-
              oned Peter and took great precaution to see that he should not
              escape. The story of Peter's deliverance is found in Acts 12.
                 "Through trial and persecution the glory—the character—of God
              is revealed in His chosen ones. . . . They are purified in the furnace
              of affliction. . . . Being partakers of Christ's sufferings, they can
              look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, 'I reckon that the
              sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
              the glory which shall be revealed in us.' "—The Acts of the Apos-
              tles, pp. 576, 577. (Emphasis supplied.)

                 Will "Christians" accustomed to "the good life" be wiling to seek
               an uncomfortable refuge in the time of trouble ahead?

    Part 6 What assurance does the Christian have that others cannot enjoy?
    AS HE
PROTECTS   "The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
 HIS OWN him, and delivereth them" (Ps. 34:7).

             Notice that though the "camp" of the angel is nearby, it is not
           always in prominence. Neither does the angel always deliver from
           suffering or cruel death. Not even those serving in other lands than
           their own. Not here shall we see the glory of the divine purpose in
           every experience. In this sometimes strange, sad world that is our
           Father's school, Paul linked his sufferings to the glory of God. (See
           2 Cor. 4:5-11.)

             Since God "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
           sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matt. 5:45), what is the
           benefit a Christian may anticipate? (See Ps. 37:23-28; 73:2, 3, 12, 17;
           John 14:27; 16:33; Rom. 8:1.

              The uncertainty of life for so many makes envy of the rich a
           strong temptation. But one great search in the world today is for
           secure places in which to protect wealth. David was tempted
           to envy the wicked for their prosperity. But he found an answer to
           his question when he looked at eternal values.

             Compared with the experience of His ancient people, what can
           God's people do today to prepare for the trials ahead? Zeph. 1:14,
           15; 2:1-3.

            "It is because they [the people of God] are drawing nearer to
          Christ, and their eyes are fixed upon His perfect purity, that they
          so clearly discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin. Their contrition
          and self-abasement are infinitely more acceptable in the sight of
          God than is the self-sufficient, haughty spirit of those who see no
          cause to lament, who scorn the humility of Christ, and who claim
          perfection while transgressing God's holy law. . . . The crown of
          glory awaits those who bow at the foot of the cross."—

                                                                2
What Is Glory?
  "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give
you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him" (Eph.
1:17).



   Putting our text aside for a moment, what does the word "glory"
itself bring to mind? A sunset, a cathedral, a coronation, a stallion, or
untold wealth? Perhaps something like honor or character. Perhaps
something that calls for praise, worship, or adoration. Its meaning
could include any or all of these.
   The range of words translated as glory in the English Bible
includes "adornment," "honor," "brightness," "beauty," "majesty,"
"purity," preciousness," "weight," "heaviness," "desire." The most
frequently used Hebrew word for glory means (in verb form) "to be
heavy." Ancient people who traveled abroad often returned "heavy"
with gifts. These suggested honor, approval, or praise on the part of
their hosts. Perhaps also on the part of the people who became aware of the
gifts.
   These brief observations about biblical usages of the words for glory
should alert us to one thing. We should not expect that wherever the
word appears it carries the same meaning. Sometimes the setting or
context in which the word appears will guide us to the meaning. The
use of a concordance can be helpful also. But our limited
 consideration of the general term glory is only to shed light on the
 glory of God—our overall study for the quarter.
   Throughout the Bible "glory" deals with wealth, gifts, attributes,
and objective reality on the one hand, and the aura of honor and praise that
the objects call forth on the other. Let us keep these thoughts in mind in
our study. By doing so we can gain important insights into God's
 purposes for us and can better know our role in the realization of these
 purposes.
    Referring back to the first lesson, not one among us wants to "come
short of the glory [praise and approval] of God" (Rom. 3:23). And not
one of us would choose to be absent when God's glory (His character
 arid its worthiness) is displayed to the universe, with praise ascending
 from people of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.
    "Through trials and persecution, the glory—character—of God is re-
 vealed in His chosen ones."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
 ing, p. 31.
    Throughout our study this quarter we will discover that God's glory is
 a present reality for us as well as a strong hope for the future. In fact,
 God's glory involves every moment of our lives.
                                                                    13
               What Is Glory?                                             2 Sunday
                                                                              April 4

      Part 1     According to the psalmist, with what attitude were the "great"
"GLORY" IN     people of earth to relate to God?
   THE OLD
 TESTAMENT     "Give unto the Lord, 0 ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and
               strength" (Ps. 29:1).

                  As already noted, the root meaning of the word glory in the Old
               Testament is "to be heavy," or "to be laden down." One might
               wonder how our present concept of glory emerged from that.
               Language, as you may well understand, is never static, but some
               degree of meaning is generally passed along. We sometimes re-
               mark concerning a rich man that he is "loaded with wealth." If this
               phrase conveys meaning in an age of paper money and computers,
               think how much more it would have done so in a time when wealth
               was carried in saddlebags or even worn as anklets or as bracelets.

                    Where did some patriarchs stand in terms of glory as wealth?

                  "Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold" (Gen.
                13:2). When he sought a wife for Isaac, he sent his servant with ten
                camels laden with wealth as a bridal present. (See Gen. 24:10, 53 .)
                  Jacob also was very rich. After he had worked for Laban many
               years, he departed from him laden down with wealth. Now note
               the lament of Laban's sons: "Jacob hath taken away all that was
               our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all
               this glory [from kabod, "weight," "heaviness," "honor"]" (Gen.
               31:1). Jacob had not only taken the wealth of his father-in-law, but
               he had taken also the feeling that went with it.
                  Job, according to the Scriptures, was regarded as "the greatest
               of all the men of the east" (Job 1:3). Then one day he was deprived
               not only of all his physical possessions, but he was also regarded as
               a great sinner. One kind of glory Job retained—his character. He
               could say, "When he [God] hath tried me, I shall come forth as
               gold" (Job 23:10). This glory counts for eternity.
                  While kabod is translated as "glory" 155 times (in the KJV), it is
               also translated as "honour" 29 times. Not all rich men were
               worthy of the honor given to the patriarchs, but they often gave the
               onlooker a feeling of awe, if not of respect.
                  Glory in the Old Testament often touches upon the earthly
               sanctuary. There the visible glory above the mercy seat made
               known the presence of God. He was with His people, Israel. (See
               Ex. 40:34, 35 for example.)

                  In what ways is it possible for a person today to achieve true beauty
               of character—true glory?

                Further Study: This week, look in a Bible concordance for the
               word glory and note its wide and varied uses.

                                                                          April 5

    Part 2     "Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
LORY THAT    house is increased; for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his
   PASSES    glory shall not descend after him" (Ps. 49:16, 17).

               In our text for today the psalmist speaks of people who "trust in
             their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches"
             (verse 6). But their wealth cannot bring them glory forever. "Their
             inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and
             their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after
             their own names" (verse 11). Those who make earthly glory their
             goal "are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; . . . and their
             beauty shall consume in the grave" (verse 14).
               Nebuchadnezzar was one who boasted, "Is not this great Baby-
             lon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of
             my power, and for the honour of my majesty?" (Dan. 4:30). God's
             answer was swift—the king would be humiliated until he should
             learn "that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men" (verse
             32).

               When Nebuchadnezzar had learned who it is that overrules the
             affairs of men, what new attitude toward the glory of God was he
             able to reveal? Dan. 4:37.

               To what does Isaiah liken earthly glory as seen in the goodliness of
             the flesh? Isa. 40:6-8.

               Members studying this lesson in lands where grasses and leaves
             are the only available fuel will have a vivid understanding of
             Isaiah's words. Not so those who have heating, cooling, and
             cooking at the turn of a knob. Everyone can understand how
             quickly and intensively grass can grow and how soon it can fade
             and burn. So swiftly will human glory disappear. So quickly pass-
             ing is the goodness of man. Yet so many still make selfish and
             visible glory their prime goal in life.

                By contrast, what glory, offered to Jerusalem by Isaiah, remained
             to be revealed at Christ's two advents? (Compare Isa. 40:1-5 with
             John 1:14; 2:11; 2 Peter 1:16, and Rev. 1:7; 21:23, 24, 26.)

                 "About His [Jesus'] coming cluster the glories of that 'restitu-
              tion of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His
              holy prophets since the world began.' Acts 3:21. Then the long-
              continued rule of evil shall be broken; 'the kingdoms of this world'
              will become 'the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He
              shall reign for ever and ever.' Revelation 11:15."—The Great

                                                                         April 6

      Part 3     What example do we have in which our Lord carried an Old
"GLORY" IN     Testament illustration of glory over to the New?
   THE NEW
 TESTAMENT       "Why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field,
               how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto
               you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
               these" (Matt. 6:28, 29).

                 Solomon's glory was, in part, his gold, his garments, his horses
               and chariots, his extensive household. And along with these pos-
               sessions went the atmosphere that surrounded them. The visible
               glory of Solomon was well acknowledged. But in sharp contrast to
               this glory was that of the lilies of the field. At first he had been
               modest and unassuming in the exercise of his governing power.
               But soon pride marred the true glory of his character.
                  We may want to analyze how Solomon got his wealth after he
               lost his true glory. Perhaps through taxation, perhaps by forced
               labor, subjugation, hoarding, and intrigue. But who can dissect the
               glory of a dew-drenched lily, open to the morning sun, so as to find
               the exact origin of its marvelous tints and designs?

                 What lesson in spiritual priorities can the Christian gain from the
               temporary glory of the lilies of the field? Matt. 6:30, 33.

                  That the beautiful righteousness of Christ is bestowed on us and
               is not achieved by our own works, is quite evident from Jesus'
               words. This blessed assurance of justifying righteousness we must
               ever retain by faith which has its fruit in obedience. Christian
               growth is also a gift of God, one that calls for our cooperation with
               the Holy Spirit.

                 How does growth relate to life—both in nature and in the true
               glory of Christian character?

                  "As in nature, so in grace; there can be no life without growth.
               The plant must either grow or die. As its growth is silent and
               imperceptible, but continuous, so is the development of the Chris-
               tian life. At every stage of development our life may be perfect; yet
               if God's purpose for us is to be fulfilled, there will be continual
               advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime. As our
               opportunities multiply, our experience will enlarge, and our
               knowledge increase. We shall become strong to bear responsibil-
               ity, and our maturity will be in proportion to our privileges."—

           What Is Glory?                                     2 Wednesday
                                                                        April 7

   Part 4  In terms of our need of God's approval, in what desperate state do
   GOD'S we humans all find ourselves?
APPROVAL
             "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Rom.
           3:23).

             When Adam and Eve chose Satan as their adviser and ruler,
           they brought the whole human race into slavery. As Paul says,
           "To whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye
           are to whom ye obey" (Rom. 6:16).
             We have fallen short of meeting God's mind, His expectation of
           us, His approval. We are therefore unable to attain it. There is only
           one Saviour (Isa. 43:11; Acts 4:12), and that Saviour is not myself
           or yourself. Only God, through Jesus Christ, can make us beautiful
           and restore the lost glory.

              In His work of restoration, how did Jesus relate the restoration of
            health to the forgiveness of sin? John 5:14. (See also verses
            1-16.)

               Jesus never left a job half done. When He healed people, He set
            them on the road to the kingdom. When He healed bodies, He
            sought to heal minds also. To those who found fault with Him for
            healing on the Sabbath, He said, "If a man on the sabbath day
            receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken;
            are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole
            on the sabbath day?" (John 7:23).
               We need a healing that will cure the ills of the entire person.
            When Christ forgave past sins, He also urged toward the cessation
            of sin—"Go, and sin no more." And yet He patiently cast an evil
            spirit out of Mary seven times. The words of Paul express God's
            ideal for us: "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
             pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blame-
             less unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 5:23).

              To what extent can a person be regarded as whole who is not
            experiencing the continuing work of sanctification?

              A plant is regarded as whole even when it is a healthy shoot;
            blossoms and fruit are yet to come. At every stage of our lives we
            can be perfect but still progressing to a new perfection. Each day
            should find us ready to receive more grace.
              "You are a sinner. You cannot atone for your past sins; you
            cannot change your heart and make- yourself holy. But God prom-
            ises to do all this for you through Christ. ... You will to serve Him.
            Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you."—

              What Is Glory?                                         2 Thursday
                                                                            April 8

     Part 5      In what ways can we glorify (bring praise to) God in our daily
"GLORY" AS    living?
    PRAISE
                "Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his
              conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God" (Ps. 50:23).

                 Hebrew parallelism indicates that in our text the offering of
              praise calls for ordering one's "conversation aright." "Conversa-
              tion" is an old word for "way," "journey," "manner." Modern
              versions tend to reflect this more accurate meaning: "to him who
              orders his way aright" (RSV).
                 So ideally, our way of life is a constant source of praise to God.
              The angels are examples to us of bringing glory to God in their
              praise. They likewise praise Him by their tireless errands of love.
              (See Ps. 148:2; Isa. 6:2, 3.) The psalmist spoke joyously of the
              heavenly hosts in their praise to God (Psalm 148). Praise is also
              said to be "comely" (Ps. 33:1). And we are to "give unto the Lord
              the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of
              holiness" (Ps. 29:2).

                Relate our way of living to the glory of God. (Compare Rom. 4:1,2
              with verse 20.)

                What did "way" mean to the early Christians? (See Acts 19:23;
              22:4.)

                Notice that to the first-century Christians their religion was not
              merely a creed to be repeated. It was not a song of praise to be sung
              once or twice a week. Their whole life, their whole "way," set
              them apart and was a song of praise to the glory of God.
                "The greatest praise that men can bring to God is to become
              consecrated channels through whom He can work."—The Acts of
              the Apostles, p. 566.

                What effect will trial have upon the praise offered to Jesus by a
              believer?

                "That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
              gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
              praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ"
              (1 Peter 1:7).

                                                                            April 9

     Part 6     "Behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah, who ap-
MOSES AND     peered in glory and spoke of his departure" (Luke 9:30, 31, RSV).
 ELIJAH IN
    GLORY       We note that it was as men that Moses and Elijah appeared on
              the mount in glory—not as sinful men, however, but as forgiven,
              saved, transfigured, and transformed men.
                Were Moses and Elijah somehow of a holier kind than we? We
              remember that it was Moses himself who received this word from
              God: "Get thee up into this mountain . . . and die in the mount . . .
              because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at
              the waters of Meribah-Kadesh" (Deut. 32:49-51). And James said
              of Elijah that he was "a man subject to like passions as we are"
              (James 5:17). So we have no reason to think that these men were of
              a different nature from us. Neither did they find a way of salvation
              that is closed to us.
                 In the Bible account of these great leaders of the past we have
              assurance that all of God's earthly children who choose to surren-
              der to Him will reflect Christ's character. In meeting with God's
              approval, through the grace of Jesus, they do and will share in His
              glory.

                Why were Moses and Elijah so highly honored?

                 No direct answer to this question is to be found in the Bible. The
              Gospels are more accounts of actions than explanatory writings,
              except where they record the teachings of Jesus. Yet we know
              enough about the life experiences of Moses and Elijah to under-
              stand, in part, why they, of all the hosts surrounding the throne of
              God should be sent on this particular mission to the Son of God.
              Both men in their earthly experiences had been called to stand
              alone under most discouraging and almost overwhelming odds.
              Through the loving care of God in the ministry of angels, they had
              emerged from those experiences triumphant. As human beings
              they couldfeel with Christ in His coming agonies. This He needed.

                 How would you compare human beings and angels in their ability
              to bring glory to God by their faithfulness?

                "God could have proclaimed His truth through sinless angels,
              but this is not His plan. He chooses human beings, men compassed
              with infirmity, as instruments in the working out of His designs.
              The priceless treasure is placed in earthen vessels. Through men
              His blessings are to be conveyed to the world. Through them His
              glory is to shine forth into the darkness of sin. . . . And in all their
              work they are to ascribe glory, honor, and praise to Him who is
              above all and over all."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 330.

The Glory of God
  "The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. . . . 0
come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our
maker" (Ps. 95:3-6).



   Any consideration of glory must begin with God. He is the source
of glory. Only God can cause glory to endure forever. The visible glory of
man passes, like that of the grass and the flowers of the field. Once we
have confessed to the greatness of God in character and in power, we
have only begun the first sentence of a paragraph that leaves us voiceless
in wonder and worship. We search for likenesses to God, but we find
none. As Isaiah asked of those turning to heathen worship, "To whom
then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?" (Isa.
40:18).
   Is it possible for a human being fully to know God? Jesus Himself said,
"This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,
and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3). Jesus had manifested
His Father to the world (see John 14:7, 9), and now He wanted His
people to continue to know God in His saving power as seen in Jesus
Himself
   We can experience God's kingship, His worship, and His love,
but we can neverfully know Him. Through our study of Scripture and by
our own experience we can catch glimpses of all aspects of His glory.
Best of all, we can know that God is love and that He loves us. That is
the heart of His glory. We shall try to explore that love—a patiently
pursuing force that refuses to surrender us to the enemy and to
perdition even when we have, by our folly, denied Him.
  This love beyond measure or explanation was shown to Israel of old.
They witnessed overwhelming displays of God's power. They were
given a school in which to learn His character. But they often chose
earthly above heavenly glory. They were not content with a Ruler
who could not be seen. They sought a visible king so as to be like the
surrounding nations. God bowed to their request. As long as these kings
recognized their need for dependence upon God, they even prospered.
But the rejection of people and kings seemed inevitable. Only by a grasp
of the Unseen can true prosperity thrive.
  Of all lessons that God would teach His people today, complete and
childlike faith in the unseen God is the most essential. By it we will see
God's glory, and that will give Him glory.

   Part 1  "I am the Lord your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King"
    GOD (Isa. 43:15).
THE KING
              God's rulership is properly thought of in connection with His
           creatorship and His holiness. (See also Ps. 95:3-5; Col. 1:16.) He
           sends out the gifts of His love. Where accepted unselfishly, they
           flow back to Him as a tide of glory. Kingship calls for a kingdom,
           and at its best a kingdom calls for citizens who are intelligent, free
           beings. God can rule par excellence; for, as Creator, He knows
           what is for the best good of all His creation.
              The Bible often refers to "the glory of the Lord." It will be our
           privilege to study those aspects of God's glory as revealed in God's
           rulership over His people.
              Israel, for example, had no human king at first. God ruled His
           people, revealing His will through His chosen agents. His people
           were to be different from the surrounding nations. Moses was
           indeed a great leader, but he was neither lord nor king. While he
           was in company with royalty in Egypt, he learned how to rule and
           how to make war, and when called to lead Israel, he even tried the
           use of force.
              Forty years in the wilderness school taught Moses that, though
           earthly kings may come and go, the great I AM rules forever.
           Moses chose to cast in his lot with the eternal kingdom.
              Israel, however, was not content with a glory that seemed far
           away. They wanted power, worldly power. After the days of
            Moses and Joshua, they chose the first judges as leaders. In doing
           so, they reduced the priestly office. But a judge is not a king, and
            soon the people became laws to themselves—"every man did that
            which was right in his own eyes" (Judges 6:17). When Eli's sons
            were priests, the glory of Israel, linked to the ark of God, departed.
            (See 1 Sam. 4:6-11, 21.) The people demanded a king, and God
            gave them Saul. With him came further rejection of Jehovah. After
            the strong rule of David and Solomon, there came another long
            period of fading glory. Satan, it seemed, had succeeded in bringing
            God's chosen people into conformity to the world. Satan claimed
            the world as his kingdom.

             Since God is the great King above all, what should be the response
           of His subjects? Ps. 145:5.

             God will yet have a people among all nations who will not make
           the error that Israel made. They will enthrone Jesus, God's Son, as
           King of their lives by submitting every act and every motive to
           the approval of their King.

   Part 2     Having saved Israel from Egypt and Assyria, what further assur-
THE ONLY    ance did God give to Israel of His plan to save them?
 SAVIOUR
              "I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour" (Isa.
            43:11).

               To be truly King over His people, ancient or modern, God must
            provide the best of all possible governments. At the heart of His
            plan for a chosen people to reflect the glory of His character is a
            "Saviour." All this was awaiting the outcome of the fateful Friday
            afternoon when Jesus hung on the cross, bearing in His own body
            the sins of the world. But when Jesus arose from the tomb, God's
            government of this world was made sure. (See John 20:11-17;
            1 Cor. 15:20-24.)

              What startling disclosure was made to Isaiah regarding the res-
            toration of Zion? What broader promise is included? Isa. 52:10.

              •At the beginning of Isaiah's ministry he received one of the most
            glorious vision: in the entire Bible account. He saw the great
            majesty of God and heard the words, "The whole earth is full of his
            glory" (Isa. 6:3). He did not join the seraphim in chanting "Holy,
            holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts." Isaiah, a sinful man, shrank from
            the great gap that lay between a righteous God and sinners. To
            Isaiah this seemed to forecast an eternal rift between God and
            man.
               Nothing is too hard for the Lord. (See Gen. 18:14; Jer. 32:17.)
            Even before a problem arises, God has provided the best possible
            answer. Isaiah was cleansed. God had made a way to bridge the
            awful gap of sin. As God "made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all
            the nations" in Israel's day, so He has in Christ. And "all the ends
            of the earth shall see the salvation of our God" (Isa. 52:10).
               The universe has before it the revelation of the measure of the
            greatness of God's character. The glory of His character of love,
            His holy rule, are upheld. In Jesus, kingship stoops to the place of
            service. Visible glory is hidden. But the glory of God's character is
            seen in His taking upon Himself the world's sin, making Himself
            the only Sin Bearer. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 758.)

              "Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of
            us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from
            the condemnation of the law. The guilt of every descendant of Adam
            was pressing upon His heart."—The Desire of Ages, p. 753.

      Part 3     What attribute of God's glory commands the worship of His
IE ETERNAL     creatures everywhere?
       GOD
                "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
               God, be honour and glory for ever and ever" (1 Tim. 1:17).

                  Glory or praise cannot properly be ascribed to any human being,
               except for the glory that God bestows upon him; for when glory
               becomes dust, it ceases to be. Yet God, in whom dwells immortal-
               ity, will be praised long after "the tumult and the shouting dies, the
               captains .and the kings depart."—Rudyard Kipling, "Reces-
               sional."
                  When God wanted to tell Moses about Himself, He appeared in
               a burning bush—burning, but never consumed. It was then that
               God revealed Himself as the great I AM, the eternal, self-
               sustaining God. God's glory is within Himself. (See Ex. 3:14.)
                  In 40 years of wilderness dwelling, Moses doubtless had plenty
               of time to learn lessons from many things, including the coura-
               geous yet struggling desert flowers. He began to understand better
               the purpose of his own life. He entered therefore into a relationship
               with God that assured him of a secure destiny. Nevertheless,
               Moses did die and was buried. (See Deut. 34:5, 6.) No tomb of
               Moses exists as a shrine. But Moses was seen in glory as a man (see
                Luke 9:30, 32) on the mount of Christ's transfiguration, in com-
                pany with the great I AM.

                 As they lost sight of the glory of the Eternal God, to what object,
               worshiped by the heathen, did ancient Israel sometimes ascribe
               praise? Eze. 8:16.

                 Even a winter's sun, reaching plants not in continual shadow,
               can stimulate added growth under most forbidding conditions. No
               wonder the sun has so long held the devotion of all mankind,
               including apostate Israelites. Because the sun, a remarkable burn-
               ing ball, and seemingly the source of all life, was always there, its
               worship often came to compete with the worship of God.

                 One is unwise to be satisfied with a brief, fading glory when "the
               gift of God is eternal life" (Rom. 6:23).

     Part 4        On what other basis may glory properly be ascribed to God?
     GOD'S
WORTHINESS      "Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and
              power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are
              and were created" (Rev. 4:11).

                 The word worship could well be thought of as "worthship" or
              "worthiness." Only those who submit to God and who find some-
              thing of the depth of His benevolence can know of His worthiness.
              It is proclaimed here on the basis of His creative power. Those
              who believe this, like the four and twenty elders of Revelation
              4:10, will one day "cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
              Thou art worthy, 0 Lord." (See verse 11.)
                 Today worldwide communication brings every man's suffering
              to our doors. People want to know whether God is lacking in
              power, in wisdom, in love, or in all three. Is God really worthy?
                 In answer, we should be asking ourselves, What is the root of all
              suffering? We should decide what we shall do with God's provi-
              sion for eradicating that root.
                 "He [God] has always chosen extremities, when there seemed
              no possible chance for deliverance from Satan's workings, for the
              manifestation of His power. Man's necessity is God's
              opportunity."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 714.

                Should faith in God's worthiness stem from the assurance of
              personal experience with God or from a sense of having no other
              place to go? (See Job 13:15.)

                When Job was in his greatest distress, personal contact with
              God seemed to have failed. Yet Job in his extremity could cling to
              his God by faith.
                Ih connection with the question, "Lord, to whom shall we go?"
              Peter made one of his greatest affirmations of faith. "Thou hast the
              words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that
              Christ, the Son of the living God" (John 6:68, 69).
                "Through good and bad report, through darkness, through all
              the antagonism of the agencies of Satan, the Sun of Righteousness
              calmly shines on, searching out evil, repressing sin, and reviving
              the spirit of the humble and contrite ones."—Testimonies to
              Ministers, p. 285.

                Our minds are not able to assess the immanent (indwelling) attri-
              butes of God, but we can glory in His great salvation. From His
              Word and our personal experience, we can pronounce Him worthy
              "to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
              honour, and glory, and blessing" (Rev. 5:12).

                                                                        April 15

     Part 5    What great revelation of His glory did God give to His servant,
BENEVOLENT    Moses?
       GOD
                "The Lord passed by before him [Moses], and proclaimed, The
              Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abun-
              dant in goodness and truth" (Ex. 34:6).

                Moses had prayed, "I beseech thee, shew me thy glory" (Ex.
              33:18). What did Moses expect to see? gold and precious stones?
              an overpowering light or array? the spectrum of the rainbow?
              Moses had already beheld the smoke, lightning, and an earth-
              quake. One can hardly blame him for wanting to know just
              what God's glory was. He may have been surprised to know that
              God's character (glory) is first of all goodness—love and mercy.
                The why of God's love will never be fully known. But we can
              know that God loved His people so much that He sent His Son to
              redeem them to Himself. And "God was in Christ, reconcil-
              ing the world unto himself' (2 Cor. 5:19).

                What is the leading thought in that best-loved text, John 3:16?

                John 3:16 has as its very first word, in the original language, that
              very meaningful "so." It is a small but mighty word. So much, so
              fervently, so dearly—to such a great extent did God love the world
              that He gave us Jesus, to be one with us, not for a day or for a year,
              but eternally, that we might be saved from sin and death.
                 Sometimes when a government investigates a person, agents are
              sent to shadow the suspect, wiretap his phone, or place micro-
              phones in his apartment. God, however, sent His Son into the
              world, not to trap or condemn it, but to save it while its people
              were still His enemies.
                 When residents of a certain Samaritan village failed to receive
              Jesus as a guest, He rebuked James and John for wanting to
              "command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them"
              (Luke 9:54). He said, "The Son of man is not come to destroy
              men's lives, but to save them" (verse 56). Jesus then went on to
              another village.

                How can I best convey to others the fact that God is good and that it
              pays to serve Him? 1 Cor. 10:31 to 11:1.

                "The strongest argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and
              lovable Christian."—The Ministry,of Healing, p. 470.

               In view of God's great Gift to us, how do we treat God's children
              who need what we can well afford to supply?

                                                                          April 16

     Part 6     What is one measurable evidence that God has given us of His
  ULTIMATE    wisdom?
IN WISDOM
                "He hath made the earth by his power, and he hath established the
              world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
              understanding" (Jer. 51:15).

                 Nature's evidence for God's glory is not always clear. Because
              of the cloud of sin over this world, the wisdom of God, even as it is
              displayed in nature, must be perceived by the eye of faith. Yet
              nature contains marvelous tokens of the infinite wisdom of the
              Creator—mysteries beyond the hand of chance and time.
                 Whether looking at nature or other evidence of God's wisdom,
              we are unable to sit in judgment upon God's wisdom. To do so
              would be to elevate our own borrowed ability above that of our
              Maker. Yet we can, in company with God, explore His house,
              entering daily, as it were, a new room in His palace. Every pushing
              back of the boundaries of science—whether through the explora-
              tion of the vast edges of space or the probing of the minut-
              est details of the microcosm—is a further revelation of the
              wisdom of God.
                 Isaiah advised Hezekiah, "Wisdom and knowledge shall be the
              stability of thy times" (Isa. 33:6). How stability is needed today! It
              has often been remarked that the lack of great human leadership is
              the outstanding phenomenon of our day.

                What gracious invitation does God extend to those who feel the
              need of guidance? James 1:5, 6.

                 All the wisdom of heaven could have been shared with Adam
              and Eve. Sabbath by Sabbath, God would tell them of His won-
              ders. But Satan could not abide such intimacy between God and
              man. He suggested to Eve that another great field of knowledge
              was out there waiting to be explored. Our first parents took the
              bait, and they brought death upon themselves and upon their
              children. The world is now being asked to explore a "new moral-
              ity." Satan's old trick is being tried out on us again.

                In terms of wisdom, by what means can the glory of God be
              restored to fallen man?

                "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Rom. 12:2).
              "Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
              and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exercise loving-
              kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth" (Jer. 9:24).

Glory in the Face
of Jesus
  "It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in
bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation
perfect through sufferings. For both he that sanctifieth and they
who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren" (Heb. 2:10, 11).

    Among the most baffling opposites in human thought are these:
that the divine has been best seen in the human; that strength can be best
manifested in weakness; that victory is best achieved through the
tender graces of faith and love; and that sinful human beings can be
accounted pure.
    In this lesson we shall briefly explore the blessings of the incarna-
tion of God in Jesus Christ—a doctrine that poses the greatest stumbling
block to many Jews and Muslims as well as to many so-called Chris-
tians.
    Why should it be thought strange that the great God who is "dwell-
ing in light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath
seen, nor can see" (1 Tim. 6:16) should somehow want to encamp near (see
John 1:14) the objects of His love? Would He not want to do this,
 particularly in view of an opposing, contesting power that seizes tyran-
 nical control over those loved ones and challenges the very purpose for
 which they were created? Would not God have the most effective,
 the most surprising way to bring His plans to fruition and to exhibit His
 treasures of grace and love, thus proving the enemy false?
    No parallel has been found in human experience that can explain the
 incarnation, although many Christians must be given some credit for
 having tried to find one. By its very nature, the life and death of
 Jesus must be a one-time-only demonstration. Indeed, no other will ever
 be needed.
     God has chosen to be our Father. Jesus has chosen to be our Elder
 Brother, who is "not ashamed to call [us] brethren" (Heb. 2:11). If
 Scripture had not recorded it, no person could ever believe it. Yet
 there it stands for all to see.
     What is our response? Complete acceptance, complete enthrone-
  ment of Jesus in our lives, complete submission to His will, voluntary
 cooperation in the writing of the final chapters in the great war between
  good and evil?
     May we in this week gain a clearer understanding of "the glory of God in
  the face of Jesus Christ"—the glory of self-sacrificing love—as we
  consider aspects of the incarnation. (See 2 Cor. 4:6.)
                                                                         27
             Glory in the Face of Jesus                                4 Sunday
                                                                          April 18

    Part 1        What is at the heart of God's plan to save man in Christ Jesus?
      THE
INCARNATE      "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
     LORD    he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
             might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil"
             (Heb. 2:14).

                Only God could originate such a plan, the stated purpose of
             which is to destroy the devil and to put an end to the great
             controversy between good and evil.
                God wants to have His children of earth and heaven a united
             family (see Eph. 3:15), yielding praise to Him. Christ, as the
             God-man, provides the link. The salvation of man, though central
             to the final goal, is not the final chapter. Sin and sinners, along with
             Satan, must be banished so that Eden can be restored. Then the
             universe will resound again with the praise and the obedience of
             those who will seek only the glory of God.


                  What kind of "flesh and blood" did Jesus assume? Heb. 2:16, 17.

                Though our Brother in the flesh, Christ gave no place to sin
             during His life on earth. He met all the guilt and power of human
             sin. The adversary is thus completely defeated by the sacrifice that
             has been made.
                "In Christ were united the divine and the human—the Creator
             and the creature. The nature of God, whose law had been trans-
             gressed, and the nature of Adam, the transgressor, meet in
             Jesus—the Son of God and the Son of man. . . . What an assurance
             to the witnessing universe, that Christ will be 'a merciful and
             faithful high priest' !"—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
             Commentary, vol. 7, p. 926.
                Although Jesus was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
             sinners" (Heb. 7:26), He endured real suffering under temptation
             such as we will never have to experience. And He gained the
             victory as one of us. (See Heb. 5:7.)
                Although Jesus knew strong feelings and emotions, these were
             always subjected to the Father's will. Never once did He nurse the
             urge to sin, though such urges must have strongly pressed upon
             His consciousness. "Not even by a thought could Christ be
             brought to yield to the power of temptation."—Ellen G. White,
             Review and Herald, Nov. 8, 1887.

                  Compare the temptations of Jesus with your own. (See Heb. 4:15.)

     Part 2      What is the meaning to us of the name by which we are instructed
OUR ELDER     to address God?
 BROTHER
                "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
              heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (Matt. 6:9).

                "Such a conception of God [as Father] was never given to the
              world by any religion but that of the Bible. Heathenism teaches
              men to look upon the Supreme Being as an object of fear rather
              than of love—a malign deity to be appeased by sacrifices, rather
              than a Father pouring upon His children the gift of His love."—
              Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 74.
                It is by virtue of His incarnation that Christ can declare Himself
              our Elder Brother. By divine adoption we join the family of
              heaven. (See Eph. 1:3-7.)
                Christ knows by experience the problems and tests that we face
              every day. He is our Brother, but He also understands and loves
              better than any earthly father can. (See Ps. 103:13.)

                What is there about God that draws us most powerfully to Him?
              1 John 4:16.

                That which drew even little children to Jesus when He walked
              this earth is the same power that draws all human hearts to God
              today—especially the lonely, the discouraged, the sick, the poor,
              the widows and orphans.

                What would be Jesus' feeling toward those who are related to Him
              in name and those who are related in deed? Matt. 12:47-50.

                 "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
              the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
              which is in heaven" (Matt. 7:21).
                 We need constantly to remind ourselves that our acceptance
              with God is not based on our obedience to His will. When Jesus
              became our Elder Brother, He brought the weight of His creative
              power to bear on our sin problem. He laid aside His divine powers
              in His contest with evil. But it was because He was our Creator
              that His death and life are effectual to the redeeming of all who will
              believe. (See Rom. 5:2, 6-8, 12, 18.)
                 The outshining of God's glory in the face of Jesus was the glory
              of God's character of love. When by faith we join His family, we,
               by His Spirit, begin to reflect His image more and more com-
               pletely.

                 "Adam . . . was the son of God" (Luke 3:38), but some children of
               Adam, by their choice, have made Satan their father. (See John
               8:44.)

                                                                                 29
           Glory in the Face of Jesus                             4 Tuesday
                                                                      April 20

  Part 3      In revealing God to man, what astounding claim did Jesus express
 JESUS,    to Martha?
THE LIFE
              "Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
           resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrec-
           tion, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet
           shall he live" (John 11:24, 25).

              In our text is one of Jesus' most notable uses of the words I AM.
           "I AM means an eternal presence; the past, present, and future are
           alike to God."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-
           mentary, vol. 1, p. 1099.
              Jesus answered Martha's question by both word and deed,
           assuring her and us that He is Master of the most feared reality of
           humanity—death.
            Perhaps the miracle that Satan most feared was the resurrection
           of the dead. Jude 9 tells us about the dispute between Michael and
           Satan over the body of Moses, a dispute in which Satan had to
           retreat in defeat. And now, at the tomb from which Jesus has
           released Lazarus, Satan, infuriated, takes up the battle anew. He
           is now more than ever determined that Christ shall die. "Then
           from that day forth they [the chief priests and the Pharisees] took
           counsel together for to put him to death" (John 11:53).

             How did Christ's own people interpret His I AM declarations?
           (See John 8:51-59 compared with 10:33.)

              If Jesus had said "I was" or "I used to be," His hearers would
           have felt insulted enough, for Abraham was to them so high that
           they "almost . . . honored him above God."—S.D.A. Bible Dic-
           tionary, p. 11. But for Jesus to apply to Himself the words I AM
           was to make Himself equal to Jehovah—a name they considered
           too exalted to pronounce. Such an act was considered worthy of
           death.

              What do we understand by the "conflict" stated in the latter part
           of Hebrews 2:14: "That through death he might destroy him that
           had the power of death, that is, the devil"?

             "When Christ was crucified, it was His human nature that died.
           Deity did not sink and die; that would have been impossible. . . .
             "This is a great mystery, a mystery that will not be fully,
           completely understood in all its greatness until the translation of
           the redeemed shall take place. Then all the power and greatness
           and efficacy of the gift of God to man will be understood."—Ellen
           G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1113.

              Glory in the Face of Jesus                            4 Wednesday
                                                                        April 21

     Part 4     What is the meaning to us and the whole world of a particular
IN COMMON     event in which Christ literally took the place of a servant?
     PATHS
                "He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
              towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason,
              and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel
              wherewith he was girded" (John 13:4, 5).

                In the culture in which Jesus lived, anyone who would wash feet
              was on the lowest rung of the social ladder. This task was devoid of
              glory, but Jesus glorified the common duties, attaching to the
              everyday chores of life an aura that only eternity can explain.
              "Judas was now offended at Christ's act in washing the feet of His
              disciples. If Jesus could so humble Himself, he thought, He could
              not be Israel's king. All hope of worldly honor in a temporal
              kingdom was destroyed. Judas was satisfied that there was nothing
              to be gained by following Christ. After seeing Him degrade Him-
              self, as he thought, he was confirmed in his purpose to disown
              Him, and confess himself deceived."—The Desire of Ages, p. 645.

                 What is the call then of Christ to His followers? John 13:13-17.

                  "All are called to do service for Him, and for the manner in
              which they have met this claim, all will be required to render an
              account at the great judgment day. . . ."
                  " . . By living to minister to others, man is brought into con-
               nection with Christ. The law of service becomes the connecting
               link which binds us to God and to our fellow men."—Christ's Ob-
              ject Lessons, p. 326.

                When the great and the learned were offended by Christ's con-
              duct, how did the majority react? Mark 12:37, last part.

                  As with the people in Christ's day, the majority of early Advent-
               ists were comparatively poor people. But it has been observed that
               Christianity makes people good stewards, good stewardship pro-
               duces efficient management, efficient management produces
               wealth, and wealth leads to a lack of emphasis on spiritual matters,
               or even to apostasy. Thus is created a vicious chain. A grave
                danger therefore faces Adventist membership in the industrialized
                world from the level of prosperity many enjoy.

                 "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
               noble, are called: . . . that no flesh should glory in his presence. . . .
               He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord" (1 Cor. 1:26-31).

            Glory in the Face of Jesus                            4 Thursday
                                                                       April 22

   Part 5        What is the most profound aspect of Jesus' mission to earth?
 HE BORE
OUR SINS      "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that
            we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose
            stripes ye were healed" (1 Peter 2:24).

               He was called Jesus, "for he shall save his people from their
            sins" (Matt. 1:21). It was "for sin," or concerning sin, that God
            sent Jesus "in the likeness of sinful flesh" (Rom. 8:3).
               In the Jewish services the priest took upon himself, in the
            symbols of the service, the sins of the people. But because he
            himself was a sinner, he could not give his life for the people.
            Therefore, the sins of the people having been transferred to it, a
            lamb "without blemish" was offered. This lamb pointed forward
            to Jesus, who shared our humanity and yet, because of His perfec-
            tion, could be God's Lamb. "John seeth Jesus coming unto him,
            and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
            the world" (John 1:29).

              Did Christ suffer only for the sins of the elect or also of the
            unrepentant? John 3:16-19; 4:42; Rom. 5:8; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20.

               "The guilt of every descendant of Adam was pressing upon His
            [Christ's] heart. The wrath of God against sin, the terrible manifes-
            tation of His displeasure because of iniquity, filled the soul of His
            Son with consternation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 753.

              What hope cheered Christ on in the midst of His sufferings? John
            17:5-8.

              "It was the joy of Christ in His humiliation and pain that His
            disciples should be glorified with Him. They are the fruit of His
            self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His own character and
            spirit is His reward, and will be His joy throughout eternity. This
            joy they share with Him as the fruit of their labor and sacrifice is
            seen in other hearts and lives. They are workers together with
            Christ, and the Father will honor them as He honors His Son."—
            The Desire of Ages, p. 624.
              When Jesus said, "Learn of me" (Matt. 11:29), He referred to
            more than the study of the Bible. We are to learn from Christ's life
            of service and, by bearing one another's burdens, "fulfil the law of
            Christ" (Gal. 6:2). Thus we will find joy in service.

              "The glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-
            sacrificing love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 20.

                                                                           April 23

      Part 6     What message did Jesus bid Mary tell?
E ASCENDED
                 "Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
               my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto
               my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (John
               20:17).

                  Why, in a lesson on the incarnation, should we include the
               thought of Christ's ascension? How could Christ be "with us" and
               yet go away?
                  The ascension of Jesus brought the testimony of Heaven that
               His sacrifice for sin was both completed and accepted. For the
               disciples, it climaxed the growing assurance as to who Jesus really
               was and what He had accomplished on earth. Now He was to be
               "with them" more intimately and constantly than ever, by the
               indwelling, promised Holy Spirit. Pentecost served as a signal to
               the band of believers on earth that their Lord was not at the
               Father's right hand. As Peter told the great crowds at Pentecost,
               "This Jesus hath God raised up; . . . and having received of the
                Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this,
               which ye now see and hear" (Acts 2:32, 33).
                   When Jesus ascended, He did not cease to be our Brother. In the
               text for today, notice the emphasis that Jesus placed upon God as
               our common Father. Neither did Jesus surrender His humanity
                when He ascended. Rather, He glorified humanity and made it
                possible for His presence to be felt by Christians at all times and in
                all parts of the world. "Christ in you" is still "the hope of glory"
                (Col. 1:27).

                What phase of Jesus' ministry opened after His ascension? (See
               Rom. 8:34.)

                 When Stephen, about to die, looked up at the opening heavens
               "and saw the glory of God" (Acts 7:55), he also saw "the Son of
               man standing on the right hand of God" (verse 56).
                 Since His ascension, our Lord has been seated (in the sense of
               enthroned) and standing at God's right hand (in the sense of
               position or authority) in His ministry as Intercessor. As the great
               High Priest of the more perfect tabernacle, He has been carrying
               out His roles represented by the daily and yearly ministries of the
               earthly tabernacle. He has been applying the benefits of His once-
               for-all sacrifice to penitent sinners.

The Glory of Man
 "Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for
my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him" (Isa. 43:7).



   In Isaiah's words to Israel is a truth for all mankind. It matters
greatly what we believe about God's purpose in creating us. In fact, this
belief is closely wrapped up with its companion thought—what we
believe about God.
   Those who view God as a super magician might emphasize the creative
act itself—like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Or some scientists might
see man's development as a laboratory experiment. In some minds God
might have wound up the human machine and then left it to run down.
   Did God create me in order to save me, or did He have an even wider
purpose? It is doubtful we can understand the whole truth on this, but we
can discover some ideas in regard to our role in God's great plan.
Seven short words tell us much: "I have created him for my glory." This
simple yet profound statement comprehends power, purpose, love,
promise, the dignity of man, and ultimate success.
   Stirring political speeches sound out in one country and then another.
The big question is, Can words of promise become fulfillment? The
Hebrew language uses one word, dabar, to denote "word" and the "act"
that fulfills that word. In much of our experience words die as words.
Not so with God, who "spake, and it was done"; who "commanded,
and it stood fast" (Ps. 33:9).
   God will also accomplish His word in our lives. His promises are
sure. True to His unchangeableness, God is steadfast in purpose; He
creates and He upholds. God chooses to work out His salvation plan
through human beings, although He could have chosen angels to preach
the gospel.
   Indeed the enemy must be baffled to discover that strength can
come out of seeming weakness. A defeat does not necessarily deny final
victory. Jesus set the example of self-sacrificing love when He chose to
pitch His tent beside the poor and the outcast. His followers too will
catch the spirit of ministry, showing to the inhabitants of the unseen
worlds the glory of God—the abiding principles of God's nature and
kingdom.

              The Glory of Man                                           5 Sunday
                                                                             April 25

                "Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
     Part 1 Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the
  MARKED     praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in
FOR GLORY the beloved" (Eph. 1:5, 6).

                Several important facts emerge from an analysis of our text for
              today: (1) God is sovereign; He works according to the good
              pleasure of His will. (2) God wants to adopt His children into full
              sonship, through the merits of Jesus' full sonship. (3) His merciful
              provision is "to the praise of the glory of his grace" (verse 6). (4)
              God is able, by His grace, to justify (count and treat as righteous)
              His erring children.
                In this brief lesson we will be able only to touch on the showing
              forth of God's glory before the inhabitants of the universe.

                What larger plan than the salvation of men does God have in
              redemption? 1 Cor. 4:9; Heb. 12:22, 23; Col. 1:20.

                 "The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper scope
              than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came
              to earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world
              might regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to
              vindicate the character of God before the universe. To this result
              of His great sacrifice—its influence upon the intelligences of other
              worlds, as well as upon man—the Saviour looked forward when
              just before His crucifixion He said: 'Now is the judgment of this
              world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be
              lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.' John 12:31,
              32."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 68, 69.

                  Although God's ultimate purpose does not end with the salvation
               of man, what is its central focus?

                  Those who see themselves as the nucleus of the prophesied
               "remnant" people of God will be foremost in exalting the cross. At
               that cross the means was provided for restoring sinners to joyful
               harmony with God's law of love—the Ten Commandments.
                  "In the cross all influence centers, and from it all influence goes
               forth. It is the great center of attraction, for on it Christ gave up His
               life for the human race. This sacrifice was offered for the purpose
               of restoring man to his original perfection; yea, more. It was
               offered to give him an entire transformation of character, making
               him more than a conqueror. Those who in the strength of Christ
               overcome the great enemy of God and man, will occupy a position
               in the heavenly courts above the angels who have never

                                                                            April 26

      Part 2     What bearing did the call of Israel have on the glory of God?
 A LIGHT TO
THE NATIONS       "Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
               nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the Lord
               thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee"
               (Isa. 55:5).

                  The universal acknowledgment of the justice of God's dealings
               begins when a human being glorifies God in his or her own daily
               living. God had in mind that Israel should do this for the Gentiles.
               "So far as it was of divine institution, the entire system of Judaism
               was a compacted prophecy of the gospel."—The Desire of Ages,
               p. 211. Likewise, if God is ever to be glorified in the remnant
               church of the last days, it will be because the persons in that church
               reflect the love of God and the power of the cross in every aspect of
               their lives.
                  Christ is the promised Seed of David, and "if ye be Christ's,
               then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the prom-
               ise" (Gal. 3:29). If we are ever tempted to long for the great
               privileges that were Israel's, we should pause to think of the
               greater privileges that are ours.

                 The promises too are ours. Read the following passage, substitut-
               ing for the word "glory" the words "character" and "approval":
               "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen
               upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
               darkness the people; but the glory of the Lord shall arise upon thee,
               and his glory shall be seen upon thee" (Isa. 60:1, 2).

                 Do my motives, my decisions, my way of life, my allocation of
               time, and my use of resources reflect the image of Christ? Do they
               reveal that, through Christ's merits, I am a child of God? Only
               when, by the grace of Christ and the power of His blood, such
               evidences of the Spirit's indwelling are seen can it be said that "the
               glory of the Lord is risen upon thee."

                  What does the restoration of the Sabbath to its rightful place have
               to do with God's glory?

                 Read Isaiah 56:1-8 and discover what goals God had for Sabbath
               keeping. Some apply the word "Jewish" to the Sabbath, but never
               once is it so described in Scripture. "Jewish" is once applied to
               "fables" but never to the Sabbath or to God's law. (See Titus
               1:14.) The Sabbath, which God calls "my holy day" (Isa. 58:13), is
               for all men of all races and nationalities.

       Part 3 What was the purpose of God's creation of this earth?
THE PURPOSE
 ESTABLISHED       "This is what the Lord says—
                     he who created the heavens,
                       he is God;
                     he who fashioned and made the earth,
                       he founded it;
                     he did not create it to be empty,
                       but formed it to be inhabited—
                     he says:
                       `I am the Lord,
                       and there is no other' " (Isa. 45:18, NIV).

                 God did not create the earth only to forsake it to its own ways.
              His will concerning it is now being established. God's purpose has
              to do with His people (see Isa. 43:7). The earth, and all it contains,
              is a vehicle as it were—a means to an end or goal.
                 God might have stopped with the creation of a lovely world, as
              seen in Eden. Animals, not people, might have wandered about in
              a harmless and safe atmosphere. Sin could never have entered
              then, for animals can neither sin, nor can they be sorry (in a moral
              sense) for any misdeed. That mysterious and convenient word
              "instinct" could have ruled every action, and there could never
              have been a fall.

                What ingredient would have been lacking in Eden had not human
              beings been created? Gen. 1:26-28.

                 Eden could still have been admired. "The hills, mountains, and
              very beautiful plains were adorned with plants and flowers and
              tall, majestic trees of every description, which were many times
              larger and much more beautiful than trees now are. The air was
              pure and healthful, and the earth seemed like a noble palace.
              Angels beheld and rejoiced at the wonderful and beautiful works of
              God."—The Story of Redemption, p. 20.
                 Without the human family, however, this world would have
              been incomplete. No one reflecting the noble character of God
              would have been there.
                 "While everything in nature is governed by natural laws, man
              alone, of all that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law. To
              man, the crowning work of creation, God has given power to
              understand His requirements, to comprehend the justice and be-
              neficence of His law, and its sacred claims upon him; and of man
              unswerving obedience is required."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
              52.

       Part 4     What words spoken of Israel indicate God's purpose for all His
SHOW FORTH      children?
SOD'S PRAISE
                  "This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
                praise"(Isa. 43:21).

                   Throughout the Bible, God's purpose for His people is not only
                stated—it is explained, and then cooperation is solicited. We are
                "called according to his purpose" (Rom. 8:28). That purpose is
                that in our brief walk upon earth we may, by the grace of Christ,
                live in joyous obedience to God's will and show forth His praise.
                   Paul goes on to show that God's calling is based upon His
                foreknowledge. "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predesti-
                nate to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Rom. 8:29).
                   To some minds, God's foreknowledge means the end of human
                freedom; it means that a person's actions are all fixed, perhaps in
                the genes, and that life unfolds independently of one's free will.
                Such a belief completely denies God's purpose as stated in our text
                for today. We can show forth no praise if we are "programmed."
                Some people would be God's elect, while others, by making con-
                trary "choices" or by neglect of the right choice, would find
                themselves in another camp. A belief in predestination would
                make God responsible for the choices that would decide individual
                human destinies.

                  What is the level of our dependence upon Christ if our lives are to
                bring glory to God? Acts 4:12; Rom. 5:17.

                  In the church of the Middle Ages it was noticed that some people
                seemed unable to "bring forth . . . fruits worthy of repentance"
                (Luke 3:8). To overcome this, a system called supererogation was
                invented whereby the excess of good works on someone's part
                could be credited to someone else to shore up his bad record.

                   Can a just God rightfully transfer from one human life (that of
                Christ) to another (that of man) the good record needed for salva-
                tion?

                  God forgives the sins that Jesus bore for us and for which He
                pleads His blood. He beholds the victory wrought by Jesus which
                we have claimed. This victory does not stand merely as a ledger
                entry or a judicial verdict. After Christ's victory on Calvary came
                the glorious resurrection. And "like as Christ was raised up from
                the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
                newness of life" (Rom. 6:4).

      Part 5     According to His gracious word to Israel, on what basis are God's
 AN HONOR-     people honored?
ABLE PEOPLE
                 "Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
               and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people
               for thy life" (Isa. 43:4).

                  It was God's purpose that Israel, as a nation, should bring honor
               to His name (Isa. 43:7, 21). The same is true with His people today.
               The human search for honor is ceaseless and often concerns
               wealth and position. These factors can be used to honorable ends,
               but elevation for any other cause than worthiness is a sham and a
               fraud. In our times masks of prominent leaders in many nations are
               being snatched away, revealing, in some cases, a condition of
               misplaced trust.
                  Unless the love of God can be detected in a Christian's daily
               dealings, there is really no basis for honor. Even if they can neither
               define nor explain it, the people of the world should sense that
               something is special about those who bear Christ's name.

                 Does God arbitrarily honor some and degrade others? Acts 10:34,
               35.

                 Very few people in this world know what it is to get a fair deal.
               Many children are spurned by their "busy" parents. And parents
               often get little honor from their ambitious children. Employees are
               often unappreciated, and many executives who look forward to
               success are struck down while on the verge of honor. We are
               assured that in God's plan honor will not be misplaced or be
               lacking.

                 How do motives weigh with God? (See 1 Sam. 16:7.)

                 "The approval of the Master is not given because of the great-
               ness of the work performed, because many things have been
               gained, but because of the fidelity in even a few things. It is not the
               great results we attain, but the motives from which we act, that
               weigh with God. He prizes goodness and faithfulness more than
               the greatness of the work accomplished."—Testimonies, vol. 2,
               pp. 510, 511.
                 God does not give us His grace on the basis of our merit. Our
               obedience is also by His grace: "Christ in you, the hope of glory"
               (Col. 1:27).

                 What effect can good works have on non-Christians? 1 Peter 2:12.

      Part 6      What place does resurrection power have in enabling man to seek
     "WALK      the glory of God?
IN NEWNESS
    OF LIFE"       "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
                like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
                even so we also should walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:4). (Read
                also verses 1-11 for the setting.)

                  Right in the heart of our lessons for this quarter lies one of the
                great "glory of God" passages of Scripture. The apostle Paul has
                contributed scores of references to the glory of God. So we are not
                dealing with a minor biblical idea in our present studies. The glory
                of God was supreme in all of Paul's thinking and living.
                  If we read the surrounding texts—the context—and note other
                key passages from Paul, "the glory of God" refers to His excel-
                lence, His power, the perfection of His character. It is God's
                power as shown in the resurrection of Christ that is brought for-
                ward. (See Rom. 1:4; 1 Cor. 6:14; 2 Cor. 13:4; Eph. 1:19, 20.)

                 What other resurrection event was a revelation of the "glory of
                God"? John 11:40.

                  The power by which Jesus rose from the dead was the power by
                which He raised others and will finally raise the righteous dead.
                (See 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.) In the meantime, there is a life to be lived
                now—the "walk in newness of life."

                  What is the relationship of "the walk in newness of life" to a
                baptized believer's daily living?

                 "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
               above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your
               affection on things above, not on things on the earth" (Col. 3:1, 2).
               Following this advice, we will be fulfilling Jesus' prayer for us,
               "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" (John 17:17).
                 "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit we are
               buried in the likeness of Christ's death and raised in the likeness of
               His resurrection, and we are to live a new life. Our life is to be
               bound up with the life of Christ. Henceforth the believer is to bear
               in mind that he is dedicated to God, to Christ, and to the Holy
               Spirit. He is to make all worldly considerations secondary to this
               new relation. Publicly he has declared that he will no longer live in
               pride and self-indulgence. He is no longer to live a careless, indif-
               ferent life."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 98, 99.

Restorin Lost
Glory
  "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priest-
hood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ"
(1 Peter 2:5).



   Before the enlightened minds and eyes of earth, God's plan for the
world and for His people is daily unfolding. To create a world, God used
His word: "He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
fast" (Ps. 33:9). But Creation was only the beginning of the project. The
special people to inhabit the world made new are also established by
God. Like a building, the Bible says they are being erected, stone by
stone, upon Christ, the Chief Cornerstone. Every stone is precious and will
shine forth as can no other in that day when the completed structure will
be on display.
   Not because of the great things God's people have done are they
valuable to Him. It is rather because of the great work Christ has
done for them. Believers, in turn, permit God to work in them. Nothing has
been left unprovided for. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath com-
mitted unto us the word of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:19).
   In drawing them to Himself, God now points to them as His
friends. He wants them to show themselves the friends of others as part of
the "spiritual sacrifices" he calls them to offer. Small and insignificant
though they may feel themselves to be in the world, they are very much
a part of God's plan. Each Christian is a "chosen vessel" to carry the
truth to others and to bring the light of life to its full and final display.
   Gentleness and tenderness, far from being negative attributes, are the
very spirit of God's kingdom. To "rejoice with them that do rejoice, and
weep with them that weep" (Rom. 12:15) is not a sign of weakness.
   The worldling may judge that the world owes him something, but the
one who has tasted of the Spirit of Christ will, like Paul, consider

       Part 1      "0 Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who
 LORY ABOVE      hast set thy glory above the heavens" (Ps. 8:1).
'HE HEAVENS
                    These opening lines of the first of the group of nature psalms are
                 repeated at its close. (See Psalms 19, 29, 104, etc.) This envelope
                 device suggests the literary beauty of this gem.
                    God's glory—whether as power, character, or majesty—is
                 presented as "above the heavens." The amazing thing, therefore,
                 is that God has drawn man into sovereignty with Himself over the
                 rest of creation (see verses 6-8). Although God's created works are
                 so vast and intricate that a man may feel small, he is crowned with
                 glory and honor (see verse 5). God's glory has never been tar-
                 nished or diminished, but redeemed man can have a part in dem-
                 onstrating that fact to the universe.

                   If God possesses so much glory (above the heavens), why introduce
                 the passages about "babes and sucklings" (verse 2)?

                    God's "strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9), and
                 He "hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
                 wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to con-
                 found the things which are mighty" (1 Cor. 1:27).
                    Man, when he was created, was pronounced "good," but man
                 sold out his dominion to the enemy. To all appearances the war is
                 lost—except for a Babe in Bethlehem, eleven vacillating disciples,
                 and a host of weak people who through the ages have used their
                 free will to invite Jesus into their hearts and lives. The glory that is
                 "above the heavens" will be augmented by honor and praise from
                 the lips of "babes."
                    Regard Psalm 8 as a promise. In both the first and the last verses
                 is an assurance that we are valuable to God in hastening that day
                 when "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of
                 the Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (Hab. 2:14).

                   "I see nothing wherein man should be praised or glorified. I see no
                 reason why the opinions of worldly-wise men and so-called great men
                 should be trusted in and exalted.
                   ". . . Let us choose to be taught by Him who created the heavens
                 and the earth."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 449.

     Part 2     What kind of people will inhabit God's glorious kingdom?
THE GENTLE
    PEOPLE      "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth" (Matt.
              5:5).

                "The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in
              the abundance of peace" (Ps. 37:11).

                 People are often heard to remark that the meek are not in charge
              of the world today. It might also be true that not all meek people
              are found in churches and that not all who go to church are meek.
              Yet the meek, the gentle, the humble, the courteous, and the
              considerate are the kind of people who are needed today.
                 "The value of our work does not consist in making a loud noise
              in the world, in being zealous, eager, and active in our own
              strength. . . . We should continually pray to God to increase our
              strength to make us strong in His strength, to kindle in our hearts
              the flame of divine love. The cause of God is best advanced by
              those who are meek and lowly in heart."—Evangelism, p. 631.

               Can meekness characterize a person in all aspects of life, even
              when being mistreated? Rom. 12:17-19.

                "A meek and quiet spirit must be cherished. Carry Christ's
              meekness with you in all your labors. . . . If we have the truth, we
              can afford to be calm and unexcited. Our language should be
              modest and elevated. . . . As the cloud of witnesses look upon a
              man reflecting the image of Christ, they will realize that he is
              surrounded by a pleasant atmosphere. The world will see that amid
              the storms of abuse he stands unmoved, like the lofty cedar. That
              man is one of God's heroes. He has overcome himself."—
              Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 348.

                In the witness of Daniel in the Babylonian capital, how did meek-
              ness combine with wisdom? (See Dan. 5:13-17.)

                 "Daniel possessed the grace of genuine meekness. He was true,
              firm, and noble. He sought to live at peace with all, while he was
              unbending as the lofty cedar wherever principle was involved. In
              everything that did not come in collision with his allegience to
              God, he was respectful and obedient to those who had authority
              over him; but he had so high a sense of the claims of God that the
              requirements of earthly rulers were held subordinate. He would
              not be induced by any selfish consideration to swerve from his
              duty."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 78, 79.

    Part 3 As represented in the experience of Joshua, the high priest, how
   WHITE did Satan try to defeat God's restoration plan?
GARMENTS
               "He shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of
            the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the
            Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, 0 Satan; even the Lord
            that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked
            out of the fire: Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and
            stood before the angel. And he answered and spake unto those that
            stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.
            And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass
            from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. And I said,
            Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon
            his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord
            stood by" (Zech. 3:1-5).

              Joshua the high priest stands as the representative of God's
            faithful people. The angel represents Christ, whom Satan opposes.
            As prince of this world (see John 14:30), Satan claims every in-
            habitant as his own subject. He points to the filthy garments of the
            high priest as proof that God's commandments cannot be obeyed.
            But Jesus, in His humanity, did obey them. He can rightfully im-
            pute that character to those whom He chooses and who choose
            Him as Lord. As for the works of Joshua himself, they proved
            to be nonmeritorious—what mattered was the righteousness of
            Christ. And Christ is waiting to bestow on His submissive chil-
            dren that which they seek but can never possibly earn.
                 How do I see myself in the experience of Joshua?

              "A Change of Raiment.— . . . 'And he answered [the accusing
           charge of Satan] and spake unto those [angels] that stood before
            him [to do His bidding], saying, Take away the filthy garments
           from him.' I will blot out his transgressions. I will cover his sins. I
           will impute to him My righteousness. . . .
              "The filthy garments are removed; for Christ says, 'I have
           caused thine iniquity to pass from thee.' The iniquity is transferred
            to the innocent, the pure, the holy Son of God; and man, all
            undeserving, stands before the Lord cleansed from all unrigh-
           teousness, and clothed with the imputed righteousness of
           Christ...."
              "And Christ does more than this for them: [Zech. 3:5 quoted].
              "This is the honor that. God will bestow on those who are
           clothed with the garments of Christ's righteousness. With such
           encouragement as this, how can men continue in sin? How can
           they grieve the heart of Christ?"—Ellen G. White Comments,

  Part 4  How can we all be used in God's plan of reconciling alienated
 MAKING people?
FRIENDS
FOR GOD   "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
          of God" (Matt. 5:9).

            Reconcilers are God's most effective agents. People will take
          knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus. As children of
          God, they will represent the principles of the heavenly household.

            To what lengths did Paul go in order to spread the gospel?
          1 Cor. 9:19-22.

            Did Paul have to deny Christ in order to establish rapport with
          his own people? No, he tactfully introduced Christ, also a Jew, as
          the expected Messiah. He showed that the ancient prophets spoke
          of the Seed of David yet to come. He sought a bridge to friendship.
            "You should get rid of your cold, frozen formality as soon as
          possible. You need to cultivate feelings of tenderness and friendli-
          ness in your everyday life. You should exhibit true courtesy and
          Christian politeness. The heart that really loves Jesus loves those
          for whom He died."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 466.

             How can the theme of friendship harmonize with James 4:4:
           "Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?
           whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of
           God?"

             James is here speaking of a yearning for worldly pleasures that
           are not in harmony with the spirit of Christ's kingdom. He echoes
           the words of Jesus, "No man can serve two masters" (Matt. 6:24).
           One can be friendly with non-Christians without espousing their
           worldly principles.

             Jesus said, "A new commandment I give unto'you, That ye love
           one another; as I have loved you" (John 13:34). In what respect was
           this commandment new?

             "To love as Christ loved means to manifest unselfishness at all
           times and in all places. . . .
             "Christ's love is deep and earnest, flowing like an irrepress-
           ible stream to all who will accept it. There is no selfishness in His
           love. If this heaven-born love is an abiding principle in the heart, it
           will make itself known . . . to all with whom we come in
           contact."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 101.

      Part 5      "From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able
THE ROLE OF    to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
GOD'S WORD     Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
               for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righ-
               teousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
               unto all good works" (2 Tim. 3:15-17).

                 The Bible is the only book in the world that really faces up to
               man's true condition and directs us to the remedy for sin. Restor-
               ing the glory (character) of God in sinful man is the burden of the
               Written Word of God.
                 Many passages of the Bible may well be memorized and re-
               peated, but knowledge in words can never approximate knowl-
               edge of the Word made flesh. Here is essential knowledge. The
               forgiveness of sin is a personal meeting with Christ our Substitute
               and Surety. By a faith stronger than sight we follow our High Priest
               into the heavenly sanctuary. "It is those who by faith follow
               Jesus in the great work of atonement who receive the benefits.
               of His mediation in their behalf, while those who reject the light
               which brings to view this ministration are not benefited thereby."
               —The Great Controversy, p. 430.
                  To what degree is a book as ancient as the Bible relevant to modern
               life? (Compare Dan. 12:4, 8, 13 with Rev. 22:10, 18, 19.)

                 "The truths thus revealed [through the various writers of Scrip-
               ture] unite to form a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of
               men in all circumstances and experiences of life."—Selected Mes-
               sages, bk. 1, p. 26.

                 Have all the truths of the Bible been discovered? (Compare
               1 Peter 1:10-13 with 2 Peter 1:19.)

                 Those who seek to discover truths for themselves, rather than to
               receive them packaged on Sabbath, will find in the Bible an in-
               exhaustible mine.
                 "There are veins of truth yet to be discovered, but spiritual
               things are spiritually discerned."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 437.
                 The supreme goal of Bible study is to have the mind and heart
               open to God. It is His Word. It is as truly His personal message to
               each of us as though we could hear His voice.

                 "It is Satan's studied plan so to absorb and engage the mind that
               God's great Guidebook shall not be regarded as the Book of books
               and that the sinner shall not be led from the path of transgression
               into the path of obedience."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 442.

    Part 6     What words concerning ancient Babylon give promise of the final
  MANKIND    restoration of God's rule over the earth?
RECLAIMED
               "The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the
             Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (Hab. 2:14).

               We have long used these words (and parallel phrases in Isaiah
             11:9 and Numbers 14:20, 21) to paint a picture. (We have even
             made them a declaration of faith in some traditional hymns about
             the future.) We see in them the final triumph of righteousness in the
             whole earth. Actually the words dealt with ancient Babylon, but
             could have a broader fulfillment at the end of time.
                When we speak of the reclaiming of mankind, we are talking
             about the ultimate result of the plan of redemption. Sin and sinners
             will have brought destruction on themselves, and only the re-
             deemed remain. (See Rev. 20:7-9.)

              What effect will the bowing of every knee have upon the glory of
             God? Phil. 2:9-11. (Read also verses 5-8.)

               There is a sense in which God's glory is fixed and absolute. God
             differs from man because He does not change. But such is the love
             of God that the destiny of every soul will be to God's ultimate
             glory (in terms of vindication of His character and government.
               What value does God place upon a human soul? Eze. 18:4; Isa.
             53:11.

               "The Saviour longs to manifest His grace and stamp His charac-
             ter on the whole world. It is His purchased possession, and He
             desires to make men free, and pure, and holy. Though Satan
             worked to hinder this purpose, yet through the blood shed for the
             world there are triumphs to be achieved that will bring glory to God
             and the Lamb. . . . All the nations of the earth shall hear the gospel
             of His grace. Not all will receive His grace; but 'a seed shall serve
             Him; and it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation." ' '—

corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as
uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under
my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I
have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway" (1 Cor.
9:24-27).



   In Paul's day athletic contests had a regular place in Corinthian
life, and Paul used them for effective illustration. He knew that the imped-
ing garments permitted in training must be laid aside for the race itself
and that the body, through control of appetite and careful training, must
be built up to peak condition. Just as a runner might set his sights on a
distant goal or city, the candidate for the New Jerusalem will make
that goal real.
   Paul goes so far as to say, "Our conversation [citizenship] is in
heaven" (Phil. 3:20)—our manner of running, our whole way of life, is
pointed toward heaven. Never for an instant will the dedicated runner
forget it.
   All about us are strivers—some even fall into the category known as
"workaholics"—addicts of work. But to what end? To achieve great
fame in the world of sports, for instance, young men and young women
risk bodily injury and possibly even death itself. And should they ever
reach the top, their career might last a few years. Is it really worth it
all? There is some satisfaction, no doubt, in hearing the cheers of the
crowds and seeing one's name in the headlines, but this is poor comfort
in comparison with the glory that endures.
   Even the strivers after otherwise worthy goals will meet great disap-
pointments unless they also achieve a strong grasp on eternal mat-
ters.
   In the Christian race all can win if they will, by the grace of Christ
persisting to the end. As for the rewards, the real treasure is measured
in the gold of character.

                                                                             May 9

        Part 1 "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God,
   JUST MEN . .. to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
MADE PERFECT written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
               just men made perfect"(Heb. 12:22, 23).

                   The first 11 chapters of Hebrews take us on a tour, as it were,
                beginning with the role of Jesus Christ in the creation of the
                worlds. As the tour moves along, the great scenes concerning
                redemption are introduced. Jesus is always the supreme fig-
                ure because of His great sacrifice and His mediation. These scenes
                are to be held as a part of our experience, and we are not to let them
                slip. In chapter 11 attention is turned to people who lived lives of
                faith, lives of faithful deeds. And with chapter 12 we as Christians
                are introduced into the race toward the New Jerusalem. The
                heroes of old are pictured as sitting in an arena, urging us on and
                encouraging us to finish well. (See Heb. 12:1, 2.)
                   (The "spirits" in today's text are not some conscious part of
                man that can exist apart from the body. The language is figurative
                of the saints who will assemble before God's throne.) Whether we
                like it or not, we must live our lives in the light of those who have
                lived before us. We may also contemplate those who are yet to
                come on the scene.

                  In the text for today, what is meant by "just"?

                   The words just and righteous are really the same word in the
                Bible, whether in the Hebrew or the Greek language. "Paths of
                righteousness" (Ps. 23:3) are right paths, paths that are good for
                one's feet, paths that exemplify what paths ought to be.
                   When a person accepts the righteousness of Christ, he accepts
                the merits.of Christ's life of complete obedience to the Father's
                will. This act places him where God sees him and counts him
                righteous. He treats him as righteous, just. By contrast, "all our
                righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (Isa. 64:6).
                   Yet the story does not stop here. As God counts the believers
                righteous, He also implants within them a new spirit. (See Eze.
                36:25-27.) Others looking on take "knowledge of them" (Acts
                4:13), recognizing a quality of life that people cannot achieve by
                themselves.
                   Not only is the righteousness counted to us a necessary part of
                God's plan, but also the continued fostering and receiving of this
                 righteousness. Both will be seen in the final demonstration of
                God's glory.

                  To whom does the fruit belong that is borne by the branches of the
                "true vine"? (See John 15.)

   Part 2     "What glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall
EXAMPLE     take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it
            patiently, this is acceptable with God. For even hereunto were ye
            called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example,
            that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile
            found in his mouth" (1 Peter 2:20-22).

               "Imitation" can be a negative word, smacking of the fake and
            the false. But it is also a very good word when it is used of following
            Jesus, for anyone who imitates Jesus can never be led astray. (See
            1 Cor. 4:16; 1 Thess. 1:6 where the word imitator is used in the
            original language.) Much of the New Testament is an enlargement
            of Jesus' words, "Follow Me."
               "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's
            sake" (Ps. 23:3). God's name, His character, is being challenged.
            We are delegated to declare to the world what God is like. Many
            non-Christians operate from humanitarian or religious motives
            which resemble Christian motivations. They do this under cruel
            trial and with a view to the future. But the true follower of Christ
            will react from love when under cruel trial and will forego present
            advantages for an unfading crown of glory.
               In every aspect of life our example becomes a witness for or
            against Christ. In some parts of the world where Christianity is a
            minority faith, the Adventist recognition of biblical health princi-
            ples and practices often opens doors of goodwill to us.

              What should we do if we are engaged in a business in which it is
            impossible to follow the Christian way? (Consider Matt. 9:9; Acts
            19:18, 19.)

              "If any are engaged in business where they cannot advance in
            the divine life and perfect holiness in the fear of God, they should
            change to a business in which they can have Jesus with them every
            hour."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 234.

                 Why is example better than good advice?

              "When a crisis comes in the life of any soul, and you attempt to
            give counsel or admonition, your words will have only the weight
            of influence for good that your own example and spirit have gained
            for you. You must be good before you can do good."—Thoughts
            From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 127, 128. (Original emphasis.)

SINGLENESS     thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
OF PURPOSE     forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for
               the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:13, 14).

                 "He who would build up a strong, symmetrical character, he
               who would be a well-balanced Christian, must give all and do all

                 "Paul did many things. From the time that he gave his allegiance
               to Christ, his life was filled with untiring service. . . . But in all the
               busy activities of his life, Paul never lost sight of one great
               purpose—to press toward the prize of his high calling."—The Acts
               of the Apostles, pp. 483, 484.

               entire trust in Him."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 140.
                 How important it is in the race for eternal life that we look "unto
               Jesus the author and finisher of our faith" (Heb. 12:2)! Satan's big
               deception may simply be to divert our attention from essential
               prayer and Bible study, thus preoccupying our interests and
               thoughts to the exclusion of that which would advance God's
               kingdom. Today, in many parts of the world, time-consuming
               entertainment devices are invading our homes in increasing
               numbers. The challenge to our best use of time is great.

                   How might the length of human probation be related to singleness

 THE MIND    whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if

               Ask almost any Olympic athlete how he or she won distinction
             and you get one answer: the mind was set to achieve.
               The kind of food we eat daily affects in some way every tissue of
             our body. The same rule applies to the mind: we are what we think.
             Must we then go into a cloister in solitude and perform penance in
             order to stifle our fleshly urges? Those who have done so may tell

               What did Jesus intend when He told us to enter into our closet and
             shut the door? (See Matt. 6:6.)

                A Seventh-day Adventist dentist called to military service was
             deeply troubled over the impact the perpetual cursing and filthy
             talk around him made upon his mind and memory. In spite of his
             wishes this barrage coursed through his mind when he chose to
             pray or study. What would be your advice to one in such a situa-
             tion?

               Is the Christian who follows Paul's counsel (in Phil. 4:8) really
             deprived of anything worthwhile?

               "We want the transforming grace of God to take right hold of our
             thinking powers. We may think evil, we may continue to keep our
             minds upon objectionable things, but what does this do for us? It

    Part 5     "Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you [behave] like men, be
STRENGTH strong" (1 Cor. 16:13).
  FOR THE   "Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might" (Eph.
 CONTEST 6:10).

                At no point in the race can the Christian pause and say, "I am
             strong." Paul went a step farther, with the comment, "When I am
             weak, then am I strong" (2 Cor. 12:10). But let us never forget that
             Paul had the tremendous strength of a tested faith. He could
             declare, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
             me" (Phil 4:13). This strengthening, however, was not for his
             tomorrows—only for his todays. Moses said, "As thy days, so
             shall thy strength be" (Deut. 33:25).
                "No amount of past experience will suffice for the present nor
             strengthen us to overcome the difficulties in our path. We must
             have new grace and fresh strength daily in order to be
             victorious."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 541.
                "By His grace we may bear all the burdens of the present and
             perform its duties. But many are weighed down by the anticipation
             of future troubles. They are constantly seeking to bring tomor-
             row's burdens into today. Thus a large share of all their trials are
             imaginary. For these, Jesus has made no provision. He promises
             grace only for the day."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 200.

               What will enable us to withstand the trials which will come upon
             the remnant church? (See 1 John 5:4.)

                Under the trials and difficulties which have already come upon
             God's people in many countries, we may wonder what the future
             holds. The greatest comfort lies in knowing that the future is also in
             God's hands. The faith and courage gained in the place of prayer
             and in the conflicts of the past will help to keep the believer's
             lifeline open to Christ in the final days of tribulation.
                "Because man fallen could not overcome Satan with his human
             strength, Christ came from the royal courts of heaven to help him
             with His human and divine strength combined. .. . He obtains for
             the fallen sons and daughters of Adam that strength which it is
             impossible for them to gain for themselves, that in His name they

COURAGEOUS     (John 21:19).
   IN DEATH      "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints" (Ps.
               116:15).

                  Jesus could look into the future and see that after Peter's effec-
               tive ministry of the gospel he would have to lay down his life, and
               that in so doing he would bear an effective witness before the
               waiting universe, bringing glory to God.

                 When death comes, what makes the grief of believers different
               from that of the race in general? 1 Thess. 4:13-18.

                  Grief is the common lot of mankind in the wake of death. The
               separation that comes touches all, even when a faithful witness
               like Peter brings glory to God by the manner of his death. But the
               hope and assurance of the resurrection to eternal life robs death of
               its sting.

                 In what spirit should the Christian meet death? (Consider Acts
               7:54-60.)

                  "The Christian who manifests patience and cheerfulness under
               bereavement and suffering, who meets even death itself with the
               peace and calmness of an unwavering faith, may accomplish for
               the gospel more than he would have effected by a long life of
               faithful labor. Often when the servant of God is withdrawn from
               active duty, the mysterious providence which our shortsighted
               vision would lament is designed by God to accomplish a work that
               otherwise would never have been done."—The Acts of the Apos-
               tles, p. 465.

                    In the Christian's experience, what would be worse than death?

                 "To pursue a course of deviation from the purposes of God, in
               the smallest degree, would be more grievous than hunger or
               death."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
               vol. 5, p. 1083.

                  "The season of distress before God's people will call for a faith
               that will not falter. His children must make it manifest that He is the
               only object of their worship, and that no consideration, not even that
               of life itself, can induce them to make the least concession to false
               worship. . . . Truth will be obeyed though the result be imprisonment
               or exile or death."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 512, 513.

                                              Adult Lesson




Prayer for io
  "It came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he
ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray" (Luke
11:1).



   "In a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour found
it necessary to turn aside from ceaseless activity and contact with human
needs, to seek retirement and unbroken communion with His
Father."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 58.
   In this lesson we wish to consider the intercessory prayer of Jesus as
recorded in John 17. Although Jesus is about to experience crucifix-
ion and death, His greatest burden is for His disciples and for the comple-
tion, through them and all later Christians, of the work of revealing God
to the world.
   The words glory, glorify, and glorified are used by Jesus eight times in
His prayer. In this chapter the real meaning of glory 'becomes
apparent. The Father dwells in glory that flows from His perfect character
and infinite power. Although fiery brightness surrounds Him and a
rainbow encircles His throne, it is the glory of His character of love and
goodness that outshines all. In every way He is worthy of our honor,
 praise, approval, and acclamation. These accompanying elements
are never absent. He is the "King of glory," and we give glory to Him.
    What astounds us is that although Jesus shared the Father's glory,
 yet He was not content to see one little lamb go astray. His equality with
 God was not the goal to be grasped and hoarded. The glory of self-
 sacrificing love could better be displayed to the universe in a dark-
 ness more dense than midnight—the heavy gloom of Gethsemane and
 Calvary.
    The character of God is knit with that of the Son. Because Jesus is
 representative man, our Elder Brother, we have a great share in the
 Father's love. God loved us in Christ before the foundation of the
 world. That same love is to work in and through us for a final dem-
 onstration to the universe of the glory of God's character.
    The prayer of Jesus may be divided into the following parts: (1) for
 Himself, that the Father's glory might be seen in Him; (2) for His
 disciples, that they might reflect the gleams of glory from above; (3)
 for the larger group of followers that should result from the apostles'
 witness; (4) for the reunited and harmonious universe.
                                                                   55
               Prayer for Glory                                         8 Sunday
                                                                            May 16

       Part1     "These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
'OR HIMSELF    said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
               glorify thee"(John 17:1).

                  The danger is that we may define too narrowly the glory which is
               a recurring subject in this selfless prayer. With what lay just before
               Him, Jesus would be pleading for the support of His Father's
               presence and power; He would yearn for the sense of the Father's
               approval of His work now closing; He would ask for the assurance
               of restoration to His oneness with the Father in His glory; He
               would yearn for strength to continue to reveal the Father's charac-
               ter to the final moment of life.
                  Not all prayers for oneself should be regarded as selfish. A
               lifeguard who is about to plunge into a raging sea to rescue a
               disobedient swimmer might pray for wisdom and strength to save
               the life.
                  In the case of the world that had gone astray, it was not wind and
               weather that were the danger, for nature could cooperate with its
               Creator. But the deliberate and constant plottings of Satan and his
               agents followed Jesus throughout His earthly life.
                  "As the world's Redeemer, Christ was constantly confronted
               with apparent failure. He, the messenger of mercy to the world,
               seemed to do little of the work He longed to do in uplifting and
               saving. Satanic influences were constantly working to oppose His
               way. But He would not be discouraged."—The Desire of Ages, p.
               678.

                 Was Christ's life-saving project for His enemies, for His friends,
               or for both? Rom. 5:8.

                 The tendency of the human heart is to love those who love us.
               But though the ninety and nine sheep in the flock were indeed
               precious to Jesus, that rebel who insisted on destroying himself or
               herself moved the heart of the Rescuer. He came to endure the
               decree of Herod, the temptation in the wilderness, the constant
               harassment of the church people of His day, and the agonies of
               Gethsemane and Calvary. Why? For the greater joy in heaven.
               (See Luke 15:10.)

                 What effect does our salvation have on the glory of God? (Com-
               pare John 17:1, 4, 19, 22, 26.)

                 We have noted earlier that God's attributes and character are
               absolute. They cannot be added to, but understanding of His glory
               can be.

    Part 2     "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
  FOR THE    thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and
DISCIPLES    thine are mine; and I am glorified in them" (John 17:9, 10).

               Those for whom Jesus was praying would soon turn their backs
             upon Him. Yet He said, "I am glorified in them"—in Peter who
             would soon deny his Lord with an oath, and in those who set their
             hopes upon an earthly kingdom and positions of prominence in it.
               Psychologists tell us that older people and parents should not be
             surprised at what young people may say or do at a given time. They
             are in the process of developing, and it is not the occasional
             statement or side step that determines their destiny, but rather the
             tendency of the life.
                Jesus could see in His little flock the showing forth of glory. He
             knew that through this nucleus the Holy Spirit would enlighten the
             world and even change the universe.

               What does the picture used by Jesus tell you about the security of
             the tie that binds you to Him? John 10:27-29.

               "By His life and death, Christ has achieved even more than
             recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's pur-
             pose to bring about an eternal separation between God and man;
             but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if we had
             never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself
             to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal
             ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave
             His only-begotten Son.' John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear
             our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen
             race. . . .
                " . . The earth itself, the very field that Satan claims as his, is to
             be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world, under the curse
             of sin the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will be honored
             above all other worlds in the universe of God."—The Desire of
             Ages, pp. 25, 26.
                Liberal scholars often remark concerning the name "Im-
             manuel" (see Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23) that Jesus was never really
             called by that name during His earthly sojourn. This, they say,
             puts a cloud on the doctrines of the virgin birth and the incarnation.
              But one does not have to read far in John 17 to detect not only
             "God with us," but "God in us."

               "To bring humanity into Christ, to bring the fallen race into
             oneness with divinity, is the work of redemption."—Selected Mes-
             sages, bk. 1, p. 251.

                                                                           May 18

     Part 3     With what earnest pleading did Jesus express concern for His
HE GUARDS     own? How is His concern reflected in us?
  HIS OWN
                 "Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou
              hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with
              them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gayest me
              I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition" (John
              17:11, 12).

                Jesus' relationship to His disciples might well be likened to that
              of a nurse to a child. Gentleness and carefulness should likewise
              characterize all our dealings with one another. Only thus can we
              follow the Christ way.
                 Paul said of his dealings with the Thessalonians, "We were
              gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children"
              (1 Thess. 2:7). How many times have we permitted our "clumsy
              hands" to "rend quivering heartstrings"? How often have we
              perhaps by a cold, legalistic approach to people, driven them over
              to the charismatics and others, there to feel they have found a
              warmth and an understanding that we failed to give?
                 We do have to call sin by its right name, and we all should heed
              Paul's counsel to "reprove, rebuke, exhort" (2 Tim. 4:2). How-
              ever, we are to do this with "all longsuffering." Only thus can we
              represent Jesus aright and bring glory to His name—that glory for
              which He prayed.

                In fulfillment of Christ's mission, where are His followers to find
              their power? Acts 1:8; John 16:13, 14.

                The Holy Spirit will glorify Jesus when He dwells in our hearts.
              He will dwell in our hearts through God's instruction to us: "He
              shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you" (John 16:14).
              Then we must become listeners and learners. How can sinners
              bring glory to God better than to reveal the working of His grace in
              the heart and the power of His Spirit in the life.

                With respect to the text of the day, think of Christ's grief over
              Judas's rejection of Him.

                 In this part of His prayer (John 17:11, 12) Jesus had special
              reference to the Twelve, the "little flock" whom He had especially
              trained. Of these, Judas was lost. But think of the value that Jesus
              placed upon the eleven who were true. Jesus placed the success of
              His mission upon eleven men empowered by the Spirit. Today we
              are called to stand in that same light, reflecting the glory of God to
              the world.

  Part 4     What was Jesus' goal for the whole world?
FOR THE
 WORLD       "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
           believe on me through their word; that they all may be one; as thou,
           Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that
           the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which
           thou gayest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we
           are one" (John 17:20-22).

             Those of us who read these lines did not have the privilege of
           being numbered with the twelve disciples. But we are not left out in
           the cold; we are among "them also which shall believe."
           Moreover, out there—next door, perhaps in the next village, or
           perhaps half a world away—there are more souls to bring, "other
           sheep" that are "not of this fold" (John 10:16). Think of the glory
           (in the sense of praise and honor) that can be added to the, One
           "who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
           despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne
           of God" (Heb. 12:2).
              "Christians are set as light bearers on the way to heaven. They
           are to reflect to the world the light shining upon them from Christ.
           Their life and character should be such that through them others
           will get a right conception of Christ and of His service."—Steps to
           Christ, p. 115.

            What is the place of joy if the Christian is to be a manifestation of
           Christ? (See Phil. 4:4.)

              At the birth of Jesus the angel said, "I bring you good tidings of
           great joy, which shall be to all people" (Luke 2:10). But do Chris-
           tians really project a joyful image to those about them?
              "If we do represent Christ, we shall make His service appear
           attractive, as it really is. Christians who gather up gloom and
           sadness to their souls, and murmur and complain, are giving to
           others a false representation of God and the Christian life. They
           give the impression that God is not pleased to have His children
           happy, and in this they bear false witness against our heavenly
           Father."—Steps to Christ, p. 116.

              How true of me are the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:14?

              "Salvation is like the sunshine. It belongs to the whole world.
            The religion of the Bible is . . . to sanctify the daily life, to manifest
            itself in every business transaction and in all our social
            relations."—The Desire of Ages, p. 307.

    Part 5    "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gayest me
    GOD'S out of the world: thine they were, and thou gayest them me; and they
ARACTER-1 have kept thy word" (John 17:6).

                 So well did Jesus manifest the Father to the world, and espe-
              cially to the disciples, that He could say, "He that hath seen me
              hath seen the Father" (John 14:9). So central was the manifesta-
              tion of God in the plan of salvation that Jesus could say, "I have
              glorified thee on earth: I have finished the work which thou gayest
              me to do" (John 17:4).
                 Some children find it hard to obey the fifth commandment,
              "Honour thy father and thy mother" (Ex. 20:12). Children cannot
              always understand the ways their parents deal with them. But God
              sees a certain honor due to parents because they are the parents. It
              is also true that we do not understand God's will always.
                 Do we want to know what God is like? Then behold Jesus who
              said, "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30)—not one in person
              (the word one is neuter in the original language), but one in charac-
              ter and purpose.
                 "Christ, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of
              His divinity and came to live as a man among men, that they might,
              without being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator.
              Since sin brought separation between man and his Maker, no man
              has seen God at any time, except as He is manifested through
              Christ."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 419.

                Since Christ is not now physically with us, how can we know God's
              character and thus glorify Him before the world? John 17:14.

                 God's character is outlined for us in His Word, the Bible, which,
              Paul told Timothy, is "able to make thee wise unto salvation"
              (2 Tim. 3:15). If Paul could say this concerning the Old Testa-
              ment, how much more can it now be said concerning the New
              with the Old? The Word is close to us.
                 What picture of trust is more appealing than that of a tousled
              two-year-old heavy in sleep on his father's shoulder during an
              evening concert of music? So with the children of God. The Lord
              bids us, "Look unto me, and be ye saved" (Isa. 45:22). "Come
              unto me, . . . and I will give you rest" (Matt. 11:28). "If any of you
              lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally,
              and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him" (James 1:5).

                Those who are not naturally warmhearted can become so by a

      Part 6   What amazing prospect awaits the redeemed in the kingdom of
      GOD'S glory soon to come?
CHARACTER-2
               "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
             me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast
             given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"
             (John 17:24).

                   This Scripture tells us that God loved Jesus as the Representa-
                tive of the human race, and loved us in Him. He so loved us before
                human history began. God set a value on human beings because of
                what they would become through the divine sacrifice and indwell-
                ing.
                   Because of the great glory of Christ that will be seen and known
                by the redeemed in eternity, God went ahead with His plan to cre-
                ate our first parents. He did so in foreknowledge of the temptation
                and of the results of Satan's deceptions. Jesus stepped down frorri
                heaven's throne in order to declare unto us the great love of the
                 Father for His children.
                   "Christ's favorite theme was the paternal character and abun-
                dant love of God. This knowledge of God was Christ's own gift to
                 men, and this gift He has committed to His people to be communi-
                cated by them to the world."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 55.

                  What are we to know that is yet too great to know? Eph. 3:19.

                  "Who can measure the love Christ felt for a lost world as He
                hung upon the cross, suffering for the sins of guilty men? This love
                was immeasurable, infinite."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 212.
                  Although we cannot here fully know God's great love in sending
                us Jesus, we are to make this knowledge our goal. The four
                dimensions of Ephesians 3:18—breadth, length, depth, and
                height—do not describe a boxed-up area, but rather a dynamic,
                limitless radiating of God's love into our hearts, bringing us to
                glory and demonstrating God's character to the universe.

                  "That through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now
                be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly
                places" (Eph. 3:10, RSV).

                  "Here is love that no language can express. It passes knowl-
                edge. Great is the mystery of godliness. Our souls should be
                enlivened, elevated, and enraptured with the theme of the love of
                the Father and the Son to man. The followers of Christ should here
                learn to reflect in some degree that mysterious love."—

 "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 5:16).



   Although faith and works are in some ways poles apart, good
works do go hand in hand with faith. In fact, the justified person who has no
desire to give evidence in the daily life that he or she is a child of God is
thus denying the glory that God is waiting to manifest in His people. The
prayer of Jesus (John 17) is not effective in that life. The person who thus
refuses to show forth God's character in the life denies many others
an opportunity to return glory to God. Thousands have been turned away
from the Christian way because they saw in the lives of "Christians" a
great gap between principle and practice.
   We are not our own, but we are a part of the great web of humanity,
and we thus bear a responsibility to all men. We are debtors (see
Rom. 1:14). We may think that in the seemingly small matters of daily life
no glory may be brought to God, but such is not the case.
   Why is Jesus waiting to come back to receive His people? This
question is not ours to answer fully. We know that the price of our
redemption has been paid, death has been overcome, our Saviour
has ascended, and He has definitely not shirked any duty in our behalf. In
the gift of Christ to the world there must be an even wider objective than
the salvation of man. There is. Man was created for God's glory. (See
Isa. 43:7.) God has not yet received the glory due Him from His professed
followers. Some are not ready to recognize God's glory in the
condescension of the cross and in man's utter dependence on that cross for
eternal life. Such cannot therefore learn the secret of daily living that
would reflect the image of Jesus and thus reflect glory back to God.
   The stalwarts of other ages have done their part. They have passed on
to us the torch of truth, and now we have the privilege of meeting
history's climactic challenge by the final revelation of the glory of God.

                                                                        May 23

    Part 1      "Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
 UNITY OF    likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye
BELIEVERS    may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of
             our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ
             also received us to the glory of God" (Rom. 15:5-7).

               When Christ receives sinners, God is glorified. When we accept
             and honor one another as believers, God is glorified. The key
             question is this: Does Christ's perfect life stand for our sinful lives
             so that we have a welcome reception into God's presence? If so,
             then we in turn will receive others who have accepted Christ's gift
             of life and demonstrate to the world a unity that is greater than
             mere tolerance.
                In these days great virtue is attached to finding a way to dif-
             fer from any expressed opinion. One who agrees with another is
             often thought too simple. It is not always a question of belonging to
             the Apollos party or the Paul party. We boast of belonging to
             neither or of starting a new party.
                Paul would say to such, "Should we not rather glory that we are
             all of Christ?" (See 1 Cor. 3:21-23.) If Apollos has something to
             offer of value, let us receive it with thanks. But let "there be no
             divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in
             the same mind and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10).

                Since no two people are exactly alike and do not think exactly
             alike, how is it possible for us to be "in the same mind"?

               On the great essentials of salvation, we will not agree in theory
             only but will earnestly seek unity of spirit and action in the church.
             We need to be mended, tied together, as a torn fishing net is
             mended loop to loop (Matt. 4:21). (See also Rom. 12:16; 2 Cor.
             13:11; Phil. 2:2.)

               What kind of spirit seeks to sow dissension? (See 1 Tim. 5:13; 6:4.)

                "Floating rumors are frequently the destroyers of unity among
             brethren. There are some who watch with open mind and ears to
             catch flying scandal. They gather up little incidents which may be
             trifling in themselves, but which are repeated and exaggerated
             until a man is made an offender for a word. . . . These tale-
             bearers are doing the devil's work with surprising fidelity, little
             knowing how offensive their course is to God"—Elien G. White

      Part 2        In what two opposite ways can speech be used?
SPEECH THAT
    BLESSES     "Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
               we men, which are made after the similitude of God" (James 3:9).

                  A fountain cannot send out bitter and sweet water at the same
               time and place (see verse 11), but very often those who have
               espoused Christianity try to mingle sweet and bitter speaking.
               They may turn off the bitter speech on Sabbath, only to resume it
               in the week. But religion is not a ritual to be performed on occa-
               sion; it is rather like yeast that pervades the entire lump of dough to
               make an appetizing loaf of bread. True religion is carried into our
               speech: "For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy
               words thou shalt be condemned" (Matt. 12:37).

                    How important are the words that God speaks? Isa. 55:10, 11.

                  The Hebrew word dabar is translated "word" 770 times in the
               KJV. But it is also translated "act" 52 times. God does not speak
               idle words. In a sense His word is an act. It produces.
                  Jesus spoke words that healed, and by our words we can spread
               either healing cheer or destructive gloom. Words are one of the
               chief means by which we show how we feel toward others. They
               also are an outward sign of what is going on in our minds, what our
               relationship is with God.
                  "Let not condemnatory words be spoken. Learn of the great
               Teacher. Words of kindness and sympathy will do as good as a
               medicine, and will heal souls that are in despair. The knowledge of
               the word of God brought into the practical life will have a healing,
               soothing power."—Gospel Workers, p. 163.
                  "God calls not only for your benevolence, but for your cheerful
               countenance, your hopeful words, the grasp of your hand. As you
               visit the Lord's afflicted ones, you will find some from whom hope
               has departed; bring back the sunshine to them."—Testimonies,
               vol. 6, p. 277.

                 What help can we have in choosing our words? Col. 3:14-17.

                 "God will surely help those who seek Him for wisdom.. . . If the
               worker keeps his heart uplifted in prayer, God will help him to
               speak the right word at the right time."—Gospel Workers, p. 120.

                 "Words are more than an indication of character; they have
               power to react on the character. Men are influenced by their own
               words."—The Desire of Ages, p. 323.

     Part 3     "Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
FAITH THAT    dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the
 GLORIFIES    deadness of Sara's womb: he staggered not at the promise of God
              through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God"
              (Rom. 4:19, 20).

                 "Faith" as an Old Testament word usually carries with it the
              idea of faithfulness. Paul here used the story of Abraham's faith as
              his prime exhibit of New Testament faith, the kind of faith a
              Christian should have.
                 Christian faith is not divorced from faithfulness. We read of
              heroes of faith who "endured, as seeing him who is invisible"
              (Heb. 11:27), linking their daily steadfastness to the reality of an
              unseen goal. They grasped the promises of the unseen as if they
              were seen, and the actions of their lives gave a witness to their
              faith.
                 The grace of God, manifested in forgiveness of our sins and in
              fitting us for heaven, is unseen; we grasp it by faith. In doing so,
              we, like Abraham of old, will be "strong in faith, giving glory to
              God" (Rom. 4:20). God's forgiveness of us will be an unseen
              transaction, but our lives will be a testimony to that transaction as
              well.
                 The objective of faith is our ultimate salvation, but it brings to us
              "the faith of Jesus"—the faithfulness of Jesus demonstrated in
               Gethsemane, when He could not see through the portals of the
              tomb. This faithfulness, demonstrated before the waiting uni-
               verse, was the crowning achievement that will resound endlessly
               in the ages to come. It will be reflected in the final test of "the
               remnant."

                 What is the relationship between faith and knowledge?

                "What a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?" (Rom. 8:24).
              "Those who think it impossible for them to yield to the will of God
              and have faith in His promises until all is made clear and plain
              before them, will never yield at all."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 28.
                Faith seeks an assurance that often probes beyond the known.
              Will Jesus appear the second time? Is Jesus pleading for our sins in
              the sanctuary above? Are my sins really forgiven? Does prayer
              really avail? The true Christian will demonstrate a certainty that
              outdistances book knowledge on these and many other questions.
                "You have to talk faith, you have to live faith, you have to act
              faith, that you may have an increase of faith; and thus exercising
              that living faith you will grow to strong men and women in Christ
              Jesus."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

     Part 4     Following a discussion of meats offered to idols, what general
EATING AND    principle of Christian life did Paul pronounce?
  DRINKING
                "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
              the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31).

                 All Christians would agree that "the kingdom of God is not meat
              and drink" (Rom. 14:17), yet Paul covered in his broad generaliza-
              tion every aspect of life. That certainly would include the universal
              need for nourishment of the body. Paul's view of the body-temple
              supports the general principle. (See 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.)
                 Nobody on earth has the right to dictate to us how much or of
              what we should partake. The real question is not what the other
              person says or does—what he or she may eat or imbibe—but am I
              fulfilling the inspired exhortation of 1 Corinthians 10:31? It is a
              personal matter.

                If healthful living is one means of giving glory to God, how are
              Seventh-day Adventists doing in this respect at this time?

                 Let us examine our hearts in regard to our response to God's call
              to glorify Him in our personal habits. We have no right to give way
              to perverted appetite. The result of doing so is often to inflict on
              others an unhappy disposition.
                 Healthful living is sensible, balanced, moderate, and slow to
              condemn those with different ideas. Healthful living deals with
              every part of our lives and surroundings. It is broader than food
              choice. It takes appreciative note of the findings of medical sci-
              ence.

                   What is the place of exercise in a program of health recovery?

                "Inactivity is the greatest curse that could come upon most
              invalids. . . .
                "Those whose habits are sedentary should, when the weather
              will permit, exercise in the open air every day, summer or
              winter."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 240.
                In the area of health consciousness and the conscientious taking
              of exercise, many who have no religious motivations are setting
              the pace. What opportunity for effective witness this affords us!
                Similarly, there is growing interest in all of the health standards
              once entrusted to us. How faithfully are we following that light?

            mind concerning our duty is relatively easy. Our text does not
            present Christ as an example of casual and occasional service. If
            we are to meet the requirements of Christ's example, we are to
            follow in the footsteps of Him who went about doing good continu-
            ally.
               Along with the proclamation of the Sabbath truth, Isaiah 58
            made it clear that God's people were "to loose the bands of
            wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the op-
            pressed go free" (verse 6). We likewise are to feed the hungry,
            bring the poor to our homes, and clothe the naked. If we want to
            experience a type of prosperity that leaves no bitter memories, we
            will follow our Lord in helping others.

              What ingredient is essential to effective service? 2 Cor. 6:4.

               The true spirit of ministering is shown not only in the endurance
            of persecution; but it is also evidenced in the daily, even hourly,
            training of children, in constant ministration to others, in silence
            under rebuke, and in bouncing back from loss and disappointment.
               The mother in the home may find the daily chores very tedious,
            especially in caring for a large family. But by her patient ministry
            she is worthy of glory and honor, and in the end eternal life. God's
            remnant people are to be noted for their patience. (See
            Rev. 14:12.)

             What comforting lesson may be learned from Christ, the Master
            Worker? (See Mark 6:35-44.)

              "How often our hearts sink, and faith fails us, as we see how
            great is the need, and how small the means in our hands. Like
            Andrew looking upon the five barley loaves and the two little
            fishes, we exclaim, 'What are they among so many?' Often we
            hesitate, unwilling to give all that we have, fearing to spend and to
            be spent for others. But Jesus has bidden us, 'Give ye them to eat.'
            His command is a promise; and behind it is the same power that fed
            the multitude by the sea."—The Desire of Ages, p. 369.
               Jesus mingled easily with the rich and the poor—He refused to
            conform to society's class distinctions.

  Part 6      What evidence does Peter offer to show that God considers the
 USE OF    different abilities of His servants?
TALENTS
              "If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
           giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
           to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen" (1 Peter
           4:11).

              To every person, even the most uneducated or the most feeble,
           is given some ability which he can and should use to God's glory
           and honor. While others may have greater abilities, such have only
           their own opportunities and their own areas of operation. We are
           stationed at certain places at certain times to do a work that no
           other person can do, no matter how great that person's ability may
           be.

                Consider the use of talents by the galaxy of Bible heroes.

             Noah was the man for his day. Abraham, a native of the pros-
           perous city of Ur, decided to leave it all for God. Moses, called
           from caring for sheep, provided effective leadership for Israel.
           Joseph, after a series of dark experiences, rose to prominence in
           Egypt and proved to be God's man of the hour. Esther was brought
           "to the kingdom for such a time" when she was greatly needed.
           Stephen was ready to die as the first recorded Christian martyr,
           and he thus influenced Saul to turn to Christ. Paul himself, weak
           and physically handicapped, was always God's helper; even as a
           prisoner on shipboard he was able to save many lives. Are the
           days of heroism past? No, but we need to awaken to opportunity.
           Even those who are in prison can respond to God's call.
             "Life is an important thing, a sacred trust; and every moment
           should be wisely improved, for its results will be seen in eternity.
           God requires each one to do all the good possible. The talents
           which He has entrusted to our keeping are to be made the most of.
           He has placed them in our hands to be used to His name's honor
           and glory, and for the good .of our fellow men."—Counsels to
           Teachers, pp. 62, 63.

                What is the danger to one who has superior talent?

             The greater a person's talent, the greater the danger that he or
           she will glorify self and forget to glorify God in the common
           aspects of life. For this reason God sometimes "sets them aside for
           men of inferior talent who have learned to rely upon Him."—

Glory in the
Home
   "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8).



   While the foregoing text was written in the context of individuals
in the church, it is equally applicable to the home, which is a segment of the
church and which in the early days often constituted the meeting place
in a given area.
   Two reasons have prompted the writing of a lesson on the home: (1)
The home constitutes the formative factor in the impartation of
God's character to His children. (2) The challenge now evident to the
survival of Christian homes is unprecedented in history.
   All of us came from some kind of a home or family' relationship.
Ideally, home is the dearest spot on earth. Home is reminiscent of those
beautiful Edenic surroundings within which God placed our first
parents and performed the first marriage. It is one of two important
institutions that God established and which come to us from sinless
surroundings. At the same time God's Word offers particular chal-
lenges and blessings for the dedicated single members of the church. The
lifelong selfless service of so many of them will be duly rewarded by
God, even though it has not always been recognized by the church.
    If parents realized what a great opportunity they have to cooperate
 with God in achieving His goals, they would throw their arms around
 their children and bind them to their hearts in love and protection. They
 would seek the most effective ways of counseling their "beautiful
 flock" that God has given them for a few years to love and cherish.
    Since the home was the unquestioned center of society in Bible times
 and in early advent history, the counsel then given is still vital to us
 today. The same principles apply to the dwelling places of marrieds or
 singles.
    Although the security of the Christian home is in greater danger in
 some countries than in others, Adventists should be in the fore-
 front of any save-the-home movement. The home offers the most
 lasting influences for good or evil. How essential that all who make up the
 home have the glory of God as the supreme goal of every day.
                                                                       69

                                                                       May 30
     Part 1     Who established the home? What was the nature of the first home
THE GLORY     on earth?
  OF EDEN
                "The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
              put the man whom he had formed" (Gen. 2:8).

                The glory of Eden is beyond our full understanding because it
              was the work of God's hands and untouched by sin. Physical,
              visible glory and brightness it had. "The air was pure and health-
              ful, and the earth seemed like a noble palace. Angels beheld and
              rejoiced at the wonderful and beautiful works of God."—The
              Story of Redemption, p. 20.
                As the crown of God's Creation, man was "the image and glory
              of God" (1 Cor. 11:7), made "in the image of God" (Gen. 1:27).

                How was the glory of God reflected in the garments of Adam and
              Eve? (See Gen. 2:25; 3:7-11, 21.)

                 The Bible gives us no explicit word on this. By implication, the
              following can be drawn: "They were clothed with a covering of
              light and glory, such as the angels wear. While they lived in
              obedience to God, this circle of light enshrouded them."—
              Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45. The sense of loss of their covering
              reflected their loss of God's glory, His image.

                 What guidance for our families can be drawn from the temptation
              of Eve? (See Gen. 3:1.)

                The brief phrase of Scripture shows us only that Eve was alone
              with the tempter. Perhaps the one greatest need in today's homes
              and families is that of keeping close, keeping in touch, supporting
              one another, avoiding the coming of coolness and distance. Talk,
              study, and pray together. Do not lose the sense of oneness that is
              the essence of marriage and home. "The angels cautioned Eve
              not to separate from her husband in her employment, for she might
              be brought in contact with this fallen foe. If separated from
              each other they might be in greater danger than if both were
              together."—The Story of Redemption, p. 31.

                What could more togetherness in today's homes do to provide a
              safeguard against temptation and to prevent, to some degree, the
              breakup of marriages? (See Prov. 5:18-20.)

                In seeking the glory of God in the home in these "last days,"
              surely there could be no more vital goal than to achieve, by the
              grace of Christ, the unity and harmony that was in Eden before sin.

     Part 2      "Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of
OTHERHOOD     all living" (Gen. 3:20).

                In faith Adam called his wife Eve (chavvah, a primitive root,
              meaning life-giver). She would be the mother of the race. Also the
              promise concerning the "seed of the woman" brought to Adam the
              same kind of hope that Jesus brings to us today—the assurance of
              the enemy's total defeat and the hope of Eden restored. In this
              hope our first parents went from the Garden of Eden to make a
              home in a territory claimed by Satan.

                What was the God-assigned primary role of women in Bible times?
              (See Gen. 1:28; 3:16; Prov. 31:10-31.)

                 Although in some countries today, marriage and motherhood
              are less universal than in Bible times, it still brings glory to God for
              Christian women to be faithful in such a role. "Mother" is still the
              sweetest name for many.
                 "Great is the work and mission of women, especially those who
              are wives and mothers. They can be a blessing to all around them.
              They can have a powerful influence for good if they will let their
              light so shine that others may be led to glorify our heavenly Father.
              . . . They exert an unconscious influence which seems to work out
              naturally from a sanctified life, a renewed heart."—Testimonies,
              vol. 2, p. 465.
                  In the early days of the advent movement, the role of women
              was close to that portrayed in Scripture. "God has assigned
              woman her mission; and if she, in her humble way, yet to the best
              of her ability, makes a heaven of her home, faithfully and lovingly
              performing her duties to her husband and children, continually
              seeking to let a holy light shine from her useful, pure, and virtuous
              life to brighten all around her, she is doing the work left her of the
               Master."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 465, 466.

                How much should the wives and mothers of the church confine
              themselves to the home?

                Economic stress and other factors are presenting mothers with
              cruel choices today. But where old patterns can still be followed,
              "the Christian mother's sphere of usefulness should not be nar-
              rowed by her domestic life. The salutary influence which she
              exerts in the home circle she may and will make felt in more
              widespread usefulness in her neighborhood and in the church of
              God. Home is not a prison to the devoted wife and mother."—The
              Adventist Home, p. 236.

      Part 3      What welcome did a wayward son receive upon returning to his
FATHERHOOD     father?

                 "He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great
               way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell
               on his neck, and kissed him" (Luke 15:20).

                  The Bible is not a volume of family counseling. But glimpses
               here and there present vital principles. Love should mark home
               relationships at all times. Fathers are to be motivated by love when
               they discipline their children or feel they must deprive them of
               something that is not for their good. Requests should be carefully
               evaluated.
                  We know not to what extent the prodigal son was deprived of his
               requests, but we do know that the father embraced his returning
               boy with a spirit of love. Reluctantly the father had complied with
               his grown son's request for his inheritance. And then had come the
               seemingly endless hours of watching for his son's return.
                  On the one hand, fathers may place the kind of unbending,
               dictatorial restraint on a youth that develops obstinacy and de-
               fiance. And, on the other hand, "many prodigal sons become such
               because of indulgence in the home, because their parents have not
               been doers of the Word. The mind and purpose are to be sustained
               by firm, undeviating, sanctified principles. Consistency and affec-
               tion are to be enforced by a lovely and consistent example."—
               Child Guidance, p. 271.
                  "Whatever may be his calling and its perplexities, let the father
               take into his home the same smiling countenance and pleasant
               tones with which he has all day greeted visitors and
               strangers."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 159.

                 What part can the father have in spiritual training in the home?
               Col. 3:21; 1 John 2:13, 14.

                  Fathers can bind their children's hearts to themselves and to
               home by a willingness to confess their own mistakes and fail-
               ures. Children are forgiving by nature.
                  "All members of the family center in the father. He is the
               lawmaker. . . . The father is in one sense the priest of the house-
               hold, laying upon the altar of God the morning and evening sac-
               rifice. . . .
                  ". . . He is a laborer together with God, carrying out the gracious

    Part 4     How has God enshrined children in the heart of His holy law of
CHILDREN     love?

               "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Hon-
             our thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
             promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
             the earth" (Eph. 6:1-3).

               Happy are the Christian parents who train their children for
             eternity. Happy also are the children who can bear the polishing
             that will make them as stones in a beautiful palace. (See Ps.
             144:12.) The march toward destiny begins in the home.
               If our children can sense from infancy that we love them no
             matter how trying they may be, obedience will generally come.

               What is the primary key to a child's learning to obey? (Compare
             1 Cor. 11:1.)

               "It is by beholding love in their parents that children are led to
             obey the fifth commandment and to heed the injuction, 'Children,
             obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.' "—The
             Adventist Home, p. 199.

               How does the age level at which children tend to seek indepen-
             dence compare with that at which a Jewish boy became a "son of the
             law" in Bible times? (Compare Luke 2:41-51.)

               "Children often become impatient under restraint and wish to
             have their own way and to go and come as they please. Especially
             from the age of ten to eighteen they are inclined to feel that there
             can be no harm in going to worldly gatherings of young associates.
             But the experienced Christian parents can see danger."—The
             Adventist Home, p. 529.
               The church needs to remember that teenagers are idealists.
             Bible stories of Joseph, Daniel, Ruth, and Esther can inspire them
             to press on to victory. Adventist pioneers who devoted their lives
             to do and dare for God can also become heroes to the youth of
             today and can inspire them to do exploits for God.

               What is youth's only safety in the face of terrible temptation?

               Never was sin so readily available and in more enticing forms
             than is made possible by the inventions of modern times. Youth
             must literally "flee . . . youthful lusts" (2 Tim. 2:22). Agents of evil
             throw themselves and their wares at youth at earlier and earlier
             stages in life. In answer to the united prayers of parents and
             children, a wall of holy fire alone can turn aside the thrusting
             brazenness of temptation!

                                                                                  73

Part 5     "When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,
YOUTH    which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice;
         and I am persuaded that in thee also" (2 Tim. 1:5).

            Many a youth today is deprived of the Christian example of his
         father. He may be taught of God only by the women of his family.
         If so, it is sometimes expected that he will rebel, forsaking God and
         His Word. It does not have to be that way!
            Not only do we have the noble and challenging example of the
         young man Timothy—to whom Paul became father in the faith—
         but the same pattern has been often repeated to our amazement
         over the centuries since.
            What a comfort and what a challenge still to the mothers and
         grandmothers in Israel!

           What is the real cause of the alienation of youth? (See 2 Tim. 3:1-5,
         12, 13.)

           In considering this question, all parties to the family and church
         are tempted to blame each other for the problem. We may know
         some factors that contribute to the problem, but many escape us.
         From Cain to the prodigal son, we know from the Bible that the
         problem is not new. It challenges the whole church to prayer,
         study, and the love which is vital to the solution.

           Consider how youth have served the Lord despite the poor exam-
         ple of parents. (See 2 Chron. 33:21-25; 34:3.)

            What were the factors that counteracted the influence of Amon
         and that led this young king to turn to God? His mother Jedidah
         (meaning "beloved of God") may have taught him carefully, by
         precept and example. Perhaps his father's conduct was so unat-
         tractive to him that he determined never to follow his ways.
         Perhaps Jeremiah, a young minister, set him a good example and
         led Josiah to bring to Judah a much-needed reform. Let it never be
         said that youth from less than ideal homes cannot fill a noble place
         in God's great plan.
            Perhaps one of the greatest gifts that parents, teachers, church,
         and family can offer youth today is a listening ear. It calls for them
         to withhold counsel until they have really heard where the problem
         lies. Love listens!

           "Let the youth be led to understand the object of their creation, to
         honor God and bless their fellow men."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
         p. 601.

                                                                     June 4
  Part 6     No matter what our present situation, to what kind of home can we
  HOME     look forward?
AT LAST
             "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
           would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and
           prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto
           myself; that where I am, there ye may be also" (John 14:
           2, 3).

             The dearest and tenderest earthly thoughts that human beings
           can bring to mind usually center around the home. Although He
           suffered at the hands of Joseph's sons, this must have been true of
           Jesus also in His early years. Hearing the call of His heavenly
           Father, He left the home nest and for several years had "not where
           to lay his head" (Luke 9:58). He did, however, have a home in
           heaven, and in His earthly walk He was in constant touch with
           God.
             Jesus taught us to address God as "Our Father." And when He
           wanted to illustrate the life to come, He chose the metaphor of the
           home. What a warm and comforting thought to earth's pilgrims of
           all time, many of whom "wandered about in sheepskins and
           goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; . . . in dens and
           caves of the earth" (Heb. 11:37, 38)!
              Dear young person, do you have a home where neither par-
           ent gives God glory? God's claims upon us supersede those of a
           father or mother. "Moses, when he was come to years, refused to
           be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer
           affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
           for a season" (Heb. 11:24, 25).

             By what steps can a foretaste of heaven's joy and fellowship be
           ours now? Mal. 3:16; Col. 3:12-17.

              "Rest yourself wholly in the hands of Jesus. Contemplate His
           great love. . . . We may enjoy rich feasts of love, and as we fully
           believe that we are His by adoption, we may have a foretaste of
           heaven. . . . We feel indeed an abiding Christ in the soul. We abide
           in Him, and feel at home with Jesus. The promises flow into the
           soul. Our peace is like a river, wave after wave of glory rolls into
           the heart, and indeed we sup with Jesus and He with us. . . . With
           strong confidence, we can call God our Father."—Ellen G. White
           Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 1147, 1148.

             Why is Satan so anxious to break up homes and to promote
           unhappy unions, especially among "good" people of God's rem-
           nant church?

Glory of t e
Remnant
  "After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory" (Rev.
18:1).



   God's original purpose in creating human beings—for His glory,
to reflect His image—will be realized in a whole people before the great
drama of sin ends. When once that goal has been achieved and Satan's
charges have again been shown to be false, God will step in to rescue
His faithful ones. The sealing work will have been finished, and God's
glory will have been shown in a special setting and worldwide
confrontation by His remnant people.
   Unnumbered saints and martyrs of old have stood firm, even in the
face of death itself. But before the destruction of Satan and the forces of
evil, a final display of loyalty will be seen, motivated by the Holy Spirit.
This "latter rain" outpouring of the Spirit ripens the harvest for the
kingdom.
   What does it mean to "fear God"? It means to stand in awe of Him,
to adore, to worship, to obey. It does not, however, mean to stand
trembling in terror, and especially not if we have accepted the blood of
Jesus to cover our sins. It does mean that we live as in God's sight,
carefully and faithfully guarding against any worldly distraction or subtle
encroachment that would deceive us and cause us to dishonor God. It
does mean looking unto Jesus, who will complete His work of grace in
us.
   To fear God is to be loyal to Him. This gives God glory but not by
adding to His perfect character nor to His almighty power. It adds to God's
acceptance, His praise, and His acclamation by His creatures
everywhere.
   We cannot afford to postpone our duty to some other time. Today is
our day of opportunity. Our Lord wants us to "grow in grace,"
progressively advancing in Christian love from day to day. Living con-
stantly in the peace and assurance of the righteousness of Christ that
justifies the repentant, trusting child of God, those who thus advance
will find at the end of the race a crown of glory "that fadeth not away."
   "To give God glory is to reveal His character in our own, and thus
make Him known. And in whatever way we make known the Father or the
Son, we glorify God."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 979.

                                                                           June 6
   Part 1     In the end time of the world, how is God's call of the ages stressed?
 CALL TO
FEAR GOD      "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, . . . saying with a
            loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him" (Rev. 14:6, 7).


               We have earlier defined the biblical significance of the expres-
            sion "fear God." All through the quarter we have attempted
            to cover the breadth of the expression "give glory to God." Now
            we are coming face-to-face with a people who are the remnant.
            They are called to receive messages from God and to give those
            same messages for God. Under the symbols of angels (messen-
            gers) they give the call to fear God. The call is for reverence, awe,
            submission, and obedience to God. This is associated with giving
            glory to Him. That includes praise, adoration, worship, reverence,
            approval, and acceptance. But if God's power and His character
            are at the heart of His glory, then to give Him glory calls for
            changed human lives. It calls for lives that give evidence of the
            working of His power in the heart and that reflect the likeness of
            His character.

             Is there any reason to doubt that God is looking for godly lives in
            His people in all ages? 2 Peter 1:3; Eccl. 12:13, 14.

               As God has had His true witnesses at every stage of human
            history, so in the climax of the ages, when the whole world is
            aligned with either Christ or Satan, He has a people on the earth to
            give the final invitation of mercy to the world and to demonstrate
            to the world the power of the grace and indwelling of Jesus Christ.
            The intensity of the final conflict is matched by the completeness
            of the consecration of the witnesses for Christ.

             In the light of 2 Peter 1:3, what knowledge far supersedes that
            which can be found in books?

              Men sometimes think that the salvation of society and of the
            world lies in the knowledge contained in books from human au-
            thors. To the extent that such books reflect the knowledge that
            comes from God, they can be a blessing. But wickedness does not
            thrive merely on ignorance. It works with knowledge that has been
            distorted. The father of lies can use big words or little, fine arts or
            cave markings. The Word of God is the only fountain of truth and
            the only channel for knowledge of God's salvation in Christ Jesus.

              Glory of the Remnant                                 11 Monday
                                                                       June 7
     Part 2     What is to be the outreach of God's final call for men to give Him
WORLDWIDE     glory?
      CALL
                "Having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on
              the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
              people" (Rev. 14:6).

                One other message, in earlier ages, was given a similar world-
              ranging commission. That was the gospel which Jesus gave to His
              apostles. (See Matt. 24:14.) It is scarcely surprising that the "gos-
              pel of the kingdom" and the "everlasting gospel" should have the
              same extensive commission.

                What is our only hope of fulfillment of God's plan that our lives
              should give glory to Him? Col. 1:27; Phil. 4:13.

                Anyone who boasts that he can in his own power live a life
              acceptable to God is sadly mistaken. Such a struggle is in vain and
              can be resolved only when in utter helplessness he cries out, "0
              wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
              death?" (Rom. 7:24). The answer to this most plaintive plea is near
              and clear—"through Jesus Christ our Lord."

                 How did the world of His day react to the exact image of God in the
              life of Jesus? John 7:7; 15:18.

                "Thirty years was all that the world could endure of its Re-
              deemer. For thirty years He dwelt in a world all seared and marred
              with sin, doing the work that no other one ever had done or ever
              could do."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-
              tary, vol. 5, p. 1131.

               How is the outward manner modified by the indwelling power of
              Christ? John 13:35.

                "If the heart is reformed, it will be seen in the outward appear-
              ance. If Christ be in us the hope of glory, we shall discover such
              matchless charms in Him that the soul will be enamored. It
              will cleave to Him, choose to love Him, and in admiration of Him,
              self will be forgotten. . . . Every truly converted soul will
              carry the unmistakable marks that the carnal mind is subdued."
              —Testimonies, vol. I, pp. 162, 163.
                How will we relate to others when Christ is formed within the
              heart? 1 John 3:14, 15.

    Part 3    What element in the call of the three angels gives urgency to their
JUDGMENT     messages?
     CALL
                "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment
             is come" (Rev. 14:7).
                 If it is always in order for sinners to fear God and give glory to
             Him, then it is especially so when the judgment hour is an-
             nounced. There seems to be some time for spiritual growth under
             this message of the judgment. Warnings are given. Actions are
             called for. Changes are made. Those who hear seem to become
             givers of the message. The result is a people answering to the
             character of the remnant of the seed of the woman. (See Rev.
             14:12; 12:17.)
               What is one of the keys to spiritual growth, and how does it relate
             to the glory of God? 2 Cor. 3:18.

               There is a clear connection suggested in this text between the
             glory of Christ and the reflected glory of Christ in the believer. It is
             evident also that the Holy Spirit is the divine agent in renewing,
             making holy, and effecting spiritual growth.
               Out of the great reservoir of God's grace He imputes to us
             righteousness for which we have not labored. Then we are to
             "grow in grace" (2 Peter 3:18), to enter into a union with God, the
             channel of which is deepened and widened with use so that we may
             receive more grace. Thus we may "grow up into him in all things"
             (Eph. 4:15).

               How are growth and life related in the Christian experience?
             (Consider 1 Peter 2:2.)

                "The follower of Jesus should be constantly improving in man-
             ners, in habits, in spirit, in labor. This is done by keeping the eye,
             not on mere outward, superficial attainments, but on Jesus."—
             Gospel Workers, p. 283.
                All the Bible writers hold up before the Christian a life of growth.
             Peter gave us the "addition" formula for spiritual attainment. (See
             2 Peter 1:6, 7.) Jude said that our Saviour is "able to keep you from
             falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory
             with exceeding joy" (Jude 24). John said, "Follow . . . that which
             is good. He that doeth good is of God" (3 John 11). And Jesus said
             that those who enter heaven will do "the will of my Father which is
             in heaven" (Matt. 7:21).

    Part 4     In what further way may the Father receive glory from His people,
FRUITAGE     including the remnant?
OF SAINTS
               "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye
             be my disciples" (John 15:8).
               "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
             commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12).

               "The best evidence that you are in Christ is the fruit you
             bear."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 348.

               What kind of fruit does the Master expect from us? (See Gal. 5:22,
             23.)

                "The fruit Christ claims, after the patient care bestowed upon
             His church, is faith, patience, love, forbearance, heavenly-
             mindedness, meekness. These are clusters of fruit which mature
             amid storm and cloud and darkness, as well as in the
             sunshine."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 117..
                We often think of fruitage only in terms of numbers of converts.
             This aspect of fruit-bearing is important, but it is not primary. As at
             Pentecost, God will add to the church "daily the ones being
             saved" (literal translation of Acts 2:47) when the rich fruitage of
             Christ's love is seen in the daily lives of His people.
                Before the "former rain" descended at Pentecost, the disciples
             made preparation of heart in Jerusalem. They put away differ-
             ences. They prayed earnestly. They were of one accord. This
             essential preparation is also needed before this earth shall be
             lightened with God's glory at the close of the gospel age.

               What kinds of fruitage in the lives of the saints are called for in
             Deuteronomy 14:29; 15:11; and James 1:27?

                "Prayers, exhortation, and talk are cheap fruits, which are
             frequently tied on; but fruits that are manifested in good works, in
             caring for the needy, the fatherless, and widows, are genuine
             fruits, and grow naturally upon a good tree."—Testimonies, vol.
             2, p. 24.
                Before the end of the gospel age, miracles will again be seen and
             a wide-ranging missionary activity will bring in great numbers of
             honest souls. The glory of the latter rain will greatly exceed that of
             the former.

               Consider what changes are needed in the church today if full
             fruitage is to be seen.

             Glory of the Remnant                                1 1 Thursday
                                                                      June 10

    Part 5     What aid is given the work of the three angels in completing the
LAST CALL    work of the gospel?

               "I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great
             power; and the earth was lightened with his glory" (Rev. 18:1).

               By the word delivered by this mighty angel messenger, we see
             his close tie to the work and messages of the three angels. The
             result of their combined efforts is the enlightening of the world
             with his glory. Since men are God's agents in the gospel mission, it
             can be understood that the remnant is involved both in receiving
             and in passing on the angel messages. The glory ascribed to the
             angel may be taken to describe his power and the fruitage of his
             work in the godly lives of the saints. The chief joy of loyal angels is
             to reflect the glory of God. This is the joy of the saints.

               What work once entrusted to ancient Israel remains to be com-
             pleted by those responding to God's last call? Isa. 60:1-3.

               Some people will confess God's goodness when it is too late,
             when repentance is past and the sun has set on the day of salvation;
             but many in the day of their stress and affliCtion will look to those
             who by their quiet and patient deportment have created a heavenly
             atmosphere on earth and will find salvation:

               What assurance can we find in the message of the other angel of
             Revelation 18 that God still has many, if not most, of His people in
             spiritual Babylon? (See Rev. 18:4.)

               "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with
             holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the
             message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth,
             the warning will be given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be
             healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers. Satan also
             works with lying wonders, even bringing down fire from heaven in
             the sight of men. Revelation 13:13. Thus the inhabitants of the
             earth will be brought to take their stand.
               "The message will be carried not so much by argument as by the
             deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been
             presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and
             bear fruit."—The Great Controversy, p. 612..

               Jesus said, "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the
             Son of man also confess before the angels of God" (Luke 12:8).

    Part 6     What promise made to the early church will undoubtedly be
  CROWN      fulfilled to the remnant also?
OF GLORY
               "When the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
             of glory that fadeth not away" (1 Peter 5:4).

                In ancient times the victor in a contest was often crowned with
             a wreath of olive leaves which quickly drooped and faded. (See
             2 Tim. 2:5.) Jesus, in His great victory, tasted "death for every
             man" and is "crowned with glory and honour" (Heb. 2:9). Those
             who follow in the steps of Jesus will also receive a "crown of glory
             that fadeth not away."
                Through the grace and power of Christ, Paul waged a successful
             "fight" and looked forward to receiving from "the Lord, the
             righteous judge" a crown of righteousness such as will be given not
             to one winner of the race only but to "all them also that love his
             appearing" (2 Tim. 4:8).

                How did Paul give glory to God rather than himself in the midst of
             all his trials? (See 2 Corinthians 11:24-28 for a list of the persecutions
             that Paul endured.)

              Yet he could say, "If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things
             which concern mine infirmities" (verse 30).

                How is the heavenly crown contrasted with the earthly? (See text
             of the day.)

               "You need not talk . . . of the honors of the world, or the praise
             of its great ones. They are all vanity. . . . I want the honor that is
             lasting, honor that is immortal, honor that will never perish; a
             crown that is richer than any crown that ever decked the brow of a
             monarch."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 362.

               With what words do the recipients of God's crown of life return to
             Him the glory of their triumph? Rev. 5:12-14.

               The applause that glorifies a great opera performance provides
             only a weak analogy for the climactic praise to God. A leading
             performer often beckons to the orchestra conductor, the players,
             and the composer who might be present to receive respective
             honors. In fact, as the applause thunders on and on, choir and
             orchestra may share in it.
               In the heavenly scene Jesus Christ is the worthy One. All glory
             goes to Him, the Victor, for it is by His grace alone that men have
             been gathered out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.

  "Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son
of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his
Father's, and of the holy angels" (Luke 9:26).



   As we near the close of the quarter, we are studying the climax of
the ages. We are on the verge of the great proclamation by our Lord for the
second time, "It is finished." The salvation sealed by Christ's death on
the cross will be sealed to the final converts as the Lord completes His
work of intercession in the heavenly sanctuary. He will then declare His
work fmished.
   Not one of the redeemed of all ages will be saying, "I will exalt myself!"
Each will be ascribing glory as praise to God alone, in tribute casting his
own crown—received by God's grace—at the feet of Jesus. Surely, that
day is upon us!
    Of all the glorious scenes pictured in the Bible, the second coming
of Christ ranks high. It is not just because of the brightness exhibited, the
 rainbow that encircles the throne, or the fire that issues forth to con-
sume all foreign elements that do not belong to God's glory. It is a much
 more personal matter. We shall look on the face of Him who loved us and
 who died in our behalf. The power and majesty of the Father's glory,
 the Son's glory, and the glory of the holy angels will all be made manifest at
 once. And then are introduced the saints in whose faces are reflected
 God's supreme glory—His character.
    In the 150 or so years since William Miller heard the irresistible
 call of God to preach the message of the second coming of Jesus, the
 final call of the gospel has been sounding to the world. In every land
 God has a people who in the last great burst of light will come out to join
 with those already called.
    To many the second coming of Jesus is a myth, a fable. But such have
 not heeded the words of Jesus. Let us then joyfully explore the glory
 that is yet to be revealed when Jesus appears the second time as the rightful
 King of the universe.
                                                                       83

     Part 1        What climactic event will usher in the kingdom of glory?
THRONE OF
HIS GLORY       "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
              angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory" (Matt.
              25:31).

                 The intercessory prayer ofJesus for His disciples was'that they
              may behold my glory" (John 17:24). They had seen Jesus in
              sandals and soiled garb, walking the dusty streets, touching the
              outcasts, talking to Samaritan "dogs," and welcoming small chil-
              dren to His embrace. Three of His disciples had received a preview
              of His kingdom of glory (see Luke 9:28-32). The topic of conversa-
              tion between Christ and the messengers from heaven at that time
              was "his decease" (literally, "exodus")—not a very glorious
              thought for those who longed for earthly glory. (How much the
              disciples heard in their drowsiness we may not know. But they
              "saw his glory.")
                 In order to negate the glory seen on the mount, the devil put on
              his best act, challenging Jesus to a duel. (See Luke 9:37-42.) Satan
              will also try to stage a challenge to Christ's second coining. (See
              Rev. 13:13.) But the devil cannot assume Christ's glory nor fulfill
              His promises, and God's children need not be deceived.

                The earthly sanctuary-temple was a miniature representation of
              heavenly glories. In the time of ancient Israel, where was the glory of
              God manifested? Ex. 40:34-38; Lev. 16:2.

                In the ancient sanctuary, the Shekinah glory of God rested
              above the ark of the covenant, where justice and mercy met.
              (See S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 903.)

                What will happen to the wicked when Christ returns in great
              glory? (Compare 2 Thess. 2:8; Deut. 4:24; Rev. 6:12-17.)

                "The light of the glory of God, which imparts life to the righ-
              teous, will slay the wicked."—The Desire of Ages, p. 108.

                 Why should the throne of Christ's glory be associated with de-
              structive effects upon the world?

                 On the basis that a prime definition of God's glory is His charac-
              ter, then Christ's throne of glory derives its majesty and power
              from that same pure and holy character. Therefore the presence of
              our God is a consuming presence to anything that is out of har-
              mony with His character. The consuming power is inevitable
              rather than arbitrary.

     Part 2     What indicates that when Christ returns to earth the second time
RIGHTEOUS     the redemptive activity in regard to sin is completed?
   PEOPLE
                "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them
              that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto
              salvation" (Heb. 9:28). (See also verses 23-27.)

                 When Jesus died on Calvary, He was laden with the sins of
              humanity. The cross was for the punishment of the worst of
              criminals. While Jesus did no sin and bore no sin of His own, He
              assumed the greatest load of sin ever to be carried. His was a
              once-only and all-sufficient sacrifice. Now is our day of opportu-
              nity for accepting Him and of being accepted by Him.
                 The sealed people of God are described as clothed in white, and
              they have palms in their hands, symbolizing victory. The robes are
              provided to the Laodiceans who open the heart door to the
              Heavenly Merchantman. He then makes that heart His dwelling
              place so that His life becomes the life of the believer. His will
              becomes supreme. (See Rev. 3:14-22 and Christ's Object Lessons,
              p. 312.) There is a resulting fellowship with Christ ("I will come
              into him, and will sup with him, and he with me") that can only
              bring the open-door heart into more and more harmony with
              Christ. "The heavenly intelligences will work with the human
              agent who seeks with determined faith that perfection of character
              which will reach out to perfection in action. To every one engaged
               in this work Christ says, I am at your right hand to help you."
               —Christ's Object Lessons, p. 332.
                In the parable of the king's feast, what place is there for an
              investigation of the guests? Matt. 22:9-11.

                 "Ver. 11.—The king came in to see the guests, who by this time
              had taken their appointed places at table. This second portion of
              the parable teaches that admission to the visible Church is not all
              that is required; there is also a scrutiny to be undergone and an
              award to be made. And that this investigation is keen and search-
              ing is denoted by the verb used . . . , which means not merely, to
              see casually, but to gaze upon with the intent of seeing the real
              nature and character of an object. The king makes his appearance
              in the banqueting-hall, not to feast with the guests, but to welcome
              them, and to examine if they are properly ordered, served, and
              fitted for the high honour accorded to them."—The Pulpit Com-
              mentary, vol. 15, p. 358.

                 Why is it essential that the sin question shall have been resolved by
               the time Christ returns? (See Heb. 12:18-29.)

   Part 3    What evidence did Jesus present to His disciples to show that His
  CHRIST resurrected body was real?
GLORIFIED
            "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and
          see; for a spirit bath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when
          he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet" (Luke
          24:39, 40).

              How would you react if you were approached by one whom you
            had seen crucified, stabbed with a spear, and laid in the grave?
              The body of Jesus was real, not imaginary, yet it was obviously
            not altogether subject to natural forces. Jesus offered tangible
            evidence of His personhood and human attributes, albeit glorified.

               In view of the impact upon Roman soldiers of one angel from
            glory, how will it be when Christ returns in the glory of His Father, in
            His own glory, and the glory of the unnumbered hosts of angels?
            Matt. 28:2-4.

              "When He [Christ] shall come to the earth again, He will shake
            `not the earth only, but also heaven.' The earth shall reel to and
            fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.' The
            heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll;' the elements shall
            melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
            shall be burned up.' But 'the Lord will be the hope of His people,
            and the strength of the children of Israel.' Heb. 12:26; Isa. 24:20;
            34:4; 2 Peter 3:10; Joel 3:16."—The Desire of Ages, p. 780.

              According to Paul, what is the relationship of the resurrection of
            the glorified Lord to our hope of eternal life? 1 Cor. 15:12-18.

               Qur pledge of eternal life is in the resurrection of Jesus. Because
            of Him we have "a lively hope" (1 Peter 1:3)—a hope not only of
            standing once again upon the earth but of being honored and
            glorified. The faithful will be "found unto praise and honour and
            glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 1:7). The resurrec-
            tion of all sleeping saints is one of the glories of the second advent.

              What factors troubled the early church over promises of the
            second advent?

              myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my
              reins be consumed within me" (Job 19:25-27).

                In spite of the difficulties in the translation of this text (some
              versions giving "without my flesh" for example), it is still seen
              that Job expressed a firm trust in the resurrection of the righteous.
              "In my flesh" stresses the reality of the resurrection. "Without
              my flesh" may suggest the resurrected body. (Compare 1 Cor.
              15:36-50.) Job stated this belief before the time of the Exodus and
              the giving of the law.
                Abraham also showed remarkable faith when, ready to offer
              Isaac, he said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb" (Gen.
              22:8). He then took the knife to slay his son. But God intervened.
              Isaac became a figure of Christ, a willing sacrifice.

                According to the New Testament faith chapter, how could Abra-
              ham reconcile the promise of a great nation through Isaac with the
              divine command to offer his son as a sacrifice? (See Heb. 11:17-19.)

                From this evidence of a remarkable Old Testament understand-
              ing and expectation of the resurrection, we can move to Paul's
              classical resurrection chapter in 1 Corinthians 15. Here Paul
              makes his unique contribution to the message of a risen Saviour,
              the resurrected Christ, the "first fruits" of all the saints to be
              resurrected to share in the glory of the second coming of Jesus
              Christ. (See verses 20-23.)

                 To what degree will we know each other as resurrected saints?

                 "The resurrection of Jesus was a type of the final resurrection of
              all who sleep in Him. The countenance of the risen Saviour, His
              manner, His speech, were all familiar to His disciples. As Jesus
              arose form the dead, so those who sleep in Him are to rise again.
              . . . In the glorified body their identity will be perfectly
              preserved."—The Desire of Ages, p. 804.

     Part 5 What kind of people are permitted to partake of the divine wed-
READY FOR ding feast?
THE BRIDE-
   GROOM     "While they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
            ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut"
            (Matt. 25:10).

               What a glorious privilege to be admitted by the heavenly Bride-
            groom to His wedding supper!
               In the parable, all who await the bridegroom's arrival have
            lamps representing a source of light and a symbol of rejoicing. All
            the lamps have oil, generally a symbol of the Holy Spirit, by whom
            the righteousness of Christ's character is brought into the life. (See
            Zech. 4:6.) Some of the guests have brought oil in reserve so as to
            be prepared for any emergency. Others, perhaps carelessly, have
            forgotten this precaution.
               Time passes, and the bridegroom is delayed. Lamps begin to
            flicker and then go out. In desperation the five neglectful girls try
            to barter for oil.
               "That oil is the righteousness of Christ. It represents character,
            and character is not transferable. No man can secure it for another.
            Each must obtain for himself a character purified from every stain
            of sin."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 234.

               What essential factor did the neglectful ones lack? Matt. 25:8.

               The neglectful ones had the same source of light as the others
            and had doubtless at some time enjoyed communion with the Holy
            Spirit. But they had never made a complete surrender of their
            lives to Christ for the indwelling of the Spirit—they lacked a
            preparation for a time of stress.
               "The Spirit works upon man's heart, according to his desire and
            consent, implanting in him a new nature; but the class represented
            by the foolish virgins have been content with a superficial
            work."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 411.
               "Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
            the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall
            be seen upon thee" (Isa. 60:2). This glory is what the world needs
            to see. Christ's coming exhibits His own glory, the Father's, and
            that of the angels. What is missing? The glory of those who should
            have heeded Jesus' words, "Ye are the light of the world" (Matt.
            5:14).

              "We as a people profess to have truth in advance of every other
            people upon the earth. Then our life and character should be in
            harmony with such a faith."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 100.

   Part 6    Although we rightly tend to link heaven with the future, where and
 HEAVEN     when does heaven begin?
AT LAST!
              "Ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the
            earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
            possession, unto the praise of his glory" (Eph. 1:13, 14).

               We do not negate the existence of a place called heaven when we
            say that heaven begins on earth, here and now. But the Holy Spirit
            "is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance" (NIV) until we actu-
            ally receive it.
               "When the Lord's people are filled with meekness and tender-
            ness, they will realize that His banner over them is love, and His
            fruit will be sweet to their taste. They will make a heaven below in
            which to prepare for heaven above. . . .

            "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
            not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
            glory" (1 Peter 1:8).
               "Now is the day of salvation" (2 Cor. 6:2). It is here that a noble
            character is to be formed as a result of the work of grace in the
            heart. Should this not be our primary interest in life?

              What Part may church attendance have in this preparatory work?
            (See Mal. 3:16; Heb. 10:25.)

              In our critical, skeptical age, it is harder for us to believe that
            wholehearted participation in the services of the church is a key
            agency for the preparation of a people for the glorious worship of
            the kingdom of heaven. But it is so.

              How much can our finite minds understand about the glories of
            heaven?

               "In thinking. of heaven, we may put our imagination to the
            utmost stretch and think the loftiest thoughts that we are capable
            of thinking, and our minds will grow weary in the effort to com-
            prehend the breadth and depth and height of the subject. It is
            impossible for our minds to take in the great themes of eternity. It
            is impossible for us even to make an effort to understand these
            things without the effort affecting our whole character for good
            and having an uplifting influence on our minds."—Ellen G. White,

Triumph in Glory
  "We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and
wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power,
and hast reigned" (Rev. 11:17).



   Not by accident do the three angels' messages include the exhor-
tation, "Give glory to him [God]; for the hour of his judgment is come"
(Rev. 14:7).
   In the absolute sense, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
provide God all the vindication He could ever need. Yet in a sense, God
has put Himself on trial in His people, and our judgment is His
judgment. As a part of the fmal showdown of earth's drama, His people are
to be an honor to God and to demonstrate the vindication of His
character and government particularly in the creation of earth and man.
Like Job of old, they are to show to the world that God's plan really
works and that in the midst of the most difficult circumstances of life
and in the face of death itself they choose to stand on God's side.
   God is honored not only by His people, as though a billion voices
might shout down the opposition, but He is also honored in His people,
even in the little things of life. Not that the amassing of good works in
themselves is so impressive, nor would it build merit for salvation.
But Jesus did say, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye
have love one to another" (John 13:35).
   Paul makes a strong case for the fact that the promise to Abraham
was "not to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed, which is
Christ" (Gal. 3:16). When the cross of Christ takes first place in our
hearts, this promise becomes meaningful to us. Moreover, He not only
gives us life—He is our life. (See Col. 3:4; 1 John 5:11.) We still have our
individuality and our will, but the will is merged with Christ's will in a
mysterious blend of the human and the divine. Here, by the Spirit, is
fulfilled Jesus' prayer: "That they also may be one in us: that the
world may believe that thou hast sent me" (John 17:21).
   Though earthly glory should fail, "The Lord is in his holy temple"
(verse 20), and all will come out right. Marvel of God's grace, he who
has chosen to humble himself will be exalted! (See Luke 4:11 and Phil.
2:8, 9.)

             Triumph in Glory                                      1 3 Sunday
                                                                          June 20

    Part 1     Is there any biblical basis for the idea that God is in some respects
    GOD'S    under judgment?
JUDGMENT
                Repeatedly throughout the Scriptures God is presented as the
             Judge of all things and every sinner. Only in an indirect way and in
             a particular sense is God the object of evaluation.
                The primary salvo of charges made by Satan on earth against
             Adam and Eve was really aimed at God. "Yea, hath God said, Ye
             shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" (Gen. 3:1). While it is
             true that man is on trial for his response to God's love, there is a
             way in which God is on trial. His character must be seen for what it
             has always been, a reconciling of justice and mercy. The battle-
             ground of the ages is the human heart and the human will.
                "In the day of final judgment, every lost soul will understand the
             nature of his own rejection of truth. The cross will be presented,
             and its real bearing will be seen by every mind that has been
             blinded by transgression. Before the vision of Calvary with its
             mysterious Victim, sinners will stand condemned. Every lying
             excuse will be swept away. Human apostasy will appear in its
              heinous character. Men will see what their choice has been. Every
             question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy will
             then have been made plain. In the judgment of the universe, God
             will stand clear of blame for the existence or continuance of evil. It
             will be demonstrated that the divine decrees are not accessory to
              sin. There was no defect in God's government, no cause for
              disaffection. When the thoughts of all hearts shall be revealed,
              both the loyal and the rebellious will unite in declaring, 'Just and
              true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints. Who shall not fear Thee, 0
              Lord, and glorify Thy name? . . . for Thy judgments are made
              manifest.' " Rev. 15:3, 4."—The Desire of Ages, p. 58.

               To what extent has God's plan changed because of Satan's seem-
             ing success with man? (See Gen. 3:15 and John 17:4, 5, 10, 16,
             20-26.)

                God's plan has primarily been delayed. This was to provide the
             time for man and the universe to be given evidence that God is
             indeed love. This evidence was given in a thousand ways. It was
             symbolized throughout the- era of animal sacrifices. It was
             climaxed in Calvary. The security of the triumph in glory has been
             established.

                Consider how fully God's character will be vindicated. (See Phil.
              2:10 and The Great Controversy, p. 670.)

         Part 2     "To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be
   "JUST, AND     just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (Rom. 3:26).
THE JUSTIFIER"
                     The words "at this time" refer contextually to the time of Paul.
                  By his day the completeness of the sacrifice of Christ for the sins of
                  the whole world had been demonstrated. All that was promised in
                  the sacrifices of the Old Testament was and is fulfilled in the Christ
                  of the New.
                     Paul did declare the judgment-hour message, and he enunciated
                  the problem succinctly: how God might justly and rightfully count
                  a people righteous who are anything but righteous. If that message
                  was important in Paul's time, how much more so today when
                  God's character is openly scorned and when the sins of Sodom and
                  Gomorrah might not even make headlines.
                    What is Satan's tactic now in view of the shortness of time? (See
                  Rev. 12:12-17; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 1 Peter 5:8.)

                    Satan is interested in multiplying iniquity, thus making it harder
                  for God to be regarded as just in forgiving sins. And the longer the
                  evil trend of our times continues, the more people will be con-
                  vinced of Satan's lies. We must tell the world that while justice
                  seems to have been delayed, righteousness will prevail. Our re-
                  deemed lives will reveal that Christ within leads us to love righ-
                  teousness and hate iniquity.

                   What symbol has God given to remind us of His mercy and justice?
                  Gen. 9:12-17; Rev. 4:3.

                    "As the bow in the cloud is formed by the union of the sunlight
                  and the shower, so the rainbow encircling the throne represented
                  the combined power of mercy and justice. It is not justice alone
                  that is to be maintained; for this would eclipse the glory of the
                  rainbow of promise above the throne; man would see only the
                  penalty of the law. . . . It is the mingling of judgment and mercy that
                  makes salvation complete."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                  Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1133.

                    How did Jesus satisfy justice and make mercy possible? (See Isa.
                  53:4-11; Rom. 5:8-21.)

                    "Justice demands that sin be not merely pardoned, but the death
                  penalty must be executed. God, in the gift of His only-begotten
                  Son, met both these requirements. By dying in man's stead, Christ
                  exhausted the penalty and provided a pardon."—Selected Mes-

    Part 3 On what grounds can sinners "rejoice in hope of the glory of God"
ADOPTION (Rom. 5:2)?
 AS SONS
              "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
            made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
            under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" (Gal. 4:4,
            5.)

               When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, He told them to say,
            "Our Father." (Note the importance of the word our.) Then, after
            His resurrection, just before He ascended, He reinforced this
            thought, saying, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and
            to my God, and your God" (John 20:17). In such plain words Jesus
            declared our adoption into the family of God.
               When we are adopted, we are placed in sonship (daughters are
            likewise adopted). We are elevated to the position of sonship, and
            we are fitted to the condition of sonship. We may be sure that God
            has reasons for adopting people. Reasons used by God are not
            always, if ever, fully apparent to us; but this is an area which we
            may investigate in a better, unclouded atmosphere.
               John, the last living apostle, in contemplating the reasons behind
            man's elevation, could only exclaim, "Behold, what manner of
            love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called
            the sons of God" (1 John 3:1). But, as John continues, he tells us of
            our obligation to purify ourselves, "even as he [Jesus] is pure"
            (verse 3).

              By what means can the life and soul of a sinner be purified? (See
            1 John 3:5, 6; Heb. 9:13-15.)

                The plan of salvation, in order to bring glory to God, must make
             full and final disposition of sin. It must provide forgiveness and
             restoration, adoption, tutoring, acceptance, and transformation.
             Those who are redeemed by their looking at the cross in faith and
             repentance cannot but plead for the power of the cross to purge
             and purify the soul from indwelling sin. They plead with the
             heavenly Intercessor for the indwelling of His Holy Spirit with
             transforming power. Yet they never cease to acclaim Christ as the
             sole provider of their salvation. They recognize continually that
             their best—in worship, in penitence, in obedience, in sacrifice—is
             only acceptable to God through the unfailing merits of Jesus their
             Lord. (See Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 344.)

               How are righteousness by faith and performance of duty related?

             Triumph in Glory                                  1   3 Wednesday
                                                                          June 23

    Part 4     What will be one aspect of the joy of the redeemed when they enter
GOD IN HIS   with Christ into His glory?
  PEOPLE
                "To make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which
             from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created
             all things by Jesus Christ" (Eph. 3:9).

                The fellowship to which Paul refers is communion between God
             and man in the closest of all relationships—God in man. "To
             whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of
             this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope
             of glory" (Col. 1:27). Paul then states the final goal, "that we may
             present every man perfect in Christ Jesus" (verse 28).
               Before the end of time the world will behold a people saved by
             God's grace and ascribing glory to Him by their unselfish lives. Do
             we see this phenomenon at present? Occasionally. But why the
             mad scramble, even among church members, to attain a different
             kind of glory, based on wealth and status, as if by these we are to
             impress the world?

                  What is the spirit of a dedicated Christian? (See Phil. 1:21.)

                "When the apostle Paul, through the revelation of Christ, was
             converted from a persecutor to a Christian, he declared that he was
             as one born out of due time. Henceforward Christ was all and in all
             to him. Tor me to live is Christ,' he declared. This is the most
             perfect interpretation in a few words, in all the Scriptures, of what
             it means to be a Christian. . . . [Paul's} words show that his mind
             was centered in Christ, that his whole life was bound up with his
             Lord. Christ was the author, the support, and the source of his
             life."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
             vol. 7, p. 903. (Emphasis supplied.)

               What did Paul see as the basis for a sinner to have hope that he
             would one day dwell in glory, and reveal the glory of Christ's
             character in the meantime? (See Col. 1:27.)

                "Through the power of Christ, men and women have broken the
             chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The pro-
             fane have become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate
             pure. Souls that have borne the likeness of Satan have become
             transformed into the image of God. This change is in itself the
             miracle of miracles. A change wrought by the Word, it is one of the
             deepest mysteries of the Word."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
             476.

                                                                          June 24

      Part 5     What trophies will God display in eternity?
)'S RICHES
IIS PEOPLE       "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
               grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus" (Eph. 2:7).

                  In the earthly life of Jesus one great impulse urged Him forward
               to victory: the joy of seeing souls saved eternally. This, in part, is
               the satisfaction that He will receive for the "travail of his soul."
                  "Ever before Him, Christ saw the results of His mission. His
               earthly life, so full of toil and self-sacrifice, was cheered by the
               thought that He would not have all this travail for naught. By
               giving His life for the life of men, He would restore in humanity the
               image of God. He would lift us up from the dust, reshape the
               character after the pattern of His own character, and make it
               beautiful with His own glory."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 504.

                  What will provide Christ with His deepest satisfaction throughout
               eternity for the sacrifice which divine love undertook in the incarna-
               tion? (See Isa. 53:10, 11.)

                  We shall never know how much joy Christ will have in seeing the
               redeemed. We can never know just how much it cost Him and the
               Godhead to provide redemption. The one statement explains the
               other. The tragedy is that God's treasure—His redeemed—sets
               such a low estimate upon itself. It does not believe what God wants
               to do or what He can do in its behalf. All Heaven was invested in
               the saving of God's treasure. But Heaven will yet see such fruits in
               the redeemed as to feel amply repaid. The investment will bring
               compound interest and more for eternity. There is no way to
               compute the value!
                  We often glory over the seeming successes of our blood brothers
               and sisters. So our true love for Jesus, our Elder Brother, will find
               joy in extolling Him, both here and in eternity. He, on His part,
               regards us as His trophies. He will display us to those who have
                never fallen. We will be trophies of His grace.
                  We may all hear Jesus say, "Come, ye blessed of my Father,
                inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
               world" (Matt. 25:34).

                  In order to be a part of God's eternal riches, what am I willing to
                do with the control of my will today?

                  "As the will of man co-operates with the will of God, it becomes
                omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command may be
                accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are enablings."—

               Triumph in Glory                                         1 3 Friday
                                                                             June 25

      Part 6        What must precede a full and final display of God's glory?
WORLD FULL
  OF GLORY       "Behold, is it not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labour
               in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very
               vanity? For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of
               the Lord, as the waters cover the sea" (Hab. 2:13, 14).

                  We are living at a time when many "people . . . weary them-
               selves for very vanity." Many of us are old enough to remember
               when life seemed to move at a measured pace, when one income
               was sufficient for one family and when people had time and inclina-
               tion to visit their friends. People would attend church on Sabbath
               morning and visit the sick and the needy in the afternoon and also
               during the week.
                  "He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he
               that loveth abundance with increase: this also is vanity" (Eccl.
               5:10).

                 What message can be preached that will promote the glory of the
               Lord? (See Rev. 18:1-4.)

                  "The time of test is just upon us, for the loud cry of the third
               angel has already begun in the revelation of the righteousness of
               Christ, the sin-pardoning Redeemer. This is the beginning of the
               light of the angel whose glory shall fill the whole earth."—Ellen G.
               White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 984.

                 We have studied many aspects of the glory of God during this
               quarter. What will be the peak of this present world's reflection of
               glory upon the Father? (See Phil. 2:10, 11.)

                 In the process of bringing every knee to bow at the name of
               Jesus—both those who love Him and those who hate Him—God
               will have brought "many sons to glory" (Heb. 2:10, NIV). As a
               result, the original family plan of Eden will be fully restored and
               even exceeded. Jesus, the eternal Son of God, will call us His
               brothers and sisters. And it will be more than a gesture, more than
               a name.
                 He who made us holy and we who shall have been made holy will
               be of the same family, to the glory of God the Father. May God
               hasten that day! (See Heb. 2:10-13.)

                    Will I make God's glory the supreme goal of my life?
