Adult Sabbath School Lessons
What are you doing for the millions of children wandering in the maze that Satan pro-
vides for their feet? "We may bring hundreds and thousands of children to Christ if we will
work for them." CT, p. 172. Just imagine a worldwide Vacation Bible School evangelistic
campaign conducted by every Sabbath School. What a harvest for the Holy Spirit to reap!
What a passport into the community, reaching the parents through the children.

Dear Sabbath School Members:

 New workers' homes, additional classroom space, and the extension of hospital
 facilities all testify to growth. New members mean more educational facili-
 ties and extra classroom space. The extension of the church's witness
 demands the spread of the health message. Small health-care institutions
 begun in faith and housed in temporary quarters, need permanent buildings.

 Through the years you have been supporting the work in Southern Asia through
 your Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects Offering. We thank you for your
 interest in our growth and the demonstration of your support by your faithful
 and generous contributions in the past. This quarter we present our needs
 for expansion and consolidation of our witness in the countries of this
 Division. Your offering this Thirteenth Sabbath will help us:

         1.       Provide homes for workers at the Lakpahana Adventist
                  Seminary and College in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka.

         2.       Build new classrooms for the E. D. Thomas Memorial High
                  School in South India.

         3.       Construct a new hospital building for the Ruby Nelson
                  Memorial Hospital in Jullundur, north India.

 As you think especially of Southern Asia this quarter may we request that
 you remember us regularly in your prayers. We are facing many difficult
 problems and the assurance of your prayers on our behalf will be a source
 of strength to us. Thank you.

 Yours sincerely,




 G. J. Christo
 President

Law9 Ilaws9 End lAge
  Christianity is more than a system of rituals or mere outward conformity to a
set of rules. Christianity, in practice, is a new relationship between a sinful
person and the God.who created and sustains him. Jesus Christ is the direct link
between God and man, by His incarnation. He also became the Substitute
and Surety (Pledge, Guarantee) for the sinful race.
   Sinful men may enter a new-covenant relationship with God by faith in the
Substitute and by continual cooperation with the Surety. Christ takes our sins
and gives us His righteousness. We receive it in two ways. In Him we are
accounted righteous and remain so as long as we maintain our absolute depen-
dence upon Him and His merits. He also enters into a living relationship with us
whereby the Holy Spirit brings about a new-birth experience in our hearts and
minds and writes the laws of God, as the inward law, upon the fleshy tables of our
hearts. (See Heb. 10:16.) From and by this inward law all of life is shaped for the
believer. He wills to work out what God puts within.
   In our lessons of this quarter we will concentrate upon the inward law and its
outworking in our individual lives. But it is vital that we recognize throughout
this study that the outworking of the inward law does nothing toward earning our
salvation. There is no question of deserving salvation.
  Our acceptance with God is already secure in Jesus Christ. "Ye are complete
in Him" (Col. 2:10). What the Father thinks of Christ makes us acceptable, in
Him, to God. Let us remember that this law is implanted in the heart by God
when we accept "Jesus only" as our righteousness. By the power of the Holy
Spirit, bringing resurrection power into our lives—the same power within Him-
self by which Jesus rose from the dead—the inward law becomes the motivation
and the direction of our lives. In essence it is the implanting of the Ten Com-
mandments in the wellsprings of our thoughts and actions.
   That Ten Commandment law is the expression of the character of God in
human terms fitting our human situation. Hence it is the law of love, for God is
love. This law of love is likewise the law of life—the life of God in us. So we blend
the three elements in the title of the lessons of this quarter—Law, Love, and
Life. Our Saviour becomes the pledge of the fulfillment of all three in our
standing with God and in our daily experience with God and man.
   Basic to human nature and universal in its application is God's law of love,
which transcends all cultures, customs, socioeconomic classes, ages, races,
nationalities, time, and geographical locations. It makes Christianity a religion,
not of the East or of the West, but of the whole world. A believer from any nation
does have to accept Jesus Christ as his Saviour and open his heart to the Holy
Spirit.
   From the individual and human viewpoint there can be no objective values
despite the claims of moral philosophers. At a time when "there was no king in
Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25), and
still he does today. But if the standard of goodness is given by God, who is
absolutely objective, then the establishment of a universally objective law is not
only possible but sure.
   Man's law is enforced by government officers. Sentence passed on the con-
victed is frequently based upon incomplete evidence. But God's law is enforced
by (1) man's own conscience, (2) by God's direct, redeeming intervention, and
(3) by natural events following the laws of cause and effect. Man's law can only
deter crime, but God's law inspires virtue. In God's court there is perfect justice.
Here the attorney-at-law would have no advantage over the accused, for each is
convicted by his conscience and judged by his own inward law enlightened by
the law of love and grace. Before God's perfect law all are condemned. Only an
Omnipresent and Omniscient God qualifies as the judge, for He alone can
discern the true motive of each action.

                                                                            5

   "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it
is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily
angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always
hopes, always perseveres" (1 Cor. 13:4-7, NIV).

   Love is not merely an emotion; it is also a principle. We find meaning
in life because we know somebody loves us. We do good because we
love. Yet we are all sinful, and we are all selfish. When the love of
self becomes dominant, we forget the welfare of others. One may become
so blind to the needs of others that he pursues his own goal regardless of
whether it causes pain or even death to others. If everyone on earth
were to become extremely selfish and exceedingly ruthless in pursuing
his own goal, there could be no law or law enforcement on earth.
Violence would rule.
   There is no darkness in light; so there is no selfishness in love. The
Bible tells us that there is no boastfulness, hypocrisy, jealousy, envy,
pride, rudeness, irritability, grudges, or failure in love. (See 1 Corinthians
13.)
   Divine love does not change, and it endures forever. Love involves
faith, and it also involves hope. Only to and for persons we love can we
show faith and have hope. We must thank God because He sees in us
something capable of responding to His grace.
   In loving unresponsive sinners, God must love us exceedingly. In
order to continue to love, He must also have great faith and great hope in
us. Only when we turn around to look with faith into the face of
Christ—the Christ on the cross—will our hearts be touched by this
matchless love and will we surrender ourselves unconditionally at the
foot of the cross.
   The summary of God's law is love. God is prepared to write His love in
our hearts as the inward law. He has even promised to take away our
stony hearts that are not capable of responding to His love and by His
miracle to give us hearts of flesh that we may respond to His love with
love. When this takes place, then we may learn to love others as He
does.

          Love—The Supreme Motive                                  1   Sunday
                                                                December 27

 Part 1     Since love is difficult to define, how would you describe it?
  What
Love Is     "Love is patient, love is kind."
            "Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always
          protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres" (1 Cor.
          13:4, 6, 7, NIV).

            In the above verses we are told that love is the combination of (1)
          patience, (2) kindness, (3) truthfulness, (4) faith, and (5) hope.
          Love without patience is not enduring love. Love cannot be felt if
          not expressed in kindness. Love rejoices not at wrong, but in truth.
          Love without faith results in suspicion and jealousy. And love
          without hope could bring about tragedy and even death. Love
          must involve all these factors put together, all at once.
            Love is something which all of us have experienced but none of
          us fully understands. We cannot live without love. Our lives are
          sustained by a net of love. Yet sinful men are selfish and full of
          hatred—which is the opposite of love. It may be easier to describe
          what love is not rather than what love is, because we see more
          selfishness and hatred around us than we see love.

            How did Jesus and the apostles John and Paul indicate love's
          relationship to God? John 3:16; Rom. 5:6-8; 1 John 4:8.

             Love is centered on another. Love is giving a part of self to
          another, sharing something with him. But the greatest love is that
          seen in the life of Christ, who made the supreme sacrifice for
          sinners even before they knew Him, even when they hated Him.
          Such love does not originate on this earth; it is divine.
             "When love fills the heart, it will flow out to others, not because
          of favors received from them, but because love is the principle of
          action. Love modifies the character, governs the impulses, sub-
          dues enmity, and ennobles the affections. This love is as broad as
          the universe, and is in harmony with that of the angel workers. "—
          Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 38.
             "Love's agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine.
          The soft answer that `turneth away wrath,' the love that suffereth
          long, and is kind,' the charity that `covereth a multitude of sins'
          (Proverbs 15:1; 1 Corinthians 13:4, RV; 1 Peter 4:8, RV)—would
           we learn the lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be
          gifted! How life would be transformed, and the earth become a
           very likeness and foretaste of heaven!"—Education, p. 114.

             What would one do if he truly loves God? (See 1 John 3:16-18.)

            Love—The Supreme Motive                                   1 Monday
                                                                    December 28

   Part 2       What are some of the attributes that are the opposite of love?
What Love
   Is Not     "Love . . . does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not
            rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record
            of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil" (1 Cor. 13:4-6, NIV).

               In these verses the Bible lists what love is not: (1) envy, (2)
            boastfulness, (3) arrogance and rudeness, (4) self-seeking, (5) ir-
            ritability, (6) resentfulness, and (7) smugness over wrong in others.
            These are all negative factors harmful to one's personality and to
            human relations.

             What are some additional contrasts to the characteristics of love?
            Rom. 1:28-32; Gal. 5:19-21.

               When a Christian reveals jealousy of others and is not tolerant of
            their failings, he brings a bad name upon the Christian way. We do
            not win others by bluntly telling them of their weaknesses or
            condemning their wrong actions. If we have the love that is long-
            suffering and kind, we will have a tender spirit, a gentle and
            winning way that will save and build.
               In showing love, we do not need to give up our individual ways
            that make us a person. Unity in diversity is the real possibility and
            the ideal of those who come together in Christ. We do not want a
            community of all Peters or all Mary Magdalenes. The variety of
            personalities is a strength to the church. All do not see things just
            alike and should not be pressured into doing so. But where the love
            of Jesus is, there will be a basic harmony, sympathy, and respect
            one for the other. It will be understood that all need support in their
            various trials and experiences. (See Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 65,
            66.)
               True love is not sentimentalism; it does not end in tragedy or
            suicide. True love is not a selfish, lustful feeling which disappears
            in a short while; it endures changes of time and circumstances.
            Love is a principle; it does not change. Love means sharing,
            giving, and sacrificing. A mother's love is great. Woman's love is
            deep; a friend's love, like Jonathan's toward David, may be deeply
            moving; but only God's love is everlasting and more wonderful
            than anything we experience and understand now.

              God is love. We believe in God because we are attracted to Him by
            His love. But how much (or how little) do we love God?

             Love—The Supreme Motive                               1 Tuesday
                                                                 December 29

    Part 3     Without love as a motive, how "good" are good deeds?
ien There
3 No Love      "If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but have not love, I
             am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of
             prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I
             have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am
             nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to
             the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing"(1 Cor. 13:1-3, NIV).

               Speaking with the tongues of men and angels, having the gift of
             prophecy, understanding all mysteries and all knowledge, and
             giving everything to the poor—all these are apparently good; how-
             ever, they are not truly good if the motive behind them is selfish.
             Love must be the purpose, the method, and the motive for all good
             work. Only love can keep one doing good regardless of what others
             feel and do. To help, to serve, to donate for fame or for fun cannot
             be sustained for long. Love and love alone endures forever.
              Note how tender were the words of Jesus to His beloved but
             wayward disciples just before Gethsemane. John 13:33-35.

               "This term of endearment [little children], nowhere else used in
             the Gospels, and once only employed by Paul (Gal. 4:19), is
             appropriated by the beloved disciple himself, who no fewer than
             seven times employs it in his first Epistle. Ye shall seek me—feel
             the want of Me. . . . 34. A new commandment I give unto you, That
             ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one
             another—This was the new feature of it. Christ's love to His people
             in giving His life a ransom for them was altogether new, and
             consequently as a Model and Standard for theirs to one another: It
             is not, however, something transcending the great moral law,
             which is 'the old commandment' (1 John 2:7 . . .), but that law in a
             new and peculiar form. Hence it is said to be both new and old
             (1 John 2:7, 8). 35. By this shall all men know that ye are my
             disciples—the disciples of Him who laid down His life for those He
             loved. If ye have love one to another—for My sake, and as one in
             Me; for to such love men outside the circle of believers know right
             well they are entire strangers. Alas, how little of it there is even
             within this circle!"—Jamieson, Fausset, Brown, Commentary on
             the Whole Bible (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing
              House, 1964), pp. 1059, 1060.
                One of the greatest evidences that the love of heaven is in our
              hearts is found in our growing ability to listen,to others.

               What kind of world would it be if love totally disappeared from
             human hearts?

  True Love
Is Timeless      "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease;
               where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowl-
               edge, it will pass away" (1 Cor. 13:8, NIV).

                  The Revised Standard Version translates this verse as follows:
                  "Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for
               tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away."
                  These versions focus on the time element in this verse. Nothing
               in this world can be called everlasting. Almost all things last but a
               short while and then pass away. Empires, pyramids, great walls,
               skyscrapers, things made or established by human hands will pass
               away. Heroes, kings, scholars will also pass away and be forgot-
               ten. Of all things human, only love lasts forever. Since only that
               which is living is capable of loving, we must first have eternal life
               before we can love forever.
                  Timeless love means love which can endure trial, tribulation,
               and even denial. Paul, touched by the measureless love of Jesus,
               cried out, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall
               tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
               peril, or sword?" (Rom. 8:35). While his feelings or determination
               may be admirable, how many a Christian has been able to
               withstand Paul's list of trials and still be loyal to Christ? But Jesus'
               love is timeless and changeless.
                  "The divine Teacher bears with the erring through all their
               perversity. His love does not grow cold; His efforts to win them do
               not cease. With outstretched arms He waits to welcome again and
               again the erring, the rebellious, and even the apostate. His heart is
               touched with the helplessness of the little child subject to rough
               usage. The cry of human suffering never reaches His ear in vain.
               Though all are precious in His sight, the rough, sullen, stubborn
               dispositions draw most heavily upon His sympathy and love; for
               He traces from cause to effect. The one who is most easily tempted,
               and is most inclined to err, is the special object of His solicitude."
               —Education, page 294.
                  "At all times and in all places Jesus manifested a loving interest
               in the human family and shed about Him the light of a cheerful
               piety. Students should be taught to follow in His steps."—

          Love—The Supreme Motive                                1 Thursday
                                                                December 31

 Part 5     In this imperfect world, marred by sin; what are we hoping and
Perfect   waiting for?
  Love
             "We know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection
          comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a
          child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a
          man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflec-
          tion; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall
          know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor. 13:9-12, NIV).

            Although Paul is pointing to the life to come, when the corrupt-
          ible nature is changed forever, even now, in Christ, the imperfect
          becomes more nearly perfect, more complete; the selfish becomes
          more selfless. God takes away our stony hearts and gives us hearts
          of flesh—tender, compassionate, capable of loving. This miracle
          can be wrought only when we submit ourselves totally to Christ.
            It is not easy; it takes courage to go to an enemy and say, "I'm
          sorry." Only the grace of God can help us love our enemies, but we
          must learn to love perfectly—to love as Christ loves.
             Because our capacity to love is small and our life is short, we
          take for granted that we should love the members of our families
          more than friends, and friends more than strangers. But in heaven
          there will be no strangers. Our capacity to love will increase to
          such an extent that everybody will feel fully accepted.
            Some Christians have said that they must live with their mothers
          or husbands or children in heaven. If they cannot live with them,
          heaven will not mean anything. This feeling is based on imperfect
          knowledge and on imperfect love. Jesus Christ once said, "In the
          resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
          as the angels of God in heaven" (Matt. 22:30).
             Here, Jesus pulled aside the curtain of mystery and allowed us to
          take a glimpse of heaven. Our imperfect love will become perfect.
          Human relations will broaden into a different form. We just cannot
          use our small yardstick of this earth to measure the love of heaven.

           Perfection is something all of us desire but have not attained.
          Where have you seen even a glimpse of perfect love?

            "Since there is no fear in love, one who fears demonstrates that
          he is not yet made perfect in respect to the high form of love of
          which the apostle [John] is speaking. [See 1 John 4:18.] Fortu-
          nately, development is possible. As we learn to know the Lord we
          begin to love Him, and our fear changes from a haunting dread of a
          powerful and avenging God to a 'clean' (Ps. 19:9) fear that does not
          wish to disappoint a friend."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7,

                Love—The Supreme Motive                                  1 Friday
                                                                        January 1

       Part 6      Of three key elements which open to us power to live a Christian
Faith, Hope,    life, which is the greatest?
   and Love
                  "These three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of
                these is love" (1 Cor. 13:13, NIV).

                   Though we need not worry now about what will be the exact
                relationships in heaven, we must learn here and now to grow in
                love daily, to grow more like Jesus. On this earth, where we see
                things as though looking into a mirror of polished brass, we must
                have faith. Through the eyes of faith we see beyond the mirror to
                peace and confidence in the future.
                   We must have hope. Without hope our eyes would be fixed on
                the present and the past, and the memory of unpleasant things
                might seem unbearable. But with hope we can endure all kinds of
                hardship and be patient until we reach our goal. When we see Jesus
                face-to-face, we will have perfected faith; we will have perfected
                hope, because we will have arrived in the future—infinite time.
                Yet love abides forever in the past, the present, and the future—
                even in heaven eternal. It is admirable to have strong faith, yet how
                much more do we need to have strong love!
                   We need to hold fast our hope, the blessed hope, the return of
                Christ. We can hold it fast only as a strong love for Him carries us
                through the most difficult trials and temptations. What the Laodi-
                ceans lack today is not more money. We are counseled to buy gold
                tried in the fire, white raiment, and eyesalve that we may be rich,
                be clothed, and see. The lukewarmness of the Laodiceans is
                caused by their love for earthly things. Because of it, many have
                turned away and are no longer with us in the pilgrimage to God's
                kingdom. Let us learn how to love God, love each other, and love
                strangers—even enemies—that we may truly be called sons and
                daughters of God.

                  Note Peter's combination of faith and hope in the experience of a
                child of God. 1 Peter 1:21.

                   In what ways is love given an adequate place in my Christian
                life—even greater than faith and hope?

                  "The divine love emanating from Christ never destroys human
                love, but includes it. By it human love is refined and purified,
                elevated and ennobled. Human love can never bear its precious
                fruit until it is united with the divine nature and trained to grow
                heavenward."—The Adventist Home, p. 99.

  "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,
walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
left" (Isa. 30:21).

    When God created man, He, with infinite wisdom, gave man the
 ability to discern right from wrong. What is considered to be right may
 differ from culture to culture, time to time, and place to place. But
 the ability to separate the right from the wrong, given us at Creation, was
•not completely lost under the blight of sin.
    The S.D.A. Bible Dictionary defines conscience as "an inward fac-
 ulty of consciousness that sits in judgment on the moral rightness of
 thoughts, words, and actions, independent of the individual's de-
 sires or inclination."—Page 234.
    The Bible speaks of a good conscience, a pure conscience, and a
 conscience void of offense toward God. It also talks about a weak
 conscience, a conscience that can be defiled, seared with a hot iron, or
 put away. Fortunately, the Bible teaches that the conscience can be
 cleansed and purged. Consideration of the shed blood of the Saviour
 makes a believer's conscience tender. In more detail, Ellen White
 describes a conscience quickened by the Holy Spirit, as the guide of
 conduct.
    Conscience is not only an inner voice, a sixth sense, it is a most
 important part of the decision mechanism. Through the Bible-en-
 lightened conscience, the Holy Spirit directs the will and controls the
 whole life. When violated, the sensitivity of the conscience can be so
 blunted and benumbed that one does not see sin as sin. Therefore, God in
 His great love, by virtue of Christ's sacrifice, promised to take out
 the stony heart and put within man a heart of flesh which can respond to the
 voice of the Holy Spirit. Only with such a new heart and a new spirit,
 bathed in the love of Jesus, can one walk in God's statutes and keep His
 commandments. (See Eze. 11:19, 20.)
    How important it is that we, who are purchased by the precious
 blood of Christ shall be careful in guarding the purity and tenderness of the
 conscience. For once a man's conscience is silenced, the Holy Spirit
 can no longer influence him, and he can no longer discern right from
 wrong. He will perish in the eternal darkness of his heart.
                                                                     13
            Conscience and the Spirit                               2 Sunday
                                                                     January 3

   Part 1    When a man is confronted with a choice, what provision has God
The Inner made through teachers or prophets to help him make the right
    Voice decision?

               "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way,
            walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the
            left" (Isa. 30:21).

              We make decisions every day, some routine and some more
            important. Everybody is forced to make serious decisions many
            times in his lifetime. Often, because the future is unknown, deci-
            sion making becomes an agonizing experience. A choice may
            mean success or failure, even life or death. Sometimes even when
            faced by not-so-serious decisions, we wish someone would point
            out the right way. Fortunately, our loving God has made such help
            available to us. He has created a conscience in our minds so that
            we hear an inner voice which tells us what is right and what is
            wrong. Those believing in Christ and open to the teaching of the
            prophets in His Word know that this is the voice used by the Holy
            Spirit.
              "The word of the Lord comes to us all who have not resisted His
            Spirit by determining not to hear and obey. This voice is heard in
            warnings, in counsels, in reproof. It is the Lord's message of light
            to His people."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 28.
              "It is right that you should both cherish integrity and be true to
            your sense of right. The straight path of duty should be yours from
            choice."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 62.
              "The spirit of truth and a good conscience are sufficient to
            inspire and regulate the motives and conduct of those who learn of
            Christ and are like Him."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 487.
              We have looked at the ear open to God's voice, but in a special
            sense the sensitive conscience is like an eye, providing light to the
            mind. The spiritual healthfulness of the whole soul and being
            depends upon its correct view of things. The Word of God convicts
            the conscience of sin.
              The Spirit of God also works to keep evil out of our lives through
            the control of conscience. There is only danger for the one who
            exalts himself above the influence of the Spirit. He will reap a
            harvest of iniquity.

               What does the inner voice have to do with character building?
              "Not by eloquence or logic are men's hearts reached, but by the
            sweet influences of the Holy Spirit, which operate quietly yet
            surely in transforming and developing character. It is the still,
            small voice of the Spirit of God that has power to change the
            heart."—Prophets and Kings, p. 169.

                                                                         January 4

    Part 2      In order to be on safe ground, whom should we allow to guide the
se" of the    conscience?
ioiy Spirit
                "When he [the Holy Spirit] is come, he will reprove [convict,
              convince] the world [believers and unbelievers, individuals and
              masses] of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8).

                 "The renewing, sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, which
              would give peace and hope to the troubled conscience, and restore
              health and happiness to the soul" (Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 186) is
              the guide for the conscience. A perverted conscience can allow a
              man to be very wrong and yet think that he is on the correct path.
                 As the Holy Spirit speaks to the conscience by the heart appeal
              of Calvary, something of the evil of sin, of its power, of its guilt, of
              its woe is seen. Sin loses its appeal for the sinner. It is seen as
              separating man from God and placing him in bondage to the power
              of evil.

                Of whom does the Holy Spirit come to testify? John 15:26.

                 God the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit work together to
              show man the perfect heavenly life-style. Only by the movings of
              the Holy Spirit can we correctly understand Jesus. The focus of all
              of Heaven's efforts for our salvation is the cross. It is the things
              which Christ has for His church that the Spirit brings to our
              attention.

                Some have resisted the Spirit's appeal to the conscience. Even if
              they respond later, what is the danger in resisting? For examples, see
              Acts 24:25; 26:27, 28.

                Although some may see their folly and repent of sin and receive
              pardon, they have wounded their own souls. They have brought
              upon themselves a life-long danger. The power to distinguish
              between right and wrong, which ought ever to be kept keen and
              sensitive, is in a measure destroyed. They are not as quick to
              recognize the guiding voice of the Holy Spirit or to detect the
              devices of Satan. Too often in time of danger they fall under
              temptation and are led away from God.

                What can I do to become more sensitive to the voice of the Holy
              Spirit?

               Consider that the Spirit always works in harmony with the
              Word, which He inspired, and in exaltation of the cross, where sin
              was defeated once and for all.

         Conscience and the Spirit                              2 Tuesday

Part 3        In Paul's day, who beside believers had a conscience?
  Gift
to All     "When the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
         things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
         themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts,
         their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean
         while accusing or else excusing one another" (Rom. 2:14, 15).

           Here the apostle Paul says that the Gentiles, who had not God's
         law, also had a conscience, for there is no respect of persons with
         God. (See Acts 10:34.) If they did not have a conscience, the Holy
         Spirit would not have had a channel of influence over them, and
         their conversion would not have been possible. That non-
         Christians become Christians testifies to the fact that conscience is
         a gift God has given to every human being. Once converted, our
         duty is to keep ours pure and enlightened.
            In the light of Ephesians 4:19, there are some who have muffled
         conscience so long that it and they are no longer sensitive. In the
         text for today Paul may have been challenging the spiritually
         favored Jewish people to live up to their privileges when even the
         pagan can do good things in spite of his limitations.
           As modern believers, if we cherish a habitual impression that
         God sees and hears all that we do and say, that He keeps a faithful
         record of all our words and actions, and that we must meet them all
         in the judgment, then we will seek to follow the dictates of an
         enlightened and alert conscience. We will also cherish more and
         more Christ's victory over sin for us and in us.
          How often does an "authority figure" become conscience for a
         Christian? Consider Rom. 14:5; Titus 1:13, 14; John 9:18-34.

           A constant danger faces those who hold any position or relation-
         ship that would give them a ready opportunity to dominate any
         other human being in any way. One part of the danger is that they
         will exercise their position so as to become the conscience of that
         other person.
           Church leaders, parents, teachers, and dormitory deans; hus-
         bands and wives; older brothers or sisters; psychologists, coun-
         selors, psychiatrists, and physicians; bosses; pastors, evangelists,
         and Bible instructors—all of these and many more need constantly
         to be alert to the danger of being conscience for another, especially
         when the other may invite it. (See Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 61, 62;
         vol. 9, p. 234; Education, p. 288.)

           In winning souls, how can I help to develop the conscience of the
         enquirers?

                                                                      January 6

   Part 4      From what source flows the love that sums up the commandment
good and    of law and gospel?
    Weak
(sciences     "The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart
            and a good conscience and a sincere faith" (1 Tim. 1:5, NIV).

              "Keep the conscience tender, that you may hear the faintest
            whisper of the voice that spake as never man spake."—My Life
            Today, p. 322.

              What is one result of following a good conscience? 2 Cor. 1:12-14.

              The supreme source of enlightenment for the conscience is the
            Bible. Together with sanctified reason and a prayerful, teachable
            spirit, the Holy Word—enlightened by the Holy Spirit—will up-
            hold the cross and guide into truth. It will provide sound principles
            as a guide to the conscience and will result in a joyous Christian
            experience.

              What effect do corruption and unbelief have upon the conscience?
            Titus 1:15.

               Going against an enlightened conscience is the surest way to
            weaken its effectiveness. As a watchdog barks less and less if a
            stranger is allowed in the house, so the voice of conscience is heard
            less and less if we permit evil to dwell in the soul. Ultimately it will
            be deadened and lose its soul-protecting power.
               Even in connection with the work of God, in all its branches, the
            road of progress may be blocked when those responsible have
            perverted the conscience to the point that it is hard and unim-
            pressible. The youth also need to keep the conscience tender and
            instructed by Spirit-directed Bible study:
               "If you could only arouse, if your slumbering, deadened con-
            science could be awakened, and you could cherish a habitual
            impression of the presence of God, and keep yourself subject to
            the control of an enlightened, wakeful conscience, you would be
            happy yourself and a blessing to your parents, whose hearts you
            now wound."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 563.

               By what means and methods may a bad conscience be restored to
            its original pure condition?

               Even the slightest move to obey the conscience, when en-
            lightened by the Word, will help to strengthen it.

                                                                     January 7

   Part 5   How does Paul describe the possibility that a good conscience can
  Can Be be lost?
Put Away
            "Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
          away concerning faith have made shipwreck" (1 Tim. 1:19).

              Young people who have been religiously instructed at home and
            who go away to schools or jobs, comparatively innocent and
            virtuous, may become corrupt by seeking the company of
            worldly-minded people. In the process, they lose self-respect and
            sacrifice noble principles. There is little then to keep them from the
            downward path, for they have rejected their conscience to the
            place that sin does not appear so sinful anymore.

              How does the preceding thought relate to Paul's reference to a
            seared conscience? (See 1 Tim. 4:2.)

               Repeatedly in the Scriptures and in helpful comments on them,
            the message comes through that the sensitivity of the conscience is
            influenced by what an individual does or shrinks from doing.
            Shunning the cross weakens the conviction of future duties, and
            soon disobedience fails to disturb the soul. Only a continual love-
            response to Calvary's all-sufficient Sacrifice can keep the heart
            tender to Spirit-directed duty. Otherwise "the heart is hardened,
            the conscience seared."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 279.
               To church families living sensually, the counsel was given:
               "While living under and proclaiming the most solemn message
            ever borne to mortals, . . . they are transgressing its holy precepts.
            The consciences of those who do this have become seared and
            terribly hardened. They have resisted the influences of the Spirit of
            God until they can use sacred truth as a cloak to hide the deformity
            of their corrupted souls."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 468.

               What must have happened to David's conscience during the series
            of gross sins which he committed involving Uriah the Hittite? (See
            2 Samuel 11 and 12:1-14.)

              There is a sobering warning for each of us who professes to be a
            part of God's remnant people:
              "Those who have had the light upon the subjects of eating and
            dressing with simplicity in obedience to physical and moral laws,
            and who turn from the light which points out their duty, will shun
            duty in other things."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 51.

              How guarded must I be against worldly influences? How much is
            enough? Is it possible to be too guarded?

   Part 6     What is the biblical description of an unpardonable sin?
     The
Unpardon-      "Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
 able Sin   forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost
            it shall not be forgiven" (Luke 12:10).

              It is so easy to fall into the trap which caught the boy who called
            "Wolf, wolf!" when there was no wolf. When there actually was a
            wolf, his fearful cries brought him no help. He had played his game
            too long.
              With the matter of the conscience, we do the opposite—usually
            with similar results:
              "Those who are quieting a guilty conscience with the thought
            that they can change a course of evil when they choose, that they
            can trifle with the invitations of mercy, and yet be again and again
            impressed, take this course at their peril. . . . The experience, the
            education, the discipline of a life of sinful indulgence, has so
            thoroughly molded the character that they cannot then receive the
            image of Jesus. Had no light shone upon their pathway, the case
            would have been different. Mercy might interpose, and give them
            an opportunity to accept her overtures; but after light has been
            long rejected and despised, it will be finally withdrawn."—
            Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 269.

              In rejecting the voice of conscience, whom are we, actually reject-
            ing? (Compare Ps. 51:1-3 with Isa. 30:21 and Ps. 32:1-4.)

               "It is by the Spirit that God works upon the heart; when men
            willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to be from Satan, they cut
            off the channel by which God can communicate with them. When
            the Spirit is finally rejected, there is no more that God can do for
            the soul."—The Desire of Ages, p. 322.
               There is a solution to the problem of a seared conscience. We
            have mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating lest some are
            tempted to give up in despair. The feeblest positive response to the
            Spirit's work upon the conscience will open the way for Christ's
            grace to enter the soul for redemption. As a physically sick person
            can regain strength by carefully planned exercise—even if it begins
            with the fingers only—so the spiritually sick person can receive
            remarkable results by exercising faith in Christ. Even faith ex-
             pressed in terms of unbelief can bring from God warmth, love,
             understanding, an illuminated conscience, and a will responsive to
             the Spirit's prompting. (See Mark 9:24 and context.)

              Could I be so quick to pass counsel to others that I cease to hear
             what the Spirit has for me?

                  Ihu5s3vd Laze
  "This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and be their God, and they
shall be my people" (Jer. 31:33).

    In last week's lesson we studied the function of the conscience, a gift
 from God to all. The fact that we all have a conscience does not mean that
 we all have the same evaluations of right and wrong (which are
 influenced by our concept of what is good and what is bad). As some have
 suggested, law is essentially an aspect of culture. Men's concepts of
 good or bad are largely nurtured by cultural backgrounds.
    Because circumstances and cultures differ, human law is somewhat
 relative. For example, in severe weather conditions, when food
 supply is low, the permitting of infants or the aged to die is acceptable
among some peoples.
   As behavior permissible by law may differ widely, so with standards
of goodness, unless tied to divine law and instruction. In some places,
although prohibited by written law, society in general still considers
passing money "under the table" as a necessary, if not a good, process to
get things done faster and better. Some argue that it differs little from
giving tips to a taxi driver, a barber, or a waitress in the restaurant. If
small tips are sanctioned by the government, when and why do "bigger
tips" become corruption? In the area of fashions, there are other
issues. The wearing of hats or the veil for the ladies, the width of the
necktie for men, the length of hair for both sexes, vary from time to time
and place to place. The sense of appropriateness of a certain standard is
often temporal.
   These illustrations show that each person and group has his or
their own set of inward laws which are the result of culture, education,
socioeconomic status, occupation, age, location, religion, and a
number of other factors. Since these are changeable, relative, and
subjective, God wants to write His law—a much higher and moral
standard, the expression of His character—in our hearts. His law
transcends culture, race, age, class, religion, time, and locality. He invites
us to accept it in place of our imperfect, incomplete, and defective
moral concepts.

                                                                   January 10

   Part 1     To what does the Bible point in its definition of the good?
The Good
              "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
            and good" (Rom. 7:12).

               Once a ruler asked Jesus: "Good Master, what good thing shall I
            do, that I may have eternal life?" Jesus answered, "Why callest
            thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou
            wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Matt. 19:16, 17).
               Although Jesus was trying to help the ruler understand who He
            was, Jesus here points to God as the source of all that is good. All
            good things and goodness originate with Him. The Ten
            Commandments—the law of life He gave to the race—can be
            summed up in one word: love (Matt. 22:37, 38; 1 John 4:8).
               "Goodness is the result of divine power transforming human
            nature. By believing in Christ, the fallen race He has redeemed
            may obtain that faith which works by love and purifies the soul
            from all defilement."—My Life Today, p. 54.
                Since each person has a different set of standards for what is
            good and what is bad, most moral philosophers conclude that there
            are no real and constant values. Some say that "good" cannot be
            defined, described, or explained. They say that goodness is simply
            self-evident. It can be known only by how it feels and fits! Other
            theories and interpretations lead to further cheapening of the sub-
            ject. The problem is that most moral philosophers refuse to com-
             mit themselves to any moral code. When one refuses to accept an
             absolute, eternal, and unchangeable moral standard and believes
             instead in a standard of right and wrong dependent on cir-
             cumstances, time, and place, he will soon find himself floundering
             in doubt. When one eliminates God from his system of thought and
             tries to construct for himself a set of moral standards, he produces
             only limited statements which are dwarfed before the broad,
             majestic, and beautiful truths stated in the Bible.

              From what great motive is goodness produced? 1 Cor. 13:4 com-
            pared with Gal. 5:22.

              "From a worldly point of view, money is power; but from the
            Christian standpoint, love is power. Intellectual and spiritual
            strength are involved in this principle. . . . Wealth is often an
            influence to corrupt and destroy; force is strong to do hurt; but
            truth and goodness are the properties of pure love."—
            Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 138.

   Part 2     What view does Paul hold of the possibility that man can be good in
Goodness    himself?
 and Man
               "I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing:
            for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I
            find not" (Rom. 7:18).

              "In ourselves we are incapable of doing any good thing, but that
            which we cannot do will be wrought by the power of God in every
            submissive and believing soul."—The Desire of Ages, p. 98.

                 What have the moral philosophers said on the subject of goodness?

               As early as about 300 B.C., the matter of whether man is basi-
            cally good or bad was debated by two great Confucianist
            scholars—Mencius and Shuntze. Of course, the debate came to no
            satisfactory conclusion, for man is neither wholly good nor wholly
            bad. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, states in the beginning of his
            Ethics that every reasoned human activity aims at some good. Men
            are seeking happiness, and pleasure is part of it. Unlike Plato, he
            saw that there cannot be a universal good. In other words, good-
            ness, in the eyes of human beings is only a value based on personal
            opinion. Measured by his own standard, one may pronounce him-
            self good. But that good may not stand the test of some other
            standard of goodness. Only God's standard is the real and un-
            changing rule, the standard which can be applied to all.
              Just exactly how Adam's sin causes us to sin we cannot fully
            understand. But we do observe that nobody is immune to sin. On
            the contrary, men are selfish, unholy, and prone to sin. Pride,
            jealousy, deceit, covetousness, hatred—all can be found not only
            among adults but also among children. No wonder the apostle Paul
            confesses that there is no good thing in him. (Compare with Rom.
            5:12-19.)
              Can science or education change the sinful nature of man?
               "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of
            sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot
            change them."—Steps to Christ, p. 18.
               Today men are acting as in the days of the judges—"every man
            did that which was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25). Will they
            ever see that they are wrong? Sinners "will find in the day of
            judgment that they turned from God's express requirements and
            set up their own opinion as a standard of right and wrong. They will
            find that what seemed to them unimportant was not so regarded of
            God. His requirements should be sacredly obeyed."—Counsels

   Part 3     How does law relate to Heaven's standard of right and wrong?
     The
Standard      "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
 of Right   not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the
            law had said, Thou shalt not covet" (Rom. 7:7).

              In a broader sense than provided by the moral law alone, "the
            word of God will give the correct standard of right and wrong, and
            of moral principle. A fixed principle of truth is the only safeguard
            for youth "—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 194.
              From another point of view, "if there is any question in your
            minds in regard to what is right, look to the Lord Jesus, and He will
            guide you."—Life Sketches, p. 447.
               What is legally right may differ from what is morally right. In the
            eyes of legislators, a law can be a good law or a bad law. But once a
            law is enacted, violation of even a bad law is never legally right, for
            the very function of law is to point out crime. In the eyes of a judge,
            all laws must be enforced and respected, whether good or bad.

               In this corrupt world, where violation of man-made law is some-
            times seen as advantageous and even honored, how should the Chris-
            tian act with regard to that law? Rom. 13:1-7; 12:17-19.

              The Christian may find himself unable to take advantage of what
            may be legal because he is bound by a higher law.
               "We should choose the right because it is right, and leave
            consequences with God. To men of principle, faith, and daring, the
            world is indebted for its great reforms. By such men the work of
            reform for this time must be carried forward."—The Great Con-
            troversy, p. 460.

              What guides the Christian in his choices day by day as to what is
            right to do? 1 Peter 3:10-17.

              "The truly converted soul . . . does not consider present conve-
            nience; he is not ambitious for display; he does not crave the praise
            of men. His hope is in heaven, and he keeps straight on, with his
            eye fixed on Jesus. He does right because it is right, and because
            only those who do right will have an entrance into the kingdom of
            God. He is kind and humble, and thoughtful of others'
            happiness."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 569.

               To choose right may cost something: popularity, position, posses-
            sion, even life. Am I prepared to stand for the right at all times?

                                                                         January 13

     Part 4        How does Paul vividly describe the battle going on in his heart?
The Inward
     Battle     "That which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but
              what I hate, that do I. . . . Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin
              that dwelleth in me. . . . For the good that I would I do not: but the
              evil which I would not, that I do."
                "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of
              my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in
              my members" (Rom. 7:15-19, 23).

                "As man yields to temptation, and indulges in sin, his mind
              becomes darkened. The moral sense is perverted. The warnings of
              conscience are disregarded, and its voice is less clearly heard. He
              gradually loses the power to distinguish between right and wrong,
              until he has no true sense of his standing before God. He may
              observe the forms of religion and zealously maintain its doctrine,
              while destitute of its spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 682.

                How does the Holy Spirit speaking to the conscience, help us to
              obey God's law? Consider the setting of Pentecost. Acts 2:14-37.

                 Seventh-day Adventists understand, in common with God's
              true children in every age, that the plan of salvation is designed to
              restore them to harmony with the will and mind of God. Thus we
              see it as not enough to say "I believe" and then proceed to ignore
              or violate the laws by which God governs His vast universe.
                 The heart that has been converted by the love of God revealed at
              Calvary cannot treat lightly the will of God in any sphere of life.
              "Whenever one renounces sin, which is the transgression of the
              law, his life will be brought into conformity to the law, into perfect
              obedience. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. The light of the
              Word carefully studied, the voice of conscience, the strivings of
              the Spirit, produce in the heart genuine love for Christ, who gave
              Himself a whole sacrifice to redeem the whole person, body, soul,
              and spirit. And love is manifested in obedience. "—Evangelism, p.
              309.

                Over what issue will the Spirit's final appeal be made to the
              conscience? Rev. 12:7, 17.

                 "The last great conflict between truth and error is but the final
              struggle of the long-standing controversy concerning the law of
              God."—The Great Controversy, p. 582.

                In this life-long battle in which everyone must engage, with his
              eyes upon Calvary, how careful will one be in order that he may win?

           The Inward Law                                        3 Thursday
                                                                   January 14

  Part 5     What promise has God made in giving us His law to be followed as
  Heart    our inward law?
Religion
             "This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of
           Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their
           inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
           they shall be my people" (Jer. 31:33).

              The law that was written by God on tables of stone is written by
           the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. We may have continu-
           ing peace of mind in knowing that instead of going about to estab-
           lish our own righteousness we accept the righteousness of Christ.
           His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us. At
           the same time the heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth
           "the fruit of the Spirit" spoken of in Galatians 5:22, 23. Through
           the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the inward law—
           the law of God written upon our hearts.

             What is the fruitage of "looking unto Jesus"? (See Heb. 12:2 and
           2 Cor. 3:18.)

             "We develop a character which is the counterpart of the divine
           character. Growing into His likeness, we enlarge our capacity for
           knowing God. More and more we enter into fellowship with the
           heavenly world, and we have continually increasing power to
           receive the riches of the knowledge and wisdom of eternity."—
           Christ's Object Lessons, p. 355.

             What is the secret power which can strengthen and elevate moral
           standards? Rom. 13:10; 1 Cor. 13:4-7.

             Although love is at the heart of the Spirit's work, it is not without
           conscious effort on our part that our lives are brought to resemble
           the divine Pattern. The Christian life is not a dreamlike drift toward
           the kingdom of heaven. It involves choices, decisions, goals. It
           involves conscious denial of the everywhere-present demands of
           the fashions, customs, teachings, and practices of the world. (See
           Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 146.)

             As the relentless tides of worldly influences sweep against us
           again and again and again, we must have Christ's character de-
           veloped in us. Looking ever to the cross of Jesus will give us the
           moral courage to shun the customs of the world while remaining
           open to the heart needs of our fellowmen.

              How high is the standard God has set for His children?

   Part 6     As Paul found in his continual struggle with a sinful nature, who
Reaching only can help us to have peace in our hearts?
   Up for
Goodness      "0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
           this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 7:24,
           25).

               "Desires for goodness and true holiness are right so far as they
             go; but if you stop here, they will avail nothing. Good purposes are
             right, but will prove of no avail unless resolutely carried out. Many
             will be lost while hoping and desiring to be Christians; but they
             made no earnest effort, therefore they will be weighed in the
             balances and found wanting. The will must be exercised in the right
             direction."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 265, 266.

                When we experience conflict with temptation, the Word of God
             brings to us the power of the Holy Spirit, in answer to prayer. So it
             was with our Lord in the wilderness. By the Word of God in His
             heart and mind our Lord conquered Satan. The Holy Spirit that
             inspired the Word gives power to that Word today wherever it is
             preached. All over the world it has the power to bring conviction of
             sin and trust in the divine Saviour. Cultural barriers do not limit the
             universal appeal of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

              What hope is there for weak and weakened sinners? (See Isa. 55:7;
             Matt. 6:14, 15; Eph. 4:32.)

               "You should yield your own spirit and take in its place the spirit
             of the dear Saviour. Reach up and grasp His hand, that the touch
             may electrify you and charge you with the sweet properties of His
             own matchless character. . . . Your moral strength will be equal to
             the closest test of character. Your integrity will be pure and
             sanctified. Then will your light break forth as the morning."—
             Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 63.

              From the example of God's compensation of Paul's handicaps,
             where do we find a real source of power today? 2 Cor. 12:9.

               Christ has the means and power to lead His children to
             wholehearted moral and spiritual soundness. He can draw us to
             His throne of grace and put a prayer in our hearts that will bring
             just the needed help. There is no resource in heaven that He will
             not make available to the heart that senses its need. We "are
             complete in him" (Col. 2:10). (Compare with Eph. 3:14-21.)

                 By what steps are we taking 'God's law into our hearts and making
             it the basis of our thought and our behavior?

Freedom of Choice
  "Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
stumblingblock to them that are weak" (1 Cor. 8:9).

   In Eden, along with a conscience, God gave man freedom of choice.
One may choose to believe in God; one may choose not to believe in any
god, but one may actually create a god for oneself. One may choose to
many a John or a Karen, a Peter or a Margaret. Even in trivial things, one
still has to make choices—a salad or a sandwich, an apple or a mango.
   When we choose something, we must take into account the limits and
the consequences of the choice. The apostle Paul says that even though
he has the freedom to do things which are lawful, he would not allow
his liberty to become a stumblingblock to others who are weak in faith. So
we find that a Christian's freedom is subject to the moral code which he
has chosen to follow.
    But the most serious choice each of us must make is patterned after
Christ's choice in Gethsemane—whether we wholeheartedly dedi-
cate everything we have and are to God. Some may feel that they should go
only part of the way now and somehow, at a certain point in the future,
they will complete the decision to serve God without reservation. So
they hope to gain all the advantages of this world and also heaven. But
they may suddenly die, and eternal life will forever be lost to them.
 Unless, "looking unto Jesus," we put everything on the altar—unless we
decide that to please God is our most noble choice and goal in life—it is
so easy to falter.
    Unfortunately, some use their freedom to choose a task, an ideal, as a
 "god." When these tasks or ideals take the place of God, they
 become idols—be they money, fame, position, power, ideology,
 beauty, a degree, vainglory, or simply material things such as a car, a
 house, a boat, an airplane, or even more trivial things.
    Jesus is our perfect Model and Pattern. The major purpose of His life
 was to do God's will and to glorify Him. If we would focus our
 attention on Him, His life, His sacrifice, His intercession, and learn His
 life-style, we would have no other god.

                                                                   27
             Freedom of Choice                                       4  Sunday
                                                                     January 17

    Part 1     Before exercising freedom of choice, what should a Christian
      The    consider first?
 Freedom
of Choice       "If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
             disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question
             for conscience sake. But if any man say unto you, This is offered in
             sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for
             conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:
             conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my
             liberty judged of another man's conscience?" (1 Cor. 10:27-29).

                Paul here is not concerned with the question of whether or not
             meat is a wholesome food to eat. He does not deal with the
             question of clean and unclean meat. The subject is meat offered to
             idols. The lesson here is on personal and religious freedom.
             Everybody likes freedom, and some want unlimited freedom. But
             the apostle Paul felt differently. He would not use his liberty in
             such a way that doubt would arise in the minds of others. Nor
             would he, in order to enjoy his own freedom, offend the con-
             science of others. We are all free to make choices, but we are not
             free to choose just whatever we like. Our choices must be guided
             by a set of mature inward laws.
               Seventh-day Adventists are quite conscious of religious free-
             doms, and we are perpetual watchdogs on those whom we fear
             may be planning the restriction of our liberties. But Paul's counsel
             seems to suggest that we have reason to be equally concerned
             about and respectful of the religious liberty of others—even, and
             perhaps especially, that of those who thoroughly disagree with us
             (or we with them!).

                  In Jesus' words, what makes us free? John 8:32.

                In planning the eternal security of heaven and the new earth (see
             Nahum1:9), God has made no place for the use of force or pressure
             to lead a person to accept the will of God. Those entrusted with the
             freedom of heaven must have chosen freely the will of God here.

               What is the biblical view of one believer's righteousness being
             shared with someone else? Eze. 18:5, 9, 10, 13.

               Why does God give man freedom of choice but at the same time
             restrict him with His law?

                Freedom of conscience does not include freedom from instruc-
             tion from those inspired to convey God's messages to the church.

     Part 2     What limitations are there upon a Christian's freedom to do
The Limits    lawful things?
f Freedom
                "All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
              things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his
              own, but every man another's wealth" (1 Cor. 10:23, 24).

                In this rights-conscious age in which we live, some are quite
              unwilling to consider what influence even a "lawful" deed might
              have on another. Someone younger in the faith may not be able to
              understand finer points of truth, on the one hand, or see the
              broader principle, on the other. A true Christian knows that no
              man is an island. He knows that he is accountable for what others
              could misunderstand in his exercise of lawful freedom.

                Before we speak or act, what should we think about first? James
              2:12; Eccl. 11:9.

                Following the ancient Chinese emperor, around the clock, were
              the recorders who wrote down every word he said. Because what
              the emperor said became law, this practice of recording helped
              these rulers to be careful in what they said. We too are judged by
              our own history. Not long ago a U. S. President was judged by his
              own words on tapes. How careful we should be in exercising our
              freedom!

                What counsel does the Word offer for those who resent limits upon
              their freedom? Prov. 23:19, 26; 28:7; 29:17.

                "I am a mother; I know whereof I speak, when I say that youth
              and children are not only safer but happier under wholesome
              restraint than when following their own inclination. . . . The
              unbounded freedom granted to children at this age has proved the
              ruin of thousands."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp.
              62, 63.

                Prudence in decision making is a habit. It can and should be
              cultivated. What attention have I paid to this?

                 In no aspect of human experience can the impact of the gospel
               reveal itself more vitally than in making life's choices. This is
               especially true when those choices have a bearing on other indi-
               viduals' lives. Perhaps we ride roughshod over others most readily
               when we are in haste with our decisions. It is always appropriate,
               however, to ask how this particular choice might affect someone
               else.

                                                                    January 19

  Part 3     God has given us the freedom of making choices. Why should we
 Care in be careful in using it?
   Using
Freedom      "Take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
          stumblingblock to them that are weak. For if any man see thee which
           hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the con-
          science of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which
          are offered to idols; and through thy knowledge shall the weak
          brother perish, for whom Christ died?" (1 Cor. 8:9-11).

              Some Christians have stronger faith, and some have weaker
            faith. A frank and testing statement may stimulate one to study
            more of his Bible, but the same may cast doubts in the mind of
            another. Mature Christians must be considerate of the needs and
            weaknesses of others.
              In Paul's day, the act of offering food to idols did not change the
            nutritional value of the food (and he was not here teaching regard-
            ing a better diet), but the apostle would refrain from eating such for
            the sake of those with a weak conscience. Likewise, Christians
            today should also be careful lest without wishing it, they cause the
            weakening of the faith of a fellow Christian.
              After feeding the multitudes, how did Jesus act to save the people
            from an action that would close down His ministry too soon? John
            6:15.
              What admonition involving use of freedom did the apostle Paul
            give to the church? 1 Cor. 14:40.

              "By some, all efforts to establish order are regarded as
            dangerous—as a restriction of personal liberty, and hence to be
            feared as popery. These deceived souls regard it a virtue to boast
            of their freedom to think and act independently. . . . I have been
            instructed that it is Satan's special effort to lead men to feel that
            God is pleased to have them choose their own course independent
            of the counsel of their brethren."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 257.

              What lesson can we learn from Israel's disregard of God's law
            and later use of it as a wall to separate themselves from the world?

               In the history of Israel, national calamity taught God's people
            the results of a failure to live out the law of God. They resorted,
            therefore, to device after device to compel themselves to re-
            member the law and to be strict in its observance. So they attached
            portions of the law to their garments or to their doorposts. But they
            failed to see that God's law written on the heart affects the outward
            acts. They even made their strictness a wall that shut them off from
            witnessing about Jehovah to their heathen neighbors.

Part 4     What is an idol? What makes it folly to worship idols?
 Idols
           "They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their
         delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses;
         they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed" (Isa. 44:9).

           "No outward shrines may be visible, there may be no image for
         the eye to rest upon, yet we may be practicing idolatry. It is as easy
         to make an idol of cherished ideas or objects as to fashion gods of
         wood or stone. Thousands have a false conception of God and His
         attributes. They are as verily serving a false god as were the
         servants of Baal."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 173, 174.

            In the experience of the rich young ruler, how aware was he of the
         idols he was worshiping? How could Jesus love him under such
         circumstances? How radical was the spiritual surgery which he
         needed for a cure? (See Luke 18:18-27 and Mark 10:21.)

           "He [the young ruler] had cherished an idol in the soul; the
         world was his god. He professed to have kept the commandments,
         but he was destitute of the principle which is the very spirit and life
         of them all. He did not possess true love for God or man."—
         Christ's Object Lessons, p. 392.

           Christians may be unintentionally worshiping idols. What is the
         cure? (Consider 1 Thess. 1:8-10.)

            There is an endless battle for the affections of the followers of
         Jesus Christ. When the world surges in with its earthly treasures as
         an enticement for our attention, our love for Christ grows cold and
         feeble. Only as we consciously choose to expel these potential
         idols from our hearts will our love for Christ have hope of revival.
            "When one idol is expelled from the soul, Satan has another
         prepared to supply its place. Unless you make an entire consecra-
         tion to Christ and live in communion with Him, unless you make
         Him your Counselor, you will find that your heart, open to evil
         thoughts, is easily diverted from the service of God to the service
         of self."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp. 107, 108.

           How do I know that I am not worshiping any idol? Could my idol
         be no problem to someone else, and vice versa? What does that
         matter?

 Part 5        Who alone is presented to us in Scripture as a perfect model?
Models
             "Hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,
          leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin,
          neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled,
          reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but commit-
          ted himself to him that judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our
          sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should
          live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed" (1 Peter
          2:21-24).

             While He was on earth, Jesus did everything according to His
          Father's will, yet He enjoyed the greatest freedom because sin had
          no power over Him. He loved God so much that He was perfectly
          happy to do His will. Wholeheartedly He chose to obey God.
          God's will became His. When He carried out God's will, He did it
          by His own choice. He says to us, "Take my yoke upon you, and
          learn of me" (Matt. 11:29).
            "Christ stands before us as the pattern Man, the Great Medical
          Missionary—an example for all who should come after. His love,
          pure and holy, blessed all who came within the sphere of its
          influence."—Medical Ministry, p. 20.


            How far can human beings go in duplicating the perfect pattern set
          for them by the Man, Jesus? (See John 15:3-5, 14, 16; Phil. 2:5.)

            "He [Christ] is a perfect and holy example, given for us to
          imitate. We cannot equal the pattern; but we shall not be approved
          of God if we do not copy it and, according to the ability which God
          has given, resemble it."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 549.

            With regard to following Christ's example, what did the apostle
          Paul ask us to do? 1 Cor. 11:1; Phil. 4:9.

             It may seem almost presumptuous for Paul to urge his fellow
          believers to be followers of himself when he was human too. But
          he only asked them to follow him to the degree that he was himself
          a follower of Christ.
             In the absolute sense, Paul was not a perfect replica of Jesus.
          But no one made a more earnest, more total, or more constant
          effort to imitate and resemble the divine Pattern. The call is for us
          to do likewise.

            Is it possible for man to rise to the level of enjoying complete
          freedom and no longer making wrong decisions?

    Part 6      What challenge from Paul could give us a sound motive for making
he Highest   right decisions?
 Standard
               "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
             the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31).

                In the call of the gospel there is a series of seeming paradoxes—
             opposing ideas that an unbeliever would read as contradictions.
             One pairing of opposing concepts is suggested in the offer of
             freedom and the call to service (virtually to be God's bond servant
             or slave). The youth especially covet freedom—freedom to think,
             to explore, to improve on the past. But they and we must under-
             stand that the truest freedom is found in the most complete and
             voluntary bondage to the love of Christ.
                The love of Christ, in turn, is expressed to meet our situation and
             condition in the words of the Ten Commandments. He who seeks
             God's glory rather than his own will hold back nothing from being
             examined by the eternal principles contained in God's law. Entire
             and constant consecration is no price to pay for eternal joys with
             God. It provides perpetual joy now and true freedom forever.

               What was one of Paul's favorite titles for himself? Eph. 3:1.

                When called by Christ, Paul was not a prisoner. When he ac-
             cepted the commission from Jesus as the apostle to Gentiles, he
             gladly called himself a "prisoner of Jesus Christ for . . . Gentiles."
             This willingness to submit one's own plans to God is the secret of
             achieving the highest freedom.
                The apostle John, a prisoner on the Isle of Patmos, was also a
             free man. In the truest sense, he was not a prisoner confined to this
             earth; he was certainly not a prisoner of sin. He was free to meet
             Christ, whose hair appeared "as white as snow," whose "eyes
             were as a flame of fire," and whose "feet [were] like unto fine
             brass, as if they burned in a furnace" (Rev. 1:14, 15). No sinners
             can meet Jesus in His glory and still live. Yet John had the freedom
             of meeting his beloved Master. True freedom is not a freedom to
             sin, but the freedom to do God's will as though doing one's own.

               How can I be so free that in making my own choice I am at the same
             time obeying God's will?

               "God might have created man without the power to transgress
             His law; He might have withheld the hand of Adam from touching
             the forbidden fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a
             free moral agent, but a mere automaton."—Patriarchs and
             Prophets, p. 49.

Respect o
Authority
  "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is
no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God" (Rom.
13:1).

   Authority, according to Webster, is the "power to influence or com-
mand thought, opinion, or behavior." Authority also means "freedom
granted by one in authority."—Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary.
   A father has a kind of authority over his children because he partici-
pates in giving them life, he nurtures them to adulthood, and educates
them by his knowledge, example, and financial means.
   An employer has authority over his workers because he, in paying
them wages based on a certain agreement, has contracted their services,
including the use of their time, energy, and talents.
   In days gone by, the king had authority over his subjects because
they believed that he was ordained of God to rule. So in China the
emperor was called "tientze," the "Son of Heaven." Today there
may be presidents, premiers, or governors who lead their countries and the
governments of the people.
   These are traditional concepts of authority, and some are still valid
today. However, with the increase and spread of knowledge, the diver-
sification and multiplication of the means of production as a result of
the industrial revolution, the ordinary citizen has been recognized as
having great significance to his country and government.
   The apostle Paul admonishes us to respect the authority of the
government. Some governments may be ineffective, corrupt, and even
oppressive. But when a government enacts a law, be it good or bad,
the right thing to do is to respect and obey that law to the limits of a good
conscience.
   A Christian will obey the laws of his land out of an inner commitment
to love and justice. He understands the need for laws to govern man's
behavior and to preserve order in society. And because he recog-
nizes that civil authority comes from God, he will choose to be obedient to
secular laws under all circumstances, and in good conscience.

   Part 1     What is the source of the highest human authority?
Origin of
Authority     "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
            power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
            Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
            God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation"
            (Rom. 13:1, 2).
              In the experience of Israel, "God was the center of authority and
            government. Moses, as His representative, was to administer the
            laws in His name. Then came the council of seventy, then the
            priests and the princes, under these 'captains over fifties, and
            captains over tens' (Numbers 11:16, 17; Deuteronomy 1:15), and
            lastly, officers appointed for special duties."—Education, p. 37.
               In our present-day experiences, we often see the power of
            "captains," "princes," and "councilmen," but seldom do we
            think of them as servants of God from whom they have received
            authority.
               Even in church elections the officers may be elected by the
            congregation, but they really indirectly receive the authority from
            God, "the center of authority and government." Like the apos-
            tles, in God's name they administer the church business.
               In Commonwealth countries, on government envelopes are the
            words "On Her [His] Majesty's Service." We are God's servants
            doing His Divine Majesty's service.

             By contrast to the state, where does the church get her authority?
            Matt. 28:18; 16:18, 19. (See RSV.)
              The authority of the church is an agency authority. It does not
            reside in her, of herself. The Lord, who founded the church when
            He was here, called her to administer His authority in spiritual
            matters in His absence. He has not left her without a charter; He
            has placed supreme authority—in His absence—in His Word as
            interpreted to us by the Spirit of truth. In this Word is the record of
            unchanging, eternal principles which are an expression of God's
            own unchanging character. (See Heb. 13:8.)
               Jesus Christ, provides by His atonement the only basis for His
            law to be written in the hearts of believing sinners. Thus the
            atonement undergirds the authority of the church.
              How should I treat the servants of God?
              "Those who despise and reject the faithful servant of God show
            contempt, not merely for the man, but for the Master who sent
            him. It is God's words, His reproofs and counsel, that are set at
            nought; it is His authority that is rejected."—Patriarchs and
            Prophets, p. 605.

    Part 2        Should Christians pay tax to every kind of government?
 Authority
of Govern-     "This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's
     ment    servants, who give their full time to governing" (Rom. 13:6, NIV).

                Here the apostle Paul speaks about paying tax to the govern-
             ment. In the days of the Roman Empire, government was headed
             by a caesar, some good, some bad. When Paul wrote the Epistle to
             the Romans, Nero, the wicked king, was sitting on the throne in
             Rome. Nevertheless, Paul admonished the Roman Christians that
             they should not evade tax, but be honest in paying it. Should we
             not also respect government in this way today?
                Unfortunately, some ambitious and selfish people take God's
             authority into their hands and use it to exploit others to their own
             good. Because of this, respect for authority has eroded.
                In the twentieth century, wars and revolutions have changed
             many governments—not only in form, but also in the ideologies
             which shape these forms. As a result, there has been a great deal of
             conflict. Often authority is under attack, and respect for authority
             sinks to low levels. When there is no respect for authority, anarchy
             rules.
                "In the kingdoms of the world, position meant self-
             aggrandizement. The people were supposed to exist for the benefit
             of the ruling classes. Influence, wealth, education, were so many
             means of gaining control of the masses for the use of leaders. The
             higher classes were to think, decide, enjoy, and rule; the lower
             were to obey and serve. Religion, like all things else, was a matter
             of authority. The people were expected to believe and practice as
             their superiors directed. The right of man as man, to think and act
             for himself, was wholly unrecognized."—The Desire of Ages,
             p. 550.

               What is the nature of authority in the government of a home? Eph.
             5:21-25; 6:1.

               "Parents, make home happy for your children. . . . If you allow
             them to do as they please, their purity and loveliness of character
             will quickly fade. Teach them to obey. Let them see that your
             authority must be respected."—Child Guidance, p. 271.

                Over the centuries Christians have lived and worked under vari-

    Part 3      If God's authority over our lives is challenged, what should we do?
   Varying
Authorities     "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
              to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

                 Everywhere in the world, followers of Christ will need to con-
              sider carefully and prayerfully the meaning of today's text. To
              work cooperatively with government efforts to uplift and
              strengthen the citizens of each country is the Christian's privilege.
              He will cherish the freedom to worship, to meditate, to pray. He
              will show full respect for the consciences of those who may not
              share his understanding in all matters.
                 "We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of
              divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty,
              within its legitimate sphere."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 69.

                What is the true meaning of religious liberty? Rom. 14:5-10.

                On the basis of Bible prophecy, we look for religious powers
              especially to usurp the authority of God, His Word, and His
              church. Churches will trample conscience in the attempt to bring a
              kind of unity that it is hoped will save the world from destruction.
              Unity will call for conformity to human laws that will actually
              counter the authority of the laws of God. This was what brought
              the oppression and persecution that marked the rule of an apostate
              world church during the Dark Ages. But God had promised final
              deliverance to His loyal and loving children. They will cherish His
              will above life itself.
                In different parts of the world we can see a revival of the call for
              government to enforce moral principles.

                Why should God's people have to suffer for obeying His righteous
              law of love to God and man? (See Rev. 12:17; 13:11-17.)

                Seventh-day Adventists have long understood the challenge to
              individual conscience that Bible prophecy sees at the climax of
              history. (See The Great Controversy, p. 459.) It is the same kind of
              test as God's children have faced since the trouble between Cain
              and Abel. The apostolic church and the Reformation-era churches
              knew this conflict well. It is almost to be expected that the climax
              of the controversy between Christ and. Satan should be marked
              with a climactic confrontation.

   Part 4     What will be a Christian's attitude toward officers of the various
Fear as a   areas of government under which he lives?
  Motive
              "Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil" (Rom.
            13:3).

              The Christian will be an ideal citizen in any country in which he
            lives. He will be honest in all his dealings. He will not be a
            drunkard or one to provoke civic unrest. He will do an honest
            day's work for an honest day's pay. He will not interfere with or
            disturb the peace and harmony of his neighbors. He is appreciated
            by government officers at all levels because he is a peacemaker.
              For whom is a government official "the minister of God"? Rom.
            13:4.
              There is an obvious limit to our duty toward government au-
            thorities, but it is easy to think to justify disobedience to them
            because of their limited knowledge of truth or because of weak-
            nesses revealed.

              Why is it that even fear often fails to carry a restraining influence
            upon criminals? Eccl. 8:11.

               If God had destroyed Satan when he first rebelled or if Adam and
            Eve had died immediately after partaking of the forbidden fruit, all
            creatures in the universe would be so afraid of God that they would
            never even consider the possibility that God is love. In His great
            mercy God allowed sin to develop and show its effect. He also
            allowed the plan of salvation to unfold to vindicate His eternal love
            for men. That is why we are still alive today.
               There is no doubt that fear has limits in its power to reform. For
            example, smoking is hazardous to one's health; but because smok-
            ing does not immediately kill, many people continue to smoke. On
            the other hand, only those with wisdom know what to choose and
            what not to choose. To recognize evil and to refrain from doing evil
            are signs of maturity.
               Among other reasons, we fear God because He judges. But we
            don't have to be afraid of Him in that respect because Jesus Christ,
            our High Priest, has paid the penalty for our sins and has given us
            His robe of righteousness that we may not be shown filthy or naked
            before God. "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of
            grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
            need" (Heb. 4:16).

              How much respect do you show for the government in your own
            country?

     Part 5   What desired effect may Christians have on government?
The Motive
 for Doing   "Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same [the
     Good higher power or governor]" (Rom. 13:3). (Compare 1 Cor. 13:3.)

                  Honor and praise, especially from high officials, encourage
               many people to do good. A few do good because of fear. But even
               in this sinful world, the motive for much good is love.
                  There are many sources of power in the world today. Brute
               force, the power of armaments, the power of wealth, the power of
               superior education, the power of intellect, the power of persua-
               sion, the power of the majority. But any and all of these tend
               themselves to corruption on the part of the possessor and rebellion
               on the part of those dominated by them. Love is different. It may
               use any number of sources of power, but its way of applying power
               and its motive for so doing are truly selfless. It seeks only the
               benefit of its recipient. Like the heavenly merchantman, it only
               stands at the door and knocks. It does not batter the door down!
                  When every other means of persuasion has failed, love may find
               a way. (See 1 Corinthians 13.) It is both quiet and all-pervasive in
               its operation.

                 What may be a key factor in producing rebellion in society and in
               the church today? (See Eph. 2:2, 3; James 3:14-16.)

                  Every parent and every teacher, particularly, is troubled today
               over the question of the discipline of children. The long reign of a
               permissive philosophy has increased the size of the discipline
               problem in part because the dominant influence is so often against
               right-doing. On the other hand, independence of action is the road
               for some. Firm gentleness or gentle firmness is again called for.
                  "Wherever the power of intellect, of authority, or of force is
               employed, and love is not manifestly present, the affections and
               will of those whom we seek to reach assume a defensive, repelling
               position, and their strength of resistance is increased. Jesus was
               the Prince of Peace. He came into the world to bring resistance and
               authority into subjection to Himself. Wisdom and strength He
               could command, but the means He employed with which to over-
               come evil were the wisdom and strength of love."—Testimonies,
               vol. 2, pp. 135, 136.

                 Love may be slow in achieving the intended effect, but fear may
               achieve immediate results. This principle is true in the home, in the
               classroom, and in society. How much love and fear should the
               parent, the teacher, and the government express?

     Part 6   What should be the underlying reason for obedience to govern-
 Obey "for ment?
Conscience
    Sake"     "Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
            for conscience sake" (Rom. 13:5).

                 The Christian should be the most outstanding example of law-
               abiding citizenry in his community. Observance of speed limits,
               parking zones, rightful ownership of an unguarded stall in the
               marketplace, returning an overpayment of a bill—these are but
               examples from everyday life that challenge our relationship to law.

                 When the Christian's life is motivated by the law-loving example
               and justifying righteousness of Jesus Christ, his will is continually
               given up to the will of the Lord. He does not follow his own
               inclinations, nor does he depend upon himself for the carrying out
               of the will of Heaven.
                 "Obedience is the highest dictate of reason as well as of
               conscience."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 506.
                 Why should servants obey their masters? I Peter 2:18-20.

                 As servants of Christ we are all involved in obeying our Master.
               "Obedience to God is of more value to you than gold or silver.
               Yoking up with Christ, learning His meekness and lowliness, cuts
               short many a conflict; for when the enemy comes in like a flood,
               the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against him."—
               Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 95.
                 "It is better to request than to command; the one thus addressed
               has opportunity to prove himself loyal to right principles. His
               obedience is the result of choice rather than compulsion."—
               Education, p. 290.
                 One may obey grudgingly. Another may obey blindly. Still
               another may obey gladly. What is my attitude in obeying God's
               commandments and the law of the land?
                 How essential it is to remind ourselves constantly that there is
               no saving merit in our obedience to the laws of God or the laws of
               the land—even if rendered cheerfully! Human nature possesses an
               inborn and cultivated tendency to take credit for or to seek merit in
               obedience. But there can be no true obedience in the heart that
               does not know its own sinfulness, its own helplessness, its own
               utter dependence upon the all-sufficient merits of Jesus Christ.

                 "[ 1 John 2:4, 5; 3:24 quoted.] John did not teach that salvation
               was to be earned by obedience; but that obedience was the fruit of
               faith and love."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 563.

  "He said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the
sabbath" (Mark 2:27, 28).

   After having created the earth and everything in it, God set up an
institution, the Sabbath, a channel through which He might bless man-
kind. Even in the Garden of Eden where there was no sin, God saw
the need for setting aside one seventh of the human family's time for
communication with Him; for He knows our need to fellowship with
Him. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4).
   In order to accept this free gift from heaven, mankind must
believe in God. Ancient Israel died in the wilderness and lost the rest they
could have enjoyed in Canaan because they did not believe. "They
despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my
sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols" (Eze. 20:16). Yet God, in
His infinite love, offered the race another chance.
    Rightly observed, the Sabbath provides fellowship with God and re-
 minds us of the cross and the resurrection. This fellowship draws us
 into holiness and obedience. For six days we are busy with our own
affairs; but on the Sabbath, the seventh day, God wants us to pause, to
 look to Him, to think of His creative and redemptive acts. Thus we
 may renew our close friendship with Him and review our relation to our
 fellowmen. When we cease to meet and fellowship with God, we
 become selfish tyrants in our own "kingdom." We become proud and
 self-centered. Our love toward God and our fellowmen diminishes. To
 cure this malady God has designed the Sabbath and called upon us to
 keep it holy. By keeping the Sabbath, we were reminded that we are
 created by God, our loving heavenly Father. We learn to know as
 brothers and sisters those who call the same God their Father.
    On the Sabbath especially, by coming into communion with God, we
 enter a holy atmosphere akin to the peace that Adam and Eve
 enjoyed in the Garden of Eden. By having faith in God, we may gain what
 ancient Israel lost. In this atmosphere of fellowship with God and
  meditation upon Jesus, we will become like Him.
                                                                    41

                                                                     January 31

    Part 1        What sign has God given to man to show His sanctifying power?
   Sign of
Obedience       "I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
             if a man do, he shall even live in them. Moreover also I gave them my
             sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that I am the Lord that
             sanctify them" (Eze. 20:11, 12).

                There are two senses in which we are sanctified. Being united
             with God by faith, we shall be sanctified, be wholly consecrated,
             by "the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord"
             (Heb. 12:14, ASV). The presence of God sanctifies. By entering
             into His holy presence in holy time—the Sabbath—we are espe-
             cially set apart.
                The Sabbath has been given to the world as the sign that God is
             both Creator and Sanctifier. The power that created all things is the
             power that re-creates the soul in God's own likeness. The Sabbath
             day is the sign of the lifework of sanctification to those who keep it
             holy. True sanctification involves being set apart to God's service
             and receiving power to live in harmony with God. It grows in
             dependence upon the merits of Jesus and in the consequent loving
             obedience to the law—those principles that are the transcript of
             God's character. The keeping of the Sabbath becomes a sign of
             allegiance to God by the one who, from the heart, obeys the fourth
             commandment. The same person will obey the whole law.
               "Obedience to all the commandments of God is the only true
             sign of sanctification."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
             Commentary, vol. 7, p. 908.

               Is the Sabbath a sign only in the Old Testament period? (See
             Ex. 31:16; Luke 23:54-56; Acts 13:44, 45.)

                "We are to bear witness to all nations, kindreds, and tongues
             that we are a people who love and fear God, a people who keep
             holy His memorial of creation, the sign between Him and His
             obedient children that He sanctifies them."—Testimonies, vol. 7,
             p. 107.
                "The Sabbath is a sign of Christ's power to make us holy. And it
             is given to all whom Christ makes holy. As a sign of His sanctifying
             power, the Sabbath is given to all who through Christ become a
             part of the Israel of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 288.
                It is so essential that we continually remember that our accep-
             tance with God has already been completed in Jesus Christ. Noth-
             ing that we can do by obedience to the commandments can add one
             particle to the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ.
               The cross and baptism are symbols of Christianity. Do they, like
             the Sabbath, serve as signs of sanctification?

     Part 2    In what setting did Jesus Christ show us one aspect of the true
    What Is   meaning of Sabbath observance?
     Lawful
on Sabbath      "He saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or
              to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace" (Mark
              3:4).

                Whatever Jesus did on the Sabbath and whatever the Holy Spirit
              prompts us to do is "lawful."
                "As God ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon the
              Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his
              daily life, and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to
              worship, and to holy deeds. The work of Christ in healing the sick
              was in perfect accord with the law. It honored the Sabbath."—The
              Desire of Ages, p. 207.
                "According to the fourth commandment the Sabbath was dedi-
              cated to rest and religious worship. All secular employment was to
              be suspended, but works of mercy and benevolence were in accor-
              dance with the purpose of the Lord. They were not to be limited to

                What did Jesus do on Sabbath? Luke 4:16; Matt. 12:12, 13.

                The Lord of the Sabbath is certainly a safe example for us to
              follow in our observance of the day. For Him it was not a day of
              idleness or merely a catch-up-on-sleep day following excessive
              labor or selfish activity during the week. It was a day of worship in
              synagogue and mountain, a day of fellowship with those dear to
              Him and with those to whom He ministered. As with the other
              days of the week, it was one for showing mercy and bringing
              healing to the needy souls everywhere present. Not by His design
              was it a day of controversy, but it became such, at times, as the
              Lord sought to deliver His day from the erroneous attitudes
              toward it which had grown up over the centuries of Israel's experi-
              ence.
                 The Jewish teachers had failed to see, in the Sabbath, God's
              sweetest invitation to them as individual persons to keep an ap-
              pointment with Him, a personal and loving God, the Creator and
              Sustainer of life and all things in the universe—and particularly on
              this earth.

                How could Seventh-day Adventists emphasize more what we
              should do on Sabbath rather than what we should not do?

 Part 3     What pharisaical concept of Sabbath observance conflicted with
 Letter   Jesus' Sabbath activities?
Versus
 Spirit      "It came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
          sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears
          of corn. And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
          sabbath day that which is not lawful?" (Mark 2:23, 24).

             The fourth commandment is stated positively. It is a command
          to do something that requires us to be something. Unlike the eight
          commands which are couched in the setting of "Thou shalt not,"
          this commandment exhorts us to remember and to keep the Sab-
          bath.

           What concept regarding law does Paul introduce in his letters?
          Rom. 2:29; 7:6; 2 Cor. 3:6.

            As with the rest of the Ten Commandments, the fourth deals
          with spirit as well as letter. With the best of intentions, the Jewish
          teachers had hedged the Sabbath in with multiple regulations of
          their own invention in the effort to enforce upon the people the
          sacred observance of the day. They knew their checkered history
          was in part the result of forgetting the Sabbath. But there is no
          blessing in the letter of the law. The blessing is in its spirit—the
          inward aspect of the law. Sabbath observance, to be a joy and a
          blessing, must be a special time devoted to fellowship with our best
          Friend. But if we have no relationship with Him, the Sabbath is a
          burden and a bore—a good work grudgingly performed with the
          hope of avoiding a penalty.

            Consider the attitude of heart that may have produced ancient
          breakdowns in Sabbath observance. Jer. 17:19-27; Neh. 13:15-22.

            It is not wise to reject out of hand the "mechanics"of Sabbath
          observance. As kneeling reinforces the spirit of reverence, so acts
          of Sabbath respect may strengthen our sense of its sacredness.
            "The rabbis reduced the Sabbath to an absurdity by their rigid
          and meaningless distinction between what might and what might
          not be done on that day.... They emphasized the negative aspect
          of Sabbath observance—of refraining from certain things. The
          forms of religion were set forth as the substance of it."—S.D.A.
          Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 589.

     Part 4     For whom and for what reason was the Sabbath made?
   Purpose
of Sabbath      "He said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man
 and God's    for the sabbath" (Mark 2:27).
       Law
                God meant it when He said that the Sabbath was made for man.
              Man was created before the Sabbath was made. God needed no
              rest from His labors. But man needed a continual reminder that
              God is the Creator and Sustainer of all. He also needed a special
              time in which to put aside the joyous labors of Eden and devote
              himself wholly to fellowship with and worship of his God. There-
              fore, in the Garden of Eden the Sabbath was made for man—Adam
              and his wife. Their soon forgetting of what God had told them is
              evidence enough of how much they needed the "remember"
              commandment. (See Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 582, 583.)

                Note Christ's personal involvement with the Sabbath day. Matt.
              12:8.

                "God did not create man because He had a Sabbath and needed
              someone to keep it. Rather, an All-wise Creator knew that man,
              the creature of His hand, needed opportunity for moral and
              spiritual growth, for character development. He needed time in
              which his own interests and pursuits should be subordinated to a
              study of the character and will of God as revealed in nature, and
              later, in revelation. The seventh-day Sabbath was ordained of God
              to meet this need. To tamper in any way with the Creator's specifi-
              cations as to when and how the day should be observed is tan-
              tamount to denying that God knows what is best for the creatures
              of His hand.
                 "God ordained that the Sabbath should be a blessing, not a
              burden, and it is to man's interest and not his injury to observe it. It
              was designed to increase his happiness, not to work a hardship on
              him."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 588.

                The purpose of God's law is to make us aware of our sins and to
              restrain us from committing wrong. Can the same law sanctify us?

                 When God's law is enshrined in the heart, so that the believer
              truly loves God's law, there grows within that heart a loathing for
              sin. A call to respect the rights of the fellowman inscribed on the
              second table of the law also grows. So the law is a shield between
              man and man. It encourages growing respect and concern for the
              other, whoever and whatever he may be—boss or subordinate,
              father or son, teacher or student. The principles of the law are
              eternal and unchangeable. (See Education, pp. 76, 77.)

       Part 5     Consider the scripture in which Paul may have used the Sabbath
   Faith and    as an example or illustration of entering into Christ's rest.
the Sabbath
                  "He that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
                works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that
                rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief" (Heb.
                4:10, 11). (Compare 1 John 5:3-5.)

                   The kind of faith that trusts in God for the "rest" of salvation is
                also the heart of true Sabbath rest. Faith in God is essential to a life
                of holiness, of which the Sabbath is a sign. Likewise, in the day
                soon to come when Sabbath keepers will be severely persecuted it
                will require great faith to be a Seventh-day Adventist.
                   In the present general climate of growing tolerance for devia-
                tions from normal—let alone Christian—behavior, it seems im-
                possible to believe that there will ever be a penalty upon those who
                elect to observe the outward sign of the law in the heart—the
                Sabbath. But in some lands of earth there is, even now, severe
                persecution of any who bear the name of Christ.
                   Seventh-day Adventists, in the line of the historical school of
                prophetic interpretation, have long understood and anticipated a
                final time of religious confrontation. In it the conscience of the
                minority will be pressed in the interest of a form of unity of belief
                and practice designed to save the world from extinction. (See The
                Great Controversy, pp. 582-592.)
                   And what, besides a miracle-supported "Lord's Day," could be
                seen as the greatest unifying symbol in the Christian world? And
                how will the deviating Sabbath observers fare then?
                   Already Christian groups numbering in the millions are begin-
                ning to advocate a Christian domination of politics and govern-
                ments. There are groups reacting against the "freedoms" that
                have been won at considerable price by various movements since
                the 1950s. A few shifts of power and emphasis can bring on the
                prophesied violation of conscience. Protest by violence is even
                now threatening the fabric of society on an international level. (See
                Revelation 13 and The Great Controversy, p. 592.)
                  The saints will need to enter by faith both into God's rest of
                salvation and dedication to Him and His Sabbath if they are to be
                kept true in such a time.

                  Why could not the ancient Lsraelites enjoy God's Canaan peace
                and rest? Heb. 3:16-19.

                  What is the relationship of faith and obedience as the saints
                prepare for the eternal rest?

    Part 6       What do sanctification and Sabbath observance have in common
          A   in terms of human experience?
Sanctifying
Experience      "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
              pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
              the Lord, honourable, and shalt honour him, not doing thine own
              ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:
              then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to
              ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage
              of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it" (Isa.
              58:13, 14).

                 Unless a Christian willingly and gladly observes the Sabbath and
              truly calls it a delight, keeping the Sabbath cannot be a sign of his
              sanctification. When known to him, the believer cannot be indif-
              ferent to God's personal invitation for fellowship on the Sabbath.
              He cannot be careless with the Sabbath and at the same time
              experience the close fellowship and surrender of the will to God
              that is basic to the process of sanctification. We cannot profess
              wholehearted love for God while the bleating of the sheep of our
              Sabbath violations is sounding in His ear! (See 1 Samuel 15.) Only
              a holy person can keep a holy day. Only one wholly for God can
              keep a day holy. For that person the Sabbath is a sign of the
              sanctification process at work in his life.
                 "To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative
              and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they
              delight themselves in Him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 289.

                What extraordinary experience did John have on Patmos on a
              Sabbath? Rev. 1:10-19.

                 Perhaps it was only a coincidence that this man of God was so
              blessed by his Lord on the Sabbath day. Perhaps not (see S.D.A.
              Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 955). John was by nature a "son of
              thunder," but under the discipline of Christ and heaven he had
              been transformed into a meek and gentle follower of the Lord
              Jesus. His constant burden for the church in his later ministry was
              that its members—whom he addressed as "my little children"—
              should-love one another. (See 1 John 4:7.) God can entrust to such
              a life revelations of Himself and His purposes for the church and
              the world. It would have been quite fitting for the Lord of the
              Sabbath to give His servant on that day the greatest revelation of
              Jesus that he had ever received.
                 To what extent am I getting all the benefits that I should get in
               observing the Sabbath?

     "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right" (Eph. 6:1).

   Of all the different kinds of human relations subject to the inward law,
 the first and most basic is that between the child and his parents. From
 this develop all other human relations. If one does not have a
satisfying relation with his parents, the development of his personality and
the building of other human relations may be threatened. Regardless of
a family's economic situation, father, mother, and children have roles
in the family that are not repeated in society as a whole.
   The fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents. But implied
in this command is the principle that parents are to teach their children and
to love them in such a way that children will return to parents continu-
ing respect and honor.
   Regardless of the family background or setting, the children are born
dependent. Each one deserves the parents' total attention and lots of
love, without which the child will grow up not knowing how to accept or
respond to love.
   Children have a responsibility toward their parents too. They must not
neglect to respect their parents, especially when parents are old, sick, or
handicapped—times when they most need the sympathy, love, and
support of their children. Even though parents may have adequate wealth
and be physically well cared for, they have psychological needs—they
need love from their children. Their loneliness and their hunger for love
can be satisfied only by genuine love from their children.
   Loving sons and daughters will find frequent occasions for show-
ing love to their parents. Jesus once condemned the Pharisees for their
legalistic and cold attitudes toward their parents. While no law can
compel sons or daughters to love their parents, they should rely on no
tradition or custom as an excuse from fulfilling the inward law of love.
   Be that as it may, it is not enough just to love the members of the
immediate family. Christ has taught us to enlarge our family to include
everybody. He teaches us to address God as our heavenly Father. Thus
we all become brothers and sisters.

    Part 1    What God-given duty do children have toward their parents?
 The First
Command-      "Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment
ment With with promise;) that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live
  Promise long on the earth" (Eph. 6:2, 3).

                 Children naturally love parents. Only the selfish would do
              otherwise. To love parents means giving time to, saying or sending
              words of affection to, or doing something for them.
                 "Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due
              to no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a
              responsibility for the souls committed to their charge, has or-
              dained that during the earlier years of life, parents shall stand in the
              place of God to their children. And he who rejects the rightful
              authority of his parents is rejecting the authority of God. The fifth
              commandment requires children not only to yield respect, submis-
              sion, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
              tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to
              succor and comfort them in old age."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
              p. 308.
                 "The honor here spoken of [in Eph. 6:2] is not a sentimental
              respect, but actual obedience. A divine comment on this principle
              is given in Matt. 15:4-8. Honor may be thought of as the attitude
              from which obedience springs, and it should be observed that this
               honor is due both father and mother. One is not to be placed before
               the other in esteem. This honor is shown in a variety of ways. It
               includes the little attentions that youth should show to age, confi-
              dence in the word and judgment of the parents, and loyalty to the
              family name and integrity.
                  "Not only is it natural that obedience should be given to parents,
               but it is God's express will. It is the first commandment in the
               Decalogue to which a promise is specifically attached; indeed, it is
               altogether unique in that respect. . . . Special blessing is promised
               upon those who obey their parents."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
               vol. 6, p. 1040.

                Under what conditions, if any, should children not obey their
              parents? Eph. 6:1.

                We should obey "in the Lord" our parents. Since parents are
              human and some perhaps have not accepted Christ, we may not
              always be able to obey them "in the Lord." If the parents' wishes
              or commands are contrary to the Lord's, we should obey the Lord,
              for He has the higher wisdom and His way is perfect.

                 What kind of world would we be in if children did not respect or

 Part 2     How does Isaiah compare a mother's feelings for her child with the
Family    Lord's feelings toward us?
  Ties
            "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
          compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I
          not forget thee." (Isa. 49:15).

            "When children love and repose confidence in their mother, and
          have become obedient to her, they have been taught the first
          lessons in becoming Christians."—My Life Today, p. 164.
            In today's economy, more and more young mothers are working
          outside the home—many times of necessity. This makes God's
          ideal for the home that much more difficult to fulfill. How can the
          mother be the child's sunshine in the most protective and comfort-
          ing place on earth if she cannot be there much of the time? So often
          she must entrust to another—who does not always have reason to
          care—the privilege of loving and training her child.

            How should fathers, as authority figures, show their love toward
          their children? Eph. 6:4.

             "Fathers, spend as much time as possible with your children.
          Seek to become acquainted with their various dispositions, that
          you may know how to train them in harmony with the Word of
          God. Never should a word of discouragement pass your lips. Do
          not bring darkness into the home. Be pleasant, kind, and affection-
          ate toward your children, but not foolishly indulgent. Let them
          bear their little disappointments, as every one must. Do not.eti;.

          another. Teach them to bear with one another and to seek to
          maintain each other's confidence and respect."—The Adventist
          Home, p. 222.
             Is it possible that in this "enlightened" age, there are parents
          who are dictatorial, gruff, and authoritarian? Many complain that
          parents are too indulgent of and permissive toward their children.
          Be that as it may, it is vital to remember that for the little child,
          the parent provides the basic impression of what God is like. So it is
          important that the treatment of the child be governed by an affec-
          tionate discipline. The parent who never plays with children is
          probably missing the best of opportunities to reveal love, interest,
          and acceptance. When we expect more of a child than he is able to
          deliver, we may be giving him a false impression of the character of
          God. We may also be robbing him of self-worth. This may hamper
          all his future development and happiness in the Lord.
             If the father loved the prodigal son as he did, why did the son want
          to leave home?

     Part 3     In the setting of controversy over ceremonial strictness, in what
Respect for   words did Jesus repeat Moses' emphasis on reverence for parents?
   Parents
                "Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
              commandments of men. . . . Full well ye reject the commandment of
              God, that ye may keep your own tradition. For Moses said, Honour
              thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let
              him die the death" (Mark 7:7-10).

                While no other obligations should be used as excuses to neglect
              responsibility toward parents, parents also have a responsibility to
              love and to educate their children. Unless the children are taught
              to honor their father and mother, not only by words, but by
              example, they will not know how to do it.
                "Teach your children to honor you, because the law of God lays
              this duty upon children. If you allow your children to lightly
              esteem your wishes and pay no regard to the laws of the house-
              hold, you are winking at sin; you are permitting the devil to work as
              he will; and the same insubordination, want of reverence, and love
              of self will be carried with them even into the religious life and into
              the church."—Child Guidance, pp. 87, 88.
                 Our children, after all, know best what kind of Christian we are.
              They sense, almost instinctively, when all is well. They are quick
              to forgive, if we could ever bring ourselves to acknowledge to them
              our failings and wrongs. They can even forgive us for the contrast
              that too often exists between our church-pew image and our at-
              home image.

                 How does respect for parents relate to their care in old age?

                There may be a question of how much time and how much
              money the children are willing to give. If the family situation
              permits a woman to quit her job and stay home to take care of
              elderly parents, she provides the comfort and love that would be
              difficult to find in an institution. On the other hand, if everybody in
              the family needs to work, the nursing home may have to provide
              necessary care.

                 Should children send their aging parents to a home for the aged?

                 Once this topic was hotly debated between a Westernized
              Chinese and an old-fashioned Chinese. The former felt that it is a
              crime to keep the aging parents home where they cannot get
              adequate physical care. But the latter contended that it is more
              cruel to send the aging father or mother to an impersonal institu-
              tion and let him or her die in loneliness.

     Part 4     What complaint did the Lord bring against some of His people in
  Tradition   regard to a pious method they had for ignoring the needs of parents?
    Versus
:ommand-        "But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Cor-
      ment    ban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
              by me; he shall be free. And ye suffer him no more to do ought for
              his father or his mother" (Mark 7:11, 12).

                 Often we pay much attention to the trivial and unimportant, but
              forget the essential. We exalt the traditional but neglect the com-
              mandment. So it was in the setting recorded in Mark 7:1-23. The
              Pharisees were accusing Christ's disciples because they failed to
              carry out the ceremonial washings required by rabbinical tradi-
              tion. In responding to them, Jesus pointed out a procedure which
              they had invented by which to appear pious and yet neglect to care
              for their aged parents. By assigning property to the temple, they
              would have use of it during their own lifetimes, but could not share
              it with parents.
                 "Jesus made no attempt to defend Himself or His disciples. He
              made no reference to the charges against Him, but proceeded to
              show the spirit that actuated these sticklers for human rites. He
              gave them an example of what they were repeatedly doing, and had
              done just before coming in search of Him. . . . They set aside the
              fifth commandment as of no consequence, but were very exact in
              carrying out the traditions of the elders."—The Desire of Ages,
              pp. 396, 397.

                 What good motive undergirded much of the ritual burden which
              the rabbis of Jesus' day imposed upon the people? How did this lead
              to the accusations against Jesus?

                The Jews knew that their neglect of the Ten Commandments of
              God and the law of ceremonies, which illustrated the plan of
              salvation, had led to their falling into the hands of the heathen as
              God withdrew His protection. Determined to remedy past errors,
              they made laws upon laws to make it impossible for anyone to fail
              on the basic ones. The only problem was that these laws did not
              work!

                In our relationship with parents and children, what does God
              require from us?

                We need constantly to consider our motives in what we do for
              those who are too young or too old to discern, let alone defend
              themselves against our handling of their affairs.

  Part 5     What example did Jesus set, as a child, in obeying His parents?
 Jesus'
Example      "He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject
           unto them" (Luke 2:51).

              In a peasant's home Jesus faithfully and cheerfully acted His
            part in bearing the burdens of the household. Here was the Com-
            mander of heaven, whose word angels had delighted to fulfill, now
            doing the work of a willing servant, a loving, obedient son. Work-
            ing with His own hands in the carpenter's shop with Joseph, Jesus
            learned a trade.
              When we read that Jesus learned obedience by the things which
            He suffered (Heb. 5:8), we surely must consider the fact that for
            some 18 years after He realized who He really was, He went back
           •home to Nazareth with Mary and Joseph and was obedient to their
            requirements.

             While He was hanging on the cross, what provision did Jesus make
           for His mother? John 19:26, 27.

              For all time, Jesus has left us the perfect example of a loving and
           caring son of a widowed mother. While suffering agonies that have
           no basis of comparison in human experience, He thought of the
           safety, security, and welfare of His dependent mother. "Looking
           into her grief-stricken face and then upon John, He said to her,
           `Woman, behold thy son!' then to John, 'Behold thy mother!' John
           understood Christ's words, and accepted the trust. He at once
           took Mary to his home, and from that hour cared for her tenderly.
           0 pitiful, loving Saviour; amid all His physical pain and mental
           anguish, He had a thoughtful care for His mother! He had no
           money with which to provide for her comfort; but He was en-
           shrined in the heart of John, and He gave His mother to him as a
           precious legacy. Thus He provided for her that which she most
            needed,—the tender sympathy of one who loved her because she
            loved Jesus. . . .

              "The perfect example of Christ's filial love shines forth with un-
            dimmed luster from the mist of ages. .. . Even in His last agony, He
            remembers to provide for His sorrowing, widowed mother. The
            same spirit will be seen in every disciple of our Lord. Those who
            follow Christ will feel that it is a part of their religion to respect and
            provide for their parents."—The Desire of Ages, p. 752.

              Is Jesus' example relevant today? Have the times changed so much
            that we simply can no longer use Him as our Model?

   Part 6     In the setting of family relationships, with what new title did Jesus
     Our    teach His disciples to address God?
Heavenly
  Father      "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
            heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (Matt. 6:9).

              We who have grown up with the Lord's Prayer can have little
            sense of the surprising nature of the title which Jesus gave to the
            Sovereign of the universe when He introduced Him as "Our
            Father." The religious teachers of Christ's day stressed God's
            power, majesty, rulership, and awesomeness. They had little
            thought for the paternal warmth of divine love and care.
              Those of us who have been blessed in our childhood and youth
            with a loving and lovable human father can little understand the
            problem faced by those who have not. For such, the suggestion
            that God is a "Father" can have negative impressions. Soul win-
            ners may need to keep this possibility in mind and offer to their
            hearers other names and comparisons of God that will have more
            positive counterparts in their own experience.

              Since God is our Father, there may be some "family" relation-
            ships with all the members of the church. (See Luke 8:19-21; Matt.
            23:8; 2 Tim. 1:2).

               By calling God our Father, we recognize our fellowmen as
            brothers and sisters. In doing so, we extend our family circle to
            include all who call Him "heavenly Father." When this new rela-
            tionship is truly established worldwide, there will be no war, no
            crime, and no hatred. Only love will rule in the hearts of men.

              How does the psalmist describe God's love toward us? Ps.
            103:11-13.

               If we realized how much God loves us and responded with love,
            we would love to do His will. To serve Him would be a delight.
               "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
            Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our
            thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity
            to His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our
            own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest
            delight in doing His service."—The Desire of Ages, p. 668.

              If we love our earthly father because he loves us, how much more
            should we love our heavenly Father whose love toward us cannot be
            measured?

  "Thou shalt not kill" (Ex. 20:13).

   Concerning another aspect of the inward law, God declares that
life is sacred. Other than God, no one can create life. Once life is taken,
no human effort can remedy the loss. With life, gone, wealth, fame,
power, or even love mean nothing. In order to enjoy any of these, man
must have life.
   We all have life in us, but what is life? Definition is most difficult. Life
has many aspects. It is the gift of God. It is more than a phenomenon.
With the aid of modern medical equipment, an unconscious person
can be kept. physically alive yet have no conscious "life." On the other
hand, consciousness itself is not an indispensable factor to life. We all
recognize that there is life in a sleeping person.
    The opposite of life is death—coldness, immobility, silence, and the
absence of all vital signs. Death also means decay, decomposition,
and disappearance. While a few people have had their thoughts written
down, or their activities recorded on film or videotape, the great
majority of the world's population are not remembered after their
death. They soon pass into oblivion.
    God is the Creator of life. In Him and only in Him is life. When
 God created man, He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
 became a living soul" (Gen. 2:7). It is from that beginning that we
 inherit life.
    If man had continued to live in God's love and obeyed Him, he would
 have continued to enjoy the fruit of the tree of life and would have
 lived forever. Unfortunately, he lost paradise; and death—or the absence
 of life—has come to mankind. In fact, we lose vitality every moment.
    Inasmuch as life is so precious, we must not give any thought to
 taking life. We should do everything we can to preserve life—the life of
 others and our own. In the fifth chapter of Matthew, Jesus Christ has
 enlarged the definition of killing. If we hate, if we get angry with one
 another we are taking his life, at least a portion of his life. Likewise, if
 one hates himself, loses the purpose of life, or becomes intemperate, he
 also kills a portion of his own life.

    Part .1     Contrary to scientific speculations, what is the true origin of
 God, the     human life?
Life-giver
                "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
              breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
              soul" (Gen. 2:7).

                 "God is the life-giver. From the beginning all His laws were
              ordained to life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 522.
                "All life-giving power is from Him."—The Ministry of Healing,
              p. 113.
                 "In God we live and move and have our being. Each heart-beat,
              each breath, is the inspiration of Him who breathed into the
              nostrils of Adam the breath of life."—Ellen G. White Comments,
              S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1081.

                Through whom was life created? John 1:1-4; Col. 1:15-17.

                 We derive life from Jesus Christ. His life is original and unbor-
              rowed. Within ourselves we may have a small stream from the
              fountain of life, but He is the fountain of life itself. God gives us
              life, and He takes it back to Himself again. When Christ shall
              appear, if our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall also appear
              with Him in glory. (See Medical Ministry, p. 7.)
                 Through Jesus Christ the life that was lost through sin is given
              back to the believer. Christ has life in Himself and so is able to give
              life to those who choose to live in Him. Only God has the right and
              power to give immortality. As man, Christ voluntarily laid down
              His life that He might purchase the right to give eternal life to as
              many as will receive Him. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 786, 787.)

                How will God give life back to the saints? 1 Cor. 15:20-22, 51-54.

                 The same Saviour who restored an only son to a dependent
              widow, who called a little girl back to life at the request of her
              influential but grieving father, who put surging life in a body
              already suffering decay will one day restore life to all within whose
              hearts and minds He has dwelt by His Spirit during their earthly
              sojourn. So sure is His promise that He speaks of eternal life as the
              present possession of all who believe. (See 1 John 5:13.) The
              glorious morning of the resurrection will witness the bestowal of
              immortality on all the redeemed. God haste the day!

               A piece of tissue can be kept alive in the laboratory indefinitely.
              What does this have to do with immortality?

    Part 2     Why did Jesus come to die for man? What is the value of one soul?
The Value
   of Life      "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
             whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
             life" (John 3:16).

                "Christ endured shame and agony and death for us. . . . Jesus
             died, not only to make atonement for us, but to be our pattern. Oh,
             wondrous condescension! matchless love!"—Testimonies, vol. 5,
             p. 17.

               Relate the Source of life to the value of life. 1 John 5:11, 12; Acts
             17:24, 25, 28.

               In order to allow the innocent to have a chance against the law of
             revenge, what provision was made in ancient Israel? Joshua 20:1-3.

                Compared to those of other nations and cultures of their day, the
             laws of Israel showed a profound respect for human life. In a trial
             for murder the accused was not to be condemned on the testimony
             of one witness, even though circumstantial evidence might be
             strong against him. The Lord's direction was, "Whoso killeth any
             person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of
             witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to
             cause him to die" (Num. 35:30).
                At the same time, should the guilt of the one accused of murder
             be substantiated by adequate testimony of sufficient witnesses,
             the sentencing and punishment must not be avoided. "Whoso
             sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed" (Gen. 9:6).
              "Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is
             guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death" (Num. 35:31).
              "Thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die" (Ex.
             21:14). "The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed
              therein, but by the blood of him that shed it" (Num. 35:33).
                In Christ we find "a city of refuge" where we can escape
              vengeful hands. Our present life is precious, for once it is taken,
              nobody can give it back except God perform a miracle. God makes
              provision to give man eternal life in Christ Jesus. He even allows
              Christ to be man's attorney-at-law and his Substitute.

                When one loses his life, he loses all his intellect, memory, proper-
             ties, love relations, and the ability to enjoy things in life. In man's
             eyes, one life may be more valuable than another. Why is it that God
             values all lives equally, whether rich or poor, wise or simple.

       Part 3   What change of relationship takes place as the Lord confronts
 Killing—an Cain with the unacceptability of his offering? Gen. 4:9-16.
,wful Crime
                "Cain the murderer was soon called to answer for his crime... .
                "God had given Cain an opportunity to confess his sin. He had
              had time to reflect. He knew the enormity of the deed he had done,
              and of the falsehood he had uttered to conceal it; but he was
              rebellious still, and sentence was no longer deferred. The divine
              voice that had been heard in entreaty and admonition pronounced
              the terrible words: 'And now art thou cursed from the earth, which
              hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy
              hand. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
              unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in
              the earth.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 77.

                 In divine teaching following the Flood, how was the sacredness of
              life preserved? Gen. 9:5, 6.

                What does the law of Moses stipulate as punishment for a mur-
              derer?

               "If he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a
              murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death" (Num. 35:16).

                 " 'Thou shalt not kill.'
                 "All acts of injustice that tend to shorten life; the spirit of hatred
              and revenge, or the indulgence of any passion that leads to injuri-
              ous acts toward others, or causes us even to wish them harm (for
               `whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer'); a selfish neglect of
              caring for the needy or suffering; all self-indulgence or unneces-
              sary deprivation or excessive labor that tends to injure health—all
              these are, to a greater or less degree, violations of the sixth
              commandment."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 308.
                 In the system of justice ordained by the God of Israel, no
              partiality was accorded because the accused had rank or wealth.
              Human life must be sacredly guarded.
                 The Lord even held a city or community accountable if it con-
              spired with the accused to work out an exemption from punish-
              ment in the case of murder. "The Lord designed to impress upon
              His people the terrible guilt of murder, while He would make the
              most thorough and merciful provision for the acquittal of the
              innocent."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-

    Part 4      What is one of the motives that may lead to murder?
 A Motive
for Killing      "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
              kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: but I
              say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a
              cause shall be in danger of the judgment" (Matt. 5:21, 22).

                The clear teaching of Jesus is that murder first exists in the heart.
              Hatred in the heart sets the feet in the path of the murderer, and
              even the offerings of such a one are abhorrent to God. The only
              sure remedy for such a spirit of hatred is the implantation of the
              love of Christ in the heart through the Holy Spirit.
                "It was envy that made Saul miserable and put the humble
              subject of his throne in jeopardy. What untold mischief has this
              evil trait of character worked in our world. The same enmity
              existed in the heart of Saul that stirred the heart of Cain against his
              brother Abel, because Abel's works were righteous, and God
              honored him, and his own works were evil, and the Lord could not
              bless him. Envy is the offspring of pride, and if it is entertained in
              the heart, it will lead to hatred, and eventually to revenge and
              murder. Satan displayed his own character in exciting the fury of
              Saul against him who had never done him harm."—Patriarchs and
              Prophets, p. 651.

                 What perilous days will, or have, come to us when crime will seem
              to be without restraint? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

                 The time may be here when man's conscience will be totally
              benumbed regarding life's sacredness, and killing will become ex-
              tremely common. When warfare seems inevitably to glorify the
              skillful taking of life, when movies, novels, and TV shows portray
              killing as heroic, perhaps there is no surprise in the sharp increase
              of murders.

                 How does God judge man—by his actions or by his motives?

                A story is told of a cannibal who once asked a civilized person:
              "Why do you kill so many people in war? You cannot eat them all!
              Is it not rather wasteful to kill so many?" Who has the higher
              standard of conscience, the cannibal or the so-called civilized
              person?
                Although the sixth commandment is concerned with murder,
              the wanton killing of animals could reduce the sense of the sacred-
              ness of life. Men kill animals for no other purpose than fun. Many
              are also killed for the value of their skins, tusks, or other body
              parts.

   Part 5   Concerning reconciliation, what admonition does the Prince of
 Recon- Peace give to His followers?
ciliation
            "If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy
          brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar,
          and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and
          offer thy gift" (Matt. 5:23).

               The spirit of heaven is love and forgiveness. Christ came to help
            us to be reconciled to God and to men. Love takes away the hatred
            which motivates one to kill. But God's love does not sacrifice
            justice.
               "One of Christ's last commands to His disciples was 'Love one
            another as I have loved you.' John 13:34. Do we obey this com-
            mand, or are we indulging sharp, un-Christlike traits of character?
            If we have in any way grieved or wounded others it is our duty to
            confess our fault and seek for reconciliation. This is an essential
            preparation that we may come before God in faith, to ask His
            blessing."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 144.
               On the other hand we may need to remind ourselves that differ-
            ences of opinion or conviction need not show a lack of Christian
            charity or friendliness. We should not take offense over honest and
            legitimate differences of understanding of truth. Any such differ-
            ences do not need to be regarded as grounds for confession of
            ill will or wrongdoing toward the one holding opposing views. At
            the same time, there is great weight to the biblical question, "Can
            two walk together except they be agreed?" (Amos 3:3).

              What advice does Jesus give us in His Sermon on the Mount that
            indicates Heaven's blessing on efforts to reconcile? Matt. 5:9.

               There is a frame of mind that looks for trouble everywhere and
            all the time. There is a constant suspicion of another's motives and
            a tendency to make a mountain out of every molehill of difference
            or fault. It is of the essence of the inward law that we minimize
            blemishes or stumblings, giving for as long as possible the benefit
            of the doubt. Seeking the best, seeing the best in every situation
            will be the prevailing disposition.

              Can we be truly zealous for God while harboring hatred toward a
            brother or sister? (See 1 John 2:9-11.)

              It is probable that the time of prayer will bring before us a
            reminder of any such person, and our feelings toward them. This
            may be the practical outworking of the text for today.

   Part 6     What seemingly unreasonable act has Jesus required of His fol-
Love, the   lowers?
 Cure for
  Hatred      "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
            neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your
            enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
            and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you"
            (Matt. 5:43, 44).

               We are to love our enemies with the same love that Christ
            manifested toward His enemies by giving His life to save them.
               "The heart in which love rules will not be filled with passion or
            revenge, by injuries which pride and self-love would deem unbear-
            able. Love is unsuspecting, ever placing the most favorable con-
            struction upon the motives and acts of others. Love will never
            needlessly expose the faults of others. It does not listen eagerly to
            unfavorable reports, but rather seeks to bring to mind some good
            qualities of the one defamed."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 168, 169.

              Who is my neighbor? Luke 10:29-37.

              Many of us excuse ourselves with the thought that, although we
            love God, it is impossible for us to love those miserable creatures
            known as our fellowmen. The apostle John equates our love for
            God with the love we show to those whose lives we touch day by
            day. (See 1 John 4:12, 20.) This is because Christian love is a
            principle, not a feeling. We cannot generate it within ourselves or
            will it into existence by some form of meditation or self-analysis.
            The cross of Jesus is the source of true love. Acceptance of its
            revelation of God's love for all mankind, including the •ungrateful
            and unbelieving, creates in us an echo of that love.

              What room is there in Christianity for the possibility that certain
            individuals are kindred spirits and others not? Think of David and
            Jonathan; Naomi and Ruth; Jesus and John the Beloved; Jesus and
            Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. (See Prov. 18:24.)

              It seems clear that God has no objection to the reality of kindred
            spirits. One novel suggestion is that we are all descendants of
            certain "tribes." We "hit it off' with our unmarked kinsmen. We
            have more trouble with those who are not.
              "Pure love has special efficacy to do good, and can do nothing
            but good. It prevents discord and misery, and brings the truest
            happiness."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 138.

   "The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights: and
likewise the wife to her husband" (1 Cor. 7:3, RSV).

  Seeing that "it is not good that man should be alone," God made a
companion for the first man and pronounced them husband and wife. The
two were to form a union and "they shall be one flesh" (Gen. 2:18,
24). This was God's original plan. Marriage provides a special setting for
the working of the inward law. For marriage to be successful, love must
exist between husband and wife. Without love there can be no real
marriage. Marriage is more than a physical union of two individuals. It is
more than having children, more than sharing food and shelter.
Marriage is a deep dedication and commitment to the welfare of the
spouse, a strong desire to share life together, to enter upon a lifelong
loyalty to each other.
  Although marriage was the original arrangement for families and
homes as the foundation of society, there are some in the church
today who choose not to marry. The very difference in the number of
women in the church in comparison with the number of men, in some
places, makes single living inevitable for many. In recent years; there-
fore, the church has begun to recognize the reality of the growing number
of single people within its ranks. The Bible has every respect for
such and notes the special contributions which the unmarried can make to
the work of the gospel. (Compare Matt. 19:10-12; Dan. 1:1-21; 1 Cor.
7:7, 8.)
  We are all sadly aware that even among the saints separation and
divorce have multiplied in many parts of the world. In order to
avoid headaches and heartaches, young people should be very careful
when choosing their life companions. They shciuld seek counsel from
their parents, the pastor, and other qualified counselors.
  When problems develop in the family, restraint, patience, and a spirit of
forgiveness must be exercised. Even when the quarreling partners feel
there is very little to be salvaged from the marriage, plain facts tell us
that a patched-up marriage is still better than a divorce, which leaves
scars on hearts and causes lasting damage to the children.

     Part 1     Why should there be such an institution as marriage?
Function of
  Marriage      "The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I
              will make him an help meet for him" (Gen. 2:18).

                 Everyone needs a companion. Everyone needs to talk to some-
              body, to love somebody, and to be loved by somebody. In sick-
              ness, in failure, in sadness one needs someone to give sympathy
              and encouragement. In success, in happiness, everyone also needs
              someone to share the joy. In order to promote the well-being of
              adults and children, strengthen law and order in society, and
              provide a safe environment for the young, the institution of mar-
              riage was established. Although sin has robbed marriage of some-
              thing of its original joy and purpose, yet marriage still lies at the
              foundation of the family and society and serves, in a measure, to
              preserve the purity and happiness of the race.

               What was Christ's assessment of His own institution of marriage?
              Matt. 19:3-12.

                "He [Christ] announced to the world that marriage when kept
              pure and undefiled is a sacred institution."—The Adventist Home,
              p. 341.

                What is one of the most common causes for the breakdown of the
              unison and happiness of marriage? Proverbs 5.

                 "Around every family there is a sacred circle that should be kept
              unbroken. Within this circle no other person has a right to come.
              Let not the husband or the wife permit another to share the
              confidences that belong solely to themselves."—The Ministry of
              Healing, p. 361.
                 The love relation between husband and wife is to be deepened as
              they live their lives together, meet struggles together, and enjoy
              life's blessings together. This love has to be more than a physical
              one.
                 "To gain a proper understanding of the marriage relation is the
              work of a lifetime. Those who marry enter a school from which
              they are never in this life to be graduated.
                 "However carefully and wisely marriage may have been en-
              tered into, few couples are completely united when the marriage
              ceremony is performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is the
              work of the afteryears."—The Adventist Home, p. 105.

                We are all human and none perfect. Can an imperfect husband
              and an imperfect wife have a perfect marriage?

     Part 2     What should a newly converted husband or wife do in relation to
  Relation    an unbelieving spouse?
       With
Unbelieving     "To the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that
   Spouse     believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put
              her away. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not,
              and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the
              unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving
              wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean;
              but now are they holy" (1 Cor. 7:12-14).

                 Marriage relations can be very complicated. Although the
              church discourages its members from marrying nonmembers be-
              cause of the problems that develop due to differences in religious
              convictions, there is a different situation in relation between an
              unbelieving spouse and a new convert. (In some parts of the world
              tribal or social custom may face the believers with special prob-
              lems. Such challenge the church to show much wisdom, patience,
              and prayer in each case.)
                 Paul advises that the believing spouse should work to help the
              unbelieving partner accept Christ and unite the whole family in
              Jesus. Patience and love will often win, sparing the children the
              conflicts of a divided home.
                 "He who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted is
              by his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to
              his companion, however widely they may differ in regard to reli-
              gious faith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every
              earthly relationship, even though trials and persecution may be the
              result. With the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have
              an influence to win the unbelieving one."—The Adventist Home,
              p. 69.
                 "If the wife is an unbeliever and an opposer, the husband
              cannot, in view of the law of God, put her away on this ground
              alone. In order to be in harmony with the law of Jehovah, he must
              abide with her unless she chooses of herself to depart. He may
              suffer opposition and be oppressed and annoyed in many ways; he
              will find his comfort and his strength and support from God, who is
              able to give grace for every emergency. He should be a man of pure
              mind, of truly decided, firm principles, and God will give him
              wisdom in regard to his course which he should pursue. Impulse
              will not control his reason, but reason will hold the lines of control
              in her firm hand, that lust shall be held under bit and bridle."—The

  Part 3     According to the apostle Paul, what is the definition of adultery?
Adultery
              "The woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her
           husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed
           from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth,
           she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but
           if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no
           adulteress, though she be married to another man" (Rom. 7:2, 3).

             Although Paul is here using the law of marriage (general
           perhaps, but especially in the Old Testament) as an illustration of
           the relationships of a believer to Christ and also of the relationship
           between law and grace, he is undoubtedly giving a correct por-
           trayal of the marriage relationship and properly defining
           adultery—a breakdown of the exclusive physical and spiritual
           oneness of husband and wife. But Jesus sets what may seem an
           even more demanding standard.

             How does Jesus define adultery? Matt. 5:28.

              In this age of permissiveness and sex emphasis in many coun-
           tries, temptations are ever present. We are all too prone to yield to
           them. God's people must be ever conscious of God's presence.
           Only the feeling and the recognition of being continually before
           God, of being surrounded by an atmosphere of holiness, can save
           us from sin.
              With more and more wives working outside the home—and as a
           backlash to the demands of some women for every type of "equal-
           ity" with men—the scene is set and is working all too often with
           tragic effectiveness for the breakdown of the marriage relation-
           ship. Rights and freedoms have been interpreted as guarantees of
           license without penalty—as far as society goes. But there is a
           higher law that will demand fearsome penalties in the end. He or
           she who is being unfaithful to the spouse soon knows not whom
           else to trust. Trust is the bedrock of marriage.
              Youth especially lose respect for marriage as a sacred institution
           if they learn that for some, marriage only provides a legalized
           setting for the lusts that otherwise lead to adultery. (See Tes-
           timonies, vol. 2, p. 391.)

             Do single persons have more "freedom" in associations with the
           opposite sex?

              The biblical standards of morality are universal in their applica-
           tion whether the persons involved are single or married.

 Part 4     What analysis does Jesus give of divorce?
Divorce
             "He saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
          marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman
          shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commit-
          teth adultery" (Mark 10:11, 12).

             In some areas, the church is more and more afflicted with the
          world's increasing rush to the divorce courts. Some say this is
          more realistic than requiring partners to suffer on in a no-love-left
          situation. Others feel that there are many poor judgments made as
          to who is the innocent and who the guilty party in separation and
          divorce cases. The desire to "catch" one's partner in an indiscre-
          tion can be tied to a feverish desire to retain one's name on the
          record books of the church. Surely there will be some tragic
          revelations when Heaven's books are opened. "A woman may be
          legally divorced from her husband by the laws of the land and yet
          not divorced in the sight of God and according to the higher law.
          There is only one sin, which is adultery, which can place the
          husband or wife in a position where they can be free from the
          marriage vow in the sight of God. Although the laws of the land
          may grant a divorce, yet they are husband and wife still in the Bible
          light, according to the laws of God."—The Adventist Home, p.
          344.

            Jesus does not sanction divorce, but He forgave adulterers. How is
          this possible? Matt. 19:6-9; John 8:3-11.

             Even adultery is not portrayed in Scripture as an unpardonable
          sin, whether in the sight of God or the offended partner or partners.
             "To live with one who has broken the marriage vows and is
          covered all over with the disgrace and shame of guilty love, and
          realizes it not, is an eating canker to the soul; and yet a divorce is a
          lifelong, heartfelt sore."—The Adventist Home, p. 346.
             The word used in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 translated as "fornica-
          tion," means more than adultery. It means infidelity, living in sin
          (before or during marriage), against God's law of purity. If adul-
          tery is included, the fall of a spouse does not require divorce. It
          calls for greater love to the other part of oneself.
             Although there may be marriage problems too complex to be
          resolved within church standards, we should do our best not to
          cause unnecessary sorrow. (See 2 Cor. 2:5-8.)

            Is an unhappy marriage more bitter than a heartbreaking di-
          vorce? What can be done to prevent the tragedy of divorce?

    Part 5     How shall we understand Paul's counsel on family relationships in
i Times of   times of particular distress?
  Distress
               "I think that in view of the present distress it is well for a person to
             remain as he is. Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are
             you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage. But if you marry, you do
             not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry
             will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that" (1 Cor.
             7:26-28, RSV).

                The words of Paul here have been the subject of much interpre-
             tation and misinterpretation over the centuries of the Christian
             era. This passage and parallel ones in his writing—and in the
             Gospels—have been used to support celibacy—the practice of
             nonmarriage as a requirement for religious service.
                 Paul was speaking to a special time and place—apparently a time
             of trouble already present or just coming. He "adapted his manner
             of teaching to the condition of the church."—The Acts of the
             Apostles, p. 271. Caution is called for, therefore, in the application
             of this counsel to a different setting or problem. He spoke of
             married and unmarried persons in the church, it is true, but the
             counsel was for a time of distress.
                 The mature, single members of the church today, mentioned in
             the introduction to this lesson, are real and perfectly normal
              people. (That should not need to be said.) They want to be seen and
             accepted as such. They would like to be blended into the total
             church family as they are in their own families. There are also roles
             which they could fulfill in and for the church with special effec-
              tiveness and great joy.

               What am I doing to help all members of my church feel equally
             that they are a part of the total fabric of the family of God?

               It is a particular cruelty to lead any individual to feel that there is
             something about him that makes him a second-class citizen or a
             second-class member of the church. We are so prone to act on our
             differences and so forgetful of all that we have in common in the
             family of faith. Although some differences are innocent enough
             and should not be condemned, it is the work of a true Christian to
             draw every other one, with himself, closer to the Lord.

Strongest
    Bond       "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
             and gave himself for it."
               "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
             Lord" (Eph. 5:25, 22).

                "Only let a woman realize that she is appreciated by her hus-
             band and is precious to him, not merely because she is useful and
             convenient in his house, but because she is a part of himself, and
             she will respond to his affection and reflect the love bestowed upon
             her. Let your wife be the object of your special and hearty atten-
             tion. When you feel as God would have you, you will feel lost
             without the society of your wife."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 416,
             417.

               In the marriage relationship, how should love be expressed? (See
             Prov. 31:10-31; 5:18-21; Song of Solomon; 1 Corinthians 7.)
                One man may embrace his wife 20 times a day, and another may
             only say an awkward word of appreciation. Yet both may have an
             equally strong love.
                Even in this age of boasted "rights," there are still marriages in
             which all the rights are on one side. The result is that the wife is
             made a servant to the passions and demands of the husband. Her
             needs, her rights all too often are not even considered, let alone
              respected. In the, cases where the imbalance is reversed, the same
              principles would apply. Love cannot manifest itself in self-
              indulgence. (See The Adventist Home, p. 125.)
                To one arbitrary father and husband, the counsel was given:
             "Your wife needs tenderness and love. The Lord loves her. She is
             much nearer the kingdom of heaven than you. But she is dying by
             inches, and you are the one who is slowly taking her life. You can
             make her life happy if you will. You can encourage her to lean upon
             your large affections, to confide in you and love you."—
             Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 260.
                Of another man of cold disposition, it was said: "Every word of
             tenderness, every word of appreciation and affectionate encour-
             agement, will be remembered by her [his wife] and will reflect back
             in blessings upon her husband. . . . It will not be weakness or a
             sacrifice of manhood and dignity to give his wife expressions of
             tenderness and sympathy in words and acts."—Testimonies, vol.
             3, pp. 530, 531.
               By what means can the warmth of love be manifested other than by
             physical contact—within marriage and family, within the church
             family?

                                                Adult Lesson




T   P ssni Oty
Absolute Noy pest
  "Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles" (Prov. 21:23).

   Let us face it at the outset: No human being is absolutely anything!
Absoluteness is a quality of God alone. So the title of the lesson needs to
be carefully explained. Once God asked Satan, the great deceiver,
"Halt thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the
earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and es-
cheweth evil?" (Job 1:8, RSV). Later, in tribulation, "Job did not sin
with his lips" (Job 2:10). Of how many men on earth today could God say
the same words? Aren't we all men with "unclean lips, and . . .
[who] dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips"? (Isa 6:5).
   Since speech reflects the inner feeling or thinking of a person—even
more readily than do other actions—man is frequently found at fault by
his language. If he is deceitful, even his nonverbal language betrays his
real intentions. The contrast between the verbal and the nonverbal
language often witnesses to the dishonesty of the speaker.
   The world in which we live is so full of lies that, if we are not careful,
we will lie unintentionally. Neighbors are not exact in telling us about
their feelings and the state of their health. How much do doctors tell their
patients? How truthful are some sales talks? How do counselors
deal with their counselees with the purpose of alleviating their guilt feel-
ings? Superstitious Chinese housewives even feed their kitchen gods
sticky, sweet rice-flour balls just before the New Year so that these
gods, with their mouths full of sticky rice, will not be able to give a full
report to the heavenly gods on the wastefulness of the home! Even
though we all may know the truth and know we are somewhat cheating
each other, we nevertheless put up a front just to comfort each other!
   Of course, to be honest does not mean to tell everything we know to
everybody everywhere. There is "a time to weep, and a time to laugh,"
"a time to keep silence, and a time to speak" (Eccl. 3:4, 7). In order
to be truly honest, one must feel he is constantly in the presence of God.

   Part 1     To what extent is being honest in language a clue to being an honest
Honest in   person?
Language
              "In many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the
            same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body"
            (James 3:2).

               We frequently flatter ourselves that we are not speaking falsely
            because we have couched our Thoughts in words which sound
            above reproach. But there are a multitude of ways by which we
            may bear false witness. The real heart of the matter lies in our
            intention. If we intend to deceive, we are guilty of it whether our
            words carry a technical deception or not. A gesture can lie as
            readily as any word. Many of us love to tell tall tales, to see the
            eyes and then the mouth of the listener popping open, wider and
            wider. We may lie by exaggeration, on the one hand, or by inten-
            tional minimizing or suppression of truth, on the other.

              What is the Lord's attitude toward the use of flattery in speech?
            Ps. 12:3-5.

               "Christ never flattered men. He never spoke that which would
            exalt their fancies and imaginations, nor did He praise them for
            their clever inventions; but deep, unprejudiced thinkers received
            His teaching and found that it tested their wisdom. They marveled
            at the spiritual truth expressed in the simplest of language. The
            most highly educated were charmed with His words, and the
            uneducated were always profited. He had a message for the
            illiterate; and He made even the heathen to understand that He had
            a message for them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 254.
               Only a poor cause requires flattery to win its way. Truth can
            stand up under test, under scrutiny, and not blink. It is tragedy
            compounded when men of intelligence, professing godliness,
            stoop to use flattery to achieve their ends. Likewise, when men of
            experience, in positions of highest trust, surrender their better
            judgment under the distorting wooings of a flattering tongue.

               Under what condition, in the work of God, could it ever be
            legitimate to engage in a modest measure of flattery? (See 1 Thess.
            2:5.)

               He who yields to flattery often loses respect for himself as he
            thinks it over. If he resists flattery, he may lose respect for the
            flatterer.

                                                                     March 1

   Part 2     What part of the body works like the helm of a boat?
Helm and
 Tongue       "Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, are driven
            by fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm,
            whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a little
            member, and boasteth great things" (James 3:4, 5).

               Some people talk before they think. When they hear their own
            words, their minds are reinforced. They may not be sure of what
            they want, but after they talk to themselves, their ideas are sorted
            out, their purpose clarified, and their determination strengthened.
            Thus the little tongue becomes the controller and the helm of the
            whole person.
               "Lucifer himself had not at first been acquainted with the real
            nature of his feelings; for a time he had feared to express the
            workings and imaginings of his mind; yet he did not dismiss them.
            He did not see whither he was drifting."—Patriarchs and
            Prophets, p. 39. Once he had voiced his feelings, his pride and
            ambition forbade him to repent, to take back his words. So he
            misled the angels with deception, and it was under the power of a
            lie that he led Adam and Eve to disobey the law of God. From that
            time on he was a perpetual deceiver and liar.

              Note the dilemma of Herod in the death of John the Baptist. Matt.
            14:1-12.

              King Herod was caught by his words, and so he beheaded John
            the Baptist. Because his pride prohibited him from reversing his
            action, he became the slave of his tongue. Numerous other indi-
            viduals have experienced the same struggle. If the tongue is not
            controlled, its work will ruin a person.
              According to an old saying, "Practice makes perfect." That
            may prove true at times. But more sure it is that practice makes
            permanent. We can come to accept our own lies as the truth if we
            repeat them often enough.

              Words can kill. Who is more horrible, the cannibal or the person
            with a reputation-destroying tongue?

              "We think with horror of the cannibal who feasts on the still
            warm and trembling flesh of his victim; but are the results of even
            this practice more terrible than are the agony and ruin caused by
            misrepresenting motive, blackening reputation, dissecting charac-
            ter? Let the children, and the youth as well, learn what God says
            about these things: 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'

    Part 3    What forceful words does James use in his portrayal of the human
      The tongue?
Untamable
  Tongue      "The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
            poison" (James 3:8).

                James describes the tongue as a "little member," but it is much
              bigger than the tiny vocal bands whose vibration provides the
              tongue with sound to shape into words. The entire speech
              mechanism is one of the little-recognized marvels of the human
              body.
                "Some talk too much; they stand in this position: 'Report, . . .
              and we will report it.' Miserable indeed is such a position! If all
              these gossipers would ever bear in mind that an angel is following
              them, recording their words, there would be less talking and much
              more praying."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 40.
                "Words have kindled fires that have been hard to quench. They
              have also brought joy and gladness to many souls. And when
              words are spoken because God says, 'Speak unto them My
              words,' they often cause sorrow unto repentance."—Ellen G.
              White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1142.

                What is David's wish in terms of controlling his tongue? Ps. 39:1.

                 He who uses falsehoods to make personal gain may evade
              detection for some time and feel that his new improved situation
              justifies the means. But if he continues on this course, he becomes
              a perpetual liar, for he has to lie some more to cover his first lies. If
              he does not get caught in the meshes of his own web of falsehoods,
              he soon finds himself in a more desperate plight. Knowing the
              depth of his deception of others, he himself comes to trust the word
              of no one.
                 "The atmosphere of unbelief is heavy and oppressive. The
              giddy laugh, the jesting, the joking, sickens the soul that is feeding
              on Christ. Cheap, foolish talk is painful to Him. With a humble
              heart read carefully 1 Peter 1:13-18. Those who enjoy talking
              should see that their words are select and well chosen. Be careful
              how you speak. . . . You may feel it no sin to gossip and talk
              nonsense, but this grieves your Saviour, and saddens the heavenly
              angels."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 457.
                 "Floating rumors are often the destroyers of unity among breth-
              ren. There are some who watch with open mind and ears to catch
              flying scandal."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 504.

                   Why is the tongue so hard to control?

    Part 4    Should one use the same mouth to bless and to curse? What would
Under Two    God think of it?
  Masters
               "Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
             we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same
             mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things
             ought not so to be" (James 3:9, 10).

                A man cannot serve two gods at the same time. In some way he
             is more loyal to one than the other. Likewise, the tongue shows the
             loyalty of a person. By blessing God and others, he shows his
             allegiance to God; by cursing he demonstrates his relations with
             Satan. "Those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
             from the heart; and they defile the man" (Matt. 15:18).
                When provoked by anger or possessed by envy and hatred, one
             may act quite differently from his usual behavior pattern. There is
             a kind of psychological problem called split personality. The one
             affected behaves as though he were possessed by different spirits.
             To a lesser degree, those who curse and bless with the same mouth
             are similarly sick. Only when one fully submits himself to the
             influence of the Holy Spirit can he possess full sanity.
                "The mixture of cursing with the blessing may suggest the
             insincerity of the blessing (cf. Prov. 18:21). . . .
                "James appeals to the fellowship of believers in Christ and to the
             unity found in the fatherhood of God. . . . Though some of the
             church members to whom James writes are guilty of cursing men
             while blessing God, he still regards them with affection."—S.D.A.
             Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 527.

              How close is the relationship between the heart and the tongue?
             Matt. 12:34, 35.

               "Of all the gifts which God has given to man, none is more noble
             or a greater blessing than the gift of speech, if it is sanctified by the
             Holy Spirit. It is with the tongue we convince and persuade; with it
             we offer prayer and praise to God; and with it we convey rich
             thoughts of the Redeemer's love. By this work, the canvasser can
             scatter the seeds of truth, causing the light from the word of God to
             shine into many minds."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 316,317.

               "Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account
             thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be
             justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned" (Matt. 12:36,
             37).

   Part 5      What is one of the earthly motives which causes a person to lie?
     The
Heavenly       "If ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and
 and the lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above,
  Earthly but is earthly, sensual, devilish" (James 3:14, 15).

                Motivated by negative feelings such as pride, jealousy, shame,
              hatred, or greed, one may accuse, insinuate, or falsify. Captivated
              by a fighting spirit and haunted by his own words, such is a
              miserable man. He makes enemies out of his friends, and he
              pushes himself out of his social circle.
                "The tongue is evil only when it is controlled by a mind moti-
              vated by the forces of evil. When a man does not let the Holy Spirit
              control his thoughts, and thus his speech, the tongue functions as
              an instrument of evil."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 526.
                "The spirit of self-justification originated in the father of lies; it
              was indulged by our first parents as soon as they yielded to the
              influence of Satan, and has been exhibited by all the sons and
              daughters of Adam."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 58.

                What kind of words should we avoid, and what kind of words
              should we speak? Eph. 5:4.

                 "He who is truly wise seeks to avoid quarrels and strife, but his
              desire for peace will not keep him from presenting the truth, even
              though trouble may result. Jesus predicted that the proclamation
              of truth would bring contention into the world. . . , but the resulting
              strife is the fault of those who oppose the truth, not of those who
              wisely present it. Purity of life and doctrine must never be sac-
              rificed in an effort to secure peace."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
              vol. 7, p. 529.

                Do the Scriptures recognize that it may not be possible to live at
              peace with some people? (See Rom. 12:18.)

                 In defending truth, we cannot completely avoid confrontations.
              However, we must not be overcome by the spirit of strife. We must
              be more earnest in seeking God's grace that He may deliver us
              from evil. Even under great pressure, the divine grace is sufficient
              for us. We are promised that we will be given words of wisdom
              when we are brought to the court of judgment. If we are willing to
              place ourselves under the influence of the Holy Spirit, He can
              help us to gain the victory over undisciplined speech.

                What a person speaks reflects his thinking. What does your speech
              reflect about your inner thoughts and desires?

 Part 6     What kind of language and character would one have if filled with
Wisdom    wisdom from above?
  From
 Above      "The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
          gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
          without partiality, and without hypocrisy" (James 3:17, 18).

             The wisdom from above affects the mood and the words of the
          recipient. There is, in turn, a fascinating relationship between the
          mood of a speaker and the quality of his voice that is heard. The
          pitch of the voice, the volume, the tone quality, and also the rate of
          speaking reflect in various ways the degree of tension that is felt
          throughout the body of the speaker. The tension varies with the
          emotions experienced. Naturally the content of the words spoken
          is similarly affected.

           What place may meditation upon Christ have in our revelation of
          Him in our words and deeds? 2 Cor. 3:18.

             "By beholding we are to become changed; and as we meditate
          upon the perfections of the divine Model, we shall desire to be-
          come wholly transformed, and renewed in the image of His purity.
          It is by faith in the Son of God that transformation takes, place in
          the character, and the child of wrath becomes the child of God. He
          passes from death unto life; he becomes spiritual and discerns
          spiritual things. The wisdom of God enlightens his mind, and he
          beholds wondrous things out of His law... . In becoming a man of
          obedience to God, he has the mind of Christ, and the will of God
          becomes his will."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 338.

             What part might the manner of Christ's speech have had in
          motivating the Samaritan woman to accept His offer of the "water of
          life"? (See John 4:10-14; 6:63.)

            The words of a man of God and the manner in which they are
          spoken will be as a refreshing drink to thirsty travelers. The inward
          law manifests itself in gracious speech.

            The wise man said, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he" (Prov.
          23:7). If one's mind is filled with things from above—purity, peace,
          gentleness, kindness, and honesty—these virtues will be reflected in
          his language. How can we fill ourselves with wisdom from above?

  "The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager
for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs" (1 Tim. 6:10, NIV).

   While money itself is not evil, the love of money is the root of all
evil. The covetous motive still leads one to steal, in violation of the
inward law of love.
   But before committing the crime of theft, one would first have harbored
feelings of covetousness, a craving for an object which he should not
attempt to get, such as the money, house, or wife of his neighbor.
   When the love for material things increases, the love for things such as
honesty, reputation, and spiritual experience decreases. In a society
which "despises the poor but not the prostitutes," as expressed in a
Chinese saying, the ethical standards of some people are bound to be
distorted.
   Therefore, some people don't feel guilty when they evade tax, when
they cheat in examinations, or even when they embezzle money
from the public or the organization for which they work. Some even
deVelop the thought that society or the government owes them so much
already that any cheating they can do through such things as the free use
of personal, long-distance phone calls at company expense, the
stealing of computer time, or the free use of company stationery is
but restoring justice!
   An extreme form of covetous behavior is shown in gambling—horse
racing, casino attendance, poker games, or the numbers game. Any
kind of gambling has the purpose of gaining some undeserved benefit.
   Life comes from God. Time, energy, talents, intellect, and skills
are all from God. Whatever one inherits from his ancestors or relatives is
also from God. We are God's stewards. We didn't bring anything with
us when we came into this world, and we are not taking anything with
us when we leave. We are here but a few years. We must be God's good
stewards with whatever He entrusts to our hands. Fully realizing the
principle of stewardship, we will become the masters of the wealth we
possess and not the slaves of it. This is how possessions may affect our
relation to the inward law.

                                                                     March 7

 Part 1     What effect does the love of money have upon spiritual experi-
A Root    ence?
of Evil
            "The love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted
          after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
          through with many sorrows" (1 Tim. 6:10).

             People love money. Besides material things, money can bring to
          its owner fame, power, and influence. To many people, especially
          to those in the capitalistic world, money is the standard for measur-
          ing success. Success means a bigger house, an efficient car—or
          many cars—a fat bank balance, and conspicuous consumption of
          life's delicacies.
             A Chinese adage says, "Money will get the devil to run the stone
          mill." Because money is so useful, the pursuit of money has been
          all-consuming since the dawn of history.
             "Covetousness" means craving for something other persons
          have or possess. This could include what is not yet due to me. If
          this motive is not brought under control, it will become the pre-
          dominating motive of all behavior.
             In the hot pursuit of money, one can become oblivious to the
          needs of those around him—the sick, the elderly, the poor, the
          handicapped, and the homeless children that can be found in every
          community. However, the responsibility to care for these unfortu-
          nate ones may rest increasingly upon the community.
             When money is used for philanthropic purposes, it can help fight
          disease, alleviate poverty, and promote education and culture.
          When put to illegal use, money corrupts the owner and creates
          scandal even in the higher circles of governments.

           Why did the rich young ruler go away from Jesus sorrowfully?
          Matt. 19:22.

             The rich young ruler had the desire to become a perfect man; but
          unfortunately he was addicted to money. The desire to keep his
          money was greater than the desire to enter everlasting life.
             "The Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has acquired
          his riches honestly. Not money, but the love of money, is the root
          of all evil. . . . But many, absorbed in their interest in worldly
          treasures, become insensible to the claims of God and the needs of
          their fellow men."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 212.

            The rich young ruler, if seeking church membership today, prob-
          ably would be warmly welcomed into the church. Why did Jesus
          make it so hard for him to be His follower? Does He require the same
          standard of everybody else?

             A Root of Evil                                      11 Monday
                                                                   March 8

    Part 2        Note some other forms of covetousness portrayed in the Bible.
    Other
 Forms of      "Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the
Covetous-    hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of
     ness    you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have
             reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth" (James 5:
             3, 4).

                Here the Bible says that the employer or the manager has kept
             back by fraud that which is due to the laborers or employees. The
             profit of a factory, a company, or a farm could be equitably shared
             by all who contribute to the success of it. It is true that the
             stockholders, the managers, the owners, the bosses provide
             houses, goods, tools, equipment, capital, and management to
             make the success possible. But without the participation of the
             employees, there can be no profit. It is important that the owners
             and financiers recognize the proportionate right of the laborers to
             share in the profits. Some laborers may be unskillful, lazy and
             irresponsible; but the mistakes of a few should not be made the
             reason to exploit the whole. Enlightened managers nowadays have
             realized the need to share profits with the laborers.
                Jesus described or met additional forms of covetousness recorded
             in Matthew 20:11, 12; 20:21; Luke 15:12.
               In these three passages of the Bible we find mention of three
             different kinds of covetousness. The first describes a demand for
             equality, but in effect the complainer was trying to breach his
             contract with the manager. Because other workers got a better
             deal, he became jealous. That is definitely a form of covetousness.
               The second text records the request of a mother who wanted her
             two sons, James and John, to sit on either side of Christ should He
             become King. To hope, to make plans for, or even to work for the
             best for one's children is understandable. But to desire them to
             occupy positions not rightfully theirs is another form of covetous-
             ness.
               And then the third text records the prodigal son's request made
             of his father to receive the share of properties which customarily
             would have been his only after the father had passed away. In the
             Orient, this kind of request for inheritance is considered to be a
             wish that the father would die, a most disrespectful attitude and a
             very covetous act. This may provide added significance to one
             of the best-known of Christ's many parables.
               On what basis would you decide whether or not an individual is a
             miser? Is he a covetous person?

     Part 3      What did Lucifer gradually come to covet when he was in heaven?
    Pride,
a Form of      "Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt
Covetous- my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
     ness congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights
             of the clouds; I will be like the most High" (Isa. 14:13, 14).

                  The desire of Lucifer differs from a normal desire among human
               beings for promotion. He clearly knew his position and his rela-
               tionship with God. He was already the chief of angels; he was
               directly under God. Despite all the glory he had, he coveted the
               special position, the power, and the glory of the Son, who, as God,
               was with the Father from all eternity. Satan forgot that he was a
               creature and not the Creator. He coveted something that he was
               not and never could be, and that covetousness developed into a
               rebellion in heaven.

                 What was and is the result of the rebellion that took place in
               heaven? Eze. 28:14-17.

                 "Pride of position is a deep-seated evil which has ruined
               thousands. Yes, tens of thousands, full of ambition for distinction
               and display, have been ruined because they have lost sight of
               principle. They have measured themselves among themselves,
               and compared themselves with themselves. Their eager grasping
               for credit and reward has resulted in diminished spirituality. This is
               a lesson all should study carefully, that they may be warned
               against selfishness and avarice, against pride which destroys love
               for God and corrodes the soul."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp.
               184, 185.
                 "Whenever pride and ambition are indulged, the life is marred,
               for pride, feeling no need, closes the heart against the infinite
               blessings of Heaven. He who makes self-glorification his aim will
               find himself destitute of the grace of God, through whose effi-
               ciency the truest riches and the most satisfying joys are won."—
               Prophets and Kings, p. 60.

                 Are you often being tempted to be proud? In what way?

                 There is a second cousin to pride that is really a most important
               and desirable character trait. It is that form of pride which we
               speak of as self-respect. There are those with a tragically negative
               kind of modesty. They take pride in looking poor, unkempt, and
               even dirty. Some continually put themselves down to the point
               that they fail to do what God would call them to do. Perhaps this is
               a coveting of humility! In any case, it is not good or Christlike.

 Part 4     From the teachings of Jesus, what clues can we find as to why
  Why     people worry?
People
 Worry      "Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about
          your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food,
          and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the
          air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your
          heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than
          they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And
          why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow.
          They do not labor or spin" (Matt. 6:25-28, NIV).

             From time immemorial, people have worried. They worry about
          their money, the security of their money, and the growth of their
          money. Some worry about their health. Others worry about what
          to eat and what to wear. For some, eating becomes gluttony or
          extravagant display.
             Some ladies, as well as some men, worry about what to wear.
          They worry about what to wear every day—not only to concerts,
          parties, and ceremonies. Some covet being something they are not.
          They have nonessential plastic surgery done, wear various wigs
          over their quite acceptable natural hair, make up their faces ex-
          travagantly, paint fingernails and toenails to distraction, "starve"
          themselves to preserve "the figure," and wear garments that
          offend Christian sensibilities of modesty. All these activities
          exhibit forms of covetousness.
             If one is grateful to God for what nature has given him, even the
          crippled person can accept his lot. With the hope and assurance
          that someday soon he will be given a perfect body, he does not
          need to covet something which he is not. Trusting in the Lord frees
          him from worry.

            Before seeking food, clothes, and the necessities of life, what
          should we seek? Matt. 6:33.

            "There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care
          because they seek to reach the world's standard. . . . In order to
          gratify ambition and worldly desires, they wound the conscience,
          and bring upon themselves an additional burden of remorse. The
          continual worry is wearing out the life forces. Our Lord desires
          them to lay aside this yoke of bondage. . . . In every difficulty He
          has His way prepared to bring relief."—The Desire of Ages, p.
          330.

            Worry is a form of diffused fear. How can we stop worrying?

    Part 5     The inward law is brief and explicit on God's view of stealing.
thou Shalt
Not Steal"     "Thou shalt not steal" (Ex. 20:15).

                "Both public and private sins are included in this prohibition.
             The eighth commandment condemns manstealing and slave deal-
             ing, and forbids wars of conquest. It condemns theft and robbery.
             It demands strict integrity in the minutest details of the affairs of
             life. . . . It declares that every attempt to advantage oneself by the
             ignorance, weakness, or misfortune of another is registered as
             fraud in the books of heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 308,
             309.

              What may we have stolen perhaps without being conscious of it?
             Mal. 3:8.

                If one forgot that he is but a steward of the Lord, he would claim
             as his own that which God has entrusted to him as a steward. He
             certainly would find it difficult to return to God the tithe, which is
             God's. This attitude could lead one to cheat his fellowmen, cheat
             the government, cheat his customers, his boss, his wife, and just
             about everybody around him.
                Some people seem to find it impossible not to steal. To them
             stealing is a compulsive behavior that they cannot seem to control.
             They even steal from their friends or from the department store
             worthless little things that they do not need.
                In the tenth commandment there is another item God forbids us
             to covet—the neighbor's wife. If one stole a cow, he could return it
             to its original owner. If he cheated his neighbor and took over his
             house, he could still return it to him. But if he steals his neighbor's
             marital partner, it is hard, if not impossible, to recompense the
             damage.
                When, in the broader sense of coveting, we add to our consider-
             ation gamblers, tax evaders, shoplifters, dishonest manufacturers
             and merchants, we may surprise ourselves by the number of
             people who have violated the eighth and the tenth commandments.
                In the setting of strict integrity, the principle of restoration
             comes into play. (See Eze. 33:14, 15.) Some things can never be
             fully repaid—such as stolen reputation or stolen affection—but
             most of them can and must be. Where possible, even incomplete
             restitutions will be made by those seeking forgiveness from man
             and God.

               If one has neglected to prepare a will to direct the care for his
             properties after death, is it possible that he has violated the eighth
             commandment by so doing?

      Part 6     In utter contrast to the slightest whisper of covetousness, what
Humility and   example in humility and self-denial has Jesus given us?
 Self-denial
                 "Jesus . . . , being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
               equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon
               him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and
               being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
               obedient unto death, even the death of the cross" (Phil. 2:5-8).

                  The opposite of covetousness is unselfishness, the giving of
               one's possessions and self in service to others. In this respect also
               Jesus is our perfect Example. Instead of coming to rule as a king,
               He took upon Himself the form of a servant and was made in the
               likeness of men to live among the poor and to die for us willingly as
               though He were a criminal. Such self-denial we have never seen in
               anyone else. Meditating upon this theme would prompt us to shout
               praises to Him and love Him as we have never loved before.

                 How should the Christian use his money? (See Luke 10:30-37).

                  Money is a trust from God. It is not ours to expend for the
               gratification of pride or ambition. In the hands of God's children it
               is food for the hungry, and clothing for the naked."—The Ministry
               of Healing, p. 287.

                Instead of looking for what He can get, what does God freely give?
               Acts 17:24, 25, 28.

                  Even though nature is marred by sin, its parts are complemen-
               tary to other parts, and the parts serve the whole. For example,
               water, oxygen, and nitrogen have their cycles and so do the sun
               and the moon, the tides and the seasons. Without these cycles, the
               earth would soon become a place full of poison and rubbish, unfit
               for human habitation.
                  Unceasingly, God uses His power to uphold the universe and
               work for our benefit. And He gives us the power to gain wealth
               (Deut. 8:18). The angels are "ministering spirits, sent forth to
               minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation" (Heb. 1:14). In
               God's family everyone exists to serve others. By serving one
               another we can help make the universe a paradise.

                  Many believe that there is nothing free in the world and that
               somehow we end up paying for everything ourselves. Can this be true
               of salvation (John 3:16)? the water of life (Rev. 22:17)? the bread of
               life (John 6:51)?

your spirit, which are God's" (1 Cor. 6:19, 20).

   God is the Author of both natural law (the realm of science) and
moral law. Since both are created by the same Author, there is
complete harmony between the two. Only in modern times have
scientists discovered the influence of the psychological functions of
the body on the physiological, and vice versa. God tells us that "a
merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth
the bones" (Prov. 17:22). Nature—God's other book—cannot dis-
agree. When rightly understood, the book of nature is in complete
agreement with God's primary book, the Bible.
   In health principles, it is now common knowledge that a man's
health—which is as much psychological as physical—is involved with
"abstract" feelings such as peace, joy, love, and a sense of security. For
the Christian such assurance grows from a knowledge of things
eternal.
   The spirit of prophecy clearly states: "The laws of nature are the laws
of God—as truly divine as are the precepts of the Decalogue. The laws
that govern our physical organism, God has written upon every nerve,
muscle, and fiber of the body. Every careless or willful violation of
these laws is a sin against our Creator. . . .
   "The influence of the mind on the body, as well as the body on the
mind, should be emphasized. The electric power of the brain, promoted
by mental activity, vitalizes the whole system, and is thus an invaluable
aid in resisting disease. This should be made plain. The power of the
will and the importance of self-control, both in the preservation and in the
 recovery of health, the depressing and even ruinous effect of anger,
discontent, selfishness, or impurity, and, on the other hand, the marvel-
 ous life-giving power to be found in cheerfulness, unselfishness,
 gratitude, should also be shown."--Education, pp. 196, 197.

   Part 1     In Psalm 19 who is declared to be the author of the two sets of laws,
 God, the   the natural (physical) and the moral?
Lawmaker
               "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
            sheweth his handywork."
              "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony
            of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple" (Ps. 19:1, 7).

               When God created our planet, part of His plan was the creation
            of man. Since man's body is governed by natural law and his
            behavior by moral laws, these two laws must reflect the harmoni-
            ous will of their Author. Adam not only had high intelligence, a
            beautiful body, and extraordinary vitality; he also reflected God's
            love. The motives of his behavior were good and pure, and he lived
            happily because, in perfect trust, he observed God's laws.
              "The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the
            things of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home, nature was
            full of the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. To
            their attentive ears it was vocal with the voice of wisdom. Wisdom
            spoke to the eye and was received into the heart, for they com-
            muned with God in His created works."—Counsels to Teachers,
            p.186.

              When the Ten Commandments were announced to the Hebrews,
            what natural phenomenon accompanied the pronouncement? Ex.
            20:18.

               The fire, smoke, lightning, thunder, and earthquake created a
            frightening scene before the Israelites. The power of God was
            greatly manifested when He descended on Mount Sinai to an-
            nounce His law. The power of nature and the power of law were
            demonstrated by the same Author. The reason for making the
            pronouncement solemn and memorable was to impress the minds
            of the Israelites with the importance of God's law. In Egypt many
            of them had forgotten God's law and the sacredness of it. Some-
            thing extraordinary and dramatic was needed.
               However, when God speaks to man, He does not usually appear
            in the fire or the earthquake. His small voice is heard in quietness.

                 In what respects does God's law differ from man's laws?

              There is never a need to amend the laws pronounced by God.
            Their application to mankind may vary with changing conditions,
            but the principles of God's law are as unchangeable as God Him-
            self. (See Mal. 3:6.)

 Part 2     In the light of modern science, consider the claim that nature is
Natural   governed by natural laws alone.
  Laws
            "God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his
          kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind:
          and it was so" (Gen. 1:24).

            In this short verse is hidden the genesis of zoology, entomology,
          animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, taxonomy, genetics,
          paleontology, and other disciplines of science. The short phrase
          "after his kind" governs the laws of genetics and rules out the
          possibility of a process of evolution that denies the creatorship of
          God. Rpgardless of how one looks at nature, he cannot find enough
          convincing evidence to support the conclusions of the evolution-
          ary theory. God cannot contradict Himself.
             "The Saviour in His miracles revealed the power that is con-
          tinually at work in man's behalf to sustain and to heal him.
          Through the agencies of nature, God is working, day by day, hour
          by hour, moment by moment, to keep us alive, to build up and
          restore us. . . . All life-giving power is from Him."—The Ministry
          of Healing, pp. 112, 113.
             Natural science is the knowledge of nature known to men.
          However, the total body of knowledge known to men today does
          not constitute all knowledge of nature. Otherwise there could be
          no new discovery. Similarly, nature-related points difficult to un-
          derstand and even seeming contradictions with the Bible may be-
          come plain in the near future. It would be presumptuous for man,
          with his very limited knowledge, to conclude that the Bible is
          wrong on origins.

            In one of the practical aspects of natural law, how does Bible-
          related dietary counsel affect human well-being?

            "The dietary principles of Lev. 11, together with other sanitary
          and health regulations, were intended by a wise Creator to pro-
          mote health and longevity (see Ex. 15:26; 23:25; Deut. 7:15; Ps.
          105:37; PP 378). Based as they are upon the nature and require-
          ments of the human body, these principles could in no way be
          affected either by the cross or by the disappearance of Israel as a
          nation. Principles that contributed to health 3,500 years ago will
          produce the same results today."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
          vol. 1, p. 757.

            If natural law changed once in a while, what would happen to the
          universe?

    Part 3        What is the most complete guide or standard for our behavior?
Moral Law
                "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
             liberty" (James 2:12).

                Every increase in the amazing growth of scientific knowledge in
             our day only adds to our wonder over the intricate and unfailing
             laws under which God has placed every atom of His creating. Not
             one detail has escaped the attention of the divine mind and hand.
             But while everything in this creation, animate and inanimate, is
             under law, only man is under moral law. His intelligence and his
             capacity to distinguish right from wrong, under divine tutelage,
             make him responsible to this law. The conscience again is the
             agency or channel used by the Spirit in a mind capable of finding
             the law holy, just, and good.
                "God has given us His holy precepts, because He loves man-
             kind. To shield us from the results of transgression, He reveals the
             principles of righteousness. The law is an expression of the
             thought of God; when received in Christ, it becomes our thought.
             It lifts us above the power of natural desires and tendencies, above
             temptations that lead to sin. God desires us to be happy, and He
             gave us the precepts of the law that in obeying them we might have
             joy. When at Jesus' birth the angels sang,—`Glory to God in the
             highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men' (Luke 2:14),
             they were declaring the principles of the law which He had come to
             magnify and make honorable."—The Desire of Ages, p. 308.

               Where is the assurance that the moral law and the total Old
             Testament message are in no way belittled by the gospel of Jesus?
             Matt. 5:17, 18.

               "While the Saviour's death brought to an end the law of types
             and shadows, it did not in the least detract from the obligation of
             the moral law. On the contrary, the very fact that it was necessary
             for Christ to die in order to atone for transgression of that law,
             proves it to be immutable."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 365.

               How does a man's thinking, regarding God and His law, affect his
             personality and behavior? Prov. 23:7.

                It is commonly known that by beholding we are changed. When
             we behold the glory of the Lord—His law translated into a perfect
             life—we are changed into His image. But if we let our minds dwell
             on wicked thoughts, we will become wicked in character.

               Does the moral law simply reflect the changing norm of human
             behavior? Or is it, like the laws of nature, changeless?

    Part 4     What is the divine motivation for us to take care of our health?
alth Laws
              "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
             God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall
             God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are" (1
             Cor. 3:16, 17).

               What could be the experience of a people who would happily
             follow the laws written in man's whole being? Ex. 15:26.

                Man should enjoy good health and a happy life if he observes the
             natural law. Sunshine, pure air, exercise, rest, wholesome food,
             and a peaceful mind are necessary to good health. But modern men
             are plagued by polluted air, physical inactivity, lack of sleep,
             tension, indulgence of appetite, and the use of drugs, including
             alcohol and tobacco. Only as we return to a simple life can we
             enjoy life in abundance.
                But it is easier to say this than to do it. We all tend to be slaves of
             our environment, our jobs, and our ambitions. It takes real deter-
             mination and a strong will to change the pattern of our behavior.
             That is why some people pay hundreds of dollars to go to condi-
             tioning centers to have their pattern of behavior altered.
                However, not everybody can go away to another place to
             change his life. For those people the change must begin at home.
             Members of the family must help one another and remind each
             other of the importance of adhering to health principles. We must
             be willing to earn fewer dollars, look for recreation instead of
             entertainment, withdraw from frivilous social fraternization to
              have more time with the family. Then the family may function as a
              personal health club. In so doing, the family will find it natural to
             stick together and to get closer to God.
                "Life is a gift of God. Our bodies have been given us to use in
              God's service, and He desires that we shall care for and appreciate
              them. We are possessed of physical as well as mental faculties.
              Our impulses and passions have their seat in the body, and there-
              fore we must do nothing that would defile this entrusted posses-
              sion. Our bodies must be kept in the best possible condition
              physically, and under the most spiritual influences, in order that
              we may make the best use of our talents."—Counsels on Health,
              p. 41.

                What reason did God give for His people to be holy? Lev. 11:44.

               The word holy connotes deepest reverence, spiritual purity,
             sacredness—that which is set apart, different from things common
             or ordinary.

   Body
             "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
           drieth the bones" (Prov. 17:22).

               "The relation that exists between the mind and the body is very
            intimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condi-
            tion of the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many
            realize. Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result
            of mental depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt,
            distrust, all tend to break down the life forces and to invite decay
            and death."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 241.
               Man was made as a whole person. The psychological and the
            physiological functions are interrelated. Many get sick and die
            because of a lack of desire to live on. On the other hand, many who
            cannot abstain from sinful habits are that way because of their
            physical condition. An example is the cigarette smoker who knows
            the harmfulness of the cigarette but is unable to stop smoking. If
            one is plagued by disease and sin, in order to break the vicious
            circle, he must first return to God as he is. His sins will be forgiven.
            Only then would he have the regenerated willpower to fight the
            forces of darkness.
               When we see or.hear about hale and hearty souls who have lived
            to be a hundred or more and we learn that they have been lifelong
            smokers, drinkers, and loose in their living, we cannot but wonder
            about the health principles we have been taught. How can one who
            indulges himself live so long when conscientious observers of
            every health rule suffer and perhaps die young? Are the health
            principles unsound? Are they only for those with a poor start in
            life?
               Much might be said on this. But when it is said that we are all
            born equal, that does not apply to the physical endowment with
            which we enter life. On the other hand, a life of hard work can
            counter many of the ill effects of imbibing the unhealthful. None of
            us know exactly what our fate might have been had we lived
            differently. We can only surmise, based on the law of averages.
            But it is probable that the mind and soul are more easily affected by
            our physical habits than we will know in this life. Judgment and
            eternity will reveal many things. No follower of Jesus can con-
            sciously ignore the claims of the laws of health.

   Part 6     What promise did God give Israel concerning their health?
 Promise
of Health      "The Lord will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none
            of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee" (Deut.
            7:15).

               We often marvel today at the high achievements of the descend-
            ants of the ancient people of Israel. Undoubtedly the blessings of
            their forebears have come down to them. Yet ancient Israel failed
            in large measure in being to the world the savor of life unto life
            which Jehovah intended. She could have been the world's greatest
            object lesson in good health and every other advantage. What
            Daniel and his companions were in Babylon, Israel could have
            been in the world at large. This may illustrate again what was
            demonstrated in earliest human history—that divinely bestowed
            physical and mental advantages endure through many generations
            despite abuse or misuse.
               One unanswered and unanswerable question, from our limited
            human viewpoint, is how long and how well some might live today
            if they made major efforts from earliest years to live in harmony
            with the laws of health.
               "He [God] has established the laws of nature, but His laws are
            not arbitrary exactions. Every 'Thou shalt not,' whether in physi-
            cal or moral law, contains or implies a promise. If it is obeyed,
             blessings will attend our steps; if it is disobeyed, the result is
            danger and unhappiness. The laws of God are designed to bring
             His people closer to Himself."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 445.

              What kind of cure and peace did God promise to His ancient
            people? Jer. 33:6.

              "To many of the afflicted ones who received healing, Christ
            said, 'Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.' John 5:14.
            Thus He taught that disease is the result of violating God's laws,
            both natural and spiritual. The great misery in the world would not
            exist did men but live in harmony with the Creator's plan."—The
            Desire of Ages, p. 824.
              "Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and
            prolong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the
            body and strength to the soul. 'A merry [rejoicing] heart doeth
            good like a medicine.' Proverbs 17:22."—The Ministry of Heal-

  "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of
God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is
none of his" (Rom. 8:9).

   The path of life is never an even, straight line. It goes up moun-
tains and down into deep valleys. The path of spiritual life is likewise
often a rough one. The experience of maturing in Christ is seldom a
smooth one. A bitter war is fought on the battlefields of our hearts. The
forces of good and of evil constantly engage in fierce conflict. It is in this
kind of situation that one learns the inner peace of Christ's justifying
righteousness, develops character, and learns the power of the Holy
Spirit to plant in the heart the inward law.
  Torn between two great forces, we of ourselves are powerless. It is
impossible to win against Satan if we neglect the offered help of Christ.
Worse yet, we are so prone to fall into Satan's snares, we are so inclined
to sin, and we are so afraid of facing God that, without intervening
influences, our fate is sealed. However, we are not without hope:
"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, con-
demned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be
fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom.
8:3, 4). We are already victors in Christ's victory.
   In Romans, chapters 7 and 8, the apostle Paul uses a number of contrasts
to illustrate the inner conflict which every Christian experiences.
Through these experiences a Christian gradually matures in Christ. It is
a matter of life and death. Only the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus—provided by His amazing grace—can make us free from the
law of sin and death.
   It is said that repeated similar choices form a habit, and a collection of
habits forms a character. Even though one may have the intention of
doing good, yet before he forms a good habit, like a child learning to walk,
he must deliberately concentrate all his attention and energy upon
performing that task, lest he stumble. This is especially true when.evil
forces are at work to make whatever we do more difficult.

   Part 1     What countering power frees man from the law of sin and death?
le Versus
   Death      "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
            from the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2).

               The free gift of life in Christ is the only remedy that saves man
            from death. "For what the law was unable to do, weakened as it
            was through the flesh, that God did by sending His own Son in the
            likeness of sinful flesh and on account of sin; He thus condemned
            sin in human nature" (Rom. 8:3, Berkeley [Modern Language
            Bible]). When Jesus won the battle against sin on the cross and
            triumphed over death in the garden tomb, the surety of salvation
            for the saints was sealed.
               The Spirit of life is Spirit-giving life. "He is so called because He
            exercises life-giving power. . . . The law of the Spirit of life is the
            life-giving power of the Holy Spirit, ruling as a law in the life. The
            phrase 'of life' expresses the effect accomplished, as in 'justifica-
            tion of life' (. . . John 5:18) and 'the bread of life' (John 6:35). The
            Spirit brings life and freedom, in contrast with the law of sin, which
            produces only death and condemnation. . . .
               "Sin is no longer the predominating and controlling influence in
            his life. The indwelling Spirit of life inspires obedience and gives
            power to 'mortify the deeds of the body' (v. 13). Thus the law of the
            Spirit of life works directly contrary to the law of sin and death in
            the members, empowering the believer to overcome sin's destroy-
            ing influence and freeing him from sin's bondage and
            condemnation."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 560.
                "The law reveals to man his sins, but it provides no remedy.
            While it promises life to the obedient, it declares that death is the
            portion of the transgressor. The gospel of Christ alone can free him
            from the condemnation or the defilement of sin. He must exercise
             repentance toward God, whose law has been transgressed; and
            faith in Christ, his atoning sacrifice. Thus he obtains 'remission of
             sins that are past' and becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He
             is a child of God, having received the spirit of adoption, whereby
             he cries: `Abba, Father!' "—The Great Controversy, p. 468.

               By what means can we receive life? John 5:24-26.

               "In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as
            it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change
            has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life,
            from sin unto holiness."—The Great Controversy, p. 468.

            of life and death?

 Part 2      Under what condition can the righteousness of the law be fulfilled
 Spirit   in us?
Versus
 Flesh     "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who
          walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4).

             "After the Spirit. That is, they regulate their conduct according
          to the dictates and guidance of the Spirit, the indwelling Spirit of
          Christ. . . . The just requirement of the law is being fulfilled in
          them. What the law requires is summed up in Christian love, for
          `love is the fulfilling of the law' ([Rom.] ch. 13:10). Likewise, the
          result of the working of the Holy Spirit in the life is love, for 'the
          fruit of the Spirit is love' (Gal. 5:22). Consequently, life according
          to the Spirit means a life in which the righteous demands of the law
          are fulfilled—a life of love and loving obedience. That such a life
          might be made possible for believers was the great purpose for
          which God sent His Son into the world."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
          tary, vol. 6, p. 562.
             There must be an intent and a decision of the soul itself to expel,
          by the power of the Spirit, the natural "inhabitants" that generate
          all evil works—the works of the flesh. Only then can there be an
          inflowing of the Spirit to fill the vacancy. Both the expelling and
          infilling are by the Spirit's power, but these acts never override the
          will of the soul itself. There is no spiritual pride in the Spirit-filled
          heart. Rather, there is growing sense of dependence upon the
          Spirit for the implanting and outworking of the inward law.
             "The Spirit that reveals, also works in him the fruits of righ-
          teousness. Christ is in him, 'a well of water springing up into
          everlasting life.' He is a branch of the True Vine, and bears rich
          clusters of fruit to the glory of God. What is the character of the
          fruit borne?—The fruit of the Spirit is 'love,' not hatred; 'joy,' not
          discontent and mourning; 'peace,' not irritation, anxiety, and
          manufactured trials."—Gospel Workers, p. 287.

             What place does the body have in the process of the consecration of
          life to God? Rom. 12:1, 2.
             "With what care should Christians regulate their habits, that
          they may preserve the full vigor of every faculty to give to the
          service of Christ. If we would be sanctified in soul, body, and
          spirit, we must live in conformity to the divine law.The heart
          cannot preserve consecration to God while the appetites and pas-
          sions are indulged at the expense of health and life."—Counsels on
          Health, p. 69.

            Why is it so important that we live according to the Spirit? By
          demanding this, is God taking away from us freedom of choice?

  Part 3       What is the underlying reason that prompts our actions so vital to
Spiritual our Christian experience?
   Mind
 Versus        "To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
 Carnal life and peace" (Rom. 8:6).
    Mind
               "To be carnally minded. Literally, 'the mind [or "minding"] of
            the flesh.' In this case, 'mind' means 'thought,' `purpose,' inten-
            tion,"inclination,' as in the clause, 'he . . . knoweth what is the
            mind of the Spirit' (v. 27 [of Rom. 8])."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
            tary, vol. 6, p. 563.
               Spiritual losses do not take place suddenly. As a general rule
            there is-,a series of small violations of the conscience that has a
            confusing impact on the mind and judgment. The voice of God is
             heard less and less distinctly, and the deceptions of Satan come to
             be accepted as enlightened wisdom. The soul is then in grave peril.
             And without a deliberate decision as to who is to be master of the
            soul, there will be inevitable and eternal loss.
               "The carnal mind is enmity against God, and it rebels against
             His will. Let it once throw off the yoke of obedience and it slips
             unconsciously into the lawlessness of crime."—Testimonies, vol.
             4, p. 13.
                "It is the Spirit that causes to shine into darkened minds the
             bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness; that makes men's hearts
             burn within them with an awakened realization of the truths of
             eternity; that presents before the mind the great standard of righ-
             teousness, and convinces of sin; that inspires faith in Him who
             alone can save from sin; that works to transform character by
             withdrawing the affections of men from those things which are
             temporal and perishable, and fixing them upon the eternal
             inheritance.      Gospel Workers, pp. 286, 287.

               In light of the text and quotations above, what new meaning can
             you derive from Proverbs 4:23?

               How can we develop the "spiritual mind" in a negative and
             adverse setting?

                Only he who has lived in a home where two are basically not
             agreed can have any real idea of the level of cruelty that one who
             once professed loving devotion can impose on the former object of
             affection. This is especially true if the "drifter" from God still has
             a troubling and accusing conscience. Similar kinds of cruelty—
             mental and physical—will rain down upon God's true children in
             the final days of earth's history. Only the heart kept by the Spirit
             will retain loyalty to God in that climax of the ages.

 Part 4     In the conflict between God and Satan, on what evidence or other
Peace     basis do you choose sides?
Versus
Enmity      "To be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal
          mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God,
          neither indeed can be" (Rom. 8:6, 7).

             It is tragic ever to have to think of man as the enemy of God,
          when he was created in God's image, with every advantage and
          facility for retaining a position of loving loyalty to the inward law
          implanted in his nature. But such is the sad consequence of the first
          transgression of the law of God. Since then the carnal mind has
          been at enmity with God, for it is not submissive to His law and
          cannot be.
             If man will look into the mirror of the law of God as revealed in
          the life of Je sus here on earth, he will see himself as a sinner under
          the doom and penalty of the sacred law. But he need not despair.
          He has not been abandoned, not left an orphan. The Son of God on
          the cross of Calvary provided a way of deliverance from sin's
          penalty and power, having lived a perfect life. For this purpose
          God gave His only-begotten Son. (See John 3:16.)

            Note the steps by which Jesus reconciled mankind to God. Eph.
          2:13-16.

             "Shortly before His crucifixion Christ had bequeathed to His
          disciples a legacy of peace. 'Peace I leave with you,' He said, 'My
          peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth; give I unto you. Let
          not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.' John 14:27. This
          peace is not the peace that comes through conformity to the world.
          Christ never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace
          that Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external and
          was ever to remain with His witnesses through strife and conten-
          tion. Christ said of Himself, 'Think not that I am come to send
          peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.' Matthew
          10:34. The Prince of Peace, He was yet the cause of division. He
          who came to proclaim glad tidings and to create hope and joy in the
          hearts of the children of men, opened a controversy that burns
          deep and arouses intense passion in the human heart."—The Acts
          of the Apostles, p. 84. (See Luke 21:12, 16.)

             In order to make a peace treaty effective, both tides must observe
          its details. How sincere are you in observing your peace treaty with
          God purchased by Jesus Christ?

             Maturity Through Inner Conflict                      1 3 Thursday
                                                                         March 25

    Part 5     What supreme blessing does righteousness bring to us through the
lightous- work of the Spirit when Christ is in us?
     ness
ersus Sin      "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit
            is life because of righteousness" (Rom. 8:10).

                 "Throughout the Scriptures righteousness is consistently as-
              sociated with life, as sin is with death. When there is righteousness
              in the life, there is evidence of the presence and power of the Spirit
              of God, and this means life.
                 "Some commentators prefer to limit the meaning of righteous-
              ness in this passage to the righteousness of Christ imputed to the
              believer for life-giving justification. . . . But the context does not
              seem to indicate such a limitation. Taking righteousness in the
              widest sense, Paul's meaning seems to be that, although the body
              is dead because of Adam's sin, in which we have all participated . . . ,
              the spirit is life because of Christ's righteousness, which has first
              been imputed in justification and is later imparted in sanctification.
              This gift of righteousness is accompanied by the gift of eternal
              life."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 565.
                  Holiness is being completely for God, making a total surrender
               to the working out of the inward law by God's grace. So holiness is
               not inherited; neither is it the gift of the most capable human.
               Holiness is the gift of God through Jesus Christ alone. When we
               receive Him and His righteousness, we become members of God's
               family, born again, renewed in righteousness. Our very minds are
               changed so that we can perceive eternal realities. As adopted
               children, counted righteous in Jesus, we come to resemble our
               Father more and more under the Spirit's transforming power.

                 How do we have this righteousness? Do we develop it through
               Bible study and prayer, or do we simply gain it by accepting it as a
               gift from Christ? Rom. 5:17, 18, 21.

                 Both in our conversion and in the life experience of transforming
               grace and power, the absolute righteousness of Jesus Christ
               purchases, through the cross and resurrection, our complete ac-
               ceptance with God. "The work of transformation from unholiness
               to holiness is a continuous one. Day by day God labors for man's
               sanctification, and man is to co-operate with Him, putting forth
               persevering efforts in the cultivation of right habits. He is to add
               grace to grace; and as he thus works on the plan of addition, God
               works for him on the plan of multiplication."—The Acts of the
               Apostles, p. 532.

  Part 6     What undeserved relationship is the reward of those who accept
 Slaves    Christ?
 Versus
Children     "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye
           have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father"
           (Rom. 8:15).

             "The dearest gift that heaven itself had to bestow has been
           poured out that God 'might be just, and the justifier of him which
           believeth in Jesus.' By that gift men are uplifted from the ruin and
           degradation of sin to become children of God. . . .
             "Brethren, with the beloved John I call upon you to 'behold,
           what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
           should be called the sons of God.' What love, what matchless love,
           that, sinners and aliens as we are, we may be brought back to God
           and adopted into His family! We may address Him by the endear-
           ing name, 'Our Father,' which is a sign of our affection for Him and
           a pledge of His tender regard and relationship to us."—
           Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 739, 740.

             If we are rightfully to address God as Jesus taught, what impact
           should it have on our experience? (See Matt. 6:9.)

              "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the
           control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of
           freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed to
           see the beauty of truth, for his mind is under the control of Satan.
           While he flatters himself that he is following the dictates of his own
           judgment, he obeys the will of the prince of darkness. Christ came
           to break the shackles of sin-slavery from the soul. 'If the Son
           therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.' [John
           8:36.1—The Desire of Ages, p. 466.

             What effect does sonship in Christ have upon the whole life? (See
           Col. 1:12-14, 19-23; 2:10.)

             The righteousness ofJesus Christ and His sacrificial death in our
           behalf, when accepted wholly, justify His adoption of us into the
           family of God. This remains the only basis—acceptance in and
           through the divine Substitute. Having been adopted, we prostrate
           ourselves in joy and gratitude at His feet, crying: "Lord, what wilt
           Thou have me to do?" He shows us and empowers the restoration
           of the inward law in our whole being by the ministry of His Spirit.

             What are the differences between a child and a slave? What
           identifies you as a child of God?
