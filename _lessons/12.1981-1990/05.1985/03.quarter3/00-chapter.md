     "Who am I?" "Where do I come from?" "Why am I here?"
  "Where am I going?" "Does life have meaning?" "What is the
  origin of pain, alienation, and death?" Amid the confusion of
  responses and opinions suggested throughout history, the book
  of Genesis and the rest of the Bible confidently answer these all-
  important questions. While other explanations may contain ele-
  ments of truth, Scripture, as the revelation of the Creator, boldly
  claims to provide ultimate truth.
     Genesis is a book of beginnings. It describes the origin of
  earth, sky, order, fauna, flora, humankind, marriage, society,
  ethics, history, culture, science, labor, love, grace, salvation,
  faith, providence, distrust, sin, passion, pain, alienation, and
  judgment. However, because Genesis also indicates that God is
  self-existent, we can be confident about meaning and purpose in
  life. Sin and its resultant tragedy are temporary, although power-
  ful intruders. God not only is the first word but also the last word.
  He will guide His handiwork to its glorious destiny.

I le Way of Faith
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Overview of the Book of Genesis.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;

1E  and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
    shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away"
    (Rev. 21:4).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: The book of Genesis reminds us of our origin and
our inestimable value to God and reveals that the way of faith leads from
Eden lost to Eden restored.

OVERVIEW: The book of Genesis can be divided broadly into two parts
that are linked and interlaced with genealogies. The first section outlines
primal or primeval history (the earliest history of the world), spanning
Genesis 1 through 11. In contrast with most of the Old Testament, this
record of early history has as its subject the world and the human race in its
totality. The second part of Genesis, consisting of chapters 12 through 50,
known as patriarchal history, narrows the earlier global perspective down
to a particular family in a specific geographical region.

INTRODUCTION: The book of Genesis contains much helpful instruction
for Christians today. Here the Creator provides His answers to the mystery
of the origin of humanity and the world. This book meets our intense need
to belong by declaring that our roots are in the heart and hand of God. His
words and works point up our extraordinary value.
   The book of Genesis goes beyond the question of beginnings and, as
does the rest of the Old Testament, points to the consummation of God's
purpose and design. Inspiration offers an explanation of the world in which
we live and accounts for both the good and the evil that characterize our
existence. We are assured that sin will not have the last word. The heroes
of the book are pilgrims who invite us to join them in discovering what is
best in this world and the excellence of the "better country, that is an
heavenly" (Heb. 11:16).
   The book of Genesis may be likened to a treasure chest filled with an
abundance of gems. During this week we propose to focus on several of its
many treasures. We will review particularly those themes that reveal the
Lord of creation and His constant affection for those He created. Once
more we will be reminded of our magnificent God and our own lofty origin,
inalienable identity, and illustrious destiny. We conclude our lesson with
the observation that the promises and expressions of hope found in the
book of Genesis carry us beyond its pages. They point to a new heaven and
a new earth where faith gives way to sight and Jesus rules forevermore.

DAY I. BACKGROUND AND AUTHORSHIP.

      1. Authorship.
      The Pentateuch (the first five books found in our modern Bibles) itself
    gives evidence that Moses was its author. The books that begin with Exodus
    and end with Deuteronomy intertwine the life and work of Moses with the
    events that they record. They also include lengthy speeches of Moses and
    refer to other material that he wrote. (See for example Ex. 17:14; 24:3-7;
    Num. 33:2.) In addition, the form of the book of Deuteronomy corresponds
    to a style of Near-Eastern treaties that predominated in the Mosaic age but
    virtually disappeared after that period.
       Nevertheless, the Pentateuch largely is written as history and biography
    rather than as autobiography (such as the memoirs of Nehemiah). There
    also is evidence for later additions (for example, the report of Moses' death
    and burial in Deuteronomy 34:5, 6) and updating (for example the place
    named Dan; compare Genesis 14:14 with Judges 18:29).

      How does the New Testament support Moses' authorship of the Penta-
    teuch? Compare Mark 12:26 with Exodus 3:6.


      The New Testament supports the fact that the Pentateuch was written by
    Moses. Ellen White, reflecting on the sojourn of Moses in the desert of
    Midian, commented: "Here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he
    wrote the book of Genesis."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 251.

      2. Historical Genuineness.

    COMPARE as many of the following passages as time allows:
     1. Matt. 19:3-8 and Gen. 1:27; 2:24.
     2. Luke 17:26-30 and Gen. 6 and 19.
     3. Rom. 4:3, 9-21 and Gen. 15:4-6; 18:11.
     4. Heb. 11:3-22 and Gen. 1:3-26; 4:4; 5:24; 6:13, 22; 12:1, 4.

      What do these later references to events in the book of Genesis imply
    about the historical genuineness of Genesis?


      Later Bible references to specific aspects in Genesis demonstrate no
    hesitancy on the part of Jesus and the writers of the Bible to accept the
    details of the Creation story and other accounts recorded in the first book
    of the Old Testament. Indeed, some of the references make these details of
    Genesis the basis for teachings that would collapse were they without
    historical basis.

    11. HOW GENESIS PICTURES GOD.

      The book of Genesis is first and foremost a revelation of God. In this first
    book the Bible opens to our view many splendid facets of the God whom
    we still worship today.

                                                                                 7
          DIP Wiz c0 iletlib                                            064arD 0
DAY       1. Divine Preexistence and Power.

[1] SEARCH AND LEARN: How is God depicted in the following passages?

          Gen 1.1

          Gen. 14:19, 22

          Gen. 18:23-33

          Gen. 48.15

        The first book of the Bible rings with the might and power of God. He is
      seen as the Creator, Judge, Exemplar, Sustainer, Most High, Almighty,
      and Everlasting God. As the Sovereign He not only exists before everything
      but also brings everything into existence.
        However, the God of Scripture is not simply the All Holy, or some
      detached and distant deity, He also demonstrates intense concern over the
      welfare, progress, and happiness of His creatures.

          2. Divine Purpose and Planning.

        What assurances does Genesis offer that human destiny is guided by a
      divine purpose and plan? Gen. 1:26; 3:15; 15:13-15.


         The Creation story in Genesis not only maintains a distinction between
      the Creator and the creature but also reveals that creation is the product of
      the divine will rather than a result of blind forces of chance. Similarly, the
      rise and fall of nations testify to God's purpose. Eliezer was convinced that
      Providence had led him to find Rebekah; and Joseph had no doubt that,
      although from a human perspective so many years of his life seemed cruelly
      wasted, God's purpose had been realized in his life. Likewise, the experi-
      ences of Jacob and Esau reassure us today that no amount of human
      stubbornness, deceit, or faithless scheming can thwart the carrying out of
      God's will and purpose.

        How does the New Testament reinforce the truth that there is a divine
      plan? Acts 2:23; Gal. 4:4.


         Although human research may detect no more than causes and effects in
      history, Scripture claims that God accomplishes His will quietly, steadily,
      and unperturbed by human schemes. This divine plan gives meaning to our
      lives.
DAY       3. Divine Interest in and Contact with Earth.

        What examples illustrate the living contact between heaven and earth?
      What agencies does God employ to care for His human children? Gen. 19: 12-
      17; 28:12-15.

      8
   "Heaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder, the base of which
is firmly planted on the earth, while the topmost round reaches the throne
of the Infinite. Angels are constantly ascending and descending this ladder
of shining brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy and distressed to
the Father above, and bringing blessing and hope, courage and help, to the
children of men. These angels of light create a heavenly atmosphere about
the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and the eternal....
   "... It would be well to remember that every true child of God has the
cooperation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend
the meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God."—
The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 153, 154.

SEARCH AND LEARN: While Genesis speaks of God as the all-powerful
Creator, it also depicts Him as intensely personal. Look up at least two of the
following examples: Gen. 1:26, 27; 2:7; 3:8; 5:24; 6:8, 13-18; 18:17.

  The God of power is the God of love who revealed Himself millenniums
later in the life, work, and words of Jesus. (Compare Heb. 1:2.) God is
delighted by His handiwork, grieved by sin, and open to man's prayer. He
saves from danger and folly, remains faithful in spite of human unfaithful-
ness, and bestows His supreme regard upon the human family.

  4. Divine Justice and Loving Purpose.

  While God lavishes His grace and love upon His human children, what is
His attitude toward sin and the sinner? Gen. 3:14, 16-19, 24.


  Divine love ceases to be love if it permits sin and destructive forces to go
unchecked. Moses testified to the fact that, although God's mercy bears
long with a sinner, there is a limit beyond which the sinner can no longer
receive mercy.
  "The Saviour watches for a response to His offers of love and forgiveness,
with a more tender compassion than that which moves the heart of an
earthly parent to forgive a wayward, suffering son. ... But if the erring one
persistently refuses to heed the voice that calls him with pitying, tender
love, he will at last be left in darkness. The heart that has long slighted
God's mercy, becomes hardened in sin, and is no longer susceptible to the
influence of the grace of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 165.

SEARCH AND LEARN: Study as many of the following texts as you need to
in order to learn what Genesis indicates about how fair God is: Genesis 3:11-
13; 4:10; 6:3, 5, 11, 12; 11:5; 18:21.

   The pattern of Creation, Fall, destruction, and re-creation that summa-
rizes Genesis 1 through 11 points to the final judgment and salvation of
God's remnant.




                                                                              9

DAY Ill. THE CROWNING ACT OF CREATION.

      1. Noble Beginnings.
      Scripture avows that "God is love" (1 John 4:8). Because true love cannot
    exist apart from community, God created beings who could both love and
    be loved.

      What privileges and responsibilities were bestowed upon Adam and Eve
    by virtue of their creation in the divine "image" and "likeness"? Gen.
    1:26-28.



       Even after the Fall, humanity, although in constant need of renewal in the
    likeness of Christ, still is considered to be in God's "image." What does this
    fact tell us about our origin, identity, and value? Gen. 9:6; James 3:9; 1 Cor.
    11:7.


       The biblical doctrine of creation affirms the potential within every human
    being regardless of sex, race, color, or standing in society. Although sin has
    deprived us of innate goodness, the doctrine of creation and redemption
    stresses the inestimable value and importance that all of us possess. When
    we realize what it means to be made in the image of God we will be
    conscious of unique qualities such as conscience, self-awareness, freedom,
    decision, creativity, and the ability to value and be valued. The Bible story
    insists that we are precious to God and invites us to love those who, through
    creation, are our brothers and sisters.

      How did the Creator demonstrate the value of social relationships? Gen.
    2:18-24.


       Created for community, we can reach up to our Creator and reach out
    to our fellow creatures. Being in the image of God enables us to commune
    with our Maker and with one another.
       Marriage is the basis and continuation of human life and society. Even
    though social, economic, and psychological reasons may be advanced for
    marriage, it is the biblical pattern that invests it with deeper meaning and
    characterizes it as an indissoluble bond.
       "A well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of
    the reality of the Christian religion—an argument that the infidel cannot
    gainsay. ... If the homes of professed Christians had a right religious mold,
    they would exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be the
    `light of the world.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.

      How did God provide for the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, and moral
    needs of His creatures at Creation? Gen. 1:29-31; 2:2, 3, 16, 17.



    10
DAY      2. The Legacy of Faith and of Distrust.
         In the book of Genesis human choices most often were based upon sight,
1.11,A taste, touch, sound, and reason rather than on faith. Eve, Adam, Abraham,
       Isaac, Jacob, and a host of others sometimes followed the voice of the
       creature rather than the clear word of God. Cain chose his own mode of
       worship while Abel trusted himself completely to the merits of Another.
       Ever since, righteousness by works has been in conflict with righteousness
       by faith.

      RECALL: Although by nature the biblical heroes were as prone to sin as
      their contemporaries, what examples can you think of that reveal that di-
      vine grace enables people to rise above the level of their selfish propensities?


         Genesis reminds us that the way of trust in God's love and wisdom is
      more beneficial than any attempt on our part to gain our own wishes.
      Believing the promise of Genesis 3:15, Adam called his wife "mother of
      the living," and Eve saw in Cain and Seth anticipations of the Seed, if not
      the Seed. By faith Noah obeyed God and built the ark. He and his family
      entered it in spite of a mocking crowd. By faith Abraham chose Canaan
      and was willing to offer Isaac. By faith the line of God's family continued
      through Jacob rather than through Esau. By faith Joseph rose to promi-
       nence and preeminence and Ephriam superseded Manasseh. These four
      generations of the family of Abraham reveal the superiority of the way of
      faith over the path of sight. But it was not the easiest way to travel.
         "It is one of the strongest evidences of the truth of Scripture, that facts
      are not glossed over, nor the sins of its chief characters suppressed. ...
         "Men whom God favored, and to whom He entrusted great responsibil-
      ities, were sometimes overcome by temptation and committed sin, even as
      we at the present day strive, waver, and frequently fall into error. Their
      lives, with all their faults and follies, are open before us, both for our
      encouragement and warning. If they had been represented as without fault,
      we, with our sinful nature, might despair at our own mistakes and failures.
      But seeing where others struggled through discouragements like our own,
      where they fell under temptation as we have done, and yet took heart again
      and conquered through the grace of God, we are encouraged in our striving
      after righteousness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 238.

      IV. THE BEGINNING OF THE END.

        The theme of promise of descendants, land, and salvation binds together
      the narratives within Genesis and links Genesis to the rest of Scripture.
      The genealogies and the table of nations testify to the fulfillment of God's
      blessings given at Creation, as do also the patriarchal narratives. Genesis
      begins the movement from promise to fulfillment that extends beyond the
      Pentateuch and, according to the New Testament, meets its final realization
      in the "better country, that is, an heavenly" (Heb. 11:16). The first book of
      the Bible began with the vibrant life of creation and concluded with a coffin.
      Nevertheless, the patriarchs did not die in despair but died full of faith and
      hope. Beyond both Egypt and the grave they anticipated a better land.

                                                                                     11
     I um eztv alub                                                    Lesson      1
     SEARCH AND LEARN: What common themes can you discover in both
     Genesis and Revelation? How are they related to each other? Compare:

       a. Gen. 3:8-10 with Rev. 21.3

       b. Gen. 3:17 with Rev. 22.3

       c. Gen. 3:22 with Rev. 22-2

       d. Gen. 3:23 with Rev. 2125
       The last chapters of the book of Revelation, which return to the first
     chapters of the book of Genesis, conclude with the elimination of suffering
     and death. Humanity excluded from the divine presence because of sin has
     found readmittance because of grace. Joseph's final words, "God will
     surely visit you" (Gen. 50:24), are taken up and consummated in the
     assurance of Jesus, "Surely, I come quickly" (Rev. 22:20).


E
DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Prophets,
    chapter I, "Why Was Sin Permitted?"
        Meditate on the following: "The great controversy is ended. Sin and
     sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony
     and gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all,
     flow life and light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space.
     From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and
     inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is
     love."— The Great Controversy, p. 678.

     SUMMARY: In the book of Genesis, Inspiration offers us an explanation
     of the world in which we live. It explains our yearning for happiness,
     goodness, beauty, and eternal life, as well as those jagged experiences in
     our existence such as selfishness, sin, sickness, sadness, and death. Genesis
     clarifies how it all began and intimates how it all will end.

     APPLICATION:
     o Do I recognize my noble origin and value as a child of God?
     o Do I realize that I am the subject of God's supreme regard?
     o The Lord tells me that He covets my presence in His new creation, the
       first fruits of which I already am experiencing. Will I accept His invitation
       without reservation?

INTRODUCTION: The biblical account of Creation gives purpose, mean-
ing, and value to our existence. The opening verse of the Bible not only
indicates the preexistence and power of our beneficent God but gives the
lie to such human philosophies as atheism, polytheism, pantheism, mate-
rialism, and fatalism.
   Genesis 1 implies that the Creator must be superior to His creation while
at the same time being intimately involved with His handiwork. Particu-
larly, the creation of human beings in the image of God invests humanity
with dignity and responsibility. All people are created equal, and all are
accountable. To be "in the image of God" means, among other things, (1)
that our lineage originates with God, and (2) that we are answerable to
such questions as "Adam, where are you?" and "Where is your brother?"
   Finally, this doctrine of a supernatural beginning justifies the doctrine of
a supernatural end to this world and a new supernatural beginning.
                                                                             13
DAY I. "IN THE BEGINNING" (Gen. 1:1, 2).

12     1. Opening Summary (verse 1).
       The book of Genesis begins with a summary statement that sets forth the
     biblical record of origins. The remainder of chapter 1 unfolds the majestic
     summary of verse 1 and describes in well-defined literary units how our
     globe was made into a life-supporting world.

     NOTICE who it is that is the subject of the first statement in the Bible.
     Verse 1.

       What does the New Testament indicate as to the identity of the Creator?
     John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-20; Heb. 1:2, 3, 10-12.


       Nature's Creator rather than the process of creation is the subject of
     Genesis 1 and indeed remains the primary focus in the rest of this chapter.
     The word God punctuates the 31 verses of this chapter 32 times and rebukes
     perverse human curiosity that musters a greater passion for the knowledge
     of nature than for a knowledge of the God of nature.
       Because a benevolent Creator precedes the Creation we may rest assured
     that His creative activity follows a divine plan and has meaning.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Indicate below what words are used in Genesis 1 to
     designate the creative process besides the verb "to create."

       Verse 3

       Verse 4

       Verse 7

       Verse 17

       God created by means of a commanding word (verses 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20,
     24; compare Ps. 33:6-9) or by using the matter which He already had
     brought into existence. Ultimately, the Creator precedes all matter (Heb.
     11:3). "The theory that God did not create matter when He brought the
     world into existence is without foundation. In the formation of our world,
     God was not indebted to pre-existing matter."— Testimonies , vol. 8, p. 258.

       What time references begin and end the account of Creation?
     Gen. 1:1; 2:2.


        "To the question: When did God create 'the heaven and the earth'? we
     can only answer, 'In the beginning.' And to the question: When did God
     complete His work? we can only answer, 'On the seventh day God ended
     his work.' ...
        "These remarks regarding the creation account are made, not in an
     attempt to close the discussion, but as a confession that we are unprepared
     14
      to speak with certainty beyond what is clearly revealed. The very fact that
      so much rests upon the creation record—even the whole edifice of Scrip-
      ture—prompts the devout and prudent Bible student to conform his decla-
      ration to the explicit words of Holy Writ. ... There is always safety within
      the protecting bounds of Scriptural quotation marks."—S.D.A. Bible
      Commentary, vol. 1, p. 208.
         Although it is plain that the Bible offers no date for the "beginning"
      discussed in verse 1, the entire chapter makes it clear that it took only a few
      days to begin life on this planet, not the millions of years proposed by
      biological evolution.

DAY     2. First Stage of Creation (Gen. 1:2).

         What does verse 2 tell us about the condition of the earth at the beginning
      of Creation?


         The phrase "without form, and void" depicts an environment without
      shape, form, and light, and void of plant and animal life; in short, a non-
      life-supporting globe.
         Through the centuries several commentators have suggested that verses
      1 and 2 envisage an "original" and "perfect" creation ruled by Lucifer that
      rebelled and was reduced by God to a chaotic state. According to this
      theory, which Seventh-day Adventists reject, an unspecified and long gap
      of time exists between verses 1 and 2 that accounts for both the fossil
      sediment and geological eras. Such an interpretation is unjustified on the
      grounds of the Hebrew construction used to introduce verse 2 which reads
      "And the earth was" and not "And the earth became" as required by this
      theory.

        How is the action of the Holy Spirit described in the second half of
      verse 2?


         The "deep" like the "face of the waters" refers to the watery surface of
      the planet over which the Holy Spirit hovered watchfully and protectively.
      (The Hebrew word for "moved" or "hovered" also is used in Deuteronomy
      32:11 to describe a mother eagle caring for its young.) A watery deep also
      figures in the so-called Babylonian creation story (Enuma Elish) where,
      however, it is personified as a deified water monster in combat with other
      deities. Genesis 1:2 knows nothing of such a war. In fact, the Enuma Elish
      is not a creation story as such but a hymn in honor of the god Marduk , and
      celebrates Marduk's ascendency over the rest of the Babylonian deities.
         In sum, verse 2 depicts planet Earth at the beginning of Creation week
      empty, without form, covered with water, and enshrouded with darkness.
      All the while the Holy Spirit was waiting, ready to assist in the next phase
      of creation. The first two verses of Scripture represent God as a loving
      God intimately concerned with His creation. Today He still watches over
      the creation of His hands, ready through His Holy Spirit to recreate
       hearts that are empty and enshrouded with darkness.

                                                                                   15
DAY 11. "FORM" AND "FULLNESS" (Gen. 1:3-25).

      1. Days One Through Three (verses 3-13).
      Referring to the overview chart that begins this lesson will help us
    understand that the work of the first three days gave "form" to Creation
    and the creative activity of the last three days gave "fullness" to the "form."

       How essential was the creation of light? Verses 3-5.


      It was not an explosion of light but the sound of God's voice that began
    the movement ot the first day. Up to that point darkness alone had envel-
    oped the globe. But as light poured in, a sort of twilight came into existence
    amidst the watery mass and separated "day" from "night." Darkness was
    not abolished. Instead it was subordinated and, finally as a part of the
    entire Creation, was declared to be "very good" (verse 31).

      According to verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, and 31 what part of the day begins the
    daily cycle and what implication does this have for us?


       The duration of each of the six days of the Creation week mentioned in
    Genesis 1 is literally described as "evening was, morning was." The combi-
    nation "evening (implying the following hours of the night)" and "morning
    (including the succeeding hours of the day)" designates clearly a literal day.
    In referring to the days of Creation week, the fourth commandment
    reinforces this conclusion (Ex. 20:11). So does the suggestion that whenever
    an ordinal number modifies the Hebrew word day it designates a day
    marked off by one complete rotation of the planet. Much later the Hebrews
    still commenced the day with sunset and ended it with the following sunset
    recognizing that "evening and morning" were essential components of a
    standard twenty-four-hour period. (See Lev. 23:32.) The notion that the
    days of Creation designate long and undefined periods of time was intro-
    duced on other than scriptural grounds and is unjustified.

       Note the accomplishments of the second day of Creation. Gen. 1:6-8.


       The expanse of the "firmament" separated the water that had enveloped
     the earth into two separate entities. Commentators generally identify the
     waters above the expanse with a cloudlike or water-vapor mass and those
     below with oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers.

       With what does the Bible writer identify "heaven" in verse 8?


       This account is written from the standpoint of a hypothetical observer
     based on the surface of our planet. Thus heaven would refer to the "atmo-
     sphere" or "sky" without which life as we know it would be impossible.


     16
        What two creative acts occurred on the third day? Verses 9-13.



        What definition of "earth" is offered in verse 10?


         Although the dry portion of our planet is designated "earth" in this
      verse, this definition would not apply to verse 2 in which the "earth" was
      still completely enveloped by water.
         In the manner in which Moses classifies, distinguishes, and defines what
      God has done, we see signs of what today would be termed scientific
      description. The repeated phrase "after their kind" suggests that different
      and distinct kinds of plants and animals were created at the same time.
      While Genesis does not deny variation within a species, it does not support
      the notion that plants and animals evolved from lower to higher forms
      of life.
DAY     2. Days Four Through Six (Gen. 1:14-25).
        With the creation of the life-giving properties of light and air, skies
      above, and verilant and solid land bordered by terrestrial waters below, the
      basic characteristics of the world were completed on the third day. "Form"
      had been imparted where there had been no form. The next three days
      were to provide the "fullness" as the Lord filled earth, sea, and sky.

        What is the significance of what God did on the fourth day of Creation
      week? Verses 14-19.


         The light-giving bodies that the Creator caused to appear in the "firma-
      ment" were not given to serve as rulers of fate but to designate times and
      seasons as well as to give light. The functions attributed to sun, moon, and
      stars in Scripture do not support the claims of astrology, which ascribes to
      the planetary bodies hidden powers of destiny. (Compare Isa. 47:13, 14;
      Jer. 10:2.)
         Because the Bible implies the existence of other worlds (see Heb. 1:2;
      11:3), it is unreasonable to assume that some of the stars referred to in
      Genesis 1:16 (and that could include our own sun) existed before the
      creation of this world. However, speculation on this could obscure Moses'
      primary thrust in the creation record, namely, that God also created the
      light-giving bodies.

        Summarize the creative act of the fifth day of Creation week. Gen. 1:20-
      23.


         Genesis 1 makes no reference to the creation of water. It simply assumes
      its existence. Marine creatures were to occupy the waters below and winged
      creatures the air above. In parallel to verse 11, which literally reads "let the
      earth vegetate vegetation," verse 20 suggests, "let the waters swarm with a
      swarm of living creatures." The Hebrew expression "living creatures" is

                                                                                   17
    identical with the last words in Genesis 2:7: "living soul," that is, "living
    being." To an observer standing on the earth looking up at the atmospheric
    heavens, the birds would be seen flying "above the earth across the expanse
    of the sky" (verse 20, NIV).

      What is the significance of the blessing God pronounced upon the crea-
    tures of sea and sky and upon mankind? Verses 22, 28.


      The blessing "be fruitful and multiply" was realized as the earth began
    to be filled. The genealogies and the nations are ample evidence of the
    fulfillment of God's benediction.
      As God beheld His workmanship, an exclamation of admiration escaped
    His lips which is expressed in the Genesis account in the words "it was
    good" (verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25) and, at the culmination, "it was very good"
    (verse 31).

DAY I11. THE CROWNING ACT OF GOD'S CREATION (Gen. 1:26-31).

         How is "man" defined in verse 27 and in Genesis 5:2?


      "Man" is not simply "male" but both "male" and "female." It takes the
    two different sexes to express what Scripture means by "human."

      What do the words our image and our likeness mean? Gen. 1:26, 27; 9:6;
    James 3:9.


       The words image and likeness complement each other and should not be
    treated as distinct expressions. The Scripture portrays human beings as
    whole persons or a unity.
       "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical,
    mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker.... It was His [God's]
    purpose that the longer man lived the more fully he should reveal His
    image—the more fully reflect the glory of the Creator....
       "But by disobedience this was forfeited. Through sin the divine likeness
    was marred, and well-nigh obliterated. Man's physical powers were weak-
    ened, his mental capacity was lessened, his spiritual vision dimmed.... Yet
    the race was not left without hope.... To restore in man the image of his
    Maker, to bring him back to the perfection in which he was created, to
    promote the development of body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose
    in his creation might be realized—this was to be the work of redemp-
    tion."—Education, pp. 15, 16.

      How is the relationship between human beings and God and the rest of
    creation elaborated in Genesis 1:26 through 30? What responsibilities are
    imposed upon humanity? (Compare Ps. 8:6-8.)



    18
       Commentators suggest several alternatives to interpret the "us... our...
     our" in verse 26, none of which are without problems. (See also Gen. 3:22;
     11:7; Isa. 6:8.) However, the chapter clearly specifies and the Old Testament
     generally represents creation as the act of God. The plurals used in this
     verse allow both for the role of the Holy Spirit mentioned in verse 2 and the
     New Testament declaration of Christ's involvement in creation.
       As a consequence of their creation in the image of God, Adam and Eve
     were to govern all of nature, of which they also were a part. Tragically, the
     Fall soon demonstrated that those who are ungoverned readily confuse the
     words "govern" and "exploit."

       What do Genesis 1:26 through 28 tell us about our identity, dignity, and
     value?


       Within the heart of each of us there is an intense need to belong that can
     be met adequately only by a conscious knowledge of our identity. The
     deeper the roots of our identity, the more stable our sense of security will
     be.
       The book of Genesis provides us with the deepest possible roots of
     identity, for God declared, "Let us make man in our image." So began a
     golden thread that runs through the biblical genealogies to the advent of
     Christ, binding together all those who are found in Him. Our sense of
     belonging, weakened by sin, is strengthened by redemption in Jesus. Now
     the double root of creation and redemption supports our identity in God,
     for in Jesus we are both made and remade in His image.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Patriarchs and Prophets,

IE pp. 44, 45; Education, pp. 15-18; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on
   Genesis 1.

     SUMMARY: Like a majestic anthem, Genesis 1 unfolds in six measured
     stanzas the noble origin of our world and mankind. It testifies to a beneficent
     Creator, proclaims that life has meaning and purpose, and declares that
     human beings invested with the image of God have identity, dignity, and
     responsibility.

     APPLICATION:
     o Do I share the psalmist's reverent wonder, praise, and adoration as he
       contemplated the work of Creation (Psalm 8)?
     o In the light of creation and redemption, do I recognize my true identity
       and value as well as that of all other human beings, regardless of sex,
       race, or color?
     o What responsibilities has the Almighty given me in regard to being a
       steward of my environment?
     o How does the doctrine of beginnings affect my understanding of the
       doctrine of the end?
     o Do I experience re-creation and growth in the image and likeness of my
       Creator and Redeemer?

human life that God made in Eden. It presents a model of loving parental
care in which God attends to the physical, mental, aesthetic, and moral
needs of His children.

INTRODUCTION: Having dealt with how all of creation came into being,
the writer now focuses on human beings and their immediate environment.
Whereas Genesis 1 answered the question How did it all originate? Genesis
2 explains why we are what we are. Without the information provided by
Genesis 2, the test of allegiance to God and the subsequent Fall described
in Genesis 3 would, to a large extent, be unintelligible. The intimate world
of Adam and Eve surrounded by trees and animals in a garden complements
the previous majestic account of Creation. Chapter 2 introduces the reader
of the Bible to the social dimensions of humanity and gives some insight on
prehistory and the original geography of the world.
   Genesis 2 deals with such divine institutions as Sabbath, work, home,
and marriage. Given to the human race before the Fall, these institutions
lie at the basis of human existence, conduct, and happiness. Every seventh
day should remind us of our benevolent Creator and our noble origin.
Because of this the Sabbath stands at the basis of all worship. It suggests
that the Creator is worthy of worship and able to create and recreate His
creatures. "The duty to worship God is based on the fact that He is the
Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence."— The Great
Controversy, p. 436.
   God's rest day reveals both the dimension in human beings by which we
are linked to Him in whose "image and likeness" we were made and the
obligations that we as creatures have toward our Creator. The marriage
20
    institution, in turn, highlights our relationships to our fellow beings and the
    obligations we have to one another.
       The Christian home in which the angels love to linger prepares its
    members for both this world and the world that is to come. The erosion of
    and the current attacks upon these Edenic institutions and upon the work
    ethic that is based on God's gracious provision in the Garden have con-
    tributed directly to the present disintegration of law, order, society, and
    the family.
DAY I. THE SABBATH (Gen. 2:1-3).

      Although the creation of the human race was the crown of God's creative
    activity, what set of specific actions concluded Creation week, and what is
    their significance to us today? Verses 2, 3. (Compare with Ex. 20:11 and
    31:17.)


      Although the noun sabbath is not mentioned in Genesis 2, the verb for
    rested, from which the term sabbath is derived, suggests clearly that the
    Sabbath is meant. As part of the gift of Creation, the seventh-day Sabbath
    was given to the entire human race and not merely to one nation (Mark
    2:27). As that which has from time immemorial marked the conclusion of
    the weekly cycle, the Sabbath provides an explanation for the origin of the
    week.

      According to Exodus 20:9-11, what divine pattern of labor and rest was
    given to which human beings are to conform?


      In the light of the fact that Isaiah 40:28 states that the Creator does not
    faint or grow weary, it would appear that God's rest and cessation from
    labor set an example that every member of the human race was expected to
    follow. God's Sabbath observance initiated and served as a model for our
    Sabbath observance (Ex. 20:11). Created in the "image of God" and
    encouraged to engage in useful employment, we are invited to rest with the
    Creator and to rejoice in His creation (1:27, 28). No command is stated in
    Genesis 2:2, 3, but what better injunction could be given than God's act of
    resting, blessing, and setting the seventh day apart as holy? Adam and Eve
    were an integral part of God's act of setting apart the Sabbath. They began
    their life with joy and rest rather than with self-interested work.
       No other day of the week ever has been singled out in this fashion. The
    blessedness and holiness of the seventh-day Sabbath originated with an act
    of God, and not with a decision of any human being or group of humans. By
    blessing this day God filled it with fruitfulness, prosperity, happiness, life,
    and success. By sanctifying the last day of the week He set the seventh day
    apart for His distinct use and filled its time with the presence of the divine.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Compare "holy sabbath" in Exodus 16:23; 31:14,
     15; 35:2; Isaiah 58:13. What have you learned from doing so?



                                                                                 21
       In a way that is unique from any other day of the week, the Sabbath is
    filled with God's presence.

       In what sense does the Creation Sabbath become the motivation for the
    scriptural command to keep the Sabbath? Ex. 20:8-11.


       Without the model provided by God's rest the Sabbath command lacks
    its very basis. As God completed His work in six days so that it was said to
    be "finished" on the seventh day, we are to complete our work during six
    working days and rest, looking beyond our earthly interests and needs to
    the privilege of communion with our Maker. God's rest day is not merely a
    stop sign but an invitation to an ever-growing friendship. We are invited to
    renounce our rule of self and to acknowledge God's dominion by a response
    of grateful joy, rest, and worship. Thus the Sabbath expresses the central
    truths of the gospel. Freedom from work enables us to enjoy freedom for
    God. God built a cathedral in time, the Sabbath, to which we come, laying
    aside our secular cares and problems, to enter His rest and to enjoy His
    presence.
DAY H. THE GARDEN (Gen. 2:4-17).

      Beginning with verse 4 of chapter 2 and continuing throughout the
    remainder of chapters 2 and 3, the double name Lord God is employed as
    against the single designation God found in Genesis 1:1 to 2:3. The combi-
    nation of these two names in chapters 2 and 3 seems to convey the fact that
    the Creator also is the more intimate God of the covenant.

       1. The Original Environment (verses 4-7).
       The scene shifts from the creation of the world to a local garden. Rather
    than being a second and different Creation narrative, Genesis 2 comple-
    ments Genesis 1. Human beings are the pinnacle of the pyramid in Gene-
    sis 1. In Genesis 2 they become the center of the circle. The spotlight falls
    on the human race, and everything else is relegated to the background.

      How does Genesis 2:7 complement 1:27? What do the verbs formed and
    breathed convey about God? (Compare Isa. 45:9, 10 and John 20:22.)


        Human beings are linked with heaven and earth. Formed initially of the
    "dust of the ground," Adam was animated by the breath of his Maker. The
    Creator is both Divine Sovereign and loving Father. With infinite care and
    intricate skill He fashioned the object of His hand, leaving no doubt as to
    His lordship. (See Isa. 29:16.) Then, as would be expected of a loving
    Father, God bent over the form He had created in His own image and gave
    it the animating breath of life. Even in the act of Creation we can anticipate
    the glorious news that "God so loved the world that he gave."

    SEARCH AND LEARN: What can we learn about the "breath of life" from
    studying the following scriptures? Gen. 7:21, 22; 1 Kings 17:17; Job 33:4;
    34:14, 15; Ps. 104:29, 30.

    22
        The Source of life imparted the "breath of life" both to humanity and to
      the rest of the creatures He made. Hence "breath of life" cannot refer to
      either mind or intelligence; rather, it designates the spark of life that is
      withdrawn at death. Without this spark of life the body remains lifeless.

        According to verse 7 what elements are essential to the existence of a
      "living soul"?


        The Hebrew word for soul found in this text is used 754 times in the Old
      Testament. It has a variety of meanings including "person," "self," "life,"
      or "being." Since a soul can die (Eze. 18:4) or be killed (Joshua 11:11) the
      word cannot designate what is popularly conceived of as an "immortal
      soul" but is best understood in the sense of "being." The popular concept
      of the "immortal soul" is foreign to the Bible. Genesis 2:7 states that only
      when the elements of the earth were animated by the spark of life from
      God did Adam become a "living being."
DAY     2. The Garden Home (Gen. 2:8-17).
       The specific geographical details presented in verses 10 through 14
bid indicate that, in the mind of the Bible writer, Eden was a specific locality
     rather than merely being a symbol or a metaphor. Several of the names
     mentioned in verses 11 through 14 are later applied to post-Flood localities
     and rivers. However, the Flood changed the surface features of our planet
     so radically that identification of pre-Flood geography with places and
     rivers known to us is impossible.

        What elements mentioned in verses 8 through 17 indicate that the garden
      home was an ideal model? (Note particularly the setting and the attention
      given to man's physical, mental, aesthetic, and moral needs.)


        "The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes as
      their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home, beautified
      by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. ... God placed
      Adam in a garden.... In the surroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for
      all time—that true happiness is found, not in the indulgence of pride and
      luxury, but in communion with God through His created works. ... Pride
      and ambition are never satisfied, but those who are truly wise will find
      substantial and elevating pleasure in the sources of enjoyment that God has
      placed within the reach of all."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 49, 50.

        What does verse 15 imply about the idea of "work"?


         "God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his mind, to
      strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In mental and physical
      activity Adam found one of the highest pleasures of his holy existence. And
      when, as a result of his disobedience, he was driven from his beautiful
      home, and forced to struggle with a stubborn soil to gain his daily bread,


                                                                                23
     that very labor, although widely different from his pleasant occupation in
     the garden, was a safeguard against temptation and a source of happiness.
     Those who regard work as a curse, attended though it be with weariness
     and pain, are cherishing an error. ... Our Creator, who understands what is
     for man's happiness, appointed Adam his work. The true joy of life is found
     only by the working men and women.... The Creator has prepared no place
     for the stagnating practice of indolence ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 50.

       Adam and Eve were placed in a comfortable setting surrounded by ample
     provisions that were pleasing to the taste and sight. What instructions and
     warning did God give and why? Verses 16, 17.


       The instructions were clear and unmistakable: "Thou mayest. ... Thou
     shalt not. ..." (verses 16, 17). Adam and Eve were free to demonstrate their
     absolute trust in God's love and wisdom in obedience or to choose to reveal
     their distrust, affirm their independence of God, and disobey at the peril of
     their lives (verse 17). Only the Life-giver has the power of absolute choice;
     human beings may choose life only on God's terms. Never did so much
     depend on so little. The fact that Adam and Eve's rebellion led to the death
     of Christ on the cruel cross demonstrates beyond any doubt that God is
     particular about what He says.

       How do you explain the relationship between the announcement, "In the
     day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17) and what
     happened after Adam and Eve disobeyed? (Compare Rom. 5:12.)


      Apart from being the means of testing our first parents' loyalty and
   allegiance there was no particular evil or virtue in the tree of knowledge of
   good and evil. "There was nothing poisonous in the fruit itself, and the sin
   was not merely in yielding to appetite. It was distrust of God's goodness,
   disbelief of His word, and rejection of His authority, that made our first
   parents transgressors, and that brought into the world a knowledge of
   evil."—Education, p. 25.
      From the moment the first pair transgressed they passed from the status
   of conditional immortality to that of unconditional mortality. Whereas
   prior to the Fall their access to the tree of life assured them of immortality,
   after their disobedience they were equally as certain of mortality. The reign
   of death since that moment testifies that God's warning about death was no
   vain threat.
DAY I11. THE CREATION OF EVE AND HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP
         (Gen. 2:18-25).

       How do verses 18 through 20 suggest that members of the human race
     were created as social creatures?


       The task of naming the animals afforded Adam the opportunity to
     observe closely the habits of the animals created on the fifth and sixth days.

     24
      It is of interest that, in this instance, his words were not so much a means of
      communication but were the instrument used for ordering and establishing
      his rule over the environment.

        What was God's purpose in giving woman to man? Verses 18, 20. (Com-
      pare Gen.1:27, 28.)


        The woman was to be a "help meet for him" (the Hebrew suggests a
      "helper over against him," "a help equal to him," "his counterpart"). The
      Genesis record places value on woman as an equal, a counterpart, a partner,
      or a complement in whose company man finds his fullest satisfaction and
      with whom he shares God's image and likeness.

        What is signified by the creation of Eve out of a rib of Adam? Verses 21,
      22.


        "Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that
      she was not to control him as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as
      an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and protected
      by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, she was his
      second self, showing the close union and the affectionate attachment that
      should exist in this relation ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

DAY     What kind of intimate relationship between husband and wife did the
rel inspired writer uphold long after the Fall? Eph. 5:21-29; 1 Cor. 7:2-5; Heb.
L. 13:4.



      NOTE Adam's jubilant expression as God brought Adam's newly created
      companion to him. Gen. 2:23.

         Adam was so rapt that he expressed his triumphant welcome of his wife
      in poetry (verse 23 is the first poetic couplet in Scripture).
         Marriage "was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one the two
      institutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates
      of Paradise. When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this
      relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the
      race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellec-
      tual, and the moral nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

      NOTE who it was that, according to Matthew 19:4 and 5, spoke the words
      recorded in Genesis 2:24.

       What three steps in marriage are outlined in the words of God, and in
      what order are these steps to occur? Gen. 2:24.



                                                                                    25
         God's ideal for marriage is expounded in this verse. When the time came
      to leave those closest to him, his parents, man's first earthly loyalty was to
      be to his wife. She was to occupy the foremost place in his affections. In
      God's order the union of bodies between husband and wife is to follow
      their commitment in marriage. The biblical order, "leave . . . cleave . . . and
      they shall be one flesh" tragically and defiantly has been turned upside down
      with the result that nowadays there is a great deal of "one flesh," only a
      little of "cleaving," and too much "leaving."

DAY  How did Jesus endorse the values of Genesis 2:24 and, disregarding the
   concession to human hardness, stress the permanence of the marriage bond?
111 Matt. 19:3-6.


        Genesis 2 ends with a description of the concord of love and openness
      that existed between Adam and Eve and between our first parents and our
      heavenly Father.

      SUMMARY: Flanked by the Edenic institutions of Sabbath and matrimony,
      the story of humanity's first home remains as the model of the ideal home.

      APPLICATION:
      o What can I do to get the most out of God's blessed and hallowed day of
        rest? (Compare Isa. 58:13,14; Eze. 20:12; Mark 2:23 to 3:5.)
      o Do I take advantage particularly of the edges of the Sabbath to contem-
        plate God's love and to acknowledge His dominion in our lives?
      o How may the ideal depicted in Ephesians 5:21 to 6:4 be reflected in my
        home?

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Although distrust of God led to the first act of sin
on earth and its fateful consequences, divine love surpassed human unfaith-
fulness and followed the sinners beyond the gates of Eden.

INTRODUCTION: The New Testament treats the events of Genesis 3 and
4 as literal. Luke traces the ancestry of Jesus back to Adam (Luke 3:23-38).
Paul considers the Adam of the Creation record to be as real as the second
Adam, and his trespass as factual as Jesus' death and resurrection. (See
Rom. 5:12-14; 1 Cor. 15:20-22.)
   Faced with a decision that would test their allegiance to God, Adam and
Eve were tempted to place greater trust in the creature than in the Creator.
The tragic consequences included shame, suffering, estrangement, flight
from God, disharmony within and without, passion, and disillusionment.
However, God's love for the sinner exceeded His abhorrence of sin. Had it
not been for God's grace and the certainty of His ultimate triumph, Adam
and Eve might well have succumbed to despair. Taking comfort in God's
interest and concern, Adam's vision extended beyond the apparent doom
and laid hold upon the divine promise. His confidence was shown when he
called Eve "mother of all living" rather than "mother of the doomed."
Similarly, Eve's pronouncements at the birth of Cain and Seth reflected her
faith in the promised Deliverer. (See Gen. 4:1, 25.)
   With these chapters the various vocations, the arts and crafts, domesti-
cation of animals, and food production make their debut. The human race
for the first time is divided into two distinct families who gather around two
altars. The remainder of Scripture traces their history.

                                                                             27

DAY I. THE ENTRANCE OF SIN (Gen. 3:1-7).

      1. Dialogue With the Serpent (verses 1-5).
      We are not informed as to the length of the period of happiness our first
    parents enjoyed in the presence of their Creator. However, it is apparent
    that they had no children before they were cast out of the Garden. That
    fact would limit the period before the Fall to something less than 130 years;
    how much less we do not know. (See Gen. 5:3).

      In what sense does Genesis 1:31 exclude any possibility that some imper.
    fection in God's creation may have been responsibile for the weakness of
    Adam and Eve?



    SEARCH AND LEARN: How does the Bible unmask the figure of Satan
    behind the "crafty serpent" in Genesis 3:1? (Compare Gen. 3:15 with 2 Cor.
    11:3;1 John 3:8; Rev. 12:9; 20:2.)


      In the same way that Jesus discerned the intentions of Satan behind the
    words of His disciple Peter (Matt. 16:22, 23), we can discern Satan behind
    the words of the serpent. The story implies that the fall of Lucifer took
    place prior to this interview between Eve and the serpent.

      How clear had been God's command to the first parents? How did the
    tempter seek to confuse the issue with his question and obscure the exact
    meaning of God's stipulation? Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1.



      According to Eve, what additional command, not recorded in Genesis
    2:17, did the holy pair understand? Gen. 3:3.



      Having first questioned the divine stipulation, to what did the serpent now
    resort? Verse 4. (Compare John 8:44.)


       The serpent categorically and emphatically contradicted God's word
    mnd thus originated the lie, still popular today, that human beings inher-
    ently are immortal. Insinuating that God could not be trusted, Satan in-
    formed Eve that disobedience would bring great gain. Present limitations
    would be removed if the tempter's advice was followed. God was pre-
    sented as a selfish liar, jealously withholding from Adam and Eve greater
    happiness and nobler development. Satan tempted our first parents to
    doubt God's love and wisdom. He lured them into the belief that the way
    of the curse was the way of blessing and thus placed God's requirements
    in the most reprehensible light.


    28
         "Satan represented to the holy pair that they would be gainers by
      breaking the law of God. Do we not today hear similar reasoning? Many
      talk of the narrowness of those who obey God's commandments, while they
      themselves claim to have broader ideas and to enjoy greater liberty. What
      is this but an echo of the voice from Eden, 'In the day ye eat thereof'—
      transgress the divine requirement—`ye shall be as gods'?"—Patriarchs and
      Prophets, p. 55.

        In what sense would the transgressors now know "good and evil"?


        While verse 4 represented a lie, so much of verse 5 tragically reflected
      the truth. In addition to their knowledge of pure and unadulterated love
      and goodness, the human family now added a first-hand knowledge of and
      experience with evil. With God, Adam and Eve would come to know the
      misery and pain that results from disobedience. Their disobedience brought
      pain to God as well as to themselves. But, unlike God, they would experi-
      ence with Satan the guilt and shame of sin. Not equality with God but
      separation from the tender Creator, hatred toward fellow beings, and
      estrangement from one's self and one's environment were the fruits of
      distrust and disobedience.


DAY     2. The Fall (Gen. 3:6, 7).

 .1   COMPARE: Using the following chart, compare Eve's failure, Christ's
      victory, and our conflict in the three areas of temptation indicated:


           Appeal of          TO EVE           TO CHRIST            TO US

        Physical

        Mental

        Spiritual

        "Christ came to the earth, taking humanity and standing as man's repre-
      sentative, to show in the controversy with Satan that man, as God created
      him, connected with the Father and the Son, could obey every divine
      requirement."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 253. Because the work of
      redemption had to begin where the ruin began, Christ had to succeed
      where Adam and Eve failed. As they fell through their independence from
      God and indulgence of appetite, so Christ had to live in complete depend-
      ence upon God and overcome appetite. Whereas our first parents' action
      indicates that they believed that God's great love would excuse their
      transgression, Jesus demonstrated by His life that true faith always is

                                                                                29
    revealed in obedience. The fact that Jesus followed the path of humility
    and died on the cross ever will reprove Adam's surrender of loyalty, love,
    and gratitude for the satisfaction of personal ambition.

         In what sense does Genesis 3:7 unmask the devil's claims?


       In fulfillment of the serpent's promise the eyes of Adam and Eve were
    opened, but their dream of enlightenment turned into a nightmare. This,
    the first of countless subsequent satanic schemes, demonstrates that the
    devil's promises of precious gold are delivered only in the form of tawdry
    tinsel. Deprived of the glory of holiness, burdened by the sense of guilt,
    their physical nakedness revealed in a consciousness of inner nakedness,
    the first pair sought to hide from God and to fashion their own covering.

      What was the result of Adam's surrender? Rom. 6:16. (Compare with
    Rom. 5:19.)


DAY H. GOD'S JUDGMENT ON SIN (Gen. 3:8-24).

      1. God Seeks the Fallen (verses 8-13).
      The presence of God, previously a delight to Adam and Eve, had now
    become a source of fear and embarrassment to them. This was a clear sign
    that their bond of trust with God had been broken.

         What was God's first response? Verses 8, 9.



    EXAMPLES: Think of other examples in which God took the initiative in
    the search to restore a broken fellowship.


      The Lord revealed His grace by creating human beings in His image and
    by providing a delightful setting where His creatures could develop as free
    moral beings. Subsequent to the Fall, God once again took the initiative
    and sought out His children, knowing that, in order to deal most effectively
    with them, He must draw them to Him rather than drive them out of their
    hiding.

       In what sense did Adam confuse sin with the consequences of transgres-
    sion? Verse 10.



      How did Adam and Eve endeavor to escape responsibility for their sin as,
    they responded to God's probing questions? Verses 11-13.



    30
     Adam and Eve virtually blamed God for their disobedience. What a
   change transgression had brought to the first couple! Adam, who had
   received his bride with jubilation (Gen. 2:22, 23), now coldly referred to
   his wife as "the woman whom thou gayest to be with me." The sin which
   they had committed together now separated their union of love as both
   indulged in a series of excuses that is typical of fallen beings.

DAY 2. God's Judgment (Gen. 3:14-24).
      In verses 14 and 15, what indicates that God was not merely addressing
    the reptile?


      The phrase "dust shalt thou eat" is used in other ancient literature to
    indicate a curse. Sadly, the consequence of sin affected not only the sinner
    but also the environment. The erstwhile protector, Adam, had become the
    cause of suffering that was to be experienced by the entire creation.
    (Compare with Rom. 8:19-23.)

     What hope and promise is contained in God's curse upon the serpent?
    Gen. 3:15.


      Before Adam and Eve heard about toil, pain, submission, thorns, and
    sweat, God granted them words of hope and promise. Verse 15 not only
    offers the first glimpse of the gospel, but also presents a compressed history
    of the conflicts between the family of the serpent and the descendants of
    the woman. The genealogies of Genesis develop the lines of those who
    chose "sonship" either with the devil or with God. And the rest of Scrip-
    ture continues to depict the struggles between God's people and their en-
    emies. The conflict announced in verse 15 points past the immediate ac'
    tors in the drama, and the New Testament elaborates on the fact that
    although Christ's victory would mean suffering, the serpent's wound
    would be fatal. (Compare Rev. 12:1-12; Heb. 2:14.)

      What effect would Eve's sin have upon her childbearing and marriage?
    Gen. 3:16.


      "In the creation God had made her [Eve] the equal of Adam. Had they
    remained obedient to God—in harmony with His great law of love—they
    would ever have been in harmony with each other; but sin had brought
    discord, and now their union could be maintained and harmony preserved
    only by submission on the part of the one or the other. ... It was by her
    solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was now placed in subjection to her
    husband. Had the principles enjoined in the law of God been cherished by
    the fallen race, this sentence, though growing out of the results of sin,
    would have proved a blessing to them; but man's abuse of the supremacy
    thus given him has too often rendered the lot of woman very bitter and
    made her life a burden."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 58, 59.

                                                                                31
       What changes were to occur as a result of Adam's preference for Eve's
     counsel? Verses 17-19. (Compare with Rom. 6:23.)


        Because of His love for us God appointed a life of toil and care. "It was a
     discipline rendered needful by ... [Adam's] sin, to place a check upon the
     indulgence of appetite and passion, to develop habits of self-control. It was
     a part of God's great plan for man's recovery from the ruin and degradation
     of sin." Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 60.

       What was the purpose and the significance of God's renewed provision of
     grace? Gen. 3:21. (Compare with verse 7 and Gen. 4:4.)



      In what sense was the expulsion of Adam and Eve out of the garden a
     manifestation of both judgment and mercy? Gen. 3:22-24.


       The couple's attempt to be independent from God resulted in their
     banishment from His very presence. However, even in judging them God
     demonstrated love. Access to the tree of life would have turned Adam and
     Eve into immortal sinners, thus perpetuating sin and misery eternally.
DAY I11. THE CONSEQUENCES OF SIN (Gen. 4:1-26).

r
Le        1. Two Altars (verses 1-7).

       Why did God accept Abel's sacrifice but reject his brother's offerings?
     Verses 3-7. (Compare with Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22. See also Heb. 11:4.)



          How does Genesis 4:6, 7 describe God's fatherly concern for Cain?


        The dialogue between God and Cain, and the fact that Cain neither
     accused God of partiality in accepting Abel's sacrifice nor protested his
     ignorance of God's stipulations suggests that the brothers were acquainted
     fully with what God required. The sacrificial ritual, the distinction between
     clean and unclean animals, and the basic principles of God's law were not
     introduced for the first time at Sinai but were set out in greater detail in the
     time of Moses. (See Ex. 13:12; Num. 18:17.)

        2. The First Murder (Gen. 4:8-16).
        The enmity predicted in Genesis 3:15 and hinted at in Cain's jealousy
     was manifested in full force in the murder of Abel. This murder demon-
     strated that Cain was a follower of Satan. (See John 8:44.)




     32
     lea= 4                                                          =9 Mil
      What reason does 1 John 3:12 give for Cain's murder of Abel? (Compare
    Gen. 4:8 with Matt. 23:35.)



       How did Cain seek to conceal the sin of commission that was behind his
    sin of omission? Gen. 4:9.


      Cain discovered that people cannot hide anything from God (verse 10)
    and that the divine Sovereign will right all wrongs. As punishment for his
    callous sin, the earth, which had been forced to drink innocent blood,
    would withhold its strength from the murderer (verses 11, 12). It is remark-
    able that in the story of Cain there is neither one word of remorse nor any
    sign of penitence. Even though the death penalty that he deserved was
    commuted to lifelong exile, Cain still complained.

      How does Genesis 4 reveal that God shows concern for even the unrepen-
    tant sinner? Verse 15.



       3. The Families of Cain and Seth (verses 17-26).
       Verses 17 through 24 disclose a picture of rapid moral decline as well as
     technical and cultural advances. Polygamy and murder characterize the
     family of Cain. Yet the Bible writer does not attribute only evil to the
     descendants of Cain. Their achievements are recognized. He notes that
     artisans, craftsmen, pastoralists, and agriculturalists descended from Cain.
       The chapter concludes with a reference to Seth, who replaced Abel. Seth
     became the ancestor of the line of pre-Flood patriarchs who bridged the
     period between Adam and Noah.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
    52-62, 71-81; S. D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 3 and 4.

     SUMMARY: In attempting to rise above the position ordained by God,
     Adam and Eve fell far below it. Their fall resulted in their estrangement
     from God, from each other, and from their environment. Yet God's promise
     intimated redemption. The choice that that redemption provided sinful
     beings led to the division of the human family, whose history we will study
     in the lessons to come.

     APPLICATION: The Lord approached the first sinners and the first mur-
     derer with two questions: "Where are you?" and "Where is your brother?"
     Both inquiries are as relevant today as they were at the beginning of human
     history.
     o Am I ever tempted to presume that God's great love will excuse my
        transgression and save me from the consequences of sin?
     o Have I personally tested the promises of 1 Corinthians 10:11-13; Philip-
        pians 4:13; James 4:7, 8; and Psalm 50:14, 15?

                                                                               33
     Preacher of Righteousness
    THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 5:32 through 9:29.

    DAY MEMORY TEXT: "The bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look
        upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God
        and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth" (Gen.
        9:16).

    CENTRAL THOUGHT: "By faith Noah, when warned about things not
    yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he
    condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by
    faith" (Heb. 11:7, NIV).

    OVERVIEW: Genesis 5:32 through 9:29.

          Prologue: Human sin (6:1-10)
           Violence on earth; Flood and covenant announced (6:11-22)

    INTRODUCTION: The story of the Flood follows a literary pattern known
    as a chiasmus (an X-shaped inverted literary structure named after the
    Greek letter chi). A chiasmus is comprised of a sequence of units in which
    the action flows through each unit to a climax before the action returns
    through the same sequence in reverse order. (See Overview above.) Noah
    entered the ark after 120 years of preaching, not merely as a survivor but
    also as a bearer of God's promise of a new age. As darkness increased with
    each step of divine justice in the first half of the story of the Flood so the
    light increased during the last half of the story as divine grace finally
    revealed a peaceful and calm world crowned with a rainbow of promise.

DAY I. THE GREAT INCREASE IN SIN AND NOAH'S PREPARATIONS
       FOR THE FLOOD (Gen. 5:32-7:24).

       1. Noah's Ancestors (5:1-32).
       Seth's line of descent is introduced here, following the line of Cain in
    Genesis 4:17-24. Adam and Eve had many other sons and daughters (5:4),
    but Seth's line of descent outlines the history of the pre-Flood patriarchs
    who were loyal to God. The promised Deliverer would come through this
    line.
    34
  2. Human Wickedness and Corruption (6:1-7).

  How is the theme of human sinfulness described in the prologue and
epilogue of the Flood narrative? Gen. 6:1-8 and 9:20-27.


   While some commentators suggest that the designation "sons of God"
(6:2) refers to heavenly beings, context and content indicate a reference to
the descendants of Seth. The "daughters of men" (the "men" who multi-
plied in verse 1) would then designate the posterity of Cain. The "sons of
God," representing the line of faith, contracted marriages with unbelievers
and succumbed to the danger of such alliances.
   "There were many giants, men of great stature and strength, renowned
for wisdom, skillful in devising the most cunning and wonderful works; but
their guilt in giving loose rein to iniquity was in proportion to their skill
and mental ability.
   "God bestowed upon these antediluvians many and rich gifts; but they
used His bounties to glorify themselves, and turned them into a curse by
fixing their affections upon the gifts instead of the Giver."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 90.

  What is stated in Genesis 6:5 as the compelling motive for the forth-
coming destruction? (Compare also verses 11-13.)


   The wickedness of humankind could not be stated more emphatically.
Notice the words "every ... only ... continually." The Hebrew word trans-
lated "imagination" is derived from the verb earlier rendered by "to form"
(in Gen. 2:7) and here indicates deliberation and action. In the Old Testa-
ment the word heart describes the complete inner life of a human being, as
it is the seat of emotion, will, and understanding. The words corrupt and
violence in verses 11 through 13 expand the picture of verse 5.

  How do Genesis 6:6 and 7 depict God's sorrow for what was taking place?


  After describing the human heart, the author turns to the grief and
affliction of the heart of God: Moses describes the Lord in terms which
human readers can understand. He is not some far off abstract idea or
unbending principle but, like us, is portrayed as characterized by will, open
to the tragedy of sin and prayer, and weeping over human guilt. These
words give us a feeling for how difficult it is to explain or even understand
the introduction and great increase of sin.

  What assurance does Peter give that the Lord had not left the world
without a witness? 1 Peter 3:18-20; 2 Peter 2:5.




                                                                           35
 Pre h            allgaglwaum                                     Om=
  What decision did God announce to Noah? (Compare Gen. 6:13 with
verse 7.)


  God's act of destruction was not arbitrary. It brought to conclusion the
destruction initiated by human sin. The writer here develops a "creation"
and "uncreation" theme. The creation of God described as "very good"
and full of life now has been corrupted and is being undone. (Compare
Gen. 1:31 with 6:11,13,17.)

     3. Noah Instructed to Prepare for the Flood (Gen. 6:8-22).

     How is grace introduced in verse 8?


  This is the first time that the word grace is found in the Bible. When
applied to God, grace designates God's power and willingness to do for
undeserving sinful beings that which they cannot do for themselves. God's
grace saved faithful Noah and his family. Here, as elsewhere in Scripture,
God deals with the sin problem by both providing salvation and rendering
judgment.

   What does the Bible record tell us about the character of Noah? Gen. 6:8,
9, 22; Heb. 11:7; 1 Peter 2:5.


   Although Noah was not without fault (see Gen. 9:20-24), he is character-
ized by faith, moral uprightness, and integrity. In response to God's initia-
tive of love, he demonstrated his faith by complete acceptance of God's
Word and by building the ark. His intimate and personal relationship with
God manifested in faith and obedience distinguished Noah from the rest of
the world and marked him as a member of the family of God. As God had
walked Enoch into the safety of heaven, He now walked Noah into the
safety of the ark.

  What divine action prior to the destruction of the world of Noah's day
reveals that the Deluge was no arbitrary judgment? Gen. 6:12. (Compare
with Gen. 11:5; 18:21; Dan. 7:9, 10.)


  In contrast to the Babylonian flood stories that are filled with intrigue
and capriciousness, the biblical account of the Flood stresses the absolute
justice of the divine sentence.

ANALYZE the announcements (Gen. 6:13, 17, 18) and the commands (verses
14-16,19-21) found in God's instruction to Noah (verses 13-21).


 God's instruction was given 120 years before Noah entered the ark. That
means that Noah at that time was 480 years of age. He still was childless

36
   and, as was true also of Abraham, had to accept by faith the announcement
   concerning his children.

     What does verse 22 tell us about Noah's faith in God's word? (Compare
   Gen. 7:5, 16 with Heb. 11:7.) Is there any parallel with Abram's response to
   the call out of Ur of the Chaldees?



DAY 4. The Command to Enter the Ark (Gen. 7:1-16).

lo     What does the reference to "clean" and "unclean" animals imply about
     the knowledge that Noah already possessed on this matter? Gen. 7:2, 3, 8;
     8:20.


        In chapter 7 God's command first given in Genesis 6:17 through 21 is
     repeated and expanded. Whereas the instructions concerning the animals
     in 6:19, 20 were general, they were now repeated and amplified with greater
     detail as the time of the Flood drew near. Similarly, more specific details
     were given to Noah in regard to the commencement and duration of the
     Flood. (Compare Gen. 6:17 with 7:4.)
        The fact that God distinguished "clean" and "unclean" animals long
     before the difference was explicitly stated in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy
     14, presupposes the clear knowledge of the distinction between "clean"
     and "unclean" animals from earliest times. Furthermore, it is evident that
     "clean" animals were to be used for sacrificial offering and (after the Flood)
     for food. Only one pair of "unclean" animals entered the ark, and both
     male and female were indispensable for propagation. Therefore Noah
     could not have selected any of the "unclean" animals for purposes of
     sacrifice or food.

        What lesson may be derived from the fact that the ark was the only place
     of safety and salvation appointed by God during the Flood?


       The Deluge covered the earth, and the world returned to the conditions
     that existed before God had prepared a habitable globe when the waters of
     the deep covered the earth (1:2). The only faint glimmer of light in the dark
     scene of the Flood was the ark with its precious cargo.

       What do the words "the Lord shut him in" signify as far as Noah and the
     unrighteous of his day were concerned? Gen. 7:16.


       God means what He says. As was demonstrated in the destruction of the
     antediluvian (pre-Flood) world and the inhabitants of the cities of the
     plains (Genesis 19), there is a limit beyond which sinners cannot safely go.
     When that limit is reached divine judgment begins. "Love, no less than
     justice, demanded that God's judgments should put a check on sin."—
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 101.
                                                                               37
         5. The Waters Cover the Earth (Gen. 7:17-24).

         What do verses 17 through 24 imply about the extent of the Flood?


       The repeated biblical statements, "the waters prevailed ... increased
    greatly upon the earth ... prevailed exceedingly ... fifteen cubits upward
    did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered ... all flesh died,"
    indicate a worldwide catastrophe. The universality of the Flood is further
    attested to by the worldwide distribution of Flood legends and the global
    distribution of fossil remains. Many of the fossil remains testify to the
    violence as well as the extent of the Flood.
       Genesis 7:9 through 23 repeatedly emphasizes the concept that the Flood
    covered the entire earth. Ellen White indicates the same: "The Lord
    brought a flood of waters upon the earth, and swept away its wicked
    inhabitants."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 178. "The entire surface of the
    earth was changed at the Flood."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 107.

       In what sense does the experience of Noah and his family give rise to and
    illustrate the idea of the remnant? (See verse 23.)



DAY 11. GOD REMEMBERS NOAH (Gen. 8:1).

3     How did God demonstrate His faithfulness and interest in humanity when,
    from a human perspective, all seemed lost? Verse 1.



    I11. THE PREPARATION OF A NEW EARTH (Gen. 8:2-9:29).

       1. Receding Waters and the Command to Leave the Ark (8:2-19).
       Having reached the turning point of the narrative, the literary structure
    begins to repeat in reverse order the steps that led to the Flood. (See the
    lesson overview on page 34.) The water began to recede and the dry land
    finally began to appear (verses 2-14). Thus a new beginning was made
    possible. While the Bible specifies that the ark came to rest on the moun-
    tains of Ararat, commentators are not clear as to what part of the Ararat
    range of Armenia is indicated.

      Who finally liberated the survivors and introduced them to a new age?
    Verses 15-19.


      Imagine the differences that existed between the earth Noah had left and
    the planet upon which he now set foot.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: If Noah had kept a ship's log it probably would
    have read about as follows (assuming a thirty-day month):

                            Based on S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 260.

         Study this "log" carefully. How many days did Noah and his family spend
      in the ark?




DAY     2. Harmony Restored (Gen. 8:20-9:7).

LVA      How did Noah express his dedication, homage, and gratitude to God upon
      leaving the ark? Verse 20.


         "Here was a lesson for all succeeding generations. Noah had come forth
      upon a desolate earth, but before preparing a house for himself he built an
      altar to God. His stock of cattle was small, and had been preserved at great
      expense; yet he cheerfully gave a part to the Lord as an acknowledgment
      that all was His. In like manner it should be our first care to render our
      freewill offerings to God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 106.

        How did God respond to Noah's devotion and worship? Verses 21, 22.


        The divine response is stated in human terms. God had destroyed the
      world because "every imagination of the thoughts" of the human heart was
      evil (6:5). In the light of that fact, Genesis 8:21 has been considered by
      some to be self-contradictory. However, God's resolve not to destroy the
      earth again by water and to preserve order is based on the spirit behind the
      sacrifice offered and not on human performance.

        As the survivors stepped into the new world, what command first given in
      Eden was repeated? Gen. 1:28; 9:1, 7.


                                                                               39
       How did God relieve the fear of Noah's family who were greatly outnum-
    bered by the animals who disembarked from the ark, and what responsibil-
    ities did He place upon human beings? Gen. 9:2.



      What further provision did God make for the welfare of Noah, and what
    restrictions did He apply? Verses 3-6.



DAY 3. The Covenant (Gen. 9:8-17).

E        How extensive was the covenant referred to in verses 9 through 11?


      Whereas the covenants God later made with Abraham, Israel, and David
   invited individuals or a nation into a personal fellowship with God, this
   covenant is different in that it does not call for a personal response and
   appropriation. However, as were the later covenants, this covenant was
   initiated entirely by divine grace. Yet it differs from them in that it was not
   so much an agreement between two parties as a statement of God's inten-
   tion never again to destroy the earth by a flood. (See verses 11-15.)

         What was to be the sign of the covenant? Verses 12-17.


       Sun and storm mingle to produce the rainbow reminding people on earth
    of mercy and judgment being blended, and of God's resolve never to cut
    life off by the waters of a flood.

      (The overview on page 34 includes Genesis 9:18 through 29 in order to
    present the complete picture of the literary structure involved. These
    verses will be studied in next week's lesson.)

    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
    90-104; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 6 through 9.

   SUMMARY: In spite of the terrible inroads of sin, God does not leave
   Himself without witnesses in this world. Only faithful Noah and his family
   survived the Flood and became the progenitors of the people whose history
   we will study in the following lessons.

    APPLICATION:            -
    o In the light of Jesus' comparison of conditions in Noah's day with those
      preceding the second advent (Matt. 24:37-39), am I as serious about
      preparing myself for the events ahead as was Noah?
    o In the light of the judgment that will soon come upon the world, what am
      I doing to follow Noah's example in warning those near and dear to me?
      (See 2 Peter 2:5.)

The Earth After the Mood
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 9:18 through 11:26.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the

1     last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is
      the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things
      continue as they were from the beginning of the creation" (2 Peter
      3:3, 4).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Even though they were surrounded by the results
of the great Flood, Noah's descendants continued in sin and rebellion
against God as they were dispersed throughout the world. But there were
a few who, by God's grace and strength, continued to serve Him and to
whom His covenant of peace was extended.

INTRODUCTION: One demonstration of the inspiration of Scripture is the
way in which it meets the needs and provides the counsel for each generation
of earth's inhabitants. Second Peter 3:3-5 is applicable to our time. Not
only does the text itself refer to the "last days" but the words placed in the
mouths of the scoffers by Peter are in a sense a paraphrase of the modern
principle of uniformity that has been one of the major guiding principles
for evolutionary geology. Geologists have tended to interpret the past by
what they find in terms of the geological processes in operation today. For
instance, the present rate at which mountains are being eroded and valleys
are filling up, they say, is the rate that has been in operation throughout the
indefinite past. But the Bible teaches that the earth had a dramatic origin,
a catastrophic destruction at the time of the Flood, and will be destroyed
by fire in the near future. Those who believe in a philosophy based upon
the continued gradual operation of geological processes are doomed to
great disappointment.
  There has been a less rigid adherence to the concept of uniformity among
geologists in the last few years. This provides an opportunity for Seventh-
day Adventists and other creationists to point out the catastrophic history
of the earth and to warn of catastrophe in the future, even as Jesus did.
   The inhabitants of the world live in fear today—fear of man-made
disasters such as war and much of the starvation that is found in the earth

                                                                            41
    today. But they should be concerned also about physical catastrophes in
    the near future that Bible prophecy leads us to expect. However, God's
    people can claim His promises of protection in the time of trouble and of
    deliverance at the final catastrophic climax of world history.
      Genesis 10 and 11 deal with the earliest history after the Flood, dem-
    onstrating how wickedness and rebellion built up again. The scriptural
    record then moves into the special history of those who continue to serve
    the true God.

DAY I. SIN STILL PRESENT AFTER THE FLOOD (Gen. 9:18-29).

      What evidence of the impartial nature of Scripture may be understood
    from a careful reading of verses 20 through 27?


       Although not making a moral comment on Noah's drinking, this, the first
    biblical account of the use of strong drink, testifies to the loss of dignity and
    honor that often results. This same thing is true about the story of the
    derision, degradation, and shame with which Lot came to be known as a
    result of drinking wine. (See Gen. 19:31-36.) The Bible warns of the
    degradation and hardships caused by drunkenness. (See Prov. 20:1; 23:29-
    35; 31:4, 5.) As Christians it is our privilege to recognize that our bodies
    are the temples of the Holy Spirit. The apostle challenges us to "glorify
    God in your body and in your spirit which are God's" (1 Cor. 6:20).
       It is not clear why, after Ham's act of disrespect, Noah did not curse
    Ham, but instead cursed Canaan, the youngest son of Ham. (Gen. 9:24;
    10:6). Hamites included peoples living in southern Asia Minor, coastal
    Syria, and Palestine, the Red Sea coast of Arabia, and parts of East Af-
    rica. The Canaanites were one branch of the Hamitic people who spoke a
    Semitic language. The subservience of the Canaanites to the Israelites
    after the conquest of Palestine may have fulfilled this curse literally just
    as the prediction that Japheth would live in the tents of Shem had to await
    its ultimate spiritual fulfillment until Gentiles and Jews became one in
    Jesus Christ. (Compare Gen. 9:27 with Gal. 3:26-29.)

         1. The Condition of the Earth After the Flood.

       What kinds of changes in the earth and its inhabitants were caused by the
    Flood?
       1. Before the Flood the dry land was teeming with animals and a "vast
    population" of human beings (Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Sept.
    25, 1888). After the Flood only the passengers and living creatures pre-
    served in the ark remained alive on land. (See Gen. 7:21.)
       2. Before the Flood, apparently, the area of dry land was more extensive
    than that of water. "When God had formed the earth, there were moun-
    tains, hills, and plains, and interspersed among them were rivers and bodies
    of water. The earth was not one extensive plain, but the monotony of the
    scene was broken by hills and mountains, not high and ragged as they now
    are, but regular and beautiful in shape. The bare, high rocks were never
    seen upon them, but lay beneath the surface, answering as bones to the

    42
       earth. The waters were regularly dispersed."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 33.
       Today more than 70 percent of our globe is covered with water.
          3. After the Flood, "stones, ledges, and ragged rocks were ... scattered
       upon the surface of the earth. In many places hills and mountains had
       disappeared, leaving no trace where they once stood; and plains had given
       place to mountain ranges."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 108.
          4. Precious stones that before the Flood had beautified the surface of
       the earth were now buried. "By the same means [wind-driven waves] the
       silver and gold, the choice wood and precious stones, ... were concealed
       from the sight and search of men, the violent action of the water piling earth
       and rocks upon these treasures."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 108.
          5. Confused types of animals that had been produced by hybridization
       "were destroyed by the Flood."— The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, p. 78.
          6. "There were a class of very large animals which perished at the Flood.
       God knew that the strength of man would decrease, and these mammoth
       animals could not be controlled by feeble man."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 4,
       p. 121.

DAY      2. Scoffers—Past and Present.

1231      What term does Peter use to designate those who refuse to accept the facts
       as God outlines them, and what application can be made to the same kind of
       attitude today? 2 Peter 3:3-5.


          Scoffers are those who reject the predictions of the prophets and the
       message of Jesus (2 Peter 3:2). They cannot envisage a day when the end
       will come and Jesus will be seen in the clouds of heaven (verse 4). The basis
       of their rejection is the supposition that if things have operated a certain
       way for a number of years, there is no reason to suppose any change will
       take place. Verse 5 indicates that they are willingly ignorant. They deliber-
       ately choose to ignore the evidence and project the observable continuity
       into the past, thereby establishing a principle by which they seek to explain
       all aspects of the universe. The fact that scoffers did this in Peter's day has
       a parallel in the development of the modern concept of uniformity that has
       been a guiding rule for much of geology.
          Uniformitarianism is based on the maxim, "The present is the key to the
       past." Because the theory of evolution requires much time to account for
       change, and because the application of the principle of uniformity requires
       long ages of time, uniformitarianism has served as a traditional interpretive
       tool for evolutionists.

       THINK IT THROUGH: Why do you accept the biblical account of history
       rather than the concepts and theories of man?

         "When men leave the word of God in regard to the history of creation,
       and seek to account for God's creative works upon natural principles, they
       are upon a boundless ocean of uncertainty. Just how God accomplished the
       work of creation in six literal days he has never revealed to mortals."—
       Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 93.

                                                                                   43
       Utr?         Mg3.        F ood                                   Gm= 0
DAY     What did the apostle Peter point to as an example of the world being

n     destroyed by a great catastrophe? 2 Peter 3:5, 6.


         These verses point prophetically to the last days and a dramatic fulfill-
      ment of prophecy. The trend in modern science has been toward a geologi-
      cal interpretation that favors long ages rather than the Flood and toward
      evolution as an explanation of origins rather than Creation. It is remarkable
      that long ago Peter pointed to these two areas as being the points of
      contention in the last days. That this has happened as predicted is a strong
      sign that we are living in the last moments of time.
         The Genesis Flood had a profound effect on the surface of the earth and
      is the major key to understanding much of geology. Most of the character-
      istics of the crust of the earth, the thick beds of sediments, and their fossil
      contents came about through the action of flood waters.
         "Geologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that it is very
      much older than the Mosaic record teaches....
         "But apart from Bible history, geology can prove nothing. Those who
      reason so confidently upon its discoveries have no adequate conception of
      the size of men, animals, and trees before the Flood, or of the great changes
      which then took place. Relics found in the earth do give evidence of
      conditions differing in many respects from the present, but the time when
      these conditions existed can be learned only from the Inspired record. In
      the history of the Flood, inspiration has explained that which geology alone
      could never fathom."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 112.

      NOTES:




      11. THE DIVISION AND DISPERSION OF NOAH'S DESCENDANTS
          (Gen. 10:1-11:26).

        1. The Table of Nations (Gen. 10:1-32).
        All of the children of Shem, Ham, and Japheth were born after the
      Flood. As illustrated by the map below, the descendants of Shem settled
      mostly in parts of the Middle East and Africa, the descendants of Japheth
      settled mostly in Europe and Asia Minor, and the descendants of Ham
      settled in parts of the Middle East and Africa. Of course, subsequent
      milleniums of folk wanderings and mixtures of people have made it nearly
      impossible to trace these lines of descent with any accuracy.

         "Chapter 10 sets forth the racial relationship of the various tribes and
      nations and their common descent from Noah, whereas ch. 11:10-26 pre-
      sents the exact descent of God's chosen people through the many interven-

        What effect did eating animal flesh have on length of life and why did God
      permit it? Gen. 9:3, 4.


         "After the flood the people ate largely of animal food. God saw that the
      ways of man were corrupt, and that he was disposed to exalt himself proudly
      against his Creator and to follow the inclinations of his own heart. And He
      permitted that long-lived race to eat animal food to shorten their sinful
      lives. Soon after the flood the race began to rapidly decrease in size, and in
      length of years."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 373.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Prophets,

171"After the Flood," pages 105-110.
      "There are men who think they have made wonderful discoveries in
    science. They quote the opinions of learned men as though they considered
    them infallible, and teach the deductions of science as truths that cannot be
    controverted. And the word of God, which is given as a lamp to the feet of
    the world-weary traveler, is judged by this standard, and pronounced
    wanting. The scientific research in which these men have indulged has
    proved a snare to them. It has clouded their minds, and they have drifted
      46
into skepticism. They have a consciousness of power; and instead of looking
to the Source of all wisdom, they triumph in the smattering of knowledge
they may have gained. They have exalted their human wisdom in opposition
to the wisdom of the great and mighty God, and have dared to enter into
controversy with him. The word of inspiration pronounced these men
`fools.'
   "God has permitted a flood of light to be poured upon the world in
discoveries in science and art; but when professedly scientific men lecture
and write upon these subjects from a merely human standpoint, they will
assuredly come to wrong conclusions. The greatest minds, if not guided by
the word of God in their research, become bewildered in their attempts to
investigate the relations of science and revelation. The Creator and his
works are beyond their comprehension; and because they cannot explain
these by natural laws, Bible history is considered unreliable. Those who
doubt the reliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments will be
led to go a step farther, and doubt the existence of God; and then, having
let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks of infidelity.
Moses wrote under the guidance of the Spirit of God, and a correct theory
of geology will never claim discoveries that cannot be reconciled with his
statements. The idea that many stumble over, that God did not create
matter when he brought the world into existence, limits the power of the
Holy One of Israel....
   "... Skeptics, who read the Bible for the sake of caviling, through igno-
rance claim to find decided contradictions between science and revelation.
But man's measurement of God will never be correct. The mind unenligh-
tened by God's Spirit will ever be in darkness in regard to his power.
   "Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. Those who have no vital union
with God are swayed one way and another; they put men's opinions in the
front, and God's word in the background. They grasp human assertions
that judgment against sin is contrary to God's benevolent character, and,
while dwelling upon infinite benevolence, try to forget that there is such a
thing as infinite justice."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, March 13,
1884.

SUMMARY: The record of the years from Noah to Abraham indicates
clearly that mere knowledge of God and His judgments cannot prevent
human beings from sinning nor can a worldwide flood wash away the sin
that permeates human hearts. Only by divine grace can people walk the
path of righteousness. The brief record of the post-Flood patriarchs shows
that God has had witnesses to this fact throughout history.

APPLICATION: Just as God gave Noah and his descendants the right and
the responsibility to exercise the power of choice, He has given us the same
privilege and responsibility today. Ask yourself:
o Am I abusing in any way this right and responsibility?
o What needs to be seen in my home and the environment I create in order
   for those I contact to be attracted by the love and goodness of God?

INTRODUCTION: The primeval story (Genesis 1 through 11) outlined the
course God took with the world until the call of Abraham. Beginning with
the middle of chapter 11 the writer narrows his worldwide perspective
maintained in Genesis 1 through 11 down to the family of Abram with
which the call of Israel commences. This call is both the conclusion to
primeval history and the commencement of patriarchal history.
   Up to this point history demonstrated the frightful power of sin and
illustrated the even greater might of grace. The stories of the Fall, of Cain,
and of Noah witness to sin but even more to God's forgiveness and His
saving acts. Now Abram is chosen from among the nations to reveal the
folly of the builders of the Tower of Babel who sought to make a name for
themselves (11:4). While Abram's name is cherished among millions of
Moslems, Jews, and Christians because of his faithfulness to God, the fame
sought by the architects of the Tower of Babel eluded the builders on
account of their disobedience.
   Genesis 12 through 15 provides background to the history of Israel and
represents a new phase in the history of salvation. Abram's faith response
to God commences the unfolding of God's plan which reaches its first major
climax in the events of the Exodus and Sinai and the choice of a nation.

DAY I. ABRAM'S CALL AND GOD'S COVENANT (Gen. 11:27-12:20).

      Genesis 11:10-32 notes the descent of God's chosen people from Noah's
    son Shem. Verses 27 through 31 center on the immediate ancestors of
    Abram.

      1. The Father of the Chosen Family (11:27-32).

      What do we know about the immediate family of Abram? Verses 27-30.
    What significant information is added in Joshua 24:2? (Note that "flood" in
    this verse refers to the Euphrates River.)


      Even though chronological considerations suggest that Abram was the
    youngest of Terah's sons, he appears to be mentioned first in Genesis 11:27
    because of his importance as the ancestor of the chosen family. Although
    archeology has revealed much concerning the times in which Abram lived,
    the great empires of the day form merely part of the background. The
    spotlight is on certain patriarchs and their families who move from place to
    place and occasionally interact with rulers and nations. Although it is not
    possible to give precise dates for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, certain
    chronological points of reference suggested in the Bible and pinpointed in
    the S. D. A. Bible Commentary will provide the time framework that is used
    in these lessons.

      In how many stages did the call of Abram take place according to Acts
    7:2-4? (Compare Gen. 12:1 with Acts 7:4.) Why do you think he went through
    these stages rather than going immediately to Canaan?


       Stephen states that God first appeared to Abram in Ur of the Chaldees
    and called him to go to the land He would show him.
       The southern Mesopotamian Ur which probably was Ur of the Chaldees
    was located halfway between what is now Baghdad and the present coast
    line of the Persian Gulf. At the beginning of the second millennium, the
    time when Abram lived there, Ur enjoyed a sophisticated culture. Arche-
    ological excavations have revealed a city with an efficient sewage system,
    well constructed homes, and an advanced educational program. A variety
    of deities were worshipped in Ur, and most of Abram's close relatives had
    succumbed to paganism. Abram was asked to make a considerable sacrifice
    in leaving behind this advanced culture to travel over 1000 miles to the land
    of Canaan.
       Skirting the great Arabian Desert to the west, the large caravan first
    moved north to the fertile plain of the Balikh river to a city known as
    Haran. Although we do not know how long Abram and the rest of his
    relatives, who stayed there when he went on to Canaan, lived in the region,
    local place names testify to their considerable influence.




                                                                              49
DAY        2. The Call and Covenant in Haran (Gen. 12:1-3).

ti]    What seems to have been the purpose behind the divine call, and what
      moved Abram to obey? Verses 1-3; Heb. 11:8-10.


         God, not Abram, took the initiative. Yet, the call of grace and the
      promise were also tests of faith and obedience. Abram had to leave his
      family, his own race, a sophisticated culture, fertile and watered grazing
      land, and travel to a mountainous, wooded country, a new climate, and a
      foreign people with strange customs who lived at a different cultural level.
        The divine command continued with a promise and concluded with a
      blessing. The promise theme of verse 2 becomes a dominant motif through-
      out the remainder of the book of Genesis. Childless Sarai (Gen. 11:30)
      would become the mother of a great nation. While the promise of descen-
      dants is more prominent in the early chapters of patriarchal history than
      the promise of the land, the latter assumes more significance as time passes.
      Both Jacob and Joseph die in the certain hope of Israel's return from Egypt
      to Canaan (Gen. 48:21; 50:24).

        How closely did God associate Himself with Abram? Gen. 12:2. What is
      the significance of the last half of verse 3? (Compare with James 2:21-23.)


        The reading "in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed" (Gen.
      12:3) broadens our understanding of Genesis 11:9. Much later Paul adds
      the conviction that Christians share in the blessings given to Abram and are
      his descendants by faith (Gal. 3:8,29).

           3. Abram Leaves Haran for Canaan (Gen. 12:4-10).

           What may be inferred from verses 4 and 5 about Abram's response?


         While a youth may leave home and family with relative ease, an older
      person finds such separation much more difficult. Yet Abram unquestion-
      ingly "departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him" (Gen. 12:4). The Bible
      records no negotiations with God nor any delaying tactics, merely unques-
      tioning obedience. Abram's wealth and possessions, consisting of extensive
      flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and a large household, were no hin-
      drance to the patriarch.
         Ahead of him lay Canaan, which early in the second millennium B.C.
      contained several powerful cities. The land was populated by an alien race,
      economically dependent on Egypt, overspread by idolatry, criss-crossed by
      bad roads, covered by heavily wooded mountains, and offering few per-
      manent grazing areas. If Abram thought the divine promise implied vast
      tracts of unpopulated land, he was badly mistaken (verse 6).

    God, it demonstrated the Lord's never-failing mercy and patience. God
    interfered with human folly in order to maintain the covenant and its
    significance in the light of the coming of the Saviour.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the texts below and list some other circum-
    stances that did not interfere with God's covenant promises:

      15:1,2

      15.13

DAY 11. THE COVENANT GUARDED (Gen. 13:1-14:24).

      1. Struggle Between Faith and Sight (13:1-18).

      What problem arose after the expulsion of Abram and Lot from Egypt?
    Verses 1-7.


      Returning from Egypt Abram called on the Lord at the second altar he
    had built in Canaan (verses 3, 4). Fortified by this renewal of his relationship
    with the Lord, he was able to face another test. Once more the promise of
    land seemed to elude Abram (verses 5, 6), and a decision had to be made.

      What was involved in the choice between the Jordan valley and the rugged
    and less fertile hills of Canaan? Verses 8-13.


      Abram's failure in Egypt seems counterbalanced by the nobility of
    character that he demonstrated in his dealings with Lot. From the heights
    of Bethel Lot saw the Jordan valley well-watered and fertile like the Garden
    of Eden and the plains of Mesopotamia. Lot chose that which appealed to
    his sense of immediate gain. Little did he realize that his choice would cost
    him his family. The decision was between "faith" and "sight," and the
    results demonstrate the wisdom of making the right choice. Abram's close
    relationship with the Lord and his determination to walk by faith enabled
    him to look beyond the immediate temporal advantages to eternal gain.

       How did God reward Abram for his unselfishness? Verses 14-18.


      At Hebron (formerly known as the "city of Arba"), the patriarch set up
    camp in the shade of a grove of trees and erected another altar. Here
    Abram became a friend and ally of an Amorite chieftain named Mamre.

       2. Lot's Rescue (Gen. 14:1-16).

     REVIEW the details given about the military operation between the Meso-
     potamian invaders and the Palestinian kings. Verses 1-12.

     52
DAY      After reaching Canaan, what did Abram do that gave silent testimony to

13    his faith? Verses 6-8.


         Shechem was in a pivotal position, situated in central Palestine between
      Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. Here the major roads crisscrossing
      Palestine intersected.
         Probably in search of grazing pastures, Abram moved another 20 miles
      south to a location between Bethel (formerly known as Luz, see -Gen.
      28:19) and Ai.
         "Wherever he [Abram] pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his
      altar, calling all within his encampment to the morning and evening sacri-
      fice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained."—Patriarchs and
      Prophets, p. 128. These altars were protests against idolatry and testimonies
      to the living God to all who passed by.

        What test of faith came to Abram after he had moved to the more sparsely
      populated open grazing country of the Negeb (the southern desert)? Gen.
      12:10.


        We might expect that, because he was following the call of God, Abram
      would have had his paths smoothed by Providence. Not so; Abram's
      experience is real to life. Not long after he had entered Canaan, a severe
      famine caused him to depart for Egypt which was watered by the flooding
      waters of the Nile. The Sacred Record teaches us that even those who
      follow God's commands may have to endure trials of faith.
        "The Lord in His providence had brought this trial upon Abraham to
      teach him lessons of submission, patience, and faith—lessons that were to
      be placed on record for the benefit of all who should afterward be called to
      endure affliction. God leads His children by a way that they know not, but
      He does not forget or cast off those who put their trust in Him."—
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 129.

        4. Abram's Excursion Into Egypt (Gen. 12:11-20).

        What evidence did Abram give in Egypt that he was not free of human
      weakness and imperfection? How did he almost jeopardize the promise of a
      son and heir? Verses 11-16.


        Hunger and fear reduced the hero of faith to a person with frailties that
      most of us can identify with readily. Faith succumbed to fear and fear to
      deviousness as Abram used one half truth to conceal the other half.

        How do you explain the plagues which fell upon Pharaoh? Verses 17-20.


        The plagues disclosed Sarai's true identity. While Abram's deliverance
      in no way absolved the patriarch from suffering the consequences of his
      actions that had brought such disgrace upon himself and dishonor to his
                                                                            51
        It is significant that Lot, who according to Genesis 13:12 had pitched his
      tent toward Sodom, now "dwelt in Sodom" (14:12). In contrast to Abram's
      heritage, Lot may already have lost much of his former possessions, thus
      revealing the superiority of Abram's choice.

      THINK IT THROUGH: What does the fact that Abram took his com-
      munity responsibilities seriously indicate about our duty in this area? Gen.
      14:13-16.

DAY     3. Melchizedek and Abram (Gen. 14:17-24).

        What light does the Melchizedek episode cast upon the spiritual stature of
      Abram? Verses 17-24.


        Melchizedek (meaning "my king is righteous") was king of Salem (a
      name for Jerusalem, see Ps. 76:2) and priest of the Most High God. Abram
      worshiped the same God. In deference to Melchizedek, who welcomed and
      blessed the patriarch upon his return from the battle, Abram gave the king-
      priest a tithe of all (verse 20). This indicates that the institution of tithing
      was practiced long before Moses repeated it among the precepts, thus
      recognizing the practice of tithing as a divine requirement.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Compare Genesis 28:22; Leviticus 27:31-33; Num-
      bers 18:21-28; Nehemiah 13:12; Matthew 23:23 and list below what you learn
      about the subject of tithe from this comparison:


      I11. THE COVENANT GUARANTEED (Gen. 15:1-21).

        1. Promise of Seed and Land Renewed (verses 1-7).
        Great victories are frequently followed by periods of deep depression.
      (See 1 Kings 19:1-10.) Abram, who had been a man of peace so far, had
      become involved in the wars of his neighbors. Now fear of reprisals weighed
      him down. What if the Mesopotamian kings should return?

        How did the Lord reassure His disheartened servant? Verse 1. What does
      this tell us about God's interest when we are discouraged or despondent?



        What further problems did the words "I am ... thy exceeding great
      reward" raise in Abram's mind, and how did the Lord respond? Verses 2-5.


        God repeated His earlier promise that Abram's descendants would be
      innumerable in multitude (Gen. 12:2; 13:16). Even though the advancing
      age of Abram and Sarai seemed to make the promise of descendants
      increasingly more impossible, Abram took God at His word and trusted
      the divine power.

                                                                                    53
         Abram's complete trust in God and his acceptance of the divine promise
      became the subject of much New Testament discussion about justification
      by faith. God accepts a person, not on the basis of what that person does to
      merit His approval, but purely and simply on the grounds of divine grace.
      As did Abram, we may trust God and accept His offer of salvation. The
      person thus accepted into God's family will act as a son or a daughter of the
      heavenly King and, like Abram, reveal his or her relationship to God in
      acts of obedience. Divine grace ever precedes the response of gratitude
      that we express in obedience. While human obedience is not the prerequis-
      ite for God's initiative of grace, Jesus taught that obedience must follow as
      an evidence of gratitude and love. (See John 14:15.) Although obedience
      does not bring merit, deliberate and willful disobedience or carelessness
      leads to loss of eternal life. (See 1 John 5:1-4, 11, 12.)

DAY        2. God's Promise Confirmed (Gen. 15:8-21).

           What led to the ritual described in verses 9 through 21? Verse 8.



         What details concerning Abram's seed and the Promised Land are related
      in verses 13 through 16 that were not mentioned before?


        God guaranteed His promises by the ritual described. Ordinarily all
      parties to such an agreement would pass between the dismembered animals
      and invoke on themselves a death like that of the sacrificed beasts should
      they themselves violate their agreement.
        God not only assured Abram of the ultimate fulfillment of His promises
      but also of Heaven's patience with the present inhabitants of the land (verse
      16). The intervening years were a time of waiting for the chosen family and
      a period of probation for the Amorites. Thus God certified that Israel's
      conquest of Palestine was an act of divine judgment rather than one of
      wanton aggression.

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
      125-136; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 11:26 to 15:21.

      SUMMARY: With Abram's departure from Ur, the patriarchal period
      begins. ("The patriarchs mentioned in Scripture were the founders of the
      Jewish race and religion."—S.D.A. Bible Dictionary, p. 843.) At God's
      call he left relatives, friends, fertile plains, and a sophisticated civilization
      for an unknown land. He did so because He trusted in God's promises.

      APPLICATION: Abram's unqualified obedience at considerable sacrifice
      to himself stands out as a monument of faith. When called by the Lord, will
      I be prepared to renounce cherished plans and familiar associations?

demonstrates both God's long suffering mercy and His unfailing justice as

INTRODUCTION: With characteristic candor the Bible once more pres-
ents to us the faith and frailties of its great heroes. Abram, tempted by the
pressures of time, with that temptation intensified by human manipulation,
tried to run ahead of God. He endeavored to shorten the waiting period.
The Lord had to teach His trusted friend that the promise of a descendant
would not be realized through any human scheme. Isaac was to be a miracle
son. Yet, God never forsakes His erring but repentant children. He re-
turned to Abram and reaffirmed the covenant He previously had made with
him.
   Although divine patience bore long with the city of Sodom, the offer of
mercy that persistently had been rejected and despised was withdrawn
finally, and the ministration of judgment came. The desolation of Sodom
and Gomorrah is a perpetual reminder of the certainty of God's judgment
upon sin.
                                                                           55
DAY I. HAGAR AND ISHMAEL (Gen. 16:1-16).

[2]      Ten years had passed since Abram had entered Canaan, and still there
      was no sign of the promised seed. In typical human frustration the patriarch
      listened to "reason" and to his wife Sarai rather than to the voice of God.

           1. Abram, Sarai, and Hagar (verses 1-6).

        What was wrong with the suggestion that barren Sarai offered in order to
      shorten the period of waiting for the expected son and heir? Verses 1-4.


         As Leah and Rachel did later, Sarai decided to take matters into her own
      hands. She suggested an action that, although compatible with the practices
      of her day, was inconsistent with God's plan.

           How did Paul regard the efforts of Abram and Sarai? Gal. 4:22-29.



           What were the results of these efforts at self-help? Gen. 16:4-6.


        Note particularly Hagar's pride (verse 4), Sarai's placing the blame on
      Abram (verse 5), and Abram's unwillingness to intervene (verse 6).
        Unfortunately, forgiveness is not always able to cancel out the awful
      consequences of our actions, and Abram's unwise step resulted in untold
      suffering for centuries to come; the consequences of which have continued
      even to our day.

           2. Hagar's Flight and Return (Gen. 16:7-16).

        What significant message did the "angel of the Lord" give to Hagar to
      encourage her to return as she fled toward her native Egypt? Verses 7-14.


        "God recognized the difficult circumstances in which Hagar found her-
      self, and for which she was not primarily to blame. Hagar honored the true
      God, and He would not abandon her in her extremity. The promise He
      there made to her, a slave, is without parallel. This promise greatly com-
      forted Hagar. Although her son was not to be the son of the divine plan, he
      would nevertheless share in the promise made to Abram. God had prom-
      ised to multiply Abram's seed, without limiting it to the offspring of
      Sarai."—S. D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 318.

DAY 11. THE COVENANT OF CIRCUMCISION (Gen. 17:1-27).

        Thirteen years after the birth of Ishmael, God appeared to Abram and
      repeated in expanded form the covenant he had made with the patriarch.
      In chapter 15 God reiterated the earlier promise of a son and Abram

      56
 Wm= Ei3                                              MIEW dued GuinataD
accepted the divine words with unqualified faith. Similarly, God had
renewed the promise of land and guaranteed it with a covenant ritual. Now,
some years later, with Abram and Sarai's faith tried further, God reaffirmed
the covenant and asked Abram to demonstrate his faith and commitment
to God through tangible actions.

  1. Promise and Stipulations (Gen. 17:1-14).

   What challenge to Abram was particularly appropriate in the light of the
failures recorded in chapter 16? Verses 1, 2.




  What covenant promises did God present under the heading "as for me"?
Verses 4-8.



  What stipulations are listed under the heading "as for you"? Verses 9-14.


  God still held Himself bound to the promises given 25 years before.
Divine faithfulness could not be cancelled out by Abram's failures. (Com-
pare Rom. 3:3, 4.) Here, as elsewhere in Scripture, a reminder of grace
precedes the call to specific and total obedience. Anything less leads to
expulsion from God's family (Gen. 17:14). It is within the covenant that
human fulfillment and happiness are found. (Compare Ex. 19:4, 5; Deut.
10:12-22; 30:15, 16.)
  The promise of seed was expanded at that time to include "nations" and
"kings." This led to a change in names. Abram ("high father" or "exalted
father") was renamed Abraham ("father of many"), and Sarai ("my prin-
cess") was to be known as Sarah ("a princess"). While this promise was
initially fulfilled in the many tribes who traced their lineage back to
Abraham and Sarah, it met its greater realization in the multitudes of
believers that are Abraham's spiritual descendants (Gal. 3:29).

  What outward sign signified Abraham's pledge of commitment to God?
Gen. 17:10-14.


   Much later, with the rejection of literal Israel as the Lord's peculiar
 people, the institution of circumcision ceased as a religious symbol and was
 replaced by Christian baptism. (See Col. 2:11, 12.)

   2. Sarah and Isaac (Gen. 17:15-22).

   How did Abraham react to the pledge that Sarah would be the mother of
a son? Verse 17. (Note that Romans 4:19, 20 implies a change in Abraham's
attitude following this conversation.)

                                                                           57
      Why did God reply in the way that He did to Abraham's request that
    Ishmael be accepted as his heir? Verses 18-21.



         3. Abraham and His Family Men Circumcised. (Read Gen. 17:23-27.)

DAY I11. HEAVENLY MESSENGERS VISIT ABRAHAM (Gen. 18:1-33).

      1. Three Visitors Pass by Mamre (Verses 1-15).
      Because the events of Genesis 17 through 19 took place within the year
    before Isaac's birth, the covenant of circumcision, and the visit by the three
    heavenly visitors, as well as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, must
    have followed each other in close succession.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: What do we learn about hospitality when we put
    Genesis 18:1 through 8 together with Hebrews 13:2 and Matthew 25:35?


      During the midday siesta, a most inconvenient moment, Abraham, as
    would a modern Bedouin chief, welcomed three strange chance visitors
    and showered them with the best of Oriental hospitality.

      Note how the unexpected visitors gradually revealed their identity. Gen.
    18:9-15.


         What tremendous assurance did the Lord give to Sarah? Gen. 18:14.



    THINK IT THROUGH: Would it not be wonderful if these words could be
    etched onto our minds! Ask yourself: Am I discouraged? Do I sense my
    weakness? Do I feel like Sarah? Remember, nothing is too hard for the Lord.
    (See Jer. 32:17, 27.) Human frailty stands rebuked by divine omnipotence.

         2. Abraham Intercedes for Sodom (Gen. 18:16-33).

      What interesting reason did the Lord give for revealing His plans to
    Abraham? Verses 17-19. (Compare Isa. 41:8.)


      "Abraham's affection for his children and his household led him to guard
    their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the divine statutes,
    as the most precious legacy he could transmit to them, and through them to
    the world....
      "How few there are in our day who follow this example! ...
      "Not until parents themselves walk in the law of the Lord with perfect
    hearts will they be prepared to command their children after them."
    —Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 142, 143.
    58
     In what way do verses 20 and 21 assure us that God's punishment of the
   Sodomites was not arbitrary?



     What sublime traits of Abraham's character are indicated in verses 23
   through 33?


      Compassionate justice filled the heart of Abraham, who was conscious
   of his own need for grace. The people whom he rescued once before
   (Genesis 14) were again the object of his pity. As Moses and Daniel did on
   later occasions, Abraham implored the Lord to forgive and spare. (See Ex.
   32:32; Dan. 9:3-19; compare with Luke 23:34.)

DAY IV. THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH
        (Gen. 19:1-38).

      1. Heavenly Visitors in Sodom (Verses 1-11).

      What description does Ezekiel 16:49, 50 give concerning the state of the
    Sodomites? See also Gen. 13:13.



      How would you describe Lot's reaction to this wickedness? See 2 Peter
    2:7, 8.


       Wealth, pride, and leisure generated the sins that caused the destruction
    of the cities of the plain. God had not left Himself without a witness.
    Abraham's victory and magnanimous disposition must have caused admi-
    ration, even in the wicked cities, and gave evidence of the superiority of his
    religion. Even Lot's somewhat muffled witness was used providentially to
    draw attention to the true faith. Tragically, all the rays of light had been
    rejected by a people enslaved by their passions. Mercy, perpetually slighted,
    finally ceased to plead.

      What was behind Lot's concern for the visitors? Gen. 19:1-8.


       Although the Hebrew word translated "to know" in verses 5 and 8
    designates mental recognition in the majority of its uses, it also is employed
    to indicate the intimacy of sexual relations. (See Gen. 4:1, 25.) The inhab-
    itants of Sodom were not so much interested in making the acquaintance of
    the two visitors as in abusing them sexually. (See Jude 7.) This is particularly
    clear when verse 5 of Genesis 19 is compared with verse 8 and we take into
    consideration Lot's comment, "I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly"
    (verse 7). This biblical incident gave rise to the later term "sodomy." God's
    law described this practice as heinous and condemned it alongside incest
    and beastiality. (See Lev. 18:22-30; Rom. 1:26, 27; 1 Cor. 6:9.)
                                                                                  59

        How was Lot saved from the immoral, incensed, raging mob? Verses 9-11.
      (Compare 2 Kings 6:18-20.)


DAY        2. The Visitors' Purpose Disclosed; Sodom Destroyed (Gen. 19:12-29).

51
        As the angels intervened in behalf of Lot and acquainted him with their
      mission, he must have realized that he was entertaining heavenly visitors.

           What was to be Lot's task? Verses 12, 13.



        Read verse 14 and try to figure out why Lot's relatives seemed to think
      that he was joking? Verse 14.


         Had Lot's inconsistent witness dulled the effect of his appeals? Not even
      the desperate visit at night could arouse his family. Lot's children "laughed
      at what they called his superstitious fears. His daughters were influenced
      by their husbands. They were well enough off where they were. They could
      see no evidence of danger. Everything was just as it had been. They had
      great possessions, and they could not believe it possible that beautiful
      Sodom would be destroyed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 160.

         How do you explain Lot's incredible delay when urged by the angels to
      leave? Verses 15-17.



           How is the Lord's mercy and patience revealed in verses 16 through 22?


         "Living in that wicked city, in the midst of unbelief, his faith had grown
      dim. The Prince of heaven was by his side, yet he pleaded for his own life as
      though God, who had manifested such care and love for him, would not
      still preserve him. He should have trusted himself wholly to the divine
      Messenger, giving his will and his life into the Lord's hands without a doubt
      or a question."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 161.

        What tragic note does Moses add in verse 26 as he describes the ensuing
      conflagration? Verses 23-26.

        "If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angels' warning,
      but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without one word of pleading
      or remonstrance, his wife also would have made her escape. The influence
      of his example would have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom. But
      his hesitancy and delay caused her to lightly regard the divine warning."—
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 161.

      60

        In what sense can we still be tempted to make the same kind of wrong
      decision that Lot's wife did? Luke 17:28-32.



        What does the destruction of Sodom tell us about the limits of divine
      patience and the certainty of God's announced judgments? Compare 2 Peter
      2:6-9 with Jude 7.



      THINK IT THROUGH: In view of the fact that the overthrow of the cities
      of the plain are an example of the final destruction by fire, what lessons ought
      we to learn from the words, "Escape for thy life"?

DAY     3. Lot and his Daughters (Gen. 19:30-38).

        What blot does the incident related in verses 30 through 38 leave on the
      character of Lot?


        Lot paid an exorbitant price for the few years that he spent in Sodom.
      The immorality that surrounded him there had left its stamp upon his
      daughters. After the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah these girls
      became the mothers of two idolatrous nations that constantly feuded with
      God's people. Lot began his career with possessions so extensive that "the
      land was not able to bear" them (13:5, 6). However, all this was soon
      reduced to a house in Sodom (19:3) and finally a cave in Moab (19:30).
      What a pathetic sight and what a price to pay for his wrong choice!

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Prophets,
      pages 137-144 and 156-170; S. D. A. Bible Commentary on Genesis 16 through
      19.

      SUMMARY: This week we observed the results of unwise choices made by
      both Abraham and Lot. However, we also noted the shining example of
      Abraham whose relationship to God was not only manifested in faith and
      obedience but also in his compassionate intercession for the sinful.

      APPLICATION: The temptation to run ahead of God's purposes for our
      lives is as real today as it was for Abraham and Sarah. In our impatience we
      still need to hear, "I am Almighty God, walk before me and be thou
      perfect," while in our frailties it is well for us to remember, "Is anything too
      hard for the Lord?"
      o In view of the story of Sodom, is it possible that, because I live in the
         midst of indifference, my horror of sin has been dulled?
      o At a time when it is unpopular to speak of obedience, law, and trans-
         gression could I be caricaturing God's love?
      o Might inconsistency and indecisiveness in my words and actions contrib-
         ute to the loss of someone's eternal salvation?

                                                                                      61

INTRODUCTION: Chapters 20 through 25 depict the last 55 years of
Abraham's life, a period brightened by the presence of his heir. However,
these years were not without shadows. Once more Abraham nearly jeop-
ardized the fulfillment of the promised seed (20:1-18). With moist eyes and
heavy heart he had to send away Ishmael (21:8-20). Then his faith was
tested severely when God commanded him to sacrifice the long-awaited
son of promise (22:1-18). It was in the region of Moriah, where later the
temple stood and near where Golgotha's cross was planted, that both father
and son reached the height of faith and the Lord demonstrated the way that
He was to provide for sinners. Once more dark clouds gathered when Sarah
was laid to rest. But beautiful and kind Rebekah helped bring back the
sunshine. Thus the stage was set for Jacob, whose story and that of his son,
Joseph, will take up the remaining chapters of the book of Genesis.

         1. The Promise Once More in Jeopardy (Gen. 20:1-18).

          Soon after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham moved to
       a region near the border of Egypt, approximately 80 miles southwest from
       Hebron, before traveling north to Gerar located in a fertile valley south of
       Gaza. (See map.) The city state of Gerar was then ruled by a Philistine
       prince whose name or title was Abimelech.
                                                                                                         .nnanns I

         After Abraham had reached another summit of faith, what incident
       caused him to fall? Verses 1-13.



         How does this account illustrate the words recorded in 1 Corinthians
       10:12?



         How did the incident recorded in Genesis 20 give Satan opportunity to
       thwart God's plan to bring about the birth of the promised seed?


         With years of patient waiting behind him, and now on the verge of the
       birth of Isaac, Abraham and Sarah surrendered once more to deviousness
       (verse 12). (See Gen. 12:10-20.) Had God not interposed to secure Sarah's
       release (verses 3, 6, 7, 18) Abraham would have lost both his wife and the
       prospects of the promised seed. Again lack of faith jeopardized their
       hopes.

          What is so ironical about Abraham's prayer for Abimelech? Gen. 20:17.

                                                                                                                     63

        Abraham, the embarrassed and erring prophet of God, was reprimanded
      by a Philistine king who seemed more righteous than the patriarch (verses
      5-10).

DAY     2. The Birth of Isaac (Gen. 21:1-7).
        Only when Abraham's human schemes and ingenuity had failed could
      God's intervention be appreciated fully and what seemed laughable become
      believable reality. Abraham, the centenarian (verse 5), finally received the
      long-awaited son and heir.

        How did Sarah respond to the birth of her child? Verses 6, 7.


         The birth of Isaac (whose name means "he laughs" and reminds readers
      of Abraham's and Sarah's laughter, see 17:17; 18:12, 13) became the occa-
      sion for great joy.

        3. Hagar and Ishmael Expelled; the Treaty at Beersheba (Gen. 21:8-34).

         To what did the tensions developing between Ishmael and Isaac finally
      lead? Verses 8-10.


       In view of the fact that Sarah had initially instigated the union between
      Abraham and Hagar, her demand to expel Hagar appears cruel.

       How did God ease Abraham's trauma over the banishment of Ishmael?
      What assurance did He give the anxious father? Verses 11-13.


        Ishmael had lived for about 17 years with his father Abraham. How could
      Abraham abandon Ishmael? What a price the old patriarch had to pay for
      his compliance with the hasty wishes of Sarah!

        How did Paul describe the incompatibility between Abraham's natural
      and spiritual descendants, and what application did the apostle make? Gal.
      4:28-31.


        "Sarah saw in Ishmael's turbulent disposition a perpetual source of
      discord."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 146. The later history of clashes
      between the two descendants of Abraham bears out her concern.

        Notice the contrast in attitudes between God and Sarah toward the
      outcasts. Gen. 21:14-21.



        What observations led Abimelech to enter into a friendship treaty with
      Abraham at Beersheba? Verses 22-32.

DAY IL THE ULTIMATE TEST OF FAITH (Gen. 22:1-24).

       1. The Divine Summons and the Journey to Moriah (verses 1-5).

       In spite of the admirable trust that Abraham often displayed (12:1-4;
     15:1-6) his faith had not been perfect. On a number of occasions Abraham
     had shown a lack of trust. He had deceived Pharaoh and Abimelech and
     had had a liaison with Hagar. In order for him to become truly the "father
     of all them that believe" (Rom. 4:11) Abraham had to experience one of
     the most severe trials of faith that anyone ever has experienced.

       What harrowing test was laid upon the aged Abraham? Gen. 22:1, 2.


       This was the eighth scripturally recorded message from God to Abra-
     ham. (See Acts 7:2; Gen. 12:1; 13:14; 15:1; 17:1; 18:1; 21:12.) Consequently,
     he had no doubt as to who it was that spoke to him.

     REACT: Read the following and try to imagine the thoughts that raced
     through Abraham's mind and the emotions that filled his heart.

       "The loss of such a son by accident or disease would have been heart
     rending to the fond father; it would have bowed down his whitened head
     with grief; but he was commanded to shed the blood of that son with his
     own hand. It seemed to him a fearful impossibility."—Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 148.
       Tormented by doubt, despair, and anguish, and subjected to satanic
     insinuations, Abraham sought for a divine confirmation. (See Patriarchs
     and Prophets, p. 148.) But God remained strangely silent. There was no
     relief. Not even Isaac's mother could be told for fear that she might hinder
     the patriarch. Abraham knew God's voice and was aware that he must obey
     without delay.

       What do the words that Abraham spoke to the two servants indicate about
     his faith? Gen. 22:5.


        Although tortured by questions and heartbreak, Abraham strengthened
     himself for his unwelcome task by dwelling upon the evidences of God's
     goodness and faithfulness in the past. Tested to the breaking point, he rose
     to an incredible height of faith and thus became the "father of the faithful."
     His love and faith for God was manifested in his journey to Mount Moriah.

       2. God's Initiative and Provision (Gen. 22:6-14).

       How is Abraham's faith further revealed in verses 6 through 8? (Compare
     with Heb. 11:17-19.)


      Isaac's endearing address, "my father," and his question concerning the
     whereabouts of the sacrifice (Gen. 22:7) pierced the old man's heart and
                                                                           65
       U-.52tatimia
                 •ca UM
      elicited a response full of prophetic hope (verse 8). Tremblingly, Abraham's
      faith reached out, clutching the hope that the same miraculous power that
      had given life to Isaac would restore him to life again.

           What do verses 9 and 10 disclose about Isaac?


        "It was with terror and amazement that Isaac learned his fate, but he
      offered no resistance....
        "And now the last words of love are spoken, the last tears are shed, the
      last embrace is given. The father lifts the knife to slay his son, when
      suddenly his arm is stayed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 152.

DAY     What did the Lord do at that critical moment to save Isaac and provide a

5     substitute? Verses 11-14.


         "Abraham was human; his passions and attachments were like ours; but
      he did not stop to question how the promise could be fulfilled if Isaac should
      be slain. He did not stay to reason with his aching heart. He knew that God
      is just and righteous in all His requirements, and he obeyed the command
      to the very letter."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 153.
         Isaac's ready submission typified the future submission of the Son of
      God. Once more in the region of Moriah, on a hill called Golgotha, a
      Father was to surrender His life in His Son. While Moses, looking forward
      by faith, wrote, "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided" (verse
      14, NIV), we can exclaim in adoration and gratitude, "On the mountain of
      the Lord it has been provided."

      THINK IT THROUGH: How is the proper relationship between faith and
      works revealed in this experience?

        "There are many who fail to understand the relation of faith and works.
      They say, 'Only believe in Christ, and you are safe. You have nothing to do
      with keeping the law.' But genuine faith will be manifest in obedience. Said
      Christ to the unbelieving Jews, 'If ye were Abraham's children, ye would
      do the works of Abraham.' John 8:39."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 153,
      154.

        3. Repetition of the Promise and the Return to Beersheba (Gen.
      22:15-24).

        How did God reward Abraham's supreme demonstration of faith in
      action? Verses 15-18.


        The "angel of the Lord" called attention twice to Abraham's obedience
      as the reason for the blessings pronounced (verses 16, 18). Because Abra-
      ham had demonstrated that he was trusting and trustworthy, God was able
      to bless him. For the first time, God mentioned possession of "the gate of

      66
     Lesson                                           tik3 1.110Mp117 CII MEW
    his enemies" (verse 17). Subsequent to Abraham's and Isaac's joyful return
    to Beersheba, news about their relatives in Mesopotamia reached the
    patriarch, thus introducing contact that led to Rebekah becoming the wife
    of Isaac (verses 19-24).

DAY HI. THE DEATH OF ISAAC'S PARENTS AND HIS MARRIAGE TO
         REBEKAH (Gen. 23:1-25:10).

      1. The Death of Sarah (23:1-20).

       Under what sad circumstances did Abraham acquire his first piece of real
    estate in the Promised Land? Verses 1-20.


       Abraham had returned to the land of Canaan and lived at Kiriath-arba,
    later known as Hebron. While Amorites had been in control of this region
    during Abraham's earlier residence, now Hittites dominated the territory.
    This changeover of nationalities is evidenced in the trading customs men-
    tioned during the purchase of the burial ground for Sarah.
       Sarah can be included among those whose faith looked forward to
    dwelling forever in a "better country." (See Heb. 11:13-16.)

      2. Eliezer Chooses a Bride for Isaac (Gen. 24:1-67).

      What request did Abraham make of his faithful servant, Eliezer? Verses
    1-9.


       Three years after the death of Sarah, Abraham made preparations for
    the marriage of his son. Isaac trusted divine providence and his father to
    find a suitable wife.

      Why did Abraham advise Eliezer to choose a wife from among his relatives
    rather than from the daughters of Canaan? Gen. 24:3, 4. (Compare with
    Deut. 7:3, 4; 1 Kings 11:4; 2 Cor. 6:14.)

       "The happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation depends upon
    the unity of the parties; but between the believer and the unbeliever there
    is a radical difference of tastes, inclinations, and purposes. They are serving
    two masters, between whom there can be no concord. However pure and
    correct one's principles may be, the influence of an unbelieving companion
    will have a tendency to lead away from God ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
    174.

       What does the sequel of this story reveal about Eliezer's character? Gen.
     24:12, 26, 33, 52, 56.



                                                                                67
       Ualmrab di ROD                                             Ilamm
  How was Abraham's faith and Isaac's trust in the providence of God
rewarded? Verses 16, 19, 58, 67.


  Rebekah was beautiful, kind, resolute, and both loving and lovable. "Let
parents seek, in their own character and in their home life, to exemplify the
love and beneficence of the heavenly Father. Let the home be full of
sunshine. This will be worth far more to your children than lands or money.
Let the home love be kept alive in their hearts, that they may look back
upon the home of their childhood as a place of peace and happiness next to
heaven. The members of the family do not all have the same stamp of
character, and there will be frequent occasion for the exercise of patience
and forbearance; but through love and self-discipline all may be bound
together in the closest union."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 176.

   3. The Death of Abraham (Gen. 25:1-10).
   After Abraham had appointed Isaac as his undisputed legal heir, and had
sent his other sons away richly laden with gifts, he died at the age of 175
(verses 1-8). Ishmael and Isaac buried their father in the purchased tomb
where Abraham had buried Sarah (verses 9-11).
   Before proceeding with the line of the faithful, the writer of Genesis, in
his characteristic fashion, first lists the generations of those who will fade
from our view (verses 12-18). In the next lesson we begin to take up in detail
the story of Isaac and his descendants.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
145-155 and 171-176; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis
20:1-25:18.

SUMMARY: Abraham and Isaac stand out as the ancestors of the faithful,
demonstrating that, regardless of the cost, God and His will had preemin-
ence in their lives. God can be trusted, for He provided a ram, and
ultimately the Supreme Sacrifice to assure the redemption of the lost race.
How different is the early life of Jacob, which we will begin to study next
week.

APPLICATION: Consider how distrust in God's power can jeopardize the
plans and purposes He has for our lives and thus bring heartache to others.
o While I may never be asked to demonstrate the heights of Abraham's
  faith, how willing am Ito manifest my commitment to God?
o Am I ready to reveal my love to God in obedience and exhibit my faith
  by my actions?
o Am I willing to be guided in the choice of a life partner or friends and
  associates?
o Does my home exemplify the love and beneficence of my heavenly
  Father, and is it full of sunshine?
o What values do my children derive from their home?

The Price of Duplicity
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 25:19 through 29:30.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all
    places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for
1   I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee
    of" (Gen. 28:15).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: His deception in obtaining the birthright blessing
not only revealed a blemish in Jacob's character but also cost him his peace
for years to come. However, divine grace sought out the repentant sinner
and assured him of acceptance, forgiveness, and guidance.

INTRODUCTION: The story of Jacob begins with a divine oracle and the
birth of the twins, Esau and Jacob. Although Jacob's life virtually spans
the rest of the book of Genesis, the more specific story of his life may be
divided into three broad sections that can be designated the Jacob-Esau
episode (chapters 27, 28), the Jacob-Laban episode (chapters 29-31), and
another Jacob-Esau episode (chapters 32-35). These episodes are linked
together by two major encounters that Jacob had with the Lord. The first
of these occurred at Bethel when Jacob left the Promised Land and fled
from Esau (28:10-22). The second encounter took place when the patriarch
wrestled with a divine Being as he reentered the Promised Land to face
Esau (32:6-30). At that time the Lord changed Jacob's name to Israel and
reaffirmed the Abrahamic blessing to him (35:9-12).
   Our study of the story of Jacob will be divided into two parts. This week
we will focus on the first 80 years or so of Jacob's life.
                                                                             69
DAY I. ESAU AND JACOB (Gen. 25:19-34).
 ,k1
         1. The Birth of the Twins (verses 19-26).
         Verses 19 through 26 are out of place chronologically. They are placed at
       this point in order to preserve continuity in the account of Jacob's life.
       Although Abraham's death at 175 is mentioned in Genesis 25:7-11, the
       patriarch was 160 years old when the twins were born, for Isaac was 60
       years old when Rebekah gave birth to Esau and Jacob (verse 26).

         How long did Rebekah have to wait before her prayer for children was
       answered? (Compare verses 20, 21 with verse 26.)



         How did God explain to Rebekah the worrisome jostling that she experi-
       enced during pregnancy? Verses 22, 23.


          The prediction that the older (Esau) would serve the younger (Jacob)
       explains to some extent Rebekah's desire to see Jacob receive the birthright
       and helps us understand Isaac's ultimate decision not to renege on his
       blessing (27:33; compare with Rom. 9:10-12). The name Esau probably is
       related to the Hebrew word for "hairy" (verses 24, 25), and Jacob means
       literally "he grasps the heel" and figuratively "he deceives." (See Gen.
       25:26; 27:36.)

         2. Contrasts Between Jacob and Esau (Gen. 25:27-34).

         What difference in life-style between the two brothers is indicated in verse
       27?



         What does the birthright incident reveal about the characters of Esau and
       Jacob? Verses 28-34. (Compare Heb. 12:16, 17.)


          While Jacob's conduct was deplorable as he endeavored by his scheming
       to secure the privileges that had been promised in the Lord's prediction
       (verse 23), Esau's trifling attitude also must be deplored. The birthright
       was a status normally enjoyed by the firstborn that entitled him to both
       material and spiritual blessings. (Compare Deut. 21:17.) However, to the
       restless, unrestrained, self-indulgent, and impatient Esau the momentary
       satisfaction of his immediate desires and needs was of greater value than
       any far-off blessing hidden as yet to sight. All that he cared for was that
       which presently satisfied his senses of sight and taste (Gen. 25:30-32).
          Esau demonstrated that he was unworthy of the birthright privilege not
       only by bartering it away in a most flippant manner but also by reinforcing
       his choice through an oath (verse 33) and by his unperturbed departure
       (verse 34). His calm and deliberate rejection of the birthright marked him
       as a "profane person." (See Heb. 12:16.)

DAY 11. ISAAC AND ABIMELECH (Gen. 26:1-35).

al     1. Isaac's Deceit and Treaty (verses 1-33).
       A famine, specifically distinguished from that which drove Abraham
     from Canaan to Egypt, led Isaac to the land of Gerar. Here the Lord
     renewed His covenant promises of divine guidance, descendants, land, and
     blessing (verses 3-6).

     NOTE once again the close relationship between grace and obedience.
     (Compare verse 5 with verse 24.)

       How is Isaac's lack of a fully developed faith demonstrated by the sad
     episode that followed the renewal of God's covenant of grace? Verses 7-11.



        Sometime later Isaac's wealth increased to the point that it elicited the
     jealousy of the Philistines. In order to preserve peace, Isaac moved to the
     valley of Gerar and later moved again to Beersheba (verses 12-22). This
     illustrates the hardship and tensions to which believers are exposed in this
     sin-darkened world.

        What patriarchal practice did Isaac follow after the second divine revela-
     tion was accorded to him? Verses 23-25.



     READ Genesis 26:26-33.

       Nearly a century after the treaty that Abraham had entered into with
     Abimelech, the ruler of Gerar, a later Abimelech, accompanied by a friend
     and the chief captain of his army invited Isaac to enter into another sworn
     peace treaty.

       2. Esau's Marriages (verses 34, 35).

       What do verses 34 and 35 indicate about the character of Esau?


       Esau's marriages outside his family and religion added considerable
     heartache to his parents and gave further evidence of his willful and
     independent spirit. These character indications justify God's choice of
     Jacob as covenant heir and demonstrate Isaac's injudiciousness in attempt-
     ing to bestow the birthright blessing upon Esau.

DAY I11. FAITHLESS SCHEMES (Gen. 27:1-46).

g       1. Jacob Deceives His Father Into Blessing Him (verses 1-29).

        Isaac, who was then about 137 years of age, must have felt that he was on

                                                                                71
his deathbed, even though Scripture indicates that he lived for another 43
years. (See Gen. 35:28.)

   Upon what course did Isaac decide although it was contrary to the Lord's
instruction at the birth of the twins? (Compare Gen. 27:1-4 with 25:23, 28.)


  Isaac permitted his tastebuds to influence his heart and conscience. He
determined to bestow the birthright blessing upon his older son in spite of
Esau's deliberate disregard of the birthright and his ill-disposed choice of
Hittite women for wives.

 Realizing that her husband's plan was contrary to God's revealed will,
what scheme did Rebekah devise? Gen. 27:5-13.


   As Rebekah discovered Isaac's plan to bestow the irrevocable blessing
upon her first-born, she was driven to do that which displayed her lack of
faith. Her preference for the more quiet and home-loving Jacob (25:27,
28), combined with her knowledge of his choice by God and her recognition
of Esau's irreligious and flippant disposition, led her to resort to the scheme
she developed.

 How did Rebekah relieve the anxiety of Jacob who feared that his deceit
would be discovered and that his father would curse him? Gen. 27:11-13.


  Bent on her immediate designs Rebekah was prepared to endure what-
ever adverse results might come. The price she paid was heavy, for she
never was to see her favorite son again.

THINK IT THROUGH: What concerned Jacob more, his sin or the conse-
quences he received as a result of his sin? Which am I most concerned about
when I sin?

   How did one wrong lead to another as Jacob became more deeply involved
in his deception? Verses 14-26.


   Throughout this episode Isaac relied more on his physical senses than on
God. Jacob lived up to his name. Premeditated and calculated deceit and
lies were followed even by blasphemy (verse 20).

  What blessing did the deceived father bestow upon the deceiver? Verses
27-29.


  As Isaac smelled the clothes Jacob wore, his mind was carried from the
present to the future. The smell of the fields suggested to him an abundance
of crops and a bounty of grain and wine (verses 27-29, 37). Jacob was

72
    I Ws= OD                                          VW Me a anlitilap
     promised ultimate dominion over the nations, a plan that was reiterated
     and enlarged upon by later prophets and poets of Israel. Under inspiration
     the prophetic eye envisaged the ultimate success and supremacy of God's
     people.

        What vital truth seemed to have escaped the attention of the anxious
     mother and her son as it appeared that the long-awaited blessing was about
     to elude Jacob? Psalm 37:7, 34.


       "Jacob and Rebekah succeeded in their purpose, but they gained only
    trouble and sorrow by their deception. God had declared that Jacob should
    receive the birthright, and His word would have been fulfilled in His own
    time had they waited in faith for Him to work for them. But like many who
    now profess to be children of God, they were unwilling to leave the matter
    in His hands."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 180.
DAY    2. Esau's Arrival and the Results of Deception (Gen. 27:30-46).

       How was Esau's earlier choice concerning the birthright confirmed?
     Verses 30-40.


       Pathos and pain characterize these verses as father and son recognized
     Rebekah's and Jacob's deception. However, Esau still was more concerned
     about the result of his frivolity than he was about his sin. Although Jacob
     had deluded both father and brother, he merely had claimed the blessing
     that Esau had bypassed so carelessly.

     ILLUMINATION: "As Esau awoke to see the folly of his rash exchange
     when it was too late to recover his loss, so it will be in the day of God with
     those who have bartered their heirship to heaven for selfish gratifica-
     tions."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 181,182.

        What startling recognition led Isaac to cooperate with God? (Compare
      verses 33-36 with Gen. 25:23.)


        Although Isaac's words concerning his sons were predictive of their
      future, the blessing upon Jacob did not represent a divine approval of
      Jacob's deception, "for God is not dependent upon artifice to accomplish
      His will. God did not ordain the act of deception, He overruled it. The
      blessing came to Jacob, not because of deception, but in spite of it."—
      S. D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 379.

        What led to Rebekah's suggestion that Jacob should leave for the land of
      her origin? Gen. 27:41-46.


       Afraid that she might lose Jacob at the murderous hands of Esau,
      Rebekah suggested her youngest ‘son's exile. Pretending to fear Jacob's
                                                                                 73
    marriage to a Hittite woman, Rebekah persuaded Isaac to send Jacob on
    his way.

DAY IV. JACOB'S FLIGHT (Gen. 28:1-29:30).

         1. Departure and Dream at Bethel (Gen. 28:1-22).

     Note the fatherly instruction and blessing with which Isaac sent Jacob to
    Mesopotamia. Verses 1-5.

      Based on Jacob's age when he joined his son Joseph in Eygpt, it would
    appear that Jacob was 77 years of age when he left Beersheba for his
    mother's homeland. While the precise location of Paddan Aram is not
    certain, it appears to designate a region in northwest Mesopotamia and
    may even coincide with Haran.

      What do verses 6 through 9 demonstrate about Esau's desire to please his
    parents?



      Describe the content and significance of Jacob's dream at Bethel as he left
    the Promised Land. Verses 10-15.


       After a journey of approximately 50 miles, Jacob fell asleep at Bethel
    fearing that God had forsaken him. The Lord approached him there with a
    dream of a staircase linking heaven and earth. Thus God assured Jacob of
    an uninterrupted fellowship between the human family on earth and the
    divine Father in heaven. (See John 1:51.) Most important to Jacob, trou-
    bled by remorse, was the assurance of God's presence and God's promise
    to bring him back to his homeland.

         How did Jacob respond to this remarkable dream? Gen. 28:16-22.



       2. Jacob's Arrival and Marriage (Gen. 29:1-30).
       Encouraged by the dream of the staircase and God's assurances, Jacob
    traveled the remaining 450 miles to the region of Haran (verses 1-6). Here
    he met his future wife, Rachel, and his father-in-law, Laban (verses 7-14).

      Compare and contrast the arrival of Jacob with that of Eliezer some 97
    years before. (Compare Gen. 24:10-60 with 29:1-13.)



      Having recognized the economic advantages in retaining a promising
    worker such as Jacob, what proposition did Laban submit and what agree-
    ment did both reach? Gen. 29:14-19.
    74
                                                        IOW Di/Ny Ø1J ILVVINSy
        What does verse 20 tell us about the affection of this 77-year-old suitor for
      Rachel?


        Jacob may have suggested the rather long period of seven years' service
      to give himself time for uncomfortable relations back home to heal. Laban
      saw the advantage and determined to exploit it, even forgetting the termi-
      nation of the period. (See verse 21.)

DAY     Why did Jacob's dream of marrying Rachel turn into a nightmare? What
      do verses 22 through 24 reveal about both Laban and Leah?
tO
        Darkness of night and the bridal veil prevented Jacob from discovering
      the identity of his bride. It is not impossible that Leah had developed an
      affection for Jacob and therefore consented to conspire with her father
      against Jacob.

        After Jacob's discovery of the deception and his remonstrance with La-
      ban, how did the two resolve their differences? Verses 25-30.


        In Laban Jacob had met his match. Laban's avarice, meanness, and greed
      became a means of discipline that Jacob never forgot. Disregarding the
      feelings of his daughters and his son-in-law, Laban thought only of his own
      advancement. The entire story is a sad comment on the material God had
      to use for the ancestors of His chosen people. Jacob the deceiver learned
      how cruel deception can be. Leah who craved love and recognition found
      that she could not take her sister's place in Jacob's affection. Nevertheless,
      the story equally testifies to the triumph of God's grace and love. It
      demonstrates that God can use faulty, failing, and repentant humans and
      change them by His love and power.

      SUMMARY: As this week's study detailed the intrigue, duplicity, and
      faithless schemes in the family of Isaac during the first half of Jacob's life,
      we have been led to wonder at God's patience and His willingness to mold
      us into what He wants us to be. Our next lesson will complete the life
      journey of Isaac's youngest son, who began as Jacob and ended as Israel.

      APPLICATION:
      o How would I have acted in Rebekah's and Jacob's place when Isaac
        attempted to defy God's wish and bless Esau?
      o Is it ever right to resort to wrong means to bring about right ends?
      o Do I find it difficult to trust God to accomplish His purposes in His own
        time and in His own way?
      o What lesson is conveyed by the fact that God demonstrated His interest
        and concern to fearful and despondent Jacob at Bethel?
      o What have I learned this week that will help me to be a better Christian
        witness?                                                               75

         Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and

     CENTRAL THOUGHT: The chapters to be considered this week trace
     Jacob's experience from his marriage to Leah and Rachel to his return to
     Bethel. His pilgrimage which began with his being a dejected man at
     Bethel ends with his being an overcomer at the "house of God (Bethel)."

     INTRODUCTION: Jacob's 20 years of service in Mesopotamia were char-
     acterized by jealousy, contention, and intrigue. One sister sought to outdo
     the other in the number of sons she bore as both vied for first place in their
     husband's affections. Son-in-law and father-in-law shone in their game of
     one-upmanship with Laban manifesting interest only in his own advance-
     ment. The biblical story notes more faith in potions and human schemes
     than in God. Yet, these same chapters also reveal how groundless is trust in
     human power and how certain is the reality of the divine promises of mercy,
     forgiveness, and acceptance. At the Jabbok repentant Jacob became Israel,
     and God's plan triumphed in spite of the apparently unpromising human
     material with which He had to work.


DAY I. JACOB'S FAMILY (Gen. 29:31-30:43).
ra
       1. Jacob's Children (Gen. 29:31-30:24).
       Jacob's marriage to two sisters, which later Mosaic law prohibited

     76
while the first sister was alive (Lev. 18:18), was marred by a great deal of
intrigue, jealousy, bickering, and sadness.

  How did God seek to foster Jacob's appreciation for Leah? Gen. 29:31-35.


   In a society in which children signified God's favor and attracted the
husband's love, God blessed Leah with several children. The names given
to the children of both wives and maidservants reflect the feelings of Leah
and Rachel at the birth of those infants and testified to the contention which
existed between them. The names either are derived from or resemble the
sound of the Hebrew verbs associated with the names.

  What emotions are reflected by the names of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and
Judah? Verses 32-35.
  Reuben ("see, a son") is a play on the word "[the Lord] has seen."
  Simeon ("hearing") relates to "the Lord has heard."
  Levi (sounds like "attached") and alludes to "my husband [will be]
joined."
  Judah (sounds like "praise") and expresses the conviction, "I [will] praise
the Lord."

   What contention arose between Rachel and Jacob, and how did she seek
to resolve it? Gen. 30:1-5.


  Even though Rachel enjoyed all of her husband's affections, her child-
lessness attracted shame and resulted in jealousy and petulance (30:1-5).
Frustrated by her barrenness and unwilling to be outdone by her sister, she
presented her husband with her maidservant, a customed followed earlier
by Sarah.

  What do the names Dan ("he has vindicated") and Naphtali ("my strug-
gle") exhibit about Rachel's feelings? Verses 6-8.


  Not wishing to be excelled, Leah gave her maidservant Zilpah to Jacob.
Gad ("fortune" or "truth") and Asher ("happy") were born to this union
(verses 9-12). The names reflect Leah's fortune and happiness.

  To what superstitious practice did the two sisters resort according to
verses 14 through 17?


   It was an ancient belief that has persisted to our day that the plum-like
 berry and fleshy root of the mandrake plant stimulate sexual desire and
 induce human fertility. It is ironic that, in spite of the superstition, the herb
 did not benefit Rachel. Actually, Rachel's scheme only advantaged Leah,
 who was prepared to part with her son's mandrakes. The story demonstrates
 that God blessed in answer to prayer in spite of superstition.

                                                                               77
         What significance did Leah attach to the birth of Issachar (the name
      sounds like the Hebrew for "reward" or "wages") and Zebulun ("honor"
      or "gift")? Verses 18-20.


         Once more God blessed, not in order to sanction Leah's wrong action,
      but in spite of her false belief. Leah craved her husband's acceptance and
      attention. The reference to Dinah in verse 21 prepares the reader for the
      unhappy incident recorded in chapter 34.

        Having abandoned human schemes, to what did Rachel finally resort and
      how did God respond? What hope did Rachel express in the name, Joseph
      ("may He add")? Gen. 30:22-24.


        Joseph probably was born at the end of the 14 years of service to which
      Jacob was committed in return for Leah and Rachel (verse 25).


DAY        2. Jacob's Wages (Gen. 30:25-43).

N        How did the schemers, Laban and Jacob, attempt to outsmart each other
      after Jacob had requested permission for himself and his family to return to
      his native country? Verses 26-34.


        The form of payment agreed on extended Jacob's stay for another six
      years (31:41). Jacob's request appears magnanimous when we realize that
      in the Near East "goats, as a rule, are black or dark brown, rarely white or
      spotted with white, and that sheep are for the most part white, seldom
      black or speckled."—S. D. A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 394. As Laban
      would be left with all the pure-color animals the deal seemed advantageous
      to Jacob's father-in-law.

        How did Laban seek to prevent any off-color characteristics being bred
      back into the pure-color stock? Gen. 30:35, 36.



         To what ancient superstition did Jacob resort after any possible attempt
      at selected breeding had been thwarted by Laban's separation of the stock?
      Verses 37-43.


        Jacob as well as Laban seemed to be unaware of the fact that even those
      animals which appeared to be pure-color still carried in them recessive
      color characteristics that could be transmitted to their offspring. Being at a
      loss as to what he should do, Jacob took refuge in the mistaken belief that
      vivid sights experienced by a mother during conception or pregnancy would
      mark her offspring.

     1_42=7) •                                           WW1) Becomes lsrae
      While to all intents and purposes Jacob's stratagems appeared to meet
    with success (verse 43), what message did God convey to the patriarch in a
    dream? Gen. 31:7-12.


      Jacob attributed his success to God's blessing (verses 7, 9), and the Lord
    blessed him in spite of his superstitious beliefs (verse 12). Indeed, the
    dream of verses 10 through 12 may have been intended to explain to the
    patriarch how the recessive off-color characteristics were passed on by the
    pure-color parents. God used the occasion for a miracle and blessed Jacob,
    not because of his skill or ingenuity but in order to thwart Laban's exploitation.

DAY 11. JACOB'S FLIGHT TO CANAAN (Gen. 31:1-55).

       1. Jacob Plans his Return (verses 1-21).

      What circumstances suggested to Jacob that he should return to his
    homeland? Verses 1-3. How many years did he work for Laban? Verse 41.



       How did Leah and Rachel respond to Jacob's plan? Verses 4-16.


       As a result of his greed Laban alienated his daughters and changed
     Jacob's wages ten times. Laban's absence provided the opportunity for
     Jacob to leave Mesopotamia (verses 17-21). Rachel's theft of her father's
     household deities may testify to the fact that her beautiful appearance
     concealed a half-converted heart. After 13 years of marriage she still had
     not submitted fully to the God worshiped by her husband (verse 19).

       2. Laban Pursues Jacob (Gen. 31:22-55).

       What sanctimonious accusation did Laban level against Jacob when
     he overtook him after covering a distance of more than 275 miles? Verses
     22-30.


        Conscious of his innocence, Jacob invoked the death penalty upon the
     one in whose possession the household gods were to be found (verse 32).
     While such a penalty was in harmony with Mesopotamian law, it was as
     foolish and rash a decision as was that of Jacob's sons years later (Gen.
     44:9). Rachel's ruse demonstrated that she was the daughter of Laban,
     partaking of his character (Gen. 31:32-35). Since Laban was unable to
     support any of his charges, Jacob reprimanded his father-in-law angrily and
     attributed his own success to the God of his father (verses 36-42).

      What was the last contact mentioned in the Bible between the family
     members in Mesopotamia and Canaan? Verses 43-55.


                                                                                   79
DAY I11. JACOB AND ESAU (Gen. 32:1-33:20).

51     1. Preparations to Meet Esau (32:1-21).
       Before returning to Bethel Jacob prepared to be reconciled with his
     brother. (Compare Matt. 5:23, 24.)

       How did God attempt to comfort Jacob, who was burdened by guilt and
     fear? Gen. 32:1,2.



       Frightened by the reported advance of Esau with 400 men, what
     preparations did Jacob make in order to be reconciled with his brother?
     Verses 3-21.



     THINK IT THROUGH: Was Jacob's strategy a substitute for faith or a tool
     in the hands of faith?

          2. Jacob Becomes Israel (Gen. 32:22-32).

       Another significant encounter with God took place as Jacob stood on the
     borders of the Promised Land and prepared to face his brother again.

       What is the significance of the unusual experience Jacob had after he had
     sent his family and possessions across the river Jabbok? Verses 22-26.
     (Compare Hosea 12:4.)


       Standing on the borders of Canaan, suffering with guilt, remorse, and
     doubt, Jacob longed for a sense of total acceptance with God and his
     brother Esau. Jacob knew that it was his past sin that had now put at risk
     his loved ones, who already had crossed the waters of the Jabbok. As
     he recalled the scenes of the past he suddenly was attacked. (See Gen.
     32:24-26.)

        What hints in verses 25 through 30 indicate Jacob's gradual recognition
     of the true identity of his opponent?


       As Jacob perceived that he had struggled with a supernatural being, he
     pleaded for a blessing (verse 26). His petition and perseverance were
     rewarded by a change of name. No longer would his name be Jacob ("to
     seize the heel" and by extension "to overreach" or "to deceive"). Now it
     would be Israel ("he strives with God"). (See verse 28.)

       Why did Jacob call the location of this experience Peniel ("face of God")?
     Verse 30.


     80
                                                       ItintD ntrcraw)
         Jacob had met God face to face and lived to tell about the encounter.
      Both at Bethel 20 years earlier and now at Peniel he received the assurance
      of God's presence. However, the much more intimate experience at Peniel
      prepared Jacob to enter the Land of Promise as a man of faith. This last
      encounter with God was memorialized in the names Israel and Peniel, and
      in the custom of not eating a specific sinew of animals slaughtered for food
      (verses 31, 32).

        3. Jacob and Esau (Gen. 33:1-20).

        What touching scene is recounted in verses 1-7? (Compare Luke 15:20.)


        Jacob's name had been changed to Israel because he had struggled "with
      God and with men" (Gen. 32:28). His encounter with God was followed by
      his meeting with his brother. How sweet was the sense of grace and
      forgiveness that Jacob felt. Former hostilities were washed away by a flood
      of tears as the brothers embraced in love and reconciliation. Esau's accep-
      tance of the droves of animals that Jacob had sent ahead of his group sealed
      the brothers' reconciliation (Gen. 33:8-11).

        What was behind the way Jacob expressed his relief at Esau's forgiveness
      and acceptance? Verse 10. (Compare with 32:30.)


        "Esau's friendly greeting called to mind the divine promise so recently
      accorded Jacob, and in Esau's face he could read its gracious fulfillment.
      These words of Jacob reflect his profound gratitude for the obvious
      Presence that attended him on his way."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
      vol. 1, p. 409.

        In what way is Jacob's exemplary concern for those in his care worthy of
      emulation by both parents and church leaders today? Gen. 33:12-14.




DAY IV. MASSACRE AT SHECHEM AND ISRAEL'S RETURN TO
        BETHEL (Gen. 34:1-35:29).
rfi
         1. Dinah and the Shechemites (34:1-31).

        While living in Succoth and Shechem Dinah grew into womanhood. What
      sad incident in the city of Shechem led to treachery, massacre, and renewed
      fear? Gen. 34:1-31.


        The events recorded in chapter 34 are a sad commentary on Jacob's delay
      in fulfilling completely the vows He had made to God at Bethel. (See Gen.
      28:20-22.)

                                                                                81
        2. Return to Bethel (Gen. 35:1-29).

        In direct answer to the divine summons Jacob prepared to return to
      Bethel where his pilgrimage had begun many years before (verse 1).

       What call for revival and reformation did Jacob address to his family
     before returning to Bethel? How did he make good his earlier vow at Bethel?
     Verses 2-7.



        How did God honor His returning son? Verses 9-15.


        It is obvious that even after the encounter with God at Peniel Jacob still
     was given to the failures common to man. The cost he had to pay for
     spending so much time living close to the Canaanites at Shechem might
     have been avoided had he repaired to Bethel immediately. The remainder
     of chapter 35 records the birth of Benjamin ("son of my right hand"),
     Rachel's death and burial, Reuben's heinous sin that cost him his birthright
     privileges, the joyous reunion between Isaac and Jacob, and an advance
     notice of Isaac's death. In fact, Isaac lived another 12 years after Jacob's
     return.
        To the Jacob-Esau episode is appended a genealogy of Esau (chapter 36)
     in which the writer of Genesis summarily lists in characteristic fashion the
     generations of that part of the family that will fade out of the picture before
     the story of the chosen family is resumed.

DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "The greatest victories to the

2  church of Christ or to the individual Christian are not those that are gained
    by talent or education, by wealth or the favor of men. They are those
    victories that are gained in the audience chamber with God, when earnest,
    agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty arm of power."—Patriarchs and
    Prophets, p. 203.
      Read also Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 190-203 and S. D.A. Bible Com-
    mentary, comments on Genesis 29:31-35:29.

     SUMMARY: After many years of anxiety, distress, and character growth,
     Jacob concluded his pilgrimage where it had begun. The deceiver had
     become an overcomer who had discovered that God and His word can be
     trusted.

     APPLICATION:
     o When tempted to succumb to the burden of guilt and remorse, what
        lesson can I learn from Jacob's experiences at Bethel and Peniel?
     o Am I sustained in my daily conflicts by the assurance that heaven and
        earth would sooner pass away than the divine promises fail?
     o In what sense does Jacob's night of wrestling and anguish represent a
        trial through which God's people must pass before Jesus returns? (Com-
        pare Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 203.)
     o What can I learn from the concern Jacob had for the welfare of his
        children and the young among his flock?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 37:2 through 41:40.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "There is none greater in this house than I; neither

111 hath he kept back any thing from me but thee: because thou art
    his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
    God?" (Gen. 39:9).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Although cruelly treated by his brothers, harshly
repaid for years of dedicated service to Potiphar, and forgotten by one he
had sought to comfort, Joseph never lost faith in the God who "was
preparing him in the school of affliction for greater usefulness, and he did
not refuse the needful discipline."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 218.

 INTRODUCTION: Although chapters 37 through 50 continue the history
 of Jacob and his family (37:2) it is Joseph who predominates as the central
 figure in the narrative. Although special mention is made of Jacob, he
 remains in the background until his death (49:33). Special attention also is
 given to Reuben (37:21, 22; compare with 42:22, 37), Judah (37:26, 27;
38:1-30; 43:3-10; 44:16-34), and Simeon (42:24, 36; 43:23). However, the
 focus throughout these chapters rests on Joseph, the older son of Jacob's
 favorite wife, Rachel.
    In this lesson we examine Joseph's life, beginning with the reasons for
 his sale into captivity as a 17-year-old (37:2) and ending with his release 13
                                                                            83
    years later (41:46). At the time Joseph was sold into slavery his father Jacob
    was 108 years old, while Isaac his grandfather was 168. The narrative tells
    of three sets of double dreams in which the second pair (chapter 40) sets
    the stage for the third, and the third leads to the fulfillment of the first set
    of dreams. The accurate fulfillment of Joseph's interpretation of the cup-
    bearer's dream led the cupbearer to introduce Joseph to Pharaoh. Then
    the fulfillment of the prediction of the years of plenty followed by the years
    of famine, that was given in Pharaoh's dreams, led to Jacob and his sons
    coming to Egypt.
      However, cruel depths of servitude and imprisonment preceded the lofty
    heights that Joseph achieved in Pharaoh's palace. Joseph's faith in God, his
    unfailing patience when cruelty came in spite of impeccable integrity, and
    his readiness to accept divine discipline trustingly opened the way for the
    future prosperity and honor that came to Joseph and his family.


DAY I. DREAMS AND DEPORTATION (Gen. 37:2-36).

         1. Hated by His Brothers (verses 2-11).

    THINK IT THROUGH: What lay behind the jealousy and hatred that
    Jacob's sons demonstrated for Joseph? Was their enmity totally unjustified?

      2. Sold by His Brothers (verses 12-36).
      The hostility noted in verses 2 through 11 forms the background to the
    actions recorded in the remainder of the chapter. In search of new pastures,
    the sons of Jacob traveled more than 70 miles north from Hebron past
    Shechem to one of the best grazing areas of Palestine near Dothan. Jacob,
    remembering well the cruel massacre of the Shechemites (chapter 34),
    feared for the safety of his sons and sent Joseph to inquire into their welfare
    (verses 12-14).
       With unabated hatred, aggravated by Joseph's dreams and intensified by
    the favor shown in the gift of the special tunic (verse 23), Joseph's brothers
    decided to rid themselves permanently of the source of their irritation.

      How did the suggestion of Jacob's son, Reuben, modify their plot? Verses
    20-22.


      Callously disregarding their brother's piteous pleas for his life (Gen.
    42:21,22), the brothers settled down to a meal. Then they noticed a caravan
    of traders passing by on the nearby trade route linking Palestine and Egypt
    via Dothan.

      What incredible plan that Judah initiated did the brothers agree upon
    and why? Gen. 37:26-28.


      This is the first slave sale recorded in Scripture. Its cruelty exceeds that
    of most sales into slavery. Jacob's sons, ignoring the terror in their brother's
    84
    eyes, traded one of their own kin. Similar barbarity was endured by our
    Elder Brother centuries later when, betrayed by one of His brothers, He
    was sold unto death for the price of a slave.

      What can we learn from the additional way that the lack of Joseph's
    brothers' natural affection was manifested? Verses 29-35.


       Although Reuben was distraught over Joseph's disappearance, he chose
    to cooperate in the wicked plot to hide the deception. Because courage and
    cruelty seldom mix, Jacob's sons apparently sent someone else to deliver
    Joseph's tunic to their father (verse 32). The erstwhile deceiver was de-
    ceived once more as he looked upon the torn and bloody garment that he
    had given to his favorite son. Although Jacob's sons "had looked forward
    to this scene with dread, ... they were not prepared for the heart-rending
    anguish, the utter abandonment of grief, which they were compelled to
    witness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 212.

DAY IL JOSEPH IN POTIPHAR'S HOME AND IN PRISON (Gen. 39:1-23).

       1. From Slave to Chief Steward (verses 1-6).

      The caravan holding Joseph captive passed the hills where Jacob's tents
    stood. For a time the teenager "gave himself up to uncontrolled grief and
    terror."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 213. However, Joseph, remembering
    Jacob's stories about God's love and constancy shown to Abraham, Isaac,
    and himself, decided to trust the Lord and act as a citizen of the kingdom
    of heaven. With Joseph's descent into Egypt divine Providence prepared
    the way for the deliverance of Jacob's family and for the foreign domination
    that Abraham's children were to experience until the sin of the Amorites
    in Canaan had reached its full measure (Gen. 15:13-16).

       What kind of person was Potiphar? (Compare Gen. 39:1 with 37:36.)



        Potiphar, a name also found on Egyptian monuments, was a high court
    • official and chief of Pharaoh's bodyguard. The fact that Potiphar is said to
      be an Egyptian suggests that Joseph's abduction took place when a non-
      Egyptian dynasty ruled the region of the Nile. If the dynasty were Egyptian,
      there would be no point in mentioning that an officer was an Egyptian.

       How is Joseph's growing success in Potiphar's household indicated in
     verses 2 through 6, and to whom is it attributed?


        Repeatedly, Moses draws attention to the fact that the Lord was with
     Joseph (verses 2 and 3), that He gave him success, and blessed the Egyp-
     tian's household because of his Hebrew slave (verse 5).


                                                                                85
         2. Joseph's Temptation (Gen. 39:7-12).

       Rachel's son was as attractive as his mother had been (compare verse 6
    with Gen. 29:17), and his handsome appearance did not escape the notice
    of his master's wife. At the height of Joseph's success, Potiphar's wife
    sought to seduce the young man by exerting persistent pressure through
    flattery, daily advances, and finally an open attack.
                                                          •
       How did Joseph respond to the sudden strong and seductive advances of
    Potiphar's wife? Gen. 39:8-12.


DAY READ Genesis 38.

       What if a Reuben or a Judah had been in Joseph's place? Genesis 38
    interrupts the Joseph story in order to contrast the immorality of Joseph's
    betrayer, Judah, with the rectitude of the betrayed. Chapter 38 also helps
    us understand "that the sons of Jacob, forgetting the sacred vocation of
    their race, were in danger of perishing in the sins of Canaan. Had not God
    in mercy interposed to bring about the removal of the whole house of Jacob
    to Egypt, the chosen race might have succumbed to the corrupting influence
    of Canaanite customs. Thus, ch. 38 is an integral part of the early history of
    Israel."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 434.
       Joseph determined to preserve his purity and integrity regardless of the
    cost. His only safety lay in distancing himself from the source of temptation.

      What principle that Joseph expressed still helps preserve us from falling
    prey to temptation? Gen. 39:9.


      "Joseph's answer reveals the power of religious principle. He would not
    betray the confidence of his master on earth, and, whatever the conse-
    quences, he would be true to his Master in heaven. Under the inspecting
    eye of God and holy angels many take liberties of which they would not be
    guilty in the presence of their fellow men, but Joseph's first thought was of
    God. 'How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?' he
    said."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 217.

         3. Joseph Placed in Prison (Gen. 39:13-23).

      How were Joseph's faithful service and integrity rewarded? Verses 13-20.
    (Compare Ps. 105:18,19.)


       Her advances repeatedly rejected, the immoral infatuation of Joseph's
    temptress turned to hatred and scorn. Not only did she hold her husband
    responsible for the alleged assault but she also spoke derisively of Joseph
    as "the Hebrew slave" (verse 17). The fact that Potiphar spared his servant's
    life for a crime punishable by death may indicate that he questioned the
    accusation.
    86
       Instead of succumbing to abject despair and harboring bitterness to God
    and to the people who had wronged him for this renewed injustice, what
    attitude did Joseph display in the prison cell? Verses 21-23.


      It is significant that Joseph's trust in the Lord enabled him to make
    himself useful in prison. The fact that the Lord was with him, blessed him,
    and gave him success, first recorded in verses 2 through 6, is repeated in
    verses 21 through 23 and surrounds, like an envelope, the episode with
    Potiphar's wife. As Potiphar before, so now the prison warden entrusted
    his affairs to Joseph, knowing that success would attend his management.

DAY I11. THE CUPBEARER AND THE BAKER (Gen. 40:1-23).

       1. Dreams of Two Imprisoned Officials (verses 1-22).
       Both the baker and the cupbearer were high-ranking officials at Pha-
    raoh's court. (Compare Neh. 1:11.) They may have been accused of a plot
    to overthrow Pharaoh and for this reason had been placed in the custody of
    Potiphar, the commander of the royal bodyguard. (Compare verses 3 and 4
    with 39:1.) Potiphar placed them in the same prison where Joseph was
    held. Joseph had just been promoted to manager of the prison, but because
    the cases of these two "were still under investigation, and they themselves
    were high officers of the state, he charged Joseph to wait upon them and
    act as their attendant."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 442.

      What further light do verses 6 through 8 shed upon Joseph's character
    and disposition? (Compare also Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 218.)



    THINK IT THROUGH: Were I like Joseph innocently imprisoned, would I
    display the same kindly attitude and interest in the welfare of those I might
    be asked to serve?

      Upon hearing and interpreting the dream (verses 9-13), what request did
    Joseph offer and what reason for his petition did he present before the
    cupbearer? Verses 14, 15.


      Having heard Joseph's favorable interpretation of the cupbearer's dream,
    the baker recited his dream also and asked for an interpretation (verses 16-
    19). Three days later when the interpretations were shown to be accurate
    (verses 20-22) Joseph's words to the cupbearer "to lift up thine head" were
    fulfilled in the cupbearer's happy release (verses 13, 20; compare with
    2 Kings 25:27). But similar words used in interpreting the baker's dream
    meant tragic beheading for the baker (verses 19, 22).

      2. The Forgotten Hero (Gen. 40:23).

      In what way does Genesis 40:23 illustrate a common human failing?

                                                                              87
        The cupbearer's release not only must have raised Joseph's hopes for his
      own release but also must have strengthened his expectations of seeing the
      fulfillment of his own dreams. How devastating, then, must have been the
      realization, confirmed by the passing days, months, and years, that he had
      been forgotten.
        Misfortune seems to have dogged Joseph's footsteps, and questions
      about the leading or even the presence of God must have come often to his
      mind. How many promises made under unfavorable circumstances have
      been forgotten when situations have changed. Sadly, sometimes when
      people are promoted to positions of importance today they tend to forget
      their "humbler" friends and circumstances.


DAY IV. PHARAOH'S DREAMS OF COWS AND CORN (Gen. 41:1-40).

15}      1. Content of the Dreams (verses 1-24).
         This chapter introduces us to a typical Egyptian setting. We read of cows
      cooling off as they stand half submerged in the river. Reed grasses are
      mentioned. And Joseph shaves as he leaves prison (Semites are identifiable
      in Egyptian drawings because they wear beards). Because Egyptians re-
      garded the Nile as the source of life, the portrayal of lean cows coming up
      from the river must have presented a real problem.

        Read the dreams and note the reasons for Pharaoh's frustrations. Verses
      1-8.

        How did Joseph's interpretation of the dreams two years before in the
      prison set the stage for his introduction to Pharaoh? Verses 9-15.



        Why did Joseph give the testimony recorded in verse 16? (Compare also
      Gen. 40:8 and Dan. 2:26-28.)


           2. The Meaning of Pharaoh's Twin Dreams (Gen. 41:25-32).

        What interpretation did Joseph offer, and what did the repetition of the
      dream in another form to Pharaoh signify? Verses 25-32.



      THINK IT THROUGH: Was this predicted famine a divine judgment that
      was brought about as the result of sin and apostasy, or did God send it
      because He had some other specific purpose in mind?

DAY     3. Need for Action (Gen. 41:33-40).

171     "The interpretation was so reasonable and consistent, and the policy
      which it recommended was so sound and shrewd, that its correctness could
      not be doubted."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 221.

      88
  What led to Pharaoh's choice of Joseph to become his second in command?
Verses 37-40.


  "How was Joseph enabled to make such a record of firmness of character,
uprightness, and wisdom?—In his early years he had consulted duty rather
than inclination; and the integrity, the simple trust, the noble nature, of the
youth bore fruit in the deeds of the man. ... Faithful attention to duty in
every station, from the lowliest to the most exalted, had been training every
power for its highest service ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 222.

  What parallels can you discover between Joseph and Daniel? (Compare
Genesis 41 and Daniel 2.)



FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "From the dungeon Joseph was
exalted to be ruler over all the land of Egypt. It was a position of high
honor, yet it was beset with difficulty and peril. One cannot stand upon a
lofty height without danger. As the tempest leaves unharmed the lowly
flower of the valley, while it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop,
so those who have maintained their integrity in humble life may be dragged
down to the pit by the temptations that assail worldly success and honor.
But Joseph's character bore the test alike of adversity and prosperity. The
same fidelity to God was manifest when he stood in the palace of the
Pharaohs as when in a prisoner's cell. He was still a stranger in a heathen
land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers of God; but he fully
believed that the divine hand had directed his steps, and in constant reliance
upon God he faithfully discharged the duties of his position."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 222.

Commentary, comments on Genesis 37 through 41.

SUMMARY: Joseph's early years were full of trials, indignities, ingrati-
tude, and cruel treatment. Yet, when troubled by doubt and temptation,
Joseph took refuge in the love and care of the God of his forefathers. Faith
sustained him in his darkest moments, and the resolve to be faithful and
patient opened the way for future honor. In the next lesson we will discover
more fully the reasons why God permitted the experience recorded in the
chapters we studied this week.

APPLICATION: Few of us will ever be called upon to suffer that which
Joseph endured. When tempted to succumb to doubt and despondency let
us recall Joseph's faith and courage. When we find it difficult to see God's
smiling face through the mists of problems, let us remember that God is
"faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but
will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
bear it" (1 Cor. 10:13). Joseph's resolve to be faithful to the little duties and
to remain pure at all costs should be reflected in our grateful response to
our greater Brother who was sold by one of His own for the price of a slave.

                                                                              89

INTRODUCTION: The predicted years of plenty and famine (Genesis 41)
set the stage for both the travels of Joseph's brothers (chapters 42 to 45)
and their final migration to Egypt (chapters 46 through 50). To the eyes of
faith their journeys are not merely the travels of a hungry, extended family
but the fulfillment of God's plan announced to Abraham: "Know of a
surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall
serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years. ... But in the
fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the
Amorites is not yet full" (Gen. 15:13-16).
  The chapters we study this week contain many spiritual jewels. They
demonstrate the change in the hearts of Joseph's brothers as well as Joseph's
own ability to perceive providential guidance behind what was happening.

      As we close the book of Genesis, we hear again the pilgrim chorus on the
      deathbed of the fathers as they close their eyes in the hope of the Promised
      Land.

DAY   I. JOSEPH AS GOVERNOR MEETS HIS BROTHERS (Gen. 41:41-
         42:38).

        Joseph was 30 years of age when Pharaoh invested him with the insignia
      of high office (41:41-44). He was given an Egyptian name and the daughter
      of the priest of the sun temple of On for a wife.

        1. Joseph Prepares Egypt for the Coming Famine (41:46-42:5).

        What measures did the former Hebrew slave take during the years of
      plenty? Gen. 41:46-49, 53-57.



        Before the years of plenty ended how did God aid Joseph in forgetting the
      hardship of his former years? Verses 50-52.


        The names Joseph gave his two sons reflect his own experience. The
      name Manasseh is related to the Hebrew verb "make to forget" and reflects
      the thought that his firstborn boy helped his father to forget the cruel past.
      Ephraim, the second son's name, seems to mean "twice fruitful" and
      represented Joseph's joyous feelings and the opening of a new chapter in
      his life.

         How did God bring members of Joseph's family to Egypt? Gen. 42:1-5.



         2. Surprise Encounter (Gen. 42:6-38).
         More than 20 years after the brothers' cruel betrayal of Joseph they were
       unable to recognize the thoroughly Egyptianized adult brother who ad-
       dressed them in the Egyptian language (verses 6-9).

         What ruse did Joseph apply in order to elicit information about his family?
       Verses 7-17; 43:7.


         While Joseph's firmness evidenced in chapters 42 through 44 may give
       the impression of vengefulness, several hints indicate that he was far from
       being vengeful. He considered the desperate need of the starving house-
       hold and permitted his brothers to return with both their food and purchase
       money (42:25). On several occasions Joseph was unable to contain his
       emotions and burst into tears (42:24; 43:30). (Compare 45:1.) His threats
       were followed by leniency (42:6-19; 44:9, 10), and he did not tantalize his

                                                                                  91
      r rtemor airo atimi                                         &stun    fill
      brothers at the feast as they had done to him years before when he was
      imprisoned in a cistern. (Compare 37:24, 25 with 43:31-34.)

       How did Joseph finally propose to verify the truthfulness of their state-
      ments about their aged father and younger brother? Gen. 42:16, 19, 20, 24.



        3. The Brothers' Second Journey to Egypt (Gen. 43:1-34).
        As the famine in Canaan intensified, supplies became exhausted and
      another journey to Egypt became imperative (verses 1, 2).

        What do Judah's negotiations with his father tell us about the former
      betrayer of Joseph? Verses 3-9. (Compare with 37:26, 27.)


        As the men set out with choice gifts, the former purchase money, and
      Benjamin, the patriarch prayed for the successful mission of his sons
      (verses 11-14). Upon seeing Benjamin, Joseph invited the brothers to his
      home for a feast and released Simeon (verses 15-31).

         What was Joseph's intent when he provided Benjamin with extra tokens
      of favor? Verse 34.


         Egyptian exclusiveness at meals prevented Egyptians from associating
      freely with foreigners. This custom provided Joseph with the unique op-
      portunity of observing his brothers.
DAY H. JOSEPH'S ULTIMATE TEST OF HIS BROTHERS AND THE REV-
         ELATION OF HIS IDENTITY (Gen. 44:1-45:25).
151
       While the brothers' lack of resentment to Benjamin at the feast (43:33,
    34) manifested that they had undergone a change of heart, Joseph decided
    to apply one final and clinching test that would reveal incontrovertably
    whether their love for their father and brother would outweigh personal
    consideration. The use of Joseph's silver cup outlined in chapter 44 essen-
    tially presented a situation that could have issued in another betrayal.

       1. The Silver Cup (Gen. 44:1-17).

     REVIEW the preparations Joseph made for his final test. Verses 1-6.

       What characterized the way Jacob's sons responded to the steward's
     charge? Verses 7-9.


       Although convinced of their absolute innocence, their answer was im-
     petuous. After finding the purchase money in their sacks on the previous
     return from Egypt (42:27, 28, 35) they should have been more judicious.
     Foolishly, they committed the "guilty" one to death.

   How did the steward modify the brothers' offer, and what was the result
of the search? Verses 10-12. Also note Joseph's reactions (verses 14-17).


  Both the steward and Joseph demonstrated leniency. Neither was pre-
pared to take advantage of the brothers' rash words and to punish the
innocent with the guilty.

  2. The Test Passed (Gen. 44:18-34).

  After politely reiterating the history of their dealings with the ruler (verses
18-29), what noble offer did Judah make? Verses 30-34.


   The agonizing decision had been made. All ten were prepared to sacrifice
their liberty (verses 13, 16). However, Judah, who had suggested that
Joseph be sold to the Ishmaelites, determined to surrender his liberty and
life for the freedom of his brothers. Joseph could expect no more. Judah
offered, "Let your servant abide instead of the lad."

  3. Joseph Reveals His Identity (Gen. 45:1-25).

  How do verses 1 through 4 portray the amazement of the startled brothers
as Joseph made himself known to them?



   What interpretation of his past experience explains Joseph's complete lack
of resentment, bitterness, and revenge? Verses 5-8.


  These verses sum up one of the most significant lessons in the book of
Genesis and in the Scriptures as a whole. In the same way that Joseph did,
the believer today may detect two aspects to every event. Joseph explained,
"You sold me ... God sent me." Joseph did not lightly dismiss his past
sufferings and the questions his trials must have engendered about God.
Yet, he saw a significance in these events that was more important; namely,
the overruling plan of God. In and through the play and counterplay of
human affairs he discerned God's control of history and His care for
individual lives (verses 5, 7-9).

  As the famine was to last for another five years, what request did Joseph
present to his brothers? In what way would this present an additional test to
them? Verses 9-25.


   Imagine the return of Jacob's sons. Their carts and donkeys were laden
 with provisions, food, clothing, and the best that famine-stricken Egypt
 could offer. The brothers had several days to formulate the confession they
 would have to make to their father.

                                                                               93

DAY HI. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ENTER EGYPT (Gen. 45:26-49:28).

        1. Jacob's Family 'Davels to Egypt (Gen. 45:26-46:27).

      After his decision to leave Hebron for Egypt, what did Jacob do on the
     way? Gen. 45:26-46:7.


       Beginning the two- to three-hundred-mile journey, Jacob stopped at
     Beersheba where his grandfather, Abraham, had worshiped and his father
     had erected an altar subsequent to a divine repetition of the covenant
     blessings (21:33; 26:23-25). As Jacob sacrificed and renewed his covenant
     commitment to the God of his father Isaac, the Lord reassured him of the
     covenant promises made at Bethel, with the added detail that Jacob's family
     would grow into nationhood in Egypt.

       After Jacob and his family reached Egypt a glad reunion took place. Gen.
     46:29,30. What suggestion did Joseph make to his brothers and why? Verses
     31-34.



       2. Joseph's Family Before Pharaoh (Gen. 47:1-12).

        What did Joseph's brothers say that indicates that they only expected to
     stay in Egypt temporarily? Verse 4. (Compare Heb. 11:13-16.)



     THINK IT THROUGH: What advantages did the isolation in the land of
     Goshen afford God's people, and what implications, if any, does this have
     for God's people today?

        While Joseph attended to the affairs of his own relatives (Gen. 47:12) and
     to those of a hungry nation (verses 13-26), what significant note about the
     growth of the family of Israel is recorded? Verse 27. (Compare with 46:3.)



DAY     3. The Patriarchal Blessings (Gen. 47:28-49:28).
FrZ]    After spending 17 happy years in Egypt surrounded by those dearest to
Wi him, Jacob felt the hour of death approaching. He called his sons to him for
     a last farewell.

       How did the dying patriarch express his trust in God's promises concern-
     ing the land of Canaan? Gen. 47:29-31. (Compare with Heb. 11:13-16.)



        What was behind Jacob's adoption of Joseph's two sons as tribal heads
     along with the rest of his sons? Gen. 48:5,6.

     first-born, so far as the inheritance was concerned."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
     mentary,vol.1, p. 476.

       What was so strange about the order in which Jacob blessed Joseph's sons,
     and what did the order signify? Verses 12-20. (Compare with Heb. 11:21.)



     READ Genesis 48:21, 22.


     REVIEW Jacob's testamentary and prophetic blessings upon his sons in
     Genesis 49:1-28.

       As divine inspiration rested upon the dying patriarch, the future of his
     descendants unfolded before him. The power of God constrained him to
     declare the truth, however painful to himself. Jacob withdrew the rights of
     the firstborn from Reuben and uttered a curse for the crime of Levi and
     Simeon. Levi's later history illustrates how a curse can be turned into a
     blessing.
        God's Word ever reveals both the virtues and vices, the failures and
     successes of men. The pages of Scripture are realistic and conceal neither
     the faults of its most revered and admired heroes nor their victories attained
     through the power of God. God's men and women are depicted as "subject
     to like passions as we are" (James 5:17). (See also Acts 14:15.)

DAY IV. DEATH OF JACOB AND JOSEPH (Gen. 49:29-50:26).

rg
i       1. Jacob's Death and Burial (49:29-50:21).

        Where did Jacob request to be buried? Gen. 49:29-33.


       After the period of embalming and mourning had ended, Joseph, his
     brothers, and a large retinue of Egyptian officials escorted Jacob's body to
     Canaan where he was buried in the cave of Machpelah with Abraham,
     Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah. (See Gen. 50:1-14.)

       How did Joseph respond to the fear and distrust displayed by his brothers
     after Jacob's death? Gen. 50:15-21.


       Joseph was reduced to tears because of his brothers' attitude. His kind
     reply contains some of the most admirable aspects of biblical faith. Joseph
     determined to trust God to right all wrongs and repeated his conviction
     that divine providence had overruled their human malice (verse 20). (Com-
     pare with 45:5-8.) Joseph repaid them with forgiveness and practical love,
     providing not only of his means but also pledging to personally care for
     them.

                                                                                 95

          2. Joseph's Death (Gen. 50:22-26).

          How did Joseph emulate his father's faith? Verses 24, 25.


       Fifty-four years after Jacob's death Joseph died at 110 years of age. On
     his deathbed he placed his brothers under oath to bury him in Canaan when
     God should lead them out of Egypt. (Compare 48:21; 49:29-32.) Joseph
     died with hope and faith in God's promises. Canaan was his ultimate home,
     and his coffin was a constant reminder to the remaining Hebrews of their
     real homeland. The patriarchal history comes to an end with the patriarch's
     hopes fixed on the promised home. The next event would be a most
     marvelous display of God's grace as He redeemed His people, and through
     Exodus and conquest, led them to Canaan.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Prophets,
    pages 224-240; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 41:41-
tE  50:26.

     SUMMARY: In this week's lesson we studied Joseph's life from his install-
     ment as governor to the preparations for his interment in a grave in Canaan.
     We observed the changes God had brought about in the life of one of His
     loyal and patient servants and noted the Lord's overruling power.
       This quarter we have studied not only our beginnings but our belonging
     as revealed in the book of Genesis. Created in the image of God in a perfect
     world, we find ourselves in a world that has been sin-damaged to the extent
     that we have come to expect the worst in ourselves and in others. But God
     has intervened in our world and in our individual lives. We belong to Him
     not only by right of creation but because He has paid the price of our
     redemption and has covenanted with those who are willing to accept what
     He has done to restore all that was lost to sin. More than that, He is at work
     in our lives to help us live as He has made it possible for His sons and
     daughters to live, even in a sinful world. As did Joseph, we can have
     confidence that whatever comes to us comes through the hand of a God
     who loves us and who will see that all things work together for the good of
     those whom He loves so much.

     APPLICATION:
     o While I may not have to suffer as Joseph did, what can I learn from his
       experience about how to respond to malice and cruelty?
     o Am I able to detect two aspects in every experience and identify with
       Joseph in his conviction that divine providence cannot be frustrated by
       human malice?
     o Has my heart been mellowed by the love of Christ to the degree that I
       can do more than forgive those who have wronged me?
     o Do I add practical love to my forgiveness, a love that gives of my means
       and also of myself?

iously there had been some hesitation to provide this information, as the lessons reflect the
nput of the worldwide Sabbath School Lesson Committee and do not solely or necessarily
epresent the intent of the writer. The decision came too late to put this quarter's biographical
