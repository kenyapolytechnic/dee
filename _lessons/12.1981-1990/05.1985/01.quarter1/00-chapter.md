             Editor's Foreword
   God did not lower His standards to meet our needs, He lowered Him-
 self. "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14) in order
to meet us where we are and to demonstrate the possibility of our being
able to live as God wants us to live.
   The lessons this quarter focus on how Christ met the needs of those to
whom He ministered while He was on earth. Our study will provide us
many insights into how He desires to meet our needs today.
   This quarterly introduces the Bible Book curriculum that will be pre-
sented in a new study format. The new curriculum will take us through
every book of the Bible in the next ten years and will concentrate on
showing how each Bible book meets current human needs. The new for-
mat is designed to foster deeper Bible study. You may elect not to read all
the passages listed or not to do all the exercises outlined in a lesson. But
they are provided for the benefit of those who wish to do more in-depth
study.
   The old adage, "we are what we eat," suggests one reason why we
need more in-depth Bible study. It applies not only to the physical dimen-
sion of life but also to the spiritual. If our spiritual diet is impoverished
and we try to feed our souls on the husks of the commonplace and the
uninspired, our minds and souls will become dwarfed and cheapened.
"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). All of us need regular daily Bible
study as much as, if not more than, we need regular meals.
   Another good reason for engaging in daily Bible study is suggested by
Ellen White: "We need to search the Scriptures daily, that we may know
the way of the Lord, and that we be not deceived by religious fallacies.
The world is full of false theories and seductive spiritualistic ideas, which
tend to destroy clear spiritual perception, and to lead away from truth and
holiness. Especially at this time do we need to heed the warning, 'Let no
man deceive you with vain words' (Eph. 5:6)."—Selected Messages, bk.
1, p. 170.
   The tragedy today is that, even among those Christians who without
question receive the Bible "as it is in truth, the Word of God" (1 Thess.
2:13), so many neglect to follow the example of the Thessalonians and
give the Word of God a chance to work effectually in them.
   Undoubtedly, it will take a little while to get used to this new format.
But we believe that these lessons, which are designed to lead into deeper
Bible study, will help the Bible come alive for you in a way that it never
has before. God's Word brings us words to live by and grow by if we will
take the time to study them and apply what we learn from them in a prac-
tical way.
INTRODUCTION TO THE GOSPEL OF MARK

HOW Or11111[157 MEETS
HUMAN NEEDS
  Early Christian tradition holds that this shortest of the four
Gospels is the work of John Mark who ministered to Paul and
Barnabas. However, it sometimes is spoken of as the Gospel
according to Peter, as Mark may be the "Marcus my son" of
1 Peter 5:13—a spiritual son of the leading apostle. Tradition
indicates that Mark recorded Peter's sermons. This Gospel
seems to have been written for Gentiles rather than Jews. Pos-
sibly it was for the special benefit of the church at Rome,
which Mark knew. This action-filled Gospel tells more about
what Jesus did in becoming our Saviour than about what He
taught in presenting the words of eternal life. Not only is it a
Gospel—one of four accounts of the good news revealed in
the life of Jesus—but it represents the promised One whose life
and actions confirmed the predictions of the prophets con-
cerning Him. This quarter's lessons will focus particularly on
how Jesus met and meets our human needs.

  INTRODUCTION: The Gospel according to Mark introduces us to a
divine Saviour who is able to take sinners from the kingdoms of this
world and make them citizens of the kingdom of God. In his Gospel,
Mark establishes Christ's authority for proclaiming the kingdom by
pointing to the power that He revealed in meeting the needs of mankind—
one by one, or in groups. As the memory text implies, Mark adds the
powerful authority of Old Testament prophecy fulfilled when Jesus began
His ministry.
  Passing by the quiet years of our Lord's childhood and youth, Mark
plunges his readers into the dynamic action of John the Baptist at the
Jordan. His mission and message lead to the introduction and baptism of
Jesus. After the baptism the unction of the Holy Spirit led Christ into the
wilderness of temptation where He met, in essence, every struggle of ev-
ery human heart—and conquered, almost dying in the process.
  With this initial triumph behind Him, even the fact of John's imprison-
ment did not deter Jesus from pushing ahead into His ministry. "The
right time" had come (Mark. 1:15, TEV), and the Carpenter turned
Teacher called four fishermen to follow Him.
   But the defeated devil did not retire from the conflict for long. A des-
perately needy possessed man and the Sabbath day provided the focal
point for a new encounter. Christ's victory in the synagogue shook the
Galilean worshipers as much as the departing devil had shaken his victim.

                                                                            9
     I-gloTill Onim Tam                                                              Timm=
       Already more at home with His followers than with His unsympathetic
     brothers and sisters, the Lord healed Peter's mother-in-law, who then
     ministered to the little band. After sunset the crowds gathered, bringing
     their sick and possessed. Jesus healed the sick, released people from
     devil possession, and silenced the demons that wanted to identify the
     Healer too soon for the good of the Lord's work.
       This one short lesson thrusts us into Christ's activity that did not cease
     until He rested briefly in Joseph's new tomb. From the grave He rose to
     His Father and ours. That is the compass of this quarter's lessons—Jesus
     in action. And all that He did, He did for us. Mark helps us understand
     how Jesus meets our needs today. In these lessons we meet One who can
     meet our every need.

DAY I. WILDERNESS VOICE (Mark 1:1-11). Before responding to the study

12        questions be sure to read each Scripture portion carefully.

        1. The Ministry of John (verses 1-8).
        To introduce the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Mark
     reaches back briefly to the Old Testament prophets to authenticate the
     strange appearance of John the Baptist in the wilderness region of the
     Jordan.

       In verse 2 Mark quotes Malachi 3:1, and, in verse 3, he quotes what ap-
     pears to be his basis for doing so. (Compare with Matthew 3:3.)

        On the map note where the people came from to hear John. (See Mark
     1:5.) What does the location of John's ministry and the phrase "in the river
     of Jordan" indicate about the mode of baptism?


     10
       Lesson                                           Wu Um GU MEELER
        In what respect did the preaching of John parallel the preaching of Jesus
      as the good news of the kingdom was introduced? (Compare Mark 1:4, 5
      with verse 15.)


        Consider how basic Jesus' and John's messages were and are to the
      needs of men and women such as ourselves.

      ILLUMINATION ON VERSES 6, 7: "John's singular appearance carried
      the minds of his hearers back to the ancient seers. In his manner and
      dress he resembled the prophet Elijah. With the spirit and power of Elijah
      he denounced the national corruption, and rebuked the prevailing sins.
      His words were plain, pointed, and convincing. Many believed him to be
      one of the prophets risen from the dead. The whole nation was stirred.
      Multitudes flocked to the wilderness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 104.

DAY     2. The Baptism of Jesus (verses 9-11).
         A favorite word that Mark uses, which perhaps reflects Peter's way of
      telling what happened to our Lord, is the word straightway (immedi-
      ately). It appears about 40 times in this short Gospel.

        What might Mark's use of a favorite word suggest concerning the way
      inspiration operates? Can inspired writers select their own words?



         How would you apply the above example of the human side of the inspira-
      tional process to this statement? "It is not the words of the Bible that are
      inspired, but the men that were inspired. . . . The divine mind and will is
      combined with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are
      the word of God."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 21.



         In the light of the fact that the Spirit of God played such an important
      part at the baptism of Jesus, how might we give the Holy Spirit due recogni-
      tion when we are baptized with water? What spiritual preparation for bap-
      tism is implied in Mark 1:5, 7, 9-11?



      11. TEMPTATION (Mark 1:12, 13). Read these verses before proceeding.

        How many weeks might be well spent in study of the temptations of
      Jesus in the wilderness! But Mark gives only passing notice to Christ's
      temptation compared with the accounts written by Matthew and Luke.
      He omits many details of the temptation but emphasizes the points that
      follow:
        1. The Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.

        5. Angels ministered to His needs (at the end of the 40 days, Matt.
           4:11).
        Mark adds one fact not found in the other Gospel accounts—the pres-
     ence of wild animals in this deserted place (verse 13).

       What would we have to do to be as directly under the Holy Spirit's lead-
     ing as was our Lord?



DAY I11. EARLY MINISTRY (Mark 1:14-34). Read these verses before pro-
         ceeding.

       1. Beginning in Galilee (verses 14, 15).
       What enormous strength and comfort are packed into these two verses!
     In capsule form they represent the entire Gospel of Mark. After John was
     imprisoned Jesus went to Galilee to labor.

       What explanations can you offer for the seeming abandonment of John
     by Jesus? (Compare Luke 7:17-35.)


       "The Saviour's words, 'Blessed is he, whosoever shall find none occa-
     sion of stumbling in Me,' were a gentle reproof to John. It was not lost
     upon him. Understanding more clearly now the nature of Christ's mis-
     sion, he yielded himself to God for life or for death, as should best serve
     the interests of the cause he loved.
       "After the messengers had departed, Jesus spoke to the people con-
     cerning John. The Saviour's heart went out in sympathy to the faithful
     witness now buried in Herod's dungeon. He would not leave the people
     to conclude that God had forsaken John, or that his faith had failed in the
     day of trial."—The Desire of Ages, p. 218.

       What do the words "the time is fulfilled" (Mark 1:15) suggest as you
     compare them with such scriptures as Matthew 3:2; Galatians 4:4; and
     Ephesians 1:10?



       What prophetic "time" fulfillment formed part of the basis for the au-
     thority that people sensed in the preaching and teaching of Jesus? (See Dan.
     9:24-27; Luke 3:15; The Desire of Ages, p. 233.)



DAY2. The Call of the Fishermen (Mark 1:16-20).
      If Peter was the prime source of Mark's record of the gospel events, we
   can imagine how often the writer may have heard the particular account
   in these verses. Do not all of us tend to go back to our first encounter with

     12
       Iloanal 0                                         Ulip              wome
      the Lord when we want others to know of His preciousness to us? Per-
      haps this was Peter's "Damascus road" experience.
        Interesting, is it not? A carpenter calling fishermen to follow Him—but
      not His vocation. They were not to give up fishing, but were to catch
      people instead of fish.

        In the light of Mark's brief presentation of the similarity in the messages
      of John the Baptist and Jesus (1:4, 5, 14, 15), what net would these new
      "fishermen" use to "catch" people?


        "The deeper lesson which the miracle [of the great catch of fish] con-
      veyed for the disciples is a lesson for us also,—that He whose word could
      gather the fishes from the sea could also impress human hearts, and draw
      them by the cords of His love, so that His servants might become 'fishers
      of men.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 249.

        3. Demon Challenge in the Synagogue (verses 21-28).
         When our Lord vanquished the adversary during the wilderness temp-
      tations, it might be assumed that His defeated foe would cease his at-
      tacks. But with the challenge in the synagogue on the Sabbath day, the
      enemy gave further evidence that he determined to challenge Christ at
      every opportunity.

         Consider what it was about the teaching of Jesus that gave it "authority"
      (verse 22; compare Matt. 7:29). You might write several possibilities below
      to share at class time:




DAY     Notice the emphasis that Mark gives in this chapter to Christ's power
      over demons. (See verses 23-27, 32, 34, 39.)
  J
  P

        What bearing would Christ's power over the demon at Capernaum have
      upon the authority of His preaching? Verses 27, 28.



         4. Home and Public Ministry (verses 29-34).
         There is much to consider in the retirement of Jesus and His small and
      not-yet-permanent group of disciples to the home of Simon Peter and An-
      drew on the Sabbath afternoon. Perhaps this already was one of Christ's
      homes-away-from-home.
         But one of the hostesses was not carrying out her usual acts of hospital-
      ity. Did Jesus miss her? Did He inquire about her?
         When someone told Him of her condition He moved to her bedside,

                                                                                  13
    I      glum Olob &cam                                          Um= 0
    took her by the hand, and raised her up. And "straightway" the fever
    that would normally be slow to subside, and would leave a person weak-
    ened, left.her. Instead of taking the usual rest necessary for recovery she
    was up and ready to serve again.

    THINK IT THROUGH: What sickness, fevers, tensions, and problems are
    there in your house that need the hand of Jesus?

       The word of Christ's miracle spread from the synagogue that morning.
    "No wonder that at sunset, when the Sabbath was over, and it was lawful
    to do so, the multitude sought out the sick and maimed among their kin-
    dred and companions, and the miserable demoniacs; brought them to the
    house of Simon, where Jesus was staying; and entreated the compassion
    and the succour of the Prophet of Nazareth."—The Pulpit Commentary,
    vol. 16, p. 22. (1950 ed.)
       Capernaum had never before witnessed a day like this. (See The Desire
    of Ages, p. 259, 260.) Jesus ministered far into the night until every suf-
    ferer who had come to Him for help had been relieved.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Reread Mark 1:1-34.

      It is difficult to find any source that can compare with the beauty, bal-
    ance, and spiritual application to be found in The Desire of Ages, pages
    97-139, 244-261. You should read this entire section; but, for those who
    may not have this book available, here are two choice selections:
      "John found in the wilderness his school and his sanctuary. Like Mo-
    ses amid the mountains of Midian, he was shut in by God's presence, and
    surrounded by the evidences of His power. It was not his lot to dwell, as
    did Israel's great leader, amid the solemn majesty of the mountain soli-
    tudes; but before him were the heights of Moab, beyond Jordan, speaking
    of Him who had set fast the mountains, and girded them with strength.
    The gloomy and terrible aspect of nature in his wilderness home vividly
    pictured the condition of Israel. The fruitful vineyard of the Lord had
    become a desolate waste. But above the desert the heavens bent bright
    and beautiful. The clouds that gathered, dark with tempest, were arched
    by the rainbow of promise. So above Israel's degradation shone the
    promised glory of the Messiah's reign. The clouds of wrath were spanned
    by the rainbow of His covenant-mercy. . . .
      "With awed yet exultant spirit he searched in the prophetic scrolls the
    revelations of the Messiah's coming,—the promised seed that should
    bruise the serpent's head; Shiloh, 'the peace giver,' who was to appear
    before a king should cease to reign on David's throne. Now the time had
    come. A Roman ruler sat in the palace upon Mount Zion. By the sure
    word of the Lord, already the Christ was born.
      "Isaiah's rapt portrayals of the Messiah's glory were his study by day
    and by night,—the Branch from the root of Jesse; a King to reign in righ-
    teousness, judging 'with equity for the meek of the earth;' a covert from
    the tempest; . . . the shadow of a great rock in a weary land;' Israel no
    longer to be termed 'Forsaken,' nor her land 'Desolate,' but to be called
    of the Lord, 'My Delight,' and her land 'Beulah.' Isa. 11:4; 32:2; 62:4,

margin. The heart of the lonely exile was filled with the glorious vision.
    "He looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was forgotten. He
beheld the majesty of holiness, and felt himself to be inefficient and un-
worthy. He was ready to go forth as Heaven's messenger, unawed by the
human, because he had looked upon the Divine. He could stand erect and
fearless in the presence of earthly monarchs, because he had bowed low
before the King of kings."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 102, 103.
    "Night was the only favorable time for fishing with nets in the clear
waters of the lake. After toiling all night without success, it seemed hope-
less to cast the net by day; but Jesus had given the command, and love for
their Master moved the disciples to obey. Simon and his brother together
let down the net. As they attempted to draw it in, so great was the quan-
tity of fish enclosed that it began to break. They were obliged to summon
James and John to their aid. When the catch was secured, both the boats
were so heavily laden that they were in danger of sinking.
    "But Peter was unmindful now of boats or lading. This miracle, above
any other he had ever witnessed, was to him a manifestation of divine
power. In Jesus he saw One who held all nature under His control. The
presence of divinity revealed his own unholiness. Love for his Master,
shame for his own unbelief, gratitude for the condescension of Christ,
above all, the sense of his uncleanness in the presence of infinite purity,
overwhelmed him. While his companions were securing the contents of
the net, Peter fell at the Saviour's feet, exclaiming, 'Depart from me; for
I am a sinful man, 0 Lord.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 246.

SUMMARY: Mark's initial verses have plunged us quickly and deeply
into the heart of the ministry of Jesus. Jesus already has been revealed as
the prime agent of the good news of salvation from sin and from its tragic
effects upon the human family.

APPLICATION: We need to recognize the unity of the gospel message in
several respects. As God's means of salvation it has been one and the
same since the first sin in Eden. It has been more fully developed as time
has moved along, but the essence of the gospel remains—repentance and
the good news that the sinless Son of God, the Son of man, lived our life,
died our death, and rose as our triumph. By trusting dependence upon
Him and turning away from our sins we become citizens of the kingdom
of grace now and transformed candidates for the kingdom of glory when it
comes.
   This quarter's study concentrates on how Jesus met human needs. One
of Jesus' first acts recorded in this Gospel was to recognize the human
need for worthy goals. He challenged two disciples to raise their expecta-
tions—to become fishers of men rather than fish.
   How was the focus of your life changed when Christ called you? Did it
include an enlarged challenge?

Controversy and Calling
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 1:35 to 3:19.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They
    that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I
1   am come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance" (Mark
    2:17).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Belief in and practice of truth through Jesus
Christ bring healing of body and soul—but they also bring controversy
and persecution.

INTRODUCTION: Something of a pattern arises in Christ's ministry. Ca-
pernaum became one of the pivotal points of His ministry, probably be-
cause of its openness to something new. Located strategically on the
northwest shore of Galilee, it came to be known as the Lord's own city.
He visited it frequently.
   But our Lord did not confine Himself to Capernaum. There were other
cities and the general area of Galilee spreading from the Sea of Galilee to
the Phoenician coast of the Great Sea (or Mediterranean). "So he trav-
eled all over Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and driving out de-
mons" (Mark 1:39, TEV). This was the first of the missionary journeys
through Galilee.
   Obviously Jesus continued to preach in Galilee the same good news
that He first introduced when He opened His ministry there following the
imprisonment of John the Baptist. (See Mark 1:14, 15.)
   The action-packed Gospel according to Mark deals with issues as they
arose over something Jesus or His disciples did. This lesson takes up the
healing of a man with leprosy, a victim of what seems to be the most

16
                                                   allitarigto
    dreaded disease of Bible times; the healing of a paralytic brought to Jesus
    by friends and lowered into His presence through a broken-up flat roof;
    the call of a hated tax collector to be an apostle; an issue over the differ-
    ences between the fasting patterns of the followers of John and the fol-
    lowers of the Lord; the second Sabbath debate—this time over a few
    handfuls of grain plucked in harmony with Old Testament principles but
    not with the Pharisaic interpretation of the law; another Sabbath healing
    in the synagogue (compare Mark 1:21-28 with 3:1-6); problems of crowds
    too big to handle at evangelistic meetings; and the choosing of twelve
    apostles whom Mark mentions by name.
       Surely there must be something for everyone in this series of real hap-
    penings that took place during the ministry of the Messiah. Surely Christ,
    the Sent of God, can meet the needs of "those who are sent" (which is
    the literal meaning of apostle) and likewise of each of those to whom we
    are sent. The underlying question is this: Are we really sent? and do we
    have the authority and power of the Sender resting upon us?

DAY I. FIRST MISSIONARY JOURNEY (Mark 1:35-45). Read these verses
       before proceeding.

      1. Preaching in Galilee (verses 35-39).
      Through His last-day messenger God has instructed His people about
    the benefit of regular and adequate sleep (see Education, p. 205), but our
    Lord seemed to lose a lot of it. At the door of Peter's home the crowds
    kept the Healer of Israel working far into the night. And yet "very early
    the next morning, long before daylight" (verse 35, TEV), Jesus was up
    and gone from the house. Was He violating health principles? Where did
    He obtain the necessary strength and energy? (See The Ministry of Heal-
    ing, p. 115; The Desire of Ages, pp. 362, 363.)

      To what extent did the Son of God actually need to pray? What difference
    does it make as to where we pray? (See verse 35.)


      It is deeply moving to think of the significance of Peter's words to Je-
    sus: "Everyone is looking for you" (verse 37, TEV). Would it not be
    wonderful if the same could be said of God's people today?

    NOTE: We must be careful to avoid anything like the cruel dilemma that
    Jewish tradition inflicted upon the sick. Sickness was thought to be God's
    punishment for the sick person's sin or for the sins of his or her ancestors.
    This grievous mistake was rebuked by Jesus and should lead us to be
    careful about our attitude toward those who are sick or have physical and
    mental health problems today.

       2. Healing a Man with Leprosy (verses 40-45).
       The dreaded disease called "leprosy" in the New Testament probably
     was used in a general sense to include diseases other than what medical
     science knows today as leprosy. But the dreadful scourge of leprosy
     drove its sufferers to find the Great Healer. In Mark 1:40-45 the Lord

                                                                               17
       COQ ai] &Mu                                                     Gamin g
      instructed the man He healed to be sure to present himself as soon as
      possible to the priest for the Mosaic examination of one claiming to be
      healed of leprosy. (See verses 43, 44 and Lev. 14:1-4.) Only by doing so
      could he expect an impartial judgment. Because of their prejudice, the
      priests might refuse to certify the healing if they learned beforehand that
      Jesus had healed him.

        How do you account for some whom the Lord healed falling to comply
      with His orders for their protection and the greater effectiveness of His own
      mission? (See verse 45.)



DAY 11. MINISTRY IN AND NEAR CAPERNAUM (Mark 2:1 to 3:19). Read
        these verses before proceeding.

        1. Healing the Paralytic (Mark 2:1-12).
        "The house" was Peter's home in Capernaum—the same place at
      which "all the city" had gathered when Jesus was last there. (See Mark
      1:29, 33.) In order to savor something of the deep significance of this mir-
      acle, attempt to answer the following questions, then enlarge the scope of
      your answers by reading The Desire of Ages, pages 262-271, "Thou
      Canst Make Me Clean."

        1. See what you can fmd out about biblical houses in order to understand
      better how crowded the situation was when the paralytic arrived. Verses
      1-4.



        2. Whose suggestion was it to break up someone else's roof? How could
      the Lord condone such an act? Verses 4, 5.



         3. What was behind Jesus' decision to give assurance of the forgiveness
      of sins to the paralytic? Verse 5.



        4. How did Jesus' power to read minds answer the objections of the
      teachers of the law? Verses 6-11.



DAY      2. The Call of Levi-Matthew (verses 13-17).

13       The call of Levi-Matthew must have hit the people of Capernaum with
      terrific force. Try putting the scene into a modern setting: A public offi-
      cial has aroused widespread anger by corrupt use of his powers. Even
      worse, he is serving as an agent for a foreign power that is oppressing his

      18
      Ulm V                                          Taxattaaw mil MUM
      own people. What would be your reaction if that individual professed a
      genuine conversion?

        What attitude does the Lord expect us to show today toward those who
      have done us an injustice? (See Mark 2:13-17 and The Desire of Ages, pp.
      272-280.)



         3. Questions About Fasting (verses 18-22).
         Some of the pious Jews in Christ's day fasted twice a week, believing
      that such an act earned special merit for them before God. The question
      brought to Jesus about fasting is one that could be applied to any area of
      life in which a person restrains some part of his normal life-style for reli-
      gious reasons. There may have been a hidden question behind the audible
      one: Are You and Your disciples as pious, as holy, as dedicated, and as
      acceptable to God as those who fast?

      CONSIDER:
       • Why are John's disciples linked with the Pharisees in verse 18?
       • What would be a proper motive for religious fasting?
       • What tie-in did Jesus make to John's words about Him? (Compare
         verses 19 and 20 with John 3:29.)
       • What is the significance of "old cloth" and "old bottles"?

        "A legal religion can never lead souls to Christ; for it is a loveless,
      Christless religion. Fasting or prayer that is actuated by a self-justifying
      spirit is an abomination in the sight of God. . . . Our own works can
      never purchase salvation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 280.

      NOTES:




DAY     4. Food and the Sabbath (verses 25-28).
        Picking someone else's heads of grain to satisfy immediate hunger was
El    legal in Israel (Deut. 23:24, 25). But Christ's disciples violated man-made
      laws when they plucked the ripe grain on the Sabbath day and rubbed it in
      their hands in order to remove the husks. (See Luke 6:1.) Jesus was in


                                                                                 19
      Tamlitcomsy aid TaMigi                                         Lkecitm N
     continual conflict with the Jewish leaders over the man-made laws and
     traditions with which they had surrounded Sabbath observance—not in
     conflict over which day, but over the why and how of the day.

        What do you understand to be the primary function and purpose of the
     Sabbath day? (Compare Matt. 12:5-7; Mark 2:27, 28; The Desire of Ages,
     p. 286.)



       5. Healing on the Sabbath (Mark 3:1-6).
       In His travels around Capernaum and the Sea of Galilee Jesus made
     His way back to the synagogue, most likely on a different Sabbath than
     the one mentioned above. Then a man with a "withered hand" seemed to
     be in plain sight, and there was an expectation that Jesus would want to
     do something about it. That was all right in itself, perhaps, but would He
     do it on the Sabbath? That was the same old issue again. How persistent
     we humans are in wanting to prove right to be wrong!

       Why were the Pharisees unable to answer the questions Jesus asked
     about the law and doing good? Verse 4. (See also The Desire of Ages, p.
     286.)



        What impressions of God's love and concern can be found in the mixture
     of righteous indignation and pity felt by Jesus in this situation? Verse 5.



       How deeply opposed to what Jesus was doing and teaching were the
     Pharisees after some two years of His ministry, and what does this fact sug-
     gest as to opposition believers may expect from holding firmly to God's
     truth today? Verse 6.



DAY 6. Jesus and Crowds (verses 7-12).
       "All these people came to Jesus because they had heard of the things
ti  he was doing" (Mark 3:8, TEV). Actions speak louder than words. Peo-
    ple need little argument when there is evidence that can be measured by
    their senses. However, sometimes there are so many counterfeit "mir-
    acles" that the deeds need the verification of an unquestioning respect
    for and belief in the special revelation of the Word.

     THINK IT THROUGH: What can be done today to arrest the attention of
     the multitudes so that they will want to hear the gospel?


          What a picture! Waves of sick people were pushing their way forward

     to touch Him. The Lord moving into a boat that was handy as a means of
     ministering more effectively to the yearning crowds.

       7. Twelve Chosen Men (verses 13-19).
       Compile a list of the twelve disciples by comparing Matthew 10:2-4;
     Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:14-16; and Acts 1:13. (If you have access to the
     S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, see p. 593.)




       It is hard to read this list of twelve names without developing a lump in
     the throat. The Lord knew so much more about the disciples than we do,
     and yet He chose them. How could One whose faith opened to Him all
     knowledge entrust the whole future of His kingdom to twelve such men?
     Consider that, with the exception of Judas Iscariot, these twelve men
     were later filled with His Spirit.

       Judas came for some wrong reasons. Should he not have been rejected?
     Suppose he had been. How much did Jesus do to try to save him and use
     him? What should we learn from this about our relationship to leaders to-
     day? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 293-297.)

      He Educated the Uneducated. "The work of Jesus was to reveal the
   character of the Father, and to unfold the truth which He Himself had
   spoken through prophets and apostles; but there was found no place for
    the truth in those wise and prudent men. Christ, the Way, the Truth, and
    the Life, had to pass by the self-righteous Pharisees, and take His disci-
    ples from unlearned fishers and men of humble rank. These who had
    never been to the rabbis, who had never sat in the schools of the proph-
    ets, who had not been members of the Sanhedrin, whose hearts were not
    bound about with their own ideas,—these He took and educated for His
    own use. He could make them as new bottles for the new wine of His
    kingdom. These were the babes to whom the Father could reveal spiritual
    things; but the priests and rulers, the scribes and Pharisees, who claimed
    to be the depositaries of knowledge, could give no room for the principles
    of Christianity, afterward taught by the apostles of Christ. The chain of

rance, and were willing to learn of the great Teacher."—Ellen G. White
Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 1088, 1089.

SUMMARY: With swift strokes Mark's word-brush has painted for us a
picture of the tireless ministry of our Lord for sinful men and women. We
have seen the recurrent attacks of the evil one—through Jewish leaders
and faltering colleagues—upon the innocent and loving Lamb of God. We
have briefly reviewed the persistent conflict between the authority of
long-held traditions and misinterpretations and the real truths portrayed
in the Old Testament and taught by Jesus. We have seen the foundation
laid by the Lord Himself for His church in the call of the apostles. We
have studied how the Lord forgave sins and sinners—the essence of His
everlasting gospel and the key to all divine healing. We have been as-
tounded by the defensiveness of man-made Sabbath regulations by those
who never saw its true meaning, and who were ready to kill its Founder
for His nonobservance of what they considered to be true.
   All this presents us with insights into how adequate our Saviour is in
meeting our diverse needs.

APPLICATION: This week's lesson pointed out that the Sabbath is not
violated when we perform works of mercy. Too often we view Sabbath
time as passive rather than as presenting us an opportunity to witness to
the mercy and love of God. This afternoon seek someone who is not a
Sabbath keeper whom you know to be in special need. Minister to that
person's need in a way that you believe will represent most effectively
the loving ministry of Jesus.

INTRODUCTION: We already have seen the Lord almost overwhelmed
by the demands of the throngs that came in search of Him daily in the
open country around Capernaum.
   Because of the throngs, a fisherman's rocking boat was needed to give
the Lord security, a seat, and a pulpit. The great amount of attention be-
ing shown Jesus was perceived as a threat by the religious authorities of
the day. They themselves had not enjoyed such a persistent and intense
interest in their teaching of religious matters. The well-meaning crowds
so desperately seeking help had no idea or intention of creating problems
for the Lord. Each sensed his own need, but none calculated the cumula-
tive demand upon the Lord's strength and time. When large segments of
days went by without affording Him even with a moment to eat, His fam-
ily felt that they must take action—particularly when someone voiced the
superstitious idea that Jesus had gone mad.
   Family people—even with the best of intentions—can be quite posses-
sive and domineering. The children of Joseph were older than Jesus. (See
The Desire of Ages, pp. 86, 87.) Taking advantage of their position, they
worked on Mary's natural concern, made her overanxious, and drew her
along to "persuade" her Son to follow their advice.
                                                                       23
       The way Jesus responded to His family was not rude or disrespectful.
    But from childhood, He could not let family relationships interfere with
    His divine commission. (See Luke 2:49, 50.)
       However, what can hurt more than to be patronized by critical mem-
    bers of our own family—particularly older members? Jesus understands
    because He experienced the same kind of problem.
       When we become the Lord's, our mother, brothers, and sisters are the
    church (which we hope will include our family members).
       Finally, Mark has to pause, as it were, in his account of Jesus' activi-
    ties to record some of His teachings.
       Parables come into focus here, and we shall want to see what they are
    and why they were given. Then we shall glean all we can from the par-
    ables about the sower, the lampstand, and the seeds—regular seeds in
    general, and mustard seeds in particular.

DAY I. PROBLEMS IN CAPERNAUM (Mark 3:20-35). Read these verses be-
 o
2       fore proceeding.
       1. Spirit of God or of Beelzebub? (Verses 20-30).
      The parallel portion of Matthew's Gospel records the healing of a man
    possessed of an evil spirit, who had become both blind and dumb as a
    result of his possession. (See Matt. 12:22-32.) His healing gave evidence
    that Christ had power over evil spirits.
      Matthew indicates that some began to ask if this was not "the Son of
    David"—the promised Messiah. But the Pharisees came up with an argu-
    ment designed to crush any such expectations. (See Mark 3:22.) They
    claimed that He was in league with the spirits, denying that He was God.
       What do Jesus' words in verses 25 to 28 indicate about the incompatibil-
    ity of the kingdoms of light and darkness?


       When Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous "House Divided"
    speech that portrayed the cleavage of thought that would soon split his
    country into two warring camps, he drew upon these very words of our
    Lord. He said that a country cannot be half slave, half free. Neither can a
    human soul be split between loyalty to God and loyalty to Satan. It is all
    or nothing, one or the other.
      What application can be made from these words of Jesus to the multiple
    forces that today are wrecking marriages and breaking up families?


    THINK IT THROUGH: If each partner to a marriage entered into the rela-
    tionship as a covenant with God first and then with the partner, would the
    house not stand?
      How would you apply the illustration of the strong man and his belong-
    ings (verse 27) to the healing of the demoniac and the arguments put for-
    ward by the Pharisees?


    24
         Jesus moved directly from answering the Pharisees' accusations into
      the question of the sin that cannot be pardoned. It seems that this subject
      mostly concerns people who feel they have committed such a sin. If they
      had they would not be concerned about it. Sometimes the subject of the
      unpardonable sin is used to urge people to act in obedience to truths
      which they have heard.
         But we need to stress—at least equally—the element of assurance in
      the Saviour's words: "I assure you that people can be forgiven all their
      sins and all the evil things they may say" (Mark 3:28, TEV). One who
      savors the peace and joy of such an assurance is not going to be prone to
      attribute the work of the Holy Spirit to the work of Satan and thus silence
      Heaven's ordained means of teaching truth, of convicting of sin, and of
      showing the need of repentance.

         Note how human pride—like angelic pride before it—plays a role in the
      slide toward the sin that cannot be forgiven:
         "The Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke this warning did not themselves
      believe the charge they brought against Him. There was not one of those
      dignitaries but had felt drawn toward the Saviour. . . . But after their re-
      jection of Him it would be too humiliating to receive Him as the
      Messiah. . . . Still the convicting Spirit of God followed them, and they
      had to build up many barriers in order to withstand its power."—The
      Desire of Ages, p. 322.

DAY     2. Troubles in the Family of Jesus (verses 31-35).
        From Mark's few words about the family of Jesus we can glean a great
      depth of comfort for the follower of the Lord who suffers the most painful
      type of reproach for Christ that there is—misunderstanding and misinter-
      pretation of motive by relatives and friends.
        In Jesus' response to the message—brought to Him in the midst of the
      day's work—that His mother and brothers wanted to see Him outside,
      we have a guide to one legitimate source of consolation in such an experi-
      ence.

         How would you counter the suggestion that Christ was so tied to His mis-
      sion that He was devoid of normal feelings for His family? (See The Desire of
      Ages, pp. 325, 326, for help with this question and those that follow.)



      THINK IT THROUGH: Who constitute the spiritual family of the follower
      of Jesus Christ?


        With what family did Jesus find the kind of love He would have cherished
      from His own family?




                                                                                 25
DAY 11. A CLUSTER OF PARABLES (Mark 4:1-34). Read these verses before
        proceeding.

       1. The Sower (verses 1-9).
       The setting for these parables already is a familiar one in Mark's Gos-
     pel. Jesus once again used a fisherman's boat as a floating pulpit. His
     hearers crowded the shoreline (verse 1). Mark then records that Jesus
     used parables in teaching the multitudes (verse 2).
        It would be well to do a little preparatory study here in order to appre-
     ciate the frequent use of parables by our Lord.
       The Greek word parabole literally comes from a verb: "To put one
     thing beside another." A parable is a narrative, the primary purpose of
     which is to teach truth. Ordinarily it enlarges on one main truth. The
     meaning of a parable often is suggested by the time, place, and circum-
     stances under which it is presented. Jesus' parables involved experiences
     of everyday life that were familiar to His audience. Often He used spe-
     cific incidents that had occurred in recent times. Sometimes He used an
     incident that was taking place before His listeners' eyes.

          2. Reasons Why Jesus Taught in Parables (verses 10-12):
           1. That His hearers might learn of the unknown through the known.
           2. To unite human beings with God and earth with heaven.
           3. To teach His hearers how to discern God in His works.
           4. To root His hearers in truth.
           5. As an effective method of instruction.
           6. To impart unwanted truth without arousing prejudice.
           7. As one way of evading the spies who always were watching Him.
           8. To create lasting impressions.
           9. To appeal to a wide variety of hearers.
          10. To demonstrate God and truth in every association of life.

       Mark's record of the parable of the sower (verses 1-9) is followed by
     the Lord's interpretation of the parable (verses 13-20). In between we are
     given a clue as to the purpose of parables (verses 10-12).
       The Lord was willing to give the candidates for the kindgom direct in-
     formation regarding the nature of that kingdom. He also informed them
     plainly and directly what His expectations were for them. But those un-
     able to receive His instruction would be taught in parables and most of
     them would not grasp the spiritual significance of what they heard.
       As is true of God's attitude referred to in such "hardening of the heart"
     texts as Exodus 7:13 and Isaiah 63:17, Jesus was describing the condition
     of the unbelieving heart and mind rather than any ungracious purpose of
     His toward such listeners. If they were willing to believe they would un-
     derstand and He would forgive, for that is His nature. (See Mark 4:12.)

       3. The Parable of the Sower Explained (Mark 4:13-20).
       Jesus gently rebuked His disciples when they appeared unable to com-
     prehend His parable (verse 13). But before we become too critical of
     them we should remember how dominated the Jews had been by human


     26
      traditions that robbed the Scriptures of their simple, direct, and most ob-
      vious meaning. For Christians today, there is no real barrier to under-
      standing the Lord's interpretation of the parable. However, it is possible,
      and in many cases all too true, that we may be anything but good soil
      hearers of the Word of God—recipients of the good seed.


5•
DAY             APPLICATIONS:
        How am I personally relating to the good seed of the gospel in my life
        today?



      • If the soil of my heart is not the right kind, how do I go about letting the
        Lord change the situation? (Consider Jer. 4:3.)



        4. Lamp Placement (Mark 4:21-25).
        Some may be confused by the use in the King James Version of the
      word candle. Jesus was talking about the small clay oil lamps used by
      people of His day. The few words recorded may scarcely qualify this as a
      full-blown parable, but the brief word picture is an apt one. A person
      dependent on an oil lamp did not go to the trouble of filling it, arranging
      the wick properly, taking a taper to an open fire, lighting it, carrying it
      quickly and carefully to the lamp in order to light the wick, watching it to
      see that it would settle to a steady, nonsmoking flame, merely in order to
      put in under a bushel basket or under a bed.
        The light of God's truth and love is not to be shut selfishly away from
      those about us but is to illuminate their souls by being shared. (See Matt.
      10:27.) And those who share the light will receive greater light. Those
      who hold the blessing to themselves will lose much of what they have.
      (See 2 Cor. 9:6.)

         Could verse 22 imply that before the end all questions of truth and error,
      light and darkness will be made plain? Think about the way in which the
      Sabbath issue will become universal before the end. (See Rev. 13:16-18;
      14:6-12; 18:1-4; The Great Controversy, pp. 603-606.)



DAY     5. Growing Seeds (Mark 4:26-29).
Iej     Mark alone records these particular words, although the truth they
%Ng   teach parallels closely Christ's words to Nicodemus concerning the work
      of the Holy Spirit (John 3:1-21). There is an element of divine mystery in
      the growth of a seed. The germ of life, transmitted through multiplied
      generations, is awakened in the seed as the needed combination of
      elements surrounds it. When the sower has done all in his power to pre-
      pare the environment for the seed to grow and become fruitful, he must
      leave the seed to God.


                                                                                   27
       What implications are contained in Jesus' words concerning Christian
     growth, maturity, and character transformation?



       How is the seed given life? Who sustains it? Who is responsible for its
     fruitfulness? (Compare with John 15:1-5, which mentions the "fruit,"
     "more fruit," and "much fruit" of the branches of the True Vine.)



       If the harvest is the end of the world, what assurance do we have that the
     seed of the good news will have achieved its full fruitage by the time the
     Lord returns? (See Mark 4:29.)



       6. The Smallest Seed (verses 30-34).
        A modern botanist might wish to refute the classification of the mus-
     tard as the "smallest." But who can doubt that it was considered such by
     Christ's hearers. Be that as it may, the size of the resulting plant was out
     of proportion to the expectation created by the size of the seed.

       What are the implications of the parable of the mustard seed to the work
     of the gospel in our hearts and to the advancement of Christ's work on
     earth?



DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Chapter 33, "Who Are
    My Brethren?" in The Desire of Ages.
       The Parable of the Sower. "Throughout the parable of the sower,
    Christ represents the different results of the sowing as depending upon
    the soil. In every case the sower and the seed are the same. Thus He
    teaches that if the word of God fails of accomplishing its work in our
    hearts and lives, the reason is to be found in ourselves. But the result is
    not beyond our control. True, we cannot change ourselves; but the power
    of choice is ours, and it rests with us to determine what we will become.
    The wayside, the stony-ground, the thorny-ground hearers need not re-
    main such. The Spirit of God is ever seeking to break the spell of infatu-
    ation that holds men absorbed in worldly things, and to awaken a desire
    for the imperishable treasure. It is by resisting the Spirit that men become
    inattentive to or neglectful of God's word. They are themselves responsi-
    ble for the hardness of heart that prevents the good seed from taking root,
    and for the evil growths that check its development.
       "The garden of the heart must be cultivated. The soil must be broken
    up by deep repentance for sin. Poisonous, Satanic plants must be up-
    rooted. The soil once overgrown by thorns can be reclaimed only by dili-
    gent labor. So the evil tendencies of the natural heart can be overcome
    only by earnest effort in the name and strength of Jesus. The Lord bids us


     28
 hem 3                                         Oteintarb ma! Para es
by His prophet, `Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among
thorns.' Sow to yourselves in righteousness; reap in mercy.' Jer. 4:3;
Hosea 10:12. This work He desires to accomplish for us, and He asks us
to co-operate with Him."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 56.
   The Parable of the Mustard Seed. "In this last generation the parable
of the mustard seed is to reach a signal and triumphant fulfillment. The
little seed will become a tree. The last message of warning and mercy is to
go to `every nation, and kindred, and tongue' (Rev. 14:6-14), 'to take out
of them a people for His name' (Acts 15:14). And the earth shall be 'light-
ened with His glory.' Rev. 18:1."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 79.

SUMMARY: In this lesson Christ is revealed as the sympathizing Com-
forter and Helper available to all who are discouraged because of family
problems today. He points all such to a closer family—those who love
Him. In the sermon by the sea the Lord introduces parables—object les-
sons to immortalize His teaching concerning the kingdom. They bring us
courage in the Lord. His kingdom is coming—soon.

APPLICATION: Your mission this week is to be a sower of the gospel
seed. Select some of the fine tracts and booklets available from Adventist
publishers that you think particularly appropriate for the people who live
where you do. Then pray for the Holy Spirit to lead you to the right per-
son or persons to receive what you have selected. Do not try to evaluate
the reception. Just plant the seed and let the Holy Spirit be responsible
for its development.

1    MEMORY TEXT: "He said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how
     is it that ye have no faith?" (Mark 4:40).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Fear, one of the most powerful consequences of

conqueror in the Son of man.

INTRODUCTION: One human need that seems to be universal in every
age, in every level of society, is the need for a miraculous antidote for
fear. Nothing so tears at the heart, so breaks down the vital forces that
sustain buoyant health and courageous action as does fear—nagging, per-
sistent, almost omnipresent fear.
  The sources and immediate causes of our fears may be almost as nu-
merous as the people who are often helpless victims. Yet there also are
great universal sources—persistent hunger, hidden malnutrition, termi-
nal disease, dreaded holocaust, joblessness, poverty, bankruptcy, loneli-
ness, rejection, all the phobias (very real to those who suffer them)—that
bring about fear.
   We think of Peter as a big, strong fisherman. Perhaps he was. But he
lacked courage at times. In their hours of innermost communication did
Peter convey to Mark how great those fears were? Did he explain to Mark
how he had learned to overcome those fears by trust in the Man of Gali-
lee?
  Mark seems to enjoy telling us what Jesus did, and thus what He can do
for us. The miracles that Mark has recorded in his Gospel up to this point
have been those of healing—the demoniac in the synagogue, Peter's
mother-in-law, those gathered at the door after sundown, casting out dev-


30
    I um= it)                      (!cW'uctla Usaimado caa ttMairgh
    ils in Galilee, the leper, the paralytic lowered through the roof, the man
    with the withered hand, and the deliverance of the possessed from the
    power of Satan. Now the Gospel writer brings us face to face with the
    source of some of our wildest fears—the fear of water, wind, storm, and
    drowning.
       However, no sooner did the Lord speak peace to the seething billows
    and deliver the disciples safely to shore than they found themselves ter-
    rorized once again by the enemy of God and man working through a man
    who lived in the tombs, a man possessed by too great a power for mana-
    cles and fetters to control. But, because the Master was in touch with
    Heaven, the fearful demons were forced to yield to His word.
       Whole, and in his right mind, the man was once again possessed. This
    time by a fear of being separated from the Lord. But the Lord had a mis-
    sion for him, and the fulfillment of his mission would bring mastery over
    his fear. "Go and tell" was and is the Master's simple formula for effec-
    tive witnessing and mastery of self-distrustful fear. When the people of
    Decapolis—the Ten Towns—heard the message they were amazed.
       Jesus and the disciples next crossed the now-quiet lake, only to be met
     by other human needs and fears. The fear of sickness, disease, and death
    knows no boundaries. It strikes rich and poor, powerful and helpless,
    alike.
       Jesus was having His usual problem on His second missionary journey
    around Galilee—the throngs of people that crowded about Him every
     waking hour. But men in positions of authority have a way about them,
     and the request reached Him in person to heal a daughter who even then
     was dying. How that tugged at the heart that loved all children. So Jesus
     started off with Jairus.
        But then the word came that the child was dead. Why trouble the
     Teacher any more? It was too late. Is it ever too late for the Lord? "Don't
     be afraid," He said. "Only believe!" And when He got there, He awak-
     ened the "sleeping" girl and gave her back to her grieving family.
        "Don't be afraid. I am the answer to your fears. Only believe."

DAY I. POWER OVER TEMPESTS (Mark 4:35-41). Read these verses before
        proceeding.

       Most of Jesus days were busy days. However, the records in the Gos-
     pels of His activity actually deal with only a few days of His ministry. But
     two days of busy ministry in the autumn of A.D. 29 are outlined in some
     detail in Mark 4 and 5. On His busy days Jesus scarcely paused for food
     or rest. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 333.) At the close of the first day
     mentioned in this section of Mark, Jesus was so tired that He determined
     to seek a place of rest and retirement at an uninhabited spot on the other
     side of the lake. He asked the disciples to take Him across in a fishing
     boat.
        Weary and hungry, the Master fell asleep. Almost immediately it was
     dark as night, and a typical Lake Galilee storm burst upon them from the
     mountain gorges. "The waves, lashed into fury by the howling winds,
     dashed fiercely over the disciples' boat, and threatened to engulf it.


                                                                              31
         Cinpi TO WM UCH, etfdl Ritraga                            &map a
    Those hardy fishermen had spent their lives upon the lake, and had
    guided their craft safely through many a storm; but now their strength and
    skill availed nothing. They were helpless in the grasp of the tempest, and
    hope failed them as they saw that their boat was filling."—The Desire of
    Ages, p. 334.

      What did Jesus indicate caused the disciples to be afraid? What example
    had He set them? What was the antidote to their fear? Mark 4:38-40.



    PERSONAL APPLICATION: Are there storms with which I am now bat-
    tling that I need to turn over to the Lord asking Him to order, "Peace, be
    still"?

      "How often the disciples' experience is ours! When the tempests of
    temptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves sweep
    over us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there is One who
    can help us. We trust to our own strength till our hope is lost, and we are
    ready to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and if we call upon Him to
    save us, we shall not cry in vain. Though He sorrowfully reproves our
    unbelief and self-confidence, He never fails to give us the help we need.
    Whether on the land or on the sea, if we have the Saviour in our hearts,
    there is no need of fear. Living faith in the Redeemer will smooth the sea
    of life, and will deliver us from danger in the way that He knows to be
    best."—The Desire of Ages, p. 336.

      What new fear possessed those who had experienced the tempest? (See
    verse 41.)



DAY 11. POWER OVER DEMONS (Mark 5:1-20). Read these verses before
        proceeding.

      This is a straightforward, simple account of how some persons behave
    when possessed of evil spirits and of Christ's power and authority over
    Satan and his agents.

      After the glorious lesson of faith conquering fear during the storm, how
    would you expect the disciples to behave when confronted with demon pos-
    session? (See The Desire of Ages, p. 337.)


      According to Matthew, who was an eyewitness, there actually were
    two demon-possessed men involved. (See Matt. 8:28.) We do not know
    why Mark mentions only one. Perhaps the one man's later experience
    was such that he was particularly noteworthy among early Christians.
      Notice that once again the evil spirits identified the Lord and revealed
    what they knew their end would be. Is it not remarkable that humans

    32
     1161;=i) 43                   CUP az ttna OffilliAra           uanib
    often dabble with demons but—unlike the fallen angels—refuse to ac-
    knowledge the Lord to be who He is? (See 2 Peter 2:4, 9; James 2:19.)

       How might the destruction of the herd of swine—instigated by the legion
    of demons, and permitted by the Lord—have brought a blessing to the own-
    ers and the region? (See Mark 5:9-17; The Desire of Ages, pp. 338-341.)


    THINK IT THROUGH: What comfort can you draw personally from the
    transformation which Christ brought to demon-possessed individuals?


DAY I11. POWER OVER DISEASE (Mark 5:25-34). Read these verses before
         proceeding.

       Returning to the western shore, Jesus taught by the seaside for a time,
    then went to Levi-Matthew's house for a feast with some publicans.
    There Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, found Him and pleaded with
    Jesus to come and heal his dying daughter. (See The Desire of Ages, p.
    342.) Immediately Jesus left the house with Jairus but found it difficult to
    press through the crowd that had gathered outside Matthew's house. In
    that crowd was a woman who had suffered from a disease that made her
    life a burden for twelve years. She had tried to reach Jesus at the seaside
    but could not get to Him because of the crowd. When He left Matthew's
    house she tried to reach Him again but almost had given up in despair
    when He turned in her direction.

      To what lengths did the woman go to be healed, and what lesson of faith
    did Jesus draw from what she did? Verses 27-34.


       "The golden opportunity had come. She was in the presence of the
     Great Physician! But amid the confusion she could not speak to Him, nor
     catch more than a passing glimpse of His figure. Fearful of losing her one
     chance of relief, she pressed forward, saying to herself, 'If I may but
     touch His garment, I shall be whole.' As He was passing, she reached
     forward, and succeeded in barely touching the border of His garment.
     But in that moment she knew that she was healed. In that one touch was
     concentrated the faith of her life, and instantly her pain and feebleness
     gave place to the vigor of perfect health."—The Desire of Ages, p. 343.
        Greater than the blessing of her healing was the blessing of her witness
     to those present and to those down through the ages who have been in-
     spired by her example. One lesson we can learn is that we are prone
     merely to touch the hem of Christ's garment and steal away satisfied
     when He has so much more that He wants to give us. We pray today for
     the outpouring of the latter rain, and we should; but we have not taken
     full advantage yet of the power of the Holy Spirit that already has been
     made available to us. Before we can expect more we must fully partake of
     that which already has been provided.


                                                                              33

       Mark mentions that the disciples wondered why Jesus asked, "Who
     touched me?" Who was the chief spokesman, and what had he failed to
     understand? Luke 8:45, 46.


       "The Saviour could distinguish the touch of faith from the casual con-
     tact of the careless throng. Such trust should not be passed without com-
     ment. He would speak to the humble woman words of comfort that would
     be to her a wellspring of joy,—words that would be a blessing to His fol-
     lowers to the close of time."—The Desire of Ages, p. 344.

DAY IV. POWER OVER DEATH (Mark 5:21-23, 35-43). Read these verses be-
         fore proceeding.

       There is much of divine love and understanding of human need in these
     two accounts of the healing of the woman in the crowd and the raising of
     Jairus' daughter. We should let our imaginations dwell on the setting until
     the event becomes real in our minds and hearts.
       Perhaps you have watched at the bedside of a child who seemed to be
     near death. The long night hours drag out the agony of mingled hope and
     fear—prayers that too often lack the power of a long walk with the Lord.
        Have you thought about the father, Jairus, in the crowd? Why did he
     not send his servants? He could entrust his burden to no other. He would
     go himself.
       Imagine his frustration. Have you ever seen possible help ebb away
     against the crisis of passing time? Oh, what anguish, what fears! And the
     desperate cry of a father's heart, Please help, Lord, before my child dies!
       When Jairus saw his servants coming, he knew the worst. They were
     not shouting and laughing with joy. Their word was, "Your daughter has
     died. Why bother the Teacher any longer?" (verse 35, TEV).
        He who could sleep through lashing storms was not perturbed by what
     seemed to be bad news. "Don't be afraid, only believe," He urged. But
     the death was real. The mourning procedure was in full wail when the
     Lord arrived. "The child is not dead—she is only sleeping," He com-
     mented (Mark 5:39, TEV). That is how death appeared to Him. He was
     going to wake her in the same way that someday soon He will wake all
     our redeemed loved ones from their "sleep." Those present ridiculed
     Him. They knew the child was dead.
       "Little girl," He said, "I tell you to get up!" (verse 41, TEV)—in the
     same way that her mother and father had done so often. How much we
     today need our loving Saviour to speak life to our spiritually dying chil-
     dren that we might gather them to us for eternity.
       "Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone, and added, 'Give her
     something to eat' " (verse 42, TEV) as tender evidence of His thoughtful
     care.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the parallel accounts in
Fel Matthew 8:23 to 9:26; Luke 8:22-56.
        The Hem of Christ's Garment. "Possibly this woman had planned for
    some time to reach Jesus, but His absence on the Second Galilean Tour
    seems to have made this, for the time being, impossible. When she
    learned that Jesus had returned to Capernaum she hastened to the shore
    of the lake, where He was teaching and healing. . . . But she searched for
     Him in vain. Learning, eventually, that He was at the home of
    Matthew. . . , she made her way there in the hope of reaching Him, but
     again arrived too late (see DA 343). Now, with the slow progress Jesus
    was making in the direction of the home of Jairus, she finally overtook
     Him.
        "But her malady had lowered the vital supply of blood in her body, and
     she was probably very weak physically in addition to being discouraged
     from the many vain attempts to secure healing at the hands of the physi-
     cians. Also, the nature of the disease itself, together with the ritual un-
     cleanness involved, was embarrassing. It may be she felt hesitant to
     present her request orally to Jesus, particularly in the presence of so
     many strangers, lest He inquire as to the nature of her affliction, which he
     seems to have done sometimes (cf. ch. 10:51). . . .
        "The touch that brought healing to the woman would be considered by
     the rabbis to have brought ritual uncleanness upon Christ. . . .
        ". . . Jesus was conscious of what had happened the moment the
     woman touched His garment. The record does not state whether Jesus
     knew in advance that this woman would touch Him. The will of the Fa-
     ther answered the unspoken plea of the woman through Him. It should be
     remembered that all Christ's miracles were 'wrought by the power of
     God through the ministration of the angels' (DA 143)."—S.D.A. Bible
     Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 607, 608.
DAY     The Touch of Faith. "The wondering crowd that pressed close about

2   Christ realized no accession of vital power. But when the suffering
     woman put forth her hand to touch Him, believing that she would be
     made whole, she felt the healing virtue. So in spiritual things. To talk of
     religion in a casual way, to pray without soul hunger and living faith,
     avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as
     the Saviour of the world, can never bring healing to the soul. The faith
     that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual assent to the truth. He who
     waits for entire knowledge before he will exercise faith cannot receive
      blessing from God. It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must be-
     lieve in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces
      Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves.
      Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by which
      those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God.
      Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding
      trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power.
         "After healing the woman, Jesus desired her to acknowledge the bless-
      ing she had received. The gifts which the gospel offers are not to be se-
      cured by stealth or enjoyed in secret. So the Lord calls upon us for con-


                                                                                35
 Oacgm m3 WID rIciarcus% tIg4J -actiurinth                      Gomm     a
fession of His goodness. 'Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am
God.' Isa. 43:12.
   "Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen agency for re-
vealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace as made
known through the holy men of old; but that which will be most effectual
is the testimony of our own experience. We are witnesses for God as we
reveal in ourselves the working of a power that is divine. Every individual
has a life distinct from all others, and an experience differing essentially
from theirs. God desires that our praise shall ascend to Him, marked by
our own individuality. These precious acknowledgements to the praise of
the glory of His grace, when supported by a Christlike life, have an
irresistible power that works for the salvation of souls."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 347.

SUMMARY: This lesson assures us that Jesus is able to meet all our
needs, and particularly to cast out the demon of fear. In a special way we
need to believe this assurance as the end of all things draws near. This
lesson also emphasizes the full range of Christ's power and touches on
His control over physical forces, devils, disease, and death.

APPLICATION: The power of Jesus answers human fears. People try to
hide their fears with bravado, activity, and disclaimers. But to a trusted
friend they will open their hearts and cry for help. Only then can help be
given.
   Do you know someone that seems to be weighed down by fear of some
kind? This week spend some quiet time showing that person that you
care. Let him or her know that you are susceptible to anxieties and how
you turn to the Lord for help. Don't boast. Be tender. Uplift Jesus.

CENTRAL THOUGHT: What appeared to be the most desperate failures
did not distress Jesus. Instead they became the settings for victory and

                       OVERVIEW: Mark 6:1-56

                           Third Galilean Tour

                 Second rejection at Nazareth (1-6)
                 Mission of the Twelve (7-13)
                 Martyrdom of John the Baptist (14-29)
                 Feeding the 5000 (30-44)
                 Jesus walks on water (45-56)


INTRODUCTION: In a style that we have learned to expect from Mark,
he presents five action-packed events within the 56 verses of what is now
designated as his sixth chapter.
  One of the most distressing experiences of Jesus' ministry came when
the people in His hometown rejected His Messiahship, His message, and
His mission. As we apply what happened to Jesus in the light of how it
enabled Him to meet human needs today there may be some encourage-
ment here for those of us who have suffered rejection by those who
should know us best. This experience also may contain a warning to us
with regard to the way we treat people whom we have known during their
developing years.
  The sending out and the empowering of the twelve apostles to do the
work they had seen Christ do is a special challenge to all who feel called
to deliver God's appeal to a particular generation—in our case, the peo-
ple who may live to see the second coming of Jesus to our world.
   Perhaps, in part, because of the widening influence of the apostles, the
Herod who had John the Baptist beheaded was shaken by the fear that
the righteous forerunner of Jesus had returned from the dead and that
Christ might be that resurrected man. (See Mark 6:16.) At this point Mark


                                                                         37
     gives us a flashback to the imprisonment of John and, in one of his longer
     accounts, traces the events leading to John's martyrdom. For a people
     facing the threat of the final persecution of the remnant and possible re-
     jection and persecution by their former fellow believers, there is both
     challenge and consolation in John's experience. A supreme lesson in true
     humility pervades this tragic account.
       Back to boats and the sea we go—to Peter's first love reflected in
     Mark. Boats, sea, and seashore provide the setting for one of the miracu-
     lous feedings of a multitude and for the Lord's walking on the water. With
     the aid of the parallel Gospel accounts we find that there were forces at
     work in these events that only are inferred in Mark's account. But again,
     there are vital lessons here for those upon whom the end of the world is
     coming. And running through all is a strong emphasis on the way that
     God looks at what seems failure to us. We also are given some insight into
     how He goes about turning failure to victory. Not that the victory is al-
     ways seen to be such here and now, but eternity will show how these
     failures were turned into victories. And for the eternal God it is eternity
     now. He is the I AM.

DAY I. SECOND REJECTION AT NAZARETH (Mark 6:1-6). Read these

13     verses before proceeding.

        Luke 4:16-30 describes Jesus' first rejection at Nazareth. That rejec-
     tion also had taken place in the synagogue on the Sabbath day. When the
     Lord's words portrayed the people of Nazareth as less open to truth than
     certain among the heathen, and applied the prophecies of Isaiah to Him-
     self as the Messiah, the infuriated townspeople would have thrown Him
     over a cliff. But the Lord's work was not yet done; therefore, angels con-
     ducted Him to safety. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 240.)
        Toward the close of a year's ministry in and around Galilee, the Lord
     returned to His hometown ("his own country," verse 1) and again taught
     His old neighbors and His relatives in the synagogue on the Sabbath day.

     RESEARCH: If you have access to a Bible dictionary, a Bible commentary,
     or a Bible encyclopedia, learn all that you can about a Jewish synagogue in
     Christ's day and the form of services that would have been held there on the
     Sabbath.

        From what the Gospels tell us about this event and by reviewing Mark
     3:31-35 and reading John 7:5, what picture do you get of the spiritual state
     of the brothers of Jesus at this point in His ministry? What change later
     took place? (See Acts 1:14.)


       A strange combination of attitudes was shown by the Nazarenes. They
     acknowledged the truth of Christ's words and the power of His miracles
     (verse 2), and yet their nationalism and pride kept them from accepting
     Jesus. As a consequence, He was not able to do as much in their behalf as
     He could have otherwise (verses 4-6). Does this not present us with a
     solemn warning in today's divisive climate?

         Although grieved by the unbelief of His own townspeople, our Lord
       did not allow failure to deter Him. He opened a wider ministry.

DAY 11. MISSION OF THE TWELVE (Mark 6:7-13). Read these verses before
3
111,
. .4
        proceeding.

          In their attempt to harmonize the order of events presented in the Gos-
       pels some suggest that the sending of the Twelve and the third missionary
       journey through Galilee may have taken place before the Nazareth rejec-
       tion. Such placement of events is not vital to our study. What we can
       learn from the sending of the Twelve is important.
          It is Matthew who provides the greatest amount of information on this
       period of ministry. (See Matt. 9:36 to 11:1.) It would be profitable to
       study as much of his account as you can.
          Mark's record first makes mention of the Lord's part in this missionary
       endeavor (verse 6) and then has the apostles going out "by two and two"
       (verse 7).

         What advantages do you see in the two-by-two method of evengelism?
       List some below in readiness for class discussion:




         What reasons can you see for the very light provisions that were to be
       carried on this mission (Mark 6:8, 9)?


        The disciples were not to expect to make a profit on their missionary
       work but were to expect those being benefited to support them.

         Why stay at only one hospitable home in a given place? Why not spread
       the blessing of apostolic presence around? (See verses 10, 11; Luke 10:7.)


         "On this first tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had been
       before them, and had made friends. Their preparation for the journey was
       to be of the simplest kind. Nothing must be allowed to divert their minds
       from their great work. . . . They were not to enter into the synagogues
       and call the people together for public service; their efforts were to be put
       forth in house-to-house labor. They were not to waste time in needless
       salutations, or in going from house to house for entertainment."—The
       Desire of Ages, p. 351.

         On what aspect of the gospel message were they to focus? Mark 6:12.



                                                                                    39

       There is an interesting reference in this account (verse 13) to the use of
     anointing with oil for healing. The olive grew plentifully in the Promised
     Land, and the use of oil—internally and externally—for its curative value
     was widely practiced. But only here and in James 5:14 is its use linked
     with a special act of faith that often brought instant healing to the suf-
     ferer.
DAYQUESTIONS FOR TODAY: Do we as Seventh-day Adventists need to be

5  reminded again of the almost inseparable elements of healing and teaching
    in Christ's earliest missions—both in His own and in those of His disciples?
    Does this biblical account apply in any way today to the kind of service that
    our institutions should offer to their patients and their families? What
    about our individual and personal witness to our neighbors and friends?
    Can we still combine healing of soul with healing of body?
       Perhaps our answers to these questions will depend, in part, on the
    state of the healing arts and practices in the places where we live. There
    are serious legal problems that can arise today in some areas if an un-
    qualified person is thought to be practicing medicine without a license.
    We may need to show our willingness to help in other ways. A good loaf
    of home-baked bread accompanied with a cheerful word and a prayer can
    still reach people for the Lord.

     I11. MARTYRDOM OF JOHN THE BAPTIST (Mark 6:14-29). Read
          these verses before proceeding.

        Locating the place in the sequence of Gospel events when John actu-
     ally was imprisoned and then lost his life is not easy for Bible students.
     We have to recognize that the Gospel accounts are sometimes difficult to
     harmonize on details. Does this shake our confidence in the inspiration of
     the various accounts? It should not. The portrayal each writer gives of
     Christ and His gospel fits into a particular organizing principle that the
     writer had in mind. The writers selected from their sources, under the
     guidance of the Holy Spirit, that which was most appropriate for their
     particular purpose.
        There is a sordid history behind the names of Herod, Herodias, Philip,
     and Salome. The simple fact is that John condemned sin in high places
     and in low. In his age such action on the part of a common man—even
     though he was recognized as a prophet—could not go unchecked.
        The real drama in this account is not that John was beheaded at the
     whim of a drunken ruler manipulated by a vengeful and bloodthirsty
     woman. (After all, this incident took place in the Roman Empire, in the
     capital of which people were entertained by gladiatorial fights to the
     death.) The real drama lies in the silence and nonintervention of Christ in
     behalf of His loyal and devoted forerunner, and in the selfless faith of
     John the Baptist in the surety of the kingdom he had the honor to an-
     nounce.
       "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30). Sense these
     words. Savor them. Meditate upon them. This is one of the most inspiring
     expressions of true human greatness. Of no man did Christ speak greater
     praise than of John. (See Luke 7:24-30, particularly verse 28.)

     40
       Read the following; then summarize why Jesus, who easily could have
     delivered John from Herod's dungeon, did not do so.

       "Jesus did not interpose to deliver His servant. He knew that John
     would bear the test. Gladly would the Saviour have come to John, to
     brighten the dungeon gloom with His own presence. But He was not to
     place himself in the hands of enemies and imperil His own mission.
     Gladly would He have delivered His faithful servant. But for the sake of
     thousands who in after years must pass from prison to death, John was to
     drink the cup of martyrdom. As the followers of Jesus should languish in
     lonely cells, or perish by the sword, the rack, or the fagot, apparently
     forsaken by God and man, what a stay to their hearts would be the
     thought that John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness Christ Himself had
     borne witness, had passed through a similar experience !"—The Desire of
     Ages, p. 224.

DAY IV. FEEDING THE 5000 (Mark 6:30-44). Read these verses before pro-
         ceeding.

        Scholars critical of the Bible have tried to make light of the Gospel
     accounts because of the seeming, repetition of some events of healing or
     other miracles. A case in point is the feeding of the multitudes of people-
     5000 here, 4000 there. But that is no real basis for doubting the accuracy
     of these accounts. The contrasting details are clear and consistent.
        Actually, the feeding of the 5000 (men) near Bethsaida (see Luke 9:10)
     is the one event between the baptism and the triumphal entry of Jesus
     into Jerusalem that is recorded in all four Gospels.
        Jesus wanted to find a quiet spot at the northern end of the Lake of
     Galilee where He could be free to hear the enthusiastic reports of His
     returned missionaries. But this was not to be. Soon the searching multi-
     tudes caught His symphathy. He continued teaching and the day wore
     away swiftly. Then the predicament arose as to how the hungry multitude
     was to be fed (verses 35, 36).

       What was behind Jesus' instruction to the disciples in verse 37, "Give ye
     them to eat"?


       "Every command of God implies the power needed to carry out the
     command. From a human point of view it was absurd to think of finding
     bread, within walking distance and before nightfall, to satisfy the needs of
     such a throng."-,S.D.A Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 617.

                                                                              41
     LZtbfitcpw C010 oil %gime Defeat
       Why should one who was about to work a miracle need the people orga-
     nized before demonstrating His power?

       "The orderly arrangement of so large a throng probably was necessary
     in order that all might witness the miracle, the better to appreciate its
     significance, and that all might be reached readily."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
     mentary, vol. 5, p. 618.

       What lesson do you see in the statement in verse 43 that they picked up
     the surplus food?



       Why should not these grateful crowds have been allowed to crown Jesus
     king? (See Matt. 3:2; 4:17; 5:3; Luke 4:19, 21; John 6:15.)



DAY V. JESUS WALKS ON WATER (Mark 6:45-56). Read these verses before
Fa       proceeding.
LV.•
       When we consider the power of the Creator of the seas, there is nothing
     that should surprise us in what Jesus did in physically walking on water as
     though it were dry land. But, in spite of all else they had seen, His disci-
     ples were impressed tremendously when they saw Him do it (verse 51).
       From the parallel Gospel accounts we learn that there was reason
     enough for Jesus to send His disciples on by boat to their appointed meet-
     ing place while He personally dismissed the grateful but rather demand-
     ing crowds.
       This was not the time for His coronation as king of Israel. Prophecies
     of His renewed power over all nations would be fulfilled at the second,
     not the first, advent. Attempts to crown Him king now would tend to
     close up His work immediately.

        What was the likely subject of Jesus' hillside prayer after He had said
      farewell to the crowds who had been fed? (See The Desire of Ages, p. 379.)




       In the light of His calming of the earlier storm recorded in Mark 4:35-41,
     why might the Lord have permitted the storm mentioned in Mark 6:48 to
     develop?


        Love of honor and prestige had so blinded the minds of the disciples
     that unbelief was taking possession of their hearts. Why did Jesus not
     allow Himself to be established on the throne of Israel as they expected
     the Messiah to be? Could it be that the Pharisees were right about Jesus'
     being an impostor? "Their thoughts were stormy and unreasonable, and

     42

    the Lord gave them something else to afflict their souls and occupy their
    minds. God often does this when men create burdens and troubles for
    themselves."—The Desire of Ages, p. 380.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages,
    pages 349-358.

    SUMMARY: We have followed the acceptance and rejection of the gos-
    pel message and the mission of Christ through a variety of circumstances
    arid situations. Yet in them all the portrayal of the loving and gracious
    character of God is consistently revealed. This was Christ's purpose in
    coming to our world. He pat failure in a new perspective—God's per-
    spective. God is not intimidated by the threats of human beings or de-
    mons.
       When martyr's blood is shed in triumph over ignorance, superstition,
    and wickedness—even in high places, God has not been defeated.
       When He feeds a multitude from a small boy's lunch, God is revealed.
       Let us go forth like the Twelve to make Him known as He truly is.

    APPLICATION: One of Jesus' briefest commands was "Give ye them to
    eat" (Mark 6:37). This is a facet of discipleship we sometimes ignore.
    Why not this week take it as His literal command to you? Undoubtedly
    there is someone in your community that is in need of food. If you are not
    aware of anyone that is in such need, contact your Community Service
    Center or a public welfare agency and ask them if they know of anyone
    you might help in this way.

cessant activity of love had to be directed toward non-Jewish as well as
Jewish hearers if His followers were to recognize that He was the Saviour

INTRODUCTION: Spiritual pride and exclusiveness seem to be natural
and universal traps for any group of human beings that enjoys a special
assignment or call from God to serve Him at a particular time and in a
specified way. So it was with the Jews. As the children of Abraham and
the race called out of Egypt under Moses, they were the people of God's
covenant—chosen, consecrated, and favored.
   However, the dulling of spiritual perception by repeated disobedience
to the revealed will of God through many generations led ultimately to the
captivity of the Jews in Babylon. But release of a remnant—indeed, of all
who were willing to return—had in it the germ of fulfilling God's original
plan of a universal witness. But the post-exilic history of the Jews indi-
cated that they had not learned what their true mission was. An intensi-
fied isolation characterized the chosen people. They turned in on them-
selves.
   The wars of Jewish independence and the persecutions endured by the
Jews during the period between the Old and New Testaments had led to

44
       Clime. ilo   C3                             IMigkesaliim Sam dad.1 Ifitu
      an intense nationalism that regarded all heathen as "dogs." This was the
      social heritage of those who would be left to carry on the work of Christ's
      kingdom after His return to heaven. They must know of God's love for all
      people and that He rejects all attempts to establish caste or to harbor
      bigotry and prejudice. This was the basic purpose in Christ's journey to
      Phoenicia, on the Mediterranean coast, and into the regions of
      heathenism.
         In the Ten Towns (the Decapolis) dominated by Greek culture the Lord
      continued to reveal the international and universal intent of His mission
      by the healing of a deaf-mute. Even the 4000 fed miraculously were Gen-
      tiles rather than Jews, once again revealing the Lord's purpose for His
      disciples.
         Next came a mysterious request from a group that had hounded the
      Saviour's footsteps ever since He began His ministry. The Pharisees
      came demanding to see a miracle, of their choosing, performed as a proof
      to them of the rightfulness of the Messianic claims of Jesus. But He did
      not operate on their terms or perform miracles to satisfy idle curiosity.
      The Lord tried to warn His disciples against the deceptive reasonings of
      such as the Pharisees or Herod and his supporters, but again they were
      slow to comprehend His words.
         In a healing resembling that of the deaf-mute in Decapolis, the Lord
      restored sight to a blind man at Bethsaida, again in an area that was
      largely populated by Gentiles.
         Thus we are brought near to the close of this interlude of Christ's min-
      istry when He retired from the Jewish sections of the country and
      bestowed His benefits on other people than His own. In the process He
      left to His immediate disciples and to us a clear lesson on the unrestricted
      nature of God's love for mankind. This lesson is vital in a world church
      that lives in the midst of persistent tensions that divide people by race,
      nationality, sex, occupation, education, and financial standing. Thus this
      Gospel account again speaks to a persistent and modern human need.

DAY I. HUMAN LAWS VERSUS GOD'S LAWS (Mark 7:1-23). Read these
       verses before proceeding.
221      1. Human Traditions (verses 1-13).
         Matthew (15:1-20) joins Mark in recording this particular debate be-
      tween the Pharisees and scribes and the Lord over the traditions of the
      Jews. From both accounts it is clear that the issue was brought up at that
      time because some of Christ's disciples (and possibly the Lord also) did
      not practice the ceremonial washings that. Jewish tradition required be-
      fore eating (Mark 7:3, 4).
         The "tradition" was made up of the interpretations placed by the
      scribes or lawyers upon the civil and religious laws of the Jews. Much of
      it had been handed down from the time between the Jewish return from
      Babylon and the days of John the Baptist—a time within which Judaism
      felt that it was fighting for its very survival. This tradition carried the
      weight that the rulings of the highest judicial bodies do today. This gives
      the background for the bitter feelings of the scribes and Pharisees toward
      Christ when he failed to observe the traditional requirements.

                                                                               45
      fahlibtim Stwo aa:0 Geo                                           ma 0
       What marked example did Jesus use to point out that Pharisaical rules
     were used to deny divine and moral principles (such as the fifth command-
     ment)? (See verses 8-13.)



     THINK IT THROUGH: What examples can you think of in which we may
     be doing the same thing today because of selfishness?


        2. That Which Makes Unclean (verses 14-23).
        Because the scribes had brought charges against Christ's disciples on
     the matter of ceremonial cleanliness, the Lord used the occasion to in-
     struct the people on the basis of cleanliness in the sight of God.
        The importance of careful consideration of the setting of a given text or
     passage of Scripture is illustrated clearly here. Those who use this pas-
     sage to negate teachings in the Old Testament regarding clean and un-
     clean meats overlook the context. It is the oral traditions of the Jewish
     elders that are at issue here (see verse 3). "The commandments of men"
     have countered the commandments of God. We certainly should never
     accuse Jesus of doing the same thing.

       What is under discussion here? Is it kinds of food? Or is it the way the
     food is eaten?


       The Greek word translated meats in verse 19 in the King James Version
     includes all food, not just flesh food. When understood in context this
     verse cannot be used properly to justify eating unclean meat.

       What shows that Christ is concerned with cleanliness of heart and soul
     rather than ceremonially with clean hands and utensils? (See verses 18-23.)



        What means has Heaven provided for removing the natural uncleanness
     of the human heart? (See Gal. 5:22, 23; John 3:5, 6, 20, 21; 2 Peter 1:4-8.)



DAY 11. AROUND THE JEWISH BORDERS (Mark 7:24 to 8:10). Read these
         verses before proceeding.
121
       1. To Phoenicia (Mark 7:24-30).
       The journey to Syrophoenicia was one of the largest that Jesus took
    during His ministry—certainly the farthest northward. We have no exact
    knowledge of where He traveled in this Gentile coastland or the location
    of the house in which He sought privacy (verse 24).



     46
      I Ow= (5                                    Manna RUM Mfg Gil?
         On what basis could the Syrophoenician woman have known that this
      stranger could deliver her devil-possessed daughter?

         "The people of this district were of the old Canaanite race. They were
      idolaters, and were despised and hated by the Jews. To this class be-
      longed the woman who now came to Jesus. . . . There were many Jews
      living among the Phoenicians, and the tidings of Christ's work had pene-
      trated to this region. Some of the people had listened to His words and
      witnessed His wonderful works. This woman had heard of the prophet,
      who, it was reported, healed all manner of diseases. As she heard of His
      power, hope sprang up in her heart. Inspired by a mother's love, she de-
      termined to present her daughter's case to Him."—The Desire of Ages,
      pp. 399, 400.

         What could have been the purpose behind Christ's seeming indifference
      to the plea of this needy soul? (See verses 27, 28.)


        It was a long way for Christ to travel for this one miracle. But He had
      two goals. One was to meet the woman's need. The other was to educate
      His disciples concerning their duty to those deprived of a knowledge of
      Christ. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 402.)

DAY     2. The Deaf-mute (verses 31-37).
        Apparently this afflicted man, never having heard of Christ, did not
      come of his own free will, but was brought by friends who were interested
      in helping him. Perhaps to reduce publicity in that Gentile area Jesus took
      the needy one aside from the throng and placed a finger in each ear, heal-
      ing his deafness. Then He touched the man's tongue, loosing it. Mark's
      reference to Jesus' sighing or groaning appears to signal His great con-
      cern over the many hearing ears that were closed to truth and the tongues
      that refused to proclaim the Saviour's name. (See The Desire of Ages, p.
      404.)

        Why did Jesus warn this healed man against telling those about him of
      Christ's power? (See verses 36, 37.)

         "In this predominately Gentile region His chief reason for enjoining
      silence may have been His desire to avoid arousing the hope of the people
      in general that the ministry of which they had, by now, heard so much,
      was to be repeated here in a large way. The heathen, in general at least,
      were unprepared to understand and appreciate the true nature of His
      message."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 627.

         3. Feeding 4000 (Mark 8:1-10).
         Christ still was ministering to His "other sheep" when He performed
      the miracle of feeding the 4000 in the region to the north and east of the
      Sea of Galilee. The basic needs of heathen are no different from those of
      believers, and the Lord again showed that He draws no preferential bar-
      riers to His love.

                                                                              47
        MIN%Ite %Ilw mil Go                                                Le on

          In the light of the previous feeding of the 5000, why did the disciples ques-
       tion Jesus' ability to feed this crowd? (See verses 1-4.)

         "Again the disciples revealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they had
       seen how, with Christ's blessing, their little store availed for the feeding
       of the multitude; yet they did not now bring forward their all, trusting His
       power to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover, those whom He
       had fed at Bethsaida were Jews; these were Gentiles and heathen. Jewish
       prejudice was still strong in the hearts of the disciples."—The Desire of
       Ages, p. 405.

DAY I11. THE DEMAND FOR A SIGN (Mark 8:11-26). Read these verses be-
          fore proceeding.

          1. Asking for a Sign (verses 11-13).
          It is almost unbelievable that the Pharisees (joined by the Sadducees,
       according to Matthew 16:1) would be asking the Lord for a sign to authen-
       ticate His claims to Messiahship and divinity. He had given such an array
       of signs already. But there probably was a fine point here. They may have
       been wanting such signs as those what were given by Samuel and Elijah
       (see 1 Sam. 12:17; 2 Kings 1:10)—Signs that were above the earth, as it
       were, and thus, perhaps, beyond the power of demons (another accusa-
       tion about the source of Christ's miracles).
          Mark notes that in responding Christ sighed deeply, demonstrating His
       deep disappointment over the unbelief of the Jewish leaders. So our Lord
       ever responds to human unbelief and willful spiritual blindness.

          2. The Leaven of Herod and the Pharisees (Mark 8:14-21).
         The confrontation with the Jewish teachers seemed to end abruptly,
       and Christ and His followers went back to the sea. They happened to take
       bread with them this time—although Mark has learned that they had just
       one loaf. And when the Lord warned them against the leaven of the Phari-
       sees and of Herod (see Matthew 16:12 for the parallel between Herod and
       the Sadducees), they assumed that He was referring to the lack of bread
       among them.
          Both Matthew and Mark give us detailed accounts of the two miracles
       of feeding the multitudes but do not provide a direct interpretation of
       Christ's words. They do admit Christ's disappointment over the lack of
       understanding. Christ used an extreme contrast to make His point. "I
       have just fed multitudes—you remember the details, even to the amounts
       left over in each case—can I not then provide food here, if needed? But
       look, I am talking about the leaven of unbelief, of the sin and indifference
       to spiritual values shown by these Jewish leaders."
DAY     3. A Blind Man Healed (Mark 8:22-26).
        Notice that the record of this miracle is found only in the Gospel of
rg
L. J   Mark.

     -amp                                                               diali Mr?
       What reason can you suggest for Jesus' two-staged approach in healing
     the blind man?


       "This is the only recorded instance in which Jesus performed a cure in
     two stages. There is no apparent reason for the use of this method in this
     case. However, it should be noted that, as partial vision was restored to
     the man, his faith increased and he was ready to believe that Jesus could
     cure him completely."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 629.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages,

Ti  pages 399-409.

     SUMMARY: Our Lord ministered faithfully, cautiously, and lovingly for
     His "other sheep." In spite of our worldwide outreach, we still can learn
     much from Him about how to minister to those who do not know Him.
     Nationalism and prejudice of all kinds close the soul of the Christian. Be-
     ware such leaven!

     APPLICATION: This lesson provides another opportunity for a type of
     outreach that is often neglected. Think of some way you can minister to a
     person of another culture or race.

     REVIEW OF PROGRESS OF THIS QUARTER'S STUDY: With this
     week's lesson we are nearing the mid-point of the Gospel according to
     Mark. We have been moving rapidly and intently through the days of the
     proclamation of the gospel, and we will be faced next week with the stra-
     tegic center of the book. There Christ asks His disciples a most vital
     question: Who am I? It is the character of the work that Jesus has done so
     far that leads to that great question. It is a thrilling fact that the apostles
     will be open to the Spirit's leading in giving the answer.
       This brief interlude in which this key question arises is part of Christ's
     work in places of retirement (see "Introduction to the Book of Mark," on
     page 7). It can be thought of as the calm before the storm.
       The forces of error, superstition, tradition, and human authority have
     been building in opposition to the Man of Nazareth, and they begin to
     break out in the open against Him. The fact that they do so leads Him into
     His passion, or final suffering, where His incessant activity of love is
     rebuffed by those who hate Him.
        From Lesson 7 forward we will see Jesus' Messianic claim pressed to
     the ultimate. That brings on both the climax of unbelief and the final vin-
     dication of the mission of our Lord.

The Shadow of the Cross
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 8:27 to 9:50.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "He began to teach them, that the Son of man
    must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the
1   chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
    again" (Mark 8:31).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ who, from the
time of the great confession onward, began to reveal to His disciples that
He was standing under the shadow of the cross.

SPECIAL NOTE: Reference to the diagram of the Gospel of Mark pre-
sented at the end of the last lesson will show that the emphasis on procla-
mation that had characterized Jesus' ministry up to this point was now to
be replaced by the preparation for His passion. We open this week's
study with Peter's identification of the Christ in answer to the question
Who am I? The incessant activity of divine love did not slacken at that
point, but it manifested itself in receiving patiently the relentless waves of
hatred that were stirred to white heat by the purity of the Son of man/Son
of God. Our loving Lord entered the agonizing experience of His be-
trayal, trial, and crucifixion. The path would lead to Gethsemane and
Calvary. But it ended with the triumphant cry It is finished!
   Heaven is secured to redeemed sinners. The gates will open to the
touch of a little child in the faith. "Except ye be converted, and become
as little children . . ." (Matt. 18:3).

    INTRODUCTION: Four high peaks of interest and instruction stand out
    on the horizon formed by the portion of Mark's Gospel that we are study-
    ing this week:
      • Peter's confession of Christ.
      • Peter's rejection of the cross.
      • Peter's part on the mount.
      • Events at the foot of the mountain.
      Some of the greatest issues of truth and error are featured here—joy
    and sorrow, the majestic and the mundane. Running in and through all is
    an ever-widening revelation of the love of God in Jesus Christ.
      Surely such a Saviour as revealed in this week's lesson can meet the
    needs of each of us today!

DAY I. THE GREAT CONFESSION AND FALLING SHADOWS (Mark 8:27
       to 9:1). Read these verses before proceeding.
%
      Caesarea Philippi is almost due north of the eastern shore of Galilee,
    and Christ led His disciples toward its villages (verse 27).
      Somewhere on the way the Lord turned the conversation toward the
    soul-saving question, Who am I? The term soul-saving is used because
    the true answer to His question provides the foundation for Heaven's
    plan for our salvation. (See Acts 4:10-12.)

       What reason can you suggest as to why the Lord's question began with
    "men" in general before it narrowed down to the convictions of the apos-
    tles? (Compare Mark 8:27 and 29.)



      Compare Mark's account of this vital event with Matthew's and Luke's
    account in Matthew 16:13-28 and Luke 9:18-27. In the space provided be-
    low note the similarities and the differences:




       The variations between the Gospel accounts of the same event should
    not shake our confidence in the inspiration of the Gospel accounts when
    we understand that the words of the Bible were not dictated by the Holy
    Spirit but that "One writer is more strongly impressed with one phase of
    the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with his experience or
    with his power of perception and appreciation; another seizes upon a dif-
    ferent phase; and each, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, presents
    what is most forcibly impressed upon his own mind."—The Great Con-
    troversy, p. vi.
       When we remember the several occasions on which the disciples
    seemed not to grasp Christ's teachings any better than the multitude, we


    52

    can well believe that Peter's confession of Christ's true identity for the
    group must be seen as a milestone, a turning point, perhaps, in the educa-
    tion of the Twelve. Yet Peter and the other disciples still were a long way
    from understanding Christ's mission.

      Having gained this heaven-sent declaration from the disciples, for what
    reasons did Christ urge them to keep this knowledge to themselves?

       "After Peter's confession, Jesus charged the disciples to tell no man
    that He was the Christ. This charge was given because of the determined
    opposition of the scribes and Pharisees. More than this, the people, and
    even the disciples, had so false a conception of the Messiah that a public
    announcement of Him would give them no true idea of His character or
    His work."—The Desire of Ages, p. 414.
       Right here comes the reverse side, as it were, of the great transition
    from proclamation to passion to which we already have called attention.
       Now that the disciples have confessed the divine/human Messiah, the
    truth which already had been told to Nicodemus (John 3:14, 15) is to be
    introduced to the chosen apostles. In what possibly was one of the most
    dramatic moments in Christ's entire ministry, His introduction of the
    cross and the resurrection simply was not acceptable to His disciples.
    They were stunned and overwhelmed with grief and unbelief. Mark
    records Peter's personal reaction to the revelation—perhaps a reaction
    from the noble and positive experience he had just had in proclaiming the
    Christ.
       The Greek text indicates that Peter actually took hold of the Lord. Pic-
    ture it. "He laid hold upon his Master, as if to draw Him back from His
    impending doom, exclaiming, 'Be it far from Thee, Lord: this shall not be
    unto Thee.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 415.
DAY PERSONAL APPLICATION: After studying this experience what lesson
    can you draw between sincerity, earnestness, zeal, and error?
[al


       How could Peter, who had just made a declaration given by Heaven, be-
     come an agent of Satan in such a short time? Mark 8:33.


       "Satan was trying to discourage Jesus, and turn Him from His mission;
     and Peter, in his blind love, was giving voice to the temptation. The
     prince of evil was the author of the thought. His instigation was behind
     that impulsive appeal. In the wilderness, Satan had offered Christ the do-
     minion of the world on condition of forsaking the path of humiliation and
     sacrifice. Now he was presenting the same temptation to the disciple of
     Christ. He was seeking to fix Peter's gaze upon the earthly glory, that he
     might not behold the cross to which Jesus desired to turn his eyes. And
     through Peter, Satan was again pressing the temptation upon Jesus."—
     The Desire of Ages, p. 416.
       Jesus now included the nearby multitude as He painted a vivid word

                                                                                53
    picture of what must be yielded to God in this life if one is to enter the
    kingdom (verses 34-38).

    EMPHASIS: That accountability and judgment face every redeemed sin-
    ner, and that the judgment will climax in the return of Christ for the inau-
    gural of His kingdom of glory is the undeniable emphasis of Mark 8:38
    and its parallels in Matthew and Luke.
      In each of these three Gospels this solemn and yet reassuring passage
    closes with the astounding announcement that some listening to Christ's
    words will see the kingdom of glory before they die. (See Mark 9:1.)

DAY 11. MOUNTAINTOPS AND VALLEYS (Mark 9:2-50). Read these verses
        before proceeding.

      1. The Transfiguration (Mark 9:2-13).
      Having recorded Christ's prediction about some seeing the kingdom of
    glory before dying, Mark outlines the fulfillment of that prophecy in the
    events of the transfiguration.
      The word transfigured was drawn from the Greek word metamorphoo,
    meaning "to be changed into another form." There on the mountain, di-
    vinity flashed through humanity, revealing the luminous glory Jesus had
    in heaven before the incarnation. The description given in Matthew 17:2
    and in Mark 9:3 resembles the description of Christ given in Daniel 10:5, 6
    and Revelation 1:13-15.

      Why were Moses and Elijah selected for this privilege of communing with
    Jesus as He moved under the shadow of the cross?

       "Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ's
    victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come forth
    from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been trans-
    lated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be liv-
    ing upon the earth at Christ's second coming, and who will be 'changed,
    in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.' . . . Upon the
    mount the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature,—Christ
    the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the
    translated ones."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 421, 422.

      What impact did this event leave on the heart of Peter? 2 Peter 1:16-21.



      Consider and comment on the purpose and the timing of the remarkable
    event—the transfiguration. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 422-425.)




    54
DAY     2. A Demon-possessed Boy (Mark 9:14-29).

El      One wonders whether inspiration has some deep reason for taking us to
      the heights and, within minutes, for plunging us back to the loathsome
      depths of human despair.
        Peter's suggestion that a shrine be made for the transfiguration group
      was the confused expression of a man just awakened from sleep and over-
      whelmed by the glory of the transfiguration. He was so afraid that he did
      not respond rationally. But what a contrast!

        What scene met our Lord upon His descent from the mountain with the
      three favored disciples?




         Consider the feelings listed below that filled the hearts of those present at
      the foot of the mountain. Then ask yourself how many of them you person-
      ally are wrestling with today?
                       Perplexity           Disappointment
                       Humiliation          Doubt
                       Contempt             Fear
        Doubtless the evil spirits at the foot of the mountain knew that they
      could not withstand the presence of the Lord when He should arrive. Yet
      notice that they pushed their advantages to the hilt, embarrassing the
      nine apostles left behind and doubtless feeling left out. They used every
      moment of the scene to create impressions of failure in the minds of the
      people regarding Christ. They also were doing all possible to destroy the
      impact of the great confession by sowing seeds of doubt in the minds of
      the disciples.
        But suddenly the atmosphere changed. Jesus was there. It was like
      when your mechanically-minded friend happened along when your car
      had broken down while on the road. Or when you were in a strange place
      and not sure of what to do or where to go, then you met an old acquain-
      tance who knew the area well.

        How did Jesus demonstrate that He understood fully all that had been
      going on? Verses 14-22.


         The key words here are those that took place between Jesus and the
      father of the possessed boy. And they are words upon which our eternal
      life depends. The father's request and explanation of the boy's needs
      concluded with the words: "If thou canst do any thing, have compassion
      on us, and help us" (verse 22). Jesus placed the responsibility right back
      on him, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believ-
      eth" (Verse 23). (Emphasis supplied.)


                                                                                    55
         The brave father could converse on abstracts and philosophies no
      more. His son! His child! He might die, Lord! And he cried out. The
      shame for a man to cry or show emotion (if it was a shame in Jesus' coun-
      try) was forgotten. The healing of the boy was up to him—the father.
         The father was crying, his tears were blocking his vocal chords, he
      choked on them. "Lord [loudly], Lord! [louder] I do believe—but not
      enough. Perhaps not enough to make it possible for You to heal my boy. I
      just don't have enough. 0 God, help Thou mine unbelief!"
         And suddenly it was over (verses 25-27). What about us and our great
      needs in life? What can we do? What hope is there?

      SPECIAL PROMISE: "Faith comes by the word of God. Then grasp His
      promise, 'Him that cometh to Me I will in nowise cast out.' John 6:37.
      Cast yourself at His feet with the cry, 'Lord, I believe; help Thou mine
      unbelief.' You can never perish while you do this—never."—The Desire
      of Ages, p. 429.

DAY     3. Secret Journey (verses 30-32).
        Again the Lord withdrew from the crowds—insincere or sincere—in
:6]   order to minister to those whom God had given Him as His followers. His
      major purpose at this stage in His ministry was to instruct the disciples
      rather than to labor for the multitudes. He was trying to prepare them for
      the scenes just ahead. But this was still something they would rather not
      understand.

        4. Humility and Forgiveness (verses 33-50).
        This may be one of the simplest but one of the most profound and chal-
      lenging of the Lord's teachings for us to believe, accept, and practice.

         In the light of the conversation of recent days among the Twelve (see
      verses 33, 34) why did they fmd Christ's words about childlikeness so ut-
      terly distasteful and unacceptable?



        If our lack of faith is a primary hindrance to Christ's healing of soul or
      body, what need might be a close second? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 435,
      436 and Matt. 18:3, 4.)



DAYTHINK IT THROUGH: For what level of sacrifice should we cheerfully

El volunteer in order to reduce hindrances to our own salvation and that of
   those who cannot yet speak or choose for themselves—our young children?


      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages, chap-
      ter 48, "Who Is the Greatest?" pages 432-442.



      56
SUMMARY: Is it unbelievable that the shadows of the cross contain
some of the richest presentations of truth yet? Could it be that the focus
of the cross is the focus of Heaven's richest blessings? Think on these
things. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 429-431.)

APPLICATION: Pray that God will lead you to understand and apply
these inspired words: "Any habit or practice that would lead into sin, and
bring dishonor upon Christ, would better be put away, whatever the sac-
rifice. That which dishonors God cannot benefit the soul. The blessings
of heaven cannot attend any man in violating the eternal principles of
right. And one sin cherished is sufficient to work the degradation of the
character, and to mislead others. If the foot or the hand would be cut off,
or even the eye would be plucked out, to save the body from death, how
much more earnest should we be to put away sin, that brings death to the
soul!"—The Desire of Ages, p. 439.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 10:1-52; 14:1-11.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the
    chief priests, to betray him unto them. And when they heard it, they
1   were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he
    might conveniently betray him" (Mark 14:10, 11).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: In the midst of loving service to people from
many walks of life the Master is steadily moving toward the betrayal by
Judas Iscariot.

INTRODUCTION: We have come to expect from Mark a series of ac-
counts of swift-moving events that portray Jesus as the answer to the
world's every need. In the midst of performing typical acts of mercy and
compassion that were shared with all ages and all classes of people, our
Lord tried yet again to prepare His disciples through the use of simple,
direct language for the final traumatic events that awaited Him and them.
   In the process, many human weaknesses which become handicaps to
the gospel showed up in the disciples and are presented by Mark with
biblical candor. The ultimate weaknesses recorded show up in Judas
Iscariot and Peter. These two had much in common, in strengths and in
weaknesses—resembling many of us. But Judas was to betray the Re-
deemer through a complex scheme designed cleverly to enrich himself
and to force the Lord to declare Himself a conquering Messiah at the
same time. Peter ended up denying his Lord and almost lost his hold on
faith.
  In the cases of James and John—with their mother's evident support—
and the rich young ruler we see three who were too amibitious for their


58
    own eternal good. Unless selfishness could be leached out of their hearts,
    they would meet spiritual tragedy.
       The Lord also is reported as saying some straight things about marriage
    and divorce, the place of little children in the life of the church, and the
    danger of trusting in riches.
       Tender dealings with Bartimaeus, with Mary, and with Simon (Luke
    7:40-47) demonstrate how our Lord never needlessly wounded even the
    most spiritually crude and ignorant among those He met and how deli-
    cately He touched the sensitive, responsive soul; thereby sheltering the
    flame of life which His own love had kindled.
       And Judas—poor, self-deceived, ambitious, and crooked Judas. How
    highly he esteemed his own cleverness! The world would owe the revela-
    tion of the Messiah to him, he thought. But his clever, scheming mind
    missed several crucial points. He saw his ambition turn to ashes. Reality
    and horror drove him to the end of a rope that broke—and gave us a
    graphic picture of the results of human scheming.
       Surely it would be hard for any one of us not to find something in this
    lesson that will meet a real personal need.

DAY I. GALILEE TO SAMARIA (Mark 10:1). Read before proceeding.

       Leaving Galilee for Samaria and Peraea.
       Luke becomes the substantial source for all that happened to Jesus as
    He left Galilee and passed through Samaria to that part of Palestine on the
    eastern side of the Jordan from Judea. A future lesson quarterly will con-
    centrate on what Luke's Gospel has to say about this period in Christ's
    life.
       We pick up the story with Christ's final approach to Jerusalem in what
    is sometimes called His later Judean ministry. Jesus is confronted, typi-
    cally and everywhere, by opposition, unbelief, and temptation.

    11. MARRIAGE, CHILDREN, AND A YOUNG RULER (Mark. 10:2-31).
        Read these verses before proceeding.

      1. Marriage and Divorce (verses 2-12).
       Some will be eager to study this portion of our lesson today; others
    may approach this study with great pain; still others with anguish about
    the future. This was a hard saying when Jesus spoke it; it is a hard saying
    now to those who feel they cannot live by it. But the questions that follow
    need to be taken into consideration concerning the Christian and mar-
    riage:

      How carefully and for how long was there a building of a foundation for
     marriage?

       How much common background did the husband and the wife share—
     such as interests, goals, ideals, life-style, and home relationships?

       How dedicated to building a Christian home were the partners?


                                                                             59
        What economic prospects did they have? Must she work? Did they want a
      family? Why?

        Customs and standards vary from country to country and culture to
      culture. In Bible times adultery was punishable by death. (See Lev.
      20:10.) And the parents tended to choose the partners in a marriage.
         Difficulties with Christ's teaching regarding divorce begin when one
      partner or both wishes to remarry without Bible grounds—where there
      has been no adultery.
         Then there are the subtle ways of toying with the committing of adul-
      tery—but in a whitewashed way—by lustful looks, by proximity, by be-
      ing at some events regularly, by unflattering comments about respective
      partners, by sharing confidences that should remain strictly between hus-
      band and wife, and by offered sympathy or leading flattery.
         What happens is that the early courtship that led to marriage is allowed
      to wither and a new, exhilarating, and flattering courtship opens up.

DAY      Study the following brief list of guidelines for a solid and joyous mar-
      riage: (Based on The Adventist Home, pp. 105-113.)

        1. Make Christ first and last and best in everything. As your love for
      Him increases your love for each other will grow deeper and stronger.
        2. Seek to discover the excellencies rather than the defects.
        3. Cultivate patience by practicing patience.
        4. Do not try to compel each other to do as you wish. Be kind in speech
      and gentle in action.
        5. Love cannot exist long without expression in words and deeds.
        6. Too many cares and burdens are brought in and too little of natural
      simplicity and peace and happiness is cherished. Thankful hearts and
      kind looks are more valuable than wealth and luxury.
        7. It is the little attentions, the numerous small incidents, and simple
      courtesies of life that make up the sum of life's happiness.
        8. Your companionship in the marriage relation should be close and
      tender, holy and elevated, breathing a spiritual power into your lives, that
      you may be everything to each other that God's word requires.

           What would you add to this list?




        2. Blessing the Children (Mark 10:13-16).
        Was it just a coincidence that mothers came bringing their little ones to
      Jesus? "Jesus was ever a lover of children. . . .
           . . The Saviour understood the care and burden of the mothers who
      were seeking to train their children according to the word of God. He had
      heard their prayers. He Himself had drawn them into His presence."—
      The Desire of Ages, p. 511.


      60
DAY     3. The Rich Young Ruler (verses 17-31).

         There was a connection between what happened to the children and
      their mothers, and the young ruler's interest. The way Jesus treated them
      had confirmed the evidence the young ruler already had received, and
      now he was ready to do something about it.
         It is such a truly sad account! He was the young man who had every-
      thing. His example demonstrates that those who live in favored lands or
      circumstances need to make sure that they know where their priorities
      lie. A young man just arriving on the scene of action from the Sorbonne,
      or Oxford, or Harvard could scarcely be more favored than was that
      young man.

        What was the fatal flaw, the one ill stroke, that led the rich young ruler,
      who had rushed to kneel at Christ's feet, to leave on leaden legs? (See The
      Desire of Ages, pp. 518-523.)



      I11. DEATH AND AMBITION (Mark 10:32-45). Read these verses before
           proceeding.

        1. Jesus Foretells His Death (verses 32-34).
        We cannot be sure always where the various events described by the
      Gospel writers fit in the chronological sequence of Jesus' short ministry.
      The variables in the account do make the location and timing of some
      events quite difficult.
        Be that as it may, the synoptics (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) picture the
      Lord on His final journey toward Jerusalem at first walking ahead alone,
      but then waiting to draw the disciples close about Him again. He made
      special attempts to penetrate their tradition-bound minds with the facts
      that were as real to Him as though they were happening already. Our
      merciful Lord was trying to prepare them, trying to replace the Messiah-
      scenario of their tradition and ambitions with the realities that were mov-
      ing toward them like a storm out of a clear sky.
        Christ must die. He must be cruelly tortured, mistreated, mocked, put
      through illegal trials—all this was but a short time away.

        How unprepared could Seventh-day Adventists today be for the close of
      human probation?



DAY     2. Ambitions of James and John (verses 35-45).
        If the section just completed and the portion now before us occurred in
      the order presented, could a person's imagination conjure up a greater
      incongruity? The Lord was attempting to tell of His death. Then along
      came two of His most devoted disciples with their mother. (See Matt.
      20:20-23.) With a mother's love and ambition for her sons, she coveted


                                                                                 61
      for them the most honored place in the new kingdom and joined them in
      requesting the two spots. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 548.)
        When the other disciples heard what John and James had done, they
      were indignant. Each of them wanted the highest place for himself. But
      what displeased the disciples most was that they had not asked first! Are
      we indignant when we read what they did and how the other disciples
      responded? Perhaps our indignation reveals something about ourselves.
      We must not be quick to judge others, for in so doing we often reveal
      what we like the least about ourselves.

        What do we learn from Jesus' reaction to James and John and to the
      displeasure shown by the other disciples? verses 38-45.



      IV. PERCEPTIONS OF JESUS (Mark 10:46-52; 14:1-11). Read these
          verses before proceeding.

         1. Blind Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52).
         When Bartimaeus used the term Son of David it implied some recogni-
      tion of Jesus' Messiahship and some faith on the blind man's part. Jesus
      required Bartimaeus to testify to his need. The Lord knew already. But
      there was to be no hocus-pocus in Christ's miracles. Everything was
      done openly and aboveboard. Jesus played no favorites and took no
      bribes.

DAY   2. Simon's Feast (Mark 14:3-9).
      At this moment our Lord stood only hours away from Passion Week.
NJ Lazarus had been raised. The ten lepers had been cleansed, Zacchaeus
   had been converted, and Jesus had accepted Simon's invitation to attend
   a feast. Simon, too, was a healed leper but his soul was not yet clean.

        Listed below are the leading characters or groups at the feast. Indicate in
      the blanks the part they each played, and how they related to Jesus Christ:

      62
       Every Mary or Simon among us can take new heart at Jesus' interest
     and tenderness. In a sense they represent us all.

        3. The Betrayal Plot (Mark 14:1, 2, 10, 11).
        The Jewish leaders had been scheming for over two years to put Christ
     to death. Fear of the Romans, the common people, and God's unfailing
     protection of His Son had held them at bay. But their anger had been
     heated by frustration and they were willing to go to desperate lengths to
     obtain their desired end.
        Judas devised what he considered to be a brilliant scheme that he an-
     ticipated would force Christ to present Himself to the Jews as the kind of
     Messiah that they envisioned. Despising each other, Judas and the priests
     made a deal. The plot was laid. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 720-722.)

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages, chap-
    ter 60, "The Law of the New Kingdom," pp. 547-551.
       Rich Young Ruler: "Jesus saw in this ruler just the help He needed if
    the young man would become a colaborer with Him in the work of salva-
    tion. If he would place himself under Christ's guidance, he would be a
    power for good. In a marked degree the ruler could have represented
    Christ; for he possessed qualifications, which, if he were united with the
    Saviour, would enable him to become a divine force among men. Christ,
    seeing into his character, loved him. Love for Christ was awakening in
    the ruler's heart; for love begets love. Jesus longed to see him a co-
    worker with Him. He longed to make him like Himself, a mirror in which
    the likeness of God would be reflected. He longed to develop the excel-
    lence of his character, and sanctify it to the Master's use. If the ruler had
    then given himself to Christ, he would have grown in the atmosphere of
    His presence. If he had made this choice, how different would have been
    his future!
       " 'One thing thou lackest,' Jesus said, 'If thou wilt be perfect, go and
    sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
    heaven: and come and follow Me.' Christ read the ruler's heart. Only one
    thing he lacked, but that was a vital principle. He needed the love of God
    in the soul. This lack, unless supplied, would prove fatal to him; his
    whole nature would become corrupted. By indulgence, selfishness would
    strengthen. That he might receive the love of God, his supreme love of
    self must be surrendered."—The Desire of Ages, p. 519.

      SUMMARY: This account has all the ingredients of great drama. Truth is
      stranger than fiction. Christ's life and ministry was moving to its inevita-
      ble climax and our salvation was about to be sealed.

      APPLICATION: Jesus loved children and showed an interest in them.
      How can you do so? Here is a suggestion: If you are not now involved in a
      children's division, visit one next Sabbath. See what you can do to help
      out. It might be telling a story, doing a bulletin board, supplying materials
      or furniture. But do something that will help you get involved with taking
      an interest in the children in your church.

The Beginning of the End
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 11:1 to 12:17.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved,
    he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son"
1   (Mark 12:6).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Jesus openly called attention to those words and
deeds that would seal His doom in the Jewish Sanhedrin. The lines were
being more clearly drawn between Jesus and the authorities each day.
Soon the people would have to choose between these two contending
authorities. The consequences of such a choice might well be eternal.

INTRODUCTION: This week we will be studying about the beginning of
the end of the life and ministry of our beloved Lord and Saviour. The
lights and shadows grew in intensity in those few remaining days before
the cross. The great excitement and nationalistic feelings surrounding the
triumphal ride into Jerusalem could be matched with the heavenly grief
Jesus expressed in the acted parable of the fruitless fig tree. The chal-
lenge to the irresistible authority which Jesus exercised in having to
cleanse the temple the second time was matched with His veiled warning
to the Jewish leadership that, if heeded, might have saved them from na-
tional suicide. In the dramatic words of the parable of the wicked hus-
bandmen, the Jewish rulers were depicted as plotting Christ's arrest, con-
demnation, and death. That they recognized themselves in His
description is stated in Mark 12:12.
   Finally, the leaders probably revealed more than they thought in asking
whether it was lawful to pay taxes or tribute to Caesar. Much as they
hated Caesar and all that he represented, they would gladly accuse the
Christ—one of their own people—before Caesar if that were the only way
to rid the world of Him.
   As usual, Jesus saw through the trap they had set for Him. But in His
great love He did more than sidestep the trap. He enunciated in simple

    words a profound principle of truth, the full meaning and application of
    which still has not been exhausted.
     What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus our Lord!

DAY I. TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY (Mark 11:1-26). Read these verses before
        proceeding.

        1. The Triumphal Entry (verses 1-11).
        Never did the sun arise on a more glorious morning nor on a more pic-
     turesque pageant. Fronds plucked from palm trees and outer garments
     laid in the dusty road hailed the Son of David as King of kings and Lord of
     lords. Jesus, veiled in His peasant's robe, sat upon an unridden ass's foal
     led by one raised from the dead. Praises rang out from those who had
     been dumb. Those who had been crippled danced about Him. He was
     hailed by children's voices raised in joyous hosannas. There never had
     been such a coronation procession. And Jesus allowed it all. Prophecy
     must be fulfilled and the attention of the world must now be drawn to Him
     and to His final march to Golgotha. Word concerning Him must be car-
     ried back wherever Jews had been dispersed.
        Priests and rulers were passed by when the birth of the Lord was an-
     nounced. Where were they at His triumphal entry? They were there, as
     we shall see, but not among those who celebrated his kingship.
        From Luke 19:39-44 we learn of the climax of this day and of Christ's
     overwhelming grief at His rejection by the city and people whom He had
     come to save.

        What does Mark tell us about the concluding events of Christ's day of
     triumph? (Mark 11:11).



       2. The Fruitless Fig Tree (verses 12-14, 20-26).

       What did leaves appearing on a fig tree indicate?



       Why did Christ, the Life-giver, cause a living tree to die?



        What lessons were the disciples to understand from the pretentious fig
     tree?
        "The parable of the fig tree, spoken before Christ's visit to Jerusalem,
     had a direct connection with the lesson He taught in cursing the fruitless
     tree. For the barren tree of the parable the gardener pleaded, Let it alone
     this year, until I shall dig about it and dress it; and if it bear fruit, well; but
     if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. Increased care was to be
     given the unfruitful tree. It was to have every advantage. But if it re-
     mained fruitless, nothing could save it from destruction. In the parable

                                                                                     65
      the result of the gardener's work was not foretold. It depended upon that
      people to whom Christ's words were spoken. They were represented by
      the fruitless tree, and it rested with them to decide their own destiny.
      Every advantage that Heaven could bestow was given them, but they did
      not profit by their increased blessings. By Christ's act in cursing the bar-
      ren fig tree, the result was shown. They had determined their own de-
      struction."—The Desire of Ages, p. 584.
         Mark identified Peter as the one who called the Lord's attention to the
      withered tree the next morning.

DAY      What reasons can you offer for Christ's introduction of His teaching
      about the power of faith and the need to exercise forgiveness at this time and
      in this particular context? (See verses 23-26.)


         What does it say about our heart condition when we bear "nothing but
      leaves" for the Lord?



        3. The Temple Cleansed Again (verses 15-19).
        It seems human to forget even that which the Lord of heaven has told
      us. Near the beginning of His short ministry Christ cleansed His Father's
      house (John 2:13-17), exercising something of His divine authority that
      will be manifested on judgment day. Now, in the closing week of His
      ministry—during His passion—He found the temple desecrated as be-
      fore. Again, He protested and drove the thieving merchants out.

        Why would Jesus trouble to cleanse the temple again when the merchants
      forgot so soon, and Jesus would soon be gone from the earth? Consider that
      He accepted the role of King at the triumphal entry. How should the King
      act in His Father's house? (See The Desire of Ages, p. 590.)



         What "merchandise" that desecrates the soul can be stored in the hearts
      of God's people today?



DAY 11. THE QUESTION OF AUTHORITY (Mark 11:27 to 12:17). Read these
         verses before proceeding.

         1. Jesus' Authority Challenged (Mark 11:27-33).
         In following Mark's narrative covering these opening days of Passion
      Week, we notice how many times the Lord has withdrawn Himself from
      the crowds so that He might have time in a secluded spot in the moun-
      tains for entire nights of prayer and contemplation. The devil was moving
      his forces in for the final confrontation in which everything was at stake
      for both Christ and Satan. The effects of this battle would be eternal.

      66
               W                               Wx 11VOthliki Ulla) MI
        On one of His returns to Jerusalem and the temple precincts the Lord
      was accosted once again by Jewish leaders. They wished to challenge the
      source and nature of His authority.

        Why do you suppose that Jesus declined to answer their questions di-
      rectly?



         Until this point in time the rulers had been asking for signs of His author-
      ity. Why did they now demand some statement as to His authority?
         "Three years before, they [the Sanhedrin] had demanded a sign of His
      Messiahship. Since that time He had wrought mighty works throughout
      the land. He had healed the sick, miraculously fed thousands of people,
      walked upon the waves, and spoken peace to the troubled sea. He had
      repeatedly read the hearts of men as an open book; He had cast out de-
      mons, and raised the dead. The rulers had before them the evidence of
      His Messiahship. They now decided to demand no sign of His authority,
      but to draw out some admission or declaration by which He might be
      condemned."—The Desire of Ages, p. 593.

      NOTE the method Christ used to avoid giving a direct answer to their chal-
      lenge (verse 29-33).

        The real issue was that the Jewish rulers, who had quailed before the
      authority of the righteously indignant Christ, were unwilling to acknowl-
      edge His divinity and Messiahship.

      PERSONAL APPLICATION: Is there anything in my life today about
      which I am under conviction, but that I am covering by quibbling over the
      authority of inspiration?

DAY      2. The Wicked Husbandman (Mark 12:1-12).

la       At this juncture in Mark's account the Lord presented a parable that
      illustrated Israel's failure to bring forth the fruits of righteousness. Mat-
      thew alone records the parable about the two sons who went to work in
      the father's vineyard (Matt. 21:28-32). Because it provides something of
      an introduction to the parable of the wicked husbandmen—one of the few
      parables recorded by Mark—it would be helpful to read Matthew's par-
      able first. •
         There is nothing complicated or obscure about the parable of the
      wicked tenants that Mark recorded. It would almost have to remind de-
      vout readers of the Old Testament of the song in Isaiah (5:1-7). The par-
      allel is so close.

        Study Mark's account of the main characters and objects spoken of in the
      parable and then match with what you understand each to represent. After




                                                                                   67
doing the matching exercise write a short paragraph applying the parable
to both the immediate hearers and the church today. (Use a Bible commen-
tary or The Desire of Ages, pp. 596-600.)

     Application to immediate hearers:



     Application to the church today:



   In a few words of final appeal Jesus spoke of an Old Testament illustra-
tion of a discarded stone that had endured every test of the elements and
of men, and proved in the long run to be the cornerstone of the first tem-
ple built by Solomon.
   The prophet Isaiah had been led to write of it (8:13-15; 28:16). And
Jesus used the familiar incident to represent Himself as the long-ne-
glected Cornerstone of the Hebrew economy. But more, He is the foun-
dation upon which the salvation of the entire world can rest if only people
were willing to believe and accept.

STRONG CONSOLATION: "In infinite wisdom, God chose the founda-
tion stone [see Isa. 8:13-15; 28:16], and laid it Himself. He called it 'a sure
foundation.' . . . Christ is a 'tried stone.' . . . He has borne every test.
He has endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his poster-
ity, and has come off more than conqueror of the powers of evil. He has
borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In Christ the
guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation. All who make
Him their dependence rest in perfect security."—The Desire of Ages, pp.
598, 599.
   Tragically, with reference to Jew and Gentile alike, Christ will prove to
be—in Peter's words (1 Peter 2:3-8)—either a rock of salvation or a rock

        Training in etiquette and deportment may help to make us graceful of
      manner, but without a faith/submission/repentance/obedience relation-
      ship to the Rock, Christ Jesus, none of us can ever be a living stone in the
      temple of the Lord. The prospect either thrills or chills, depending upon
      our choice. The Jewish leaders turned away.

DAY      3. Tribute to Caesar (Mark 12:13-17).
         Each of the three Gospel writers records this incident of the challenge
      brought to Christ by the Pharisees and Herodians. It seems that in these
      last few days of Jesus' life His enemies sent wave upon wave of spies and
      scholars with questions and issues designed to lead Him to make some
      statement, to goad Him to a claim that could be used for His joint con-
      demnation by Jewish and Roman rulers alike. They opened with flatteries
      (verse 14) designed to break down Jesus' guard.

        When those who have been our traditional enemies suddenly begin to
      speak well of us and actually bestow favors upon us, whose guise should we
      recognize? (Compare Matt. 5:10-12; Luke 6:26; and other passages.)



        What hypocrisy lay behind the apparent concern of these leaders for the
      payment of taxes to the hated Roman occupants of their fatherland?



        How true were the flattering words offered to Jesus? How will those
      words stand in the judgment day? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 601-602.)



         What was Christ's simple and practical method for taking the spring out
      of the trap set for Him? (See Mark 12:15-17.)


        "Christ's reply was no evasion, but a candid answer to the question.
      Holding in His hand the Roman coin, upon which were stamped the name
      and image of Casear, He declared that since they were living under the
      protection of the Roman power, they should render to that power the
      support it claimed, so long as this did not conflict with a higher duty. But
      while peaceably subject to the laws of the land, they should at all times
      give their first allegiance to God.
        "The Saviour's words, 'Render . . unto God the things that are
      God's,' were a severe rebuke to the intriguing Jews. Had they faithfully
      fulfilled their obligations to God, they would not have become a broken
      nation, subject to a foreign power. No Roman ensign would have waved
      over Jerusalem, no Roman sentinel would have stood at her gates, no
      Roman governor would have ruled within her walls. The Jewish nation
      was then paying the penalty of its apostasy from God."—The Desire of
      Ages, p. 602.

                                                                                69
    THINK IT THROUGH: How should this principle of giving Caesar his due
    apply in the part of the world where you live?


DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages, chap-
®ter 63, "Thy King Cometh," pages 569-579.

    SUMMARY: The greater and more frequent the crisis, the more urgent
    and constant is the need of prayer. Our Saviour recognized this clearly,
    and we can only exceed Him in our need. But our tendency is to feel that
    we have less time for prayer in the midst of crises that we face.
      Chronologically, we are well into Passion Week, which will culminate
    in the cross and the tomb. With amazement we follow the unfailing, calm
    footsteps of our Lord and listen to His final words of wisdom.
       We have to go out of the Gospel of Mark to get some events and
    settings. But Mark seems to be always there with some little detail no one
    else has noted. It is action with Mark, to the end. And the end is very
    near. We are in the beginning of the end for our Lord. Who knows? Possi-
    bly also for ourselves.

    APPLICATION: There is much in this lesson that demands personal ap-
    plication to ourselves and to our church. For instance, what lessons are
    to be applied from Christ's cleansing of the temple? What practices need
    to be expelled from our lives? Are there things going on in your particular
    church that are not in harmony with God's will for His sanctuary? Can
    you suggest improvements that would make your church services more
    worshipful?

INTRODUCTION: Unbelievable as it may seem, at a time when our Lord
was moving under the weight of the sins of the whole world He was
forced to deal with a continuing and unrelenting wave of critics. They
quibbled, queried, and quarreled over His every word and movement. It
would seem that He should have been sheltered among His devoted fol-
lowers in the greatest comfort and freedom of movement possible. They
should have been helping to build Him up for what was coming. They had
been informed about what was going on.
  Christ knew the work that He came to do. He knew that the hour of
betrayal and arrest was imminent and that even His own Twelve were
going to be shocked when it struck. By serving needy souls and dealing
with fault-finding scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians in the
way that He did, He left His disciples a broad model that they could
safely follow when brought into similar circumstances. His closing work
must be public in order to call the world's attention to the reality of His
death and the more remarkable claims of the resurrection.
   And so they came—the haughty and aristocratic Sadducees—to argue
their pet thesis that there is no resurrection. As sometimes is true of spe-



                                                                           71
      &maw at Um%)                                                 ikkLialio ►1Di
     cialists they indicated a blind side to some things that surely they should
     have known.
        Then the Pharisees came back with a brilliant lawyer. Surely he would
     succeed. But his efforts were to no avail. Christ and the lawyer ended as
     partners rather than as antagonists. Jesus amazed the lawyer, and the
     man was honest about admitting it.
        Jesus used every occasion to show the people their danger in slavishly
     following Jewish tradition and rabbinical practices. He must unshackle
     the people from centuries of bondage. The trouble was, they thought of
     themselves as free.
        When Christ began to pronounce one dreadful "woe" after another
     upon the Pharisees and scribes, He did so in love for them and for the
     people under their spiritual control. Jesus' actions were not shaped by
     expediency nor did they spring from irritability. They sprang from truth
     and principle.
        Perhaps the greatest human gift apart from the cross was that mani-
     fested by a widow for the misused, misapplied, preyed-upon treasury box
     in the temple. She gave two insignificant coins. Her gift, though small,
     had great significance—a significance that we should take some time to
     ponder.
        Then came one of the most complete statements yet from the lips of the
     Lord on any subject. It was a follow-up on an innocent-enough question
     asked earlier. Within the disciples, fierce Jewish nationalism was alive
     and well. Because of this the disciples handed the Lord a multifaceted
     question about the future. In His wisdom, the Lord did not sort out the
     jumble they expressed, but He did answer their question. In time, under
     His own later instruction, followed by the Pentecostal endorsement of
     the Spirit of truth, they discerned what they needed to and trusted Him to
     care for the rest.
        Little did the disciples then understand that some 2000 years would
     separate the first and second advents of their beloved Master. But their
     Lord assured them that His words were reliable.
        As we live in the end times foretold by the Lord and we have the privi-
     lege of hindsight of the centuries that were yet the unknown future to the
     apostles, are we as trusting as they? Is the prophetic preview of the cen-
     turies still valid? Or are we beginning to say, My Lord delayeth His com-
     ing?
       We must wrestle individually with these challenges this week and come
     together on Sabbath in our classes to share our renewed confidence.

DAY I. TRUTHS FROM BICKERINGS; DENOUNCING TRADITIONS (Mark

El      12:18-44). Read these verses before prodeeding.

       1. Resurrection and Marriage (verses 18-27).
       As we look back on what transpired it seems as though the devil had
     marshaled legions of fresh troops to send in against one lone Man and His
     bewildered and humble band of followers. The next group to test Him
     was the Sadducees.



     72
       @am= MD                                               (ARMY (ED WIWI
        If you have a reference work or commentary available, take a few mo-
      ments to study what it has to say about Sadducees. They were an interesting
      and unique group in the Jewish setting of Christ's day. (See The Desire of
      Ages, pp. 209, 387, 393, 405, 537, 538, 603-606, 705.)

         There was nothing complicated in the account that the Saducees used
      to try to trap Jesus. Seven brothers had in turn married one woman under
      the levirate marriage law of Moses' day. (See Deut. 25:5, 6.) But the di-
      lemma which the Sadducees thought beyond Christ's renowned logic and
      knowledge was which of the seven husbands would she be united with in
      the resurrection. If they had not exhibited their hatred of Christ, you
      might even imagine them hiding their snickers and guffaws behind their
      flowing robes.
         One item of common knowledge that gave their question some heat and
      intensity was the resurrection of Lazarus.

        How did Jesus turn aside their question? Where in the Old Testament
      would you look for evidence to support Christ's claim? (See Mark 12:24-
      27.)

        "The Saducees are said to have prided themselves on being more exact
      students of the Scriptures than the Pharisees, but Jesus here asserts that
      in spite of all their vaunted knowledge of the Word of God, they are pro-
      foundly ignorant. Theological concepts based on speculative reasoning
      from incomplete information are certain to lead astray those who resort
      to this fanciful method of arriving at truth. Christians today should be-
      ware lest they, too 'err, not knowing the scriptures.' "—S.D.A. Bible
      Commentary, vol. 5, p. 483.
         The Lord climaxed His discussion on the resurrection (verses 26, 27)
      by Yahweh's declaration to Moses at the burning bush. He was Lord of
      Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—all now dead. Only the resurrection could
      give this declaration true meaning. The "power of God" will be revealed
      in the armies of the resurrected saints of all ages and the establishment of
      a new world order.
         The kingdom to come is not going to be just a patched up version of this
      present life.

DAY     2. The Great Commandment (verses 28-34).
        It is as though the devil had sent in another wave of his cohorts against
      Christ (see Matt. 22:34), and this time a bold lawyer was chosen to be
      spokesman for the group. On the other hand, he was one who revealed
      keen discernment and seemed free from the general Pharisaical prejudice
      against Christ and the truths He offered.
        It is worthy of note that when our Lord quoted Deuteronomy 6:4 to the
      lawyer He was presenting what is said to be one of the most treasured
      scriptures for a Jew. These words were part of the morning and evening
      prayer at the temple and are a regular part of synagogue worship in our
      day.



                                                                               73
       mew drruzab                                                      ga).1111.1)   (IID i
        In the light of the strict life of obedience to God's law enjoined in both Old
      and New Testaments, what application can you make to our time of the
      words of the lawyer in Mark 12:33?



        How much do we as Seventh-day Adventists convey to other Christians
      our expectations and desire that the words of Jesus to the lawyer (verse 34)
      apply to them and that we are delighted to have it so?



        3. Jesus and His Critics (verses 35-37).
        Mark alone tells us that Jesus still was teaching in the temple at this
      time. It was almost as though the Lord had to cleanse the temple of the
      error proclaimed from its chambers and courts in the same way that He
      had driven out the money changers and cattle dealers.
        Mark shows us also that great crowds were waiting eagerly upon the
      Master's words. Was it not all part of the Lord's determination that His
      coming sacrifice would be known far and wide through the multitudes of
      common people who "heard Him gladly"?

        What great basic truth about Himself was the Lord trying to teach the
      Pharisees and the crowds in confronting them with David's inspired words?
      (See Ps. 110:1.)


        The critics of the Lord were silenced. The common people had to be
      released from their fear of the Pharisees and rulers in order that they
      might dare to contemplate the glorious identity of the Man from Naza-
      reth.

DAY     4. Woes on Scribes and Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40).

0       Jesus continued what must have been one of the most unpleasant tasks
      of His ministry. In the fuller presentation outlined in Matthew 23 we find
      the Lord declaring woe upon woe on the scribes and Pharisees.

         How do you account for this seeming bursting of the dam of Jesus' vehe-
      ment condemnation of the self-appointed (as opposed to called of God, like
      the priest or prophet) spiritual leaders of the Jewish people? (See The Desire
      of Ages, pp. 611-614, 619, 620.)



        5. Wealth in a Widow's Mites (Mark 12:41-44).
        In this story Jesus comments on the attitudes that stood behind the acts
      of religious service that He had witnessed. One wonders if there is any-
      thing new left in this well-worn account of the widow's mites, used for
      centuries to stir the flagging generosity of the church in support of its
      ministry and outreach. Perhaps we can risk a question such as this:

      74
                                                                Le 'ac aft WM
         If the priests were in such close financial league with the money changers
      and cattle dealers that Christ had to cleanse the temple twice, how wise was
      it for the widow to entrust all she had to the temple treasury?


         Lloyd John Ogilvie offers an interesting perspective on the account of
      the mites: "I believe that Jesus was profoundly comforted by what He
      saw in the woman's gift of self. Could it be that for a moment . . . He saw
      the sacrificial gift of His own life? The shadow of the cross loomed over
      Him. . . . Would God care? . . . Would God honor His faithfulness and
      raise Him up and clear the air with the triumphant blast of the Resurrec-
      tion?"—Lloyd J. Ogilvie, Life Without Limits (Waco, Texas: Word, Inc.,
      1975), pp. 230, 231.

DAY 11. PREVIEW OF THE CENTURIES (Mark 13:1-37). Read these verses
        before proceeding.

        1. What Is Coming? (verses 1-4).

        What attitude toward Judaism and its future do you see in the steps the
      disciples took to call Christ's personal attention to the massive stones of the
      temple? (They remembered Christ's words in Matthew 23:38.)


         When Christ indicated to the disciples and the surrounding crowds that
      the huge stones that made up the wall of the temple would all be thrown
      down it seemed impossible to them. Later, on the Mount of Olives, they
      plied the Lord with a cluster of questions about His predictions.
         We Seventh-day Adventists, along with our prophetic forefathers of the
      Christian era, have understood that the Lord covered the whole Christian
      era with His reply. This illustrates the principle of prophetic interpreta-
      tion followed by main-stream Protestantism (including the English Puri-
      tan divines) for hundreds of years and adopted by the Millerites from the
      British and European advent awakening of the early nineteenth century.

      THINK IT THROUGH: Were we to abandon the year-day principle that
      forms the backbone of traditional prophetic interpretation, where would
      that place us?

        There are many dual applications to the words of Jesus here and in
      Matthew 24 and Luke 21, and we find help on them in L. E. Froom's
      Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald
      Publishing Association, 1950), volume 1, pages 141 to 144, and in The
      Desire of Ages, pages 628 to 636. (See the additional reading suggestion at
      the close of this lesson.)

DAY     2. Days of Tribulation (Mark 13:5-20).
Fel     In this portion of His Olivet discourse Jesus blended a presentation of
      events to affect the generation then listening to Him and the generation
      that was to see the "time of the end."
                                                                                   75
       TIMEGV Off 101011                                             [gym
        Early Christians prayed for the continuation of pagan Rome, for they
     feared the mysterious "little horn" of Daniel 7:8, 19-28 and John's beast
     with a deadly wound "healed," more than they did the persecutions of
     pagan Rome. (See L. E. Froom, Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers, vol. 1,
     p. 19.)
        The main point of Mark 13:20 is that the actual persecution of the
     nonconforming Christians by the papacy for 1260 years was cut short in
     God's providence in order to preserve a seed, a witness to what would
     become a worldwide advent awakening.

        3. Last Generation (Mark 13:21-30).
        Real significance is given to the advent signs in the heavens by their
     link with the period of 1260 days that bring us down to the time of the end.
     (See verses 24, 25.)
        There will be deceptions abroad that will be so close to truth and sound
     so much like the long-desired revival and reformation that many will be
     drawn in to them and deceived.
        H. M. S. Richards used to preach a sermon indicating where he saw the
     church in the prophetic chains of events in various scriptures. He would
     see the church between verses 25 and 26 of Mark 13 and this time.
        As the leaves of a fig tree come on during the summer and signal the
     warmth of its arrival, the church is to read from all the signs given that the
     end is at hand.

        4. Reassurance (verses 31-37).
        Having given such strong assurances and signs of His near advent, and
     the infallibility of His word, the Lord now wants His church to live in a
     state of constant expectation of her returning Lord. He has entrusted her
     with the goods of salvation for all mankind. His appeal is
     "Watch . . . therefore"! Keep on watching!

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "Everything in the world is in
    agitation. The signs of the times are ominous. Coming events cast their
    shadows before. The Spirit of God is withdrawing from the earth, and
    calamity follows calamity by sea and by land. There are tempests, earth-
    quakes, fires, floods, murders of every grade. Who can read the future?
    Where is security? There is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly.
    Rapidly are men ranging themselves under the banner they have chosen.
    Restlessly are they waiting and watching the movements of their leaders.
    There are those who are waiting and watching and working for our Lord's
    appearing. Another class are falling into line under the generalship of the
    first great apostate. Few believe with heart and soul that we have a hell to
    shun and a heaven to win.
       "The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heav-
    ens, passing over its usual round, and the heavens still declare the glory
    of God. Men are still eating and drinking, planting and building,
    marrying, and giving in marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling.
    Men are jostling one against another, contending for the highest place.
    Pleasure lovers are still crowding to the theaters, horse races, gambling
    halls. The highest excitement prevails, yet probation's hour is fast clos-

     76
ing, and every case is about to be eternally decided. Satan sees that his
time is short. He has set all his agencies at work that men may be
deceived, deluded, occupied and entranced, until the day of probation
shall be ended, and the door of mercy be forever shut.
  "Solemnly there come to us down through the centuries the warning
words of our Lord from the Mount of Olives: 'Take heed to yourselves,
lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunken-
ness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.'
`Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy
to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the
Son of man.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 636.

Additional Reading Suggestion: For those interested in a solid presenta-
tion of prophetic interpretation of the passages studied in the latter part of
this lesson we suggest the following:
   P. Gerard Damsteegt, Foundations of the Seventh-day Adventist Mes-
sage and Mission (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans Publishing Com-
pany, 1977).

SUMMARY: With the shadows of the cross deepening about Him every
hour, Jesus could look ahead to His return for His saints in glory. He laid
out the journey before the church and urged her to believe in the return
and to watch for it continually.

APPLICATION: One universal human need is our need to be appreci-
ated. Notice in this lesson how Jesus gratified this need for the widow
who gave her all. Is there someone in your church who may have little in
the way of resources but is generous in sharing them? Have you ex-
pressed your appreciation to this individual? Do what you can to provide
genuine affirmation.

     The Oisis of the Ages
    THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 14:12-72.

     DAY MEMORY TEXT: "He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible
            unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will,
     1      but what thou wilt" (Mark 14:36).

    CENTRAL THOUGHT: Gethsemane fitted the prophetic timetable. The
    choice made by Christ in eternity—to be our Redeemer—at that point
    became even more of a reality. The cup of our salvation and His suffering
    trembled in His hands. He did not have to drink it. But He could not save
    us, and rid the universe of sin, without draining the cup. The crisis of the

    INTRODUCTION: Mark moves us swiftly through the closing half of
    Passion Week. Before this week's study is over we will have followed our
    Lord in the institution of the Lord's Supper, the revealing of who would
    betray Him (already known to Jesus), the quiet walk to Gethsemane, and
    then to the sudden and mysterious agony of Gethsemane where the
    Saviour almost died for us. Finally, the series of cruel and illegal trials
    opened with one convened at night, while Peter—poor, bold, unflinching
    Peter—denied his Lord and heard the crowing of a cock. And he wept in
    shame for his boasting and in shame for his weakness.

DAY I. THE UPPER ROOM (Mark 14:12-25). Read these verses before pro-
       ceeding.

         1. Preparation for Passover (verses 12-16).
         If we did not know better, we could get the impression that one charac-

    78

      teristic of Christianity is the art of borrowing—a donkey on which to ride,
      a house in which to stay, a room in which to hold a feast, a tomb in which
      to lie. Christ knew the art of graciously receiving a gift. Doing so requires
      more tact than giving. The king has a right to ask for tribute. There is both
      humility and authority in Christ's request.

        What spiritual lessons can you draw from (a) these facts of Christ's "bor-
      rowings" and (b) from the detailed directions given to Peter and John in
      Luke 22:8-13?

        (a)

        (b)

        2. The Passover Supper (Mark 14:17, 18).
        There is much discussion among New Testament scholars as to the ex-
      act timing of the Passover celebration by Christ and His disciples. (Inter-
      ested students might wish to begin with the S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
      vol. 5, additional note under Matthew 26, note 1, pp. 532-537.)
        We can attempt to imagine the actual setting for this last Passover that
      the Lord would celebrate before His suffering and death. If we examine
      the accounts of the other Gospel writers, we gain a helpful enrichment in
      detail.
        We need to understand that it was the Passover feast that was being
      celebrated. It was almost incidental (except to the Lord) that the desired
      emblems were used in connection with the Passover meal and that with
      these He instituted the Lord's Supper or Communion service.
         The significance of this dual observance should not escape us: "Christ
      was standing at the point of transition between two economies and their
      two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb of God, was about to present
      Himself as a sin offering, that He would thus bring to an end the system of
      types and ceremonies that for four thousand years had pointed to His
      death. As He ate the Passover with His disciples, He instituted in its
      place the service that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice. The
      national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service which
      Christ established was to be observed by His followers in all lands and
      through all ages."—The Desire of Ages, p. 652.

DAY      3. The Lord's Supper (Mark 14:22-25).

         What purpose did Jesus have in instituting a new ordinance?

        "In partaking with His disciples of the bread and wine, Christ pledged
      Himself to them as their Redeemer. He committed to them the new cov-
      enant, by which all who receive Him become children of God, and joint
      heirs with Christ. By this covenant every blessing that heaven could
      bestow for this life and the life to come was theirs. This covenant deed
      was to be ratified with the blood of Christ. And the administration of the
      Sacrament was to keep before the disciples the infinite sacrifice made for


                                                                                 79
    Ligp         id1QPGs1                                         Rai= OD
     each of them individually as a part of the great whole of fallen human-
     ity."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 656-659.

       How would you relate the Lord's Supper to the rending of the temple veil
     (Luke 23:45) and the later destruction of the temple in A.D. 70?



       What strong implications of the second coming of our Lord are present in
     the Lord's Supper?



      4. The Betrayer Revealed (Mark 14:18-21).
      How many times today those in positions of authority are troubled to
    determine how much of what they know about others should be revealed
    and when. It is fascinating to contemplate that for nearly three years
    Christ had known how utterly lacking in principle Judas Iscariot was.

      In relation to the Lord's Supper, how, to whom, and when did Jesus re-
    veal that Judas had made a pact with the priests to betray his Lord? (See
    The Desire of Ages, pp. 653, 654, 720.)



         What can we learn from ChHst's patient and loving treatment of Judas?



      How could Judas sit at the table with the Lord and the disciples when he
    knew what he had done to betray his Master?



DAY H. INTO GETHSEMANE (Mark 14:26-52). Read these verses before pro-
        ceeding.

       1. Retirement to the Garden (verse 26).
       This verse contains the greatest lesson on Christian calmness and trust
    in the face of crisis and death.
       From the inspired commentary we are assured that the "hymn" which
    the upper-room group sang at the close of the joint service of Passover
    and Lord's Supper was the Passover Hallel that ends with these words:
    "0 give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for
    ever" (Ps. 118:29). (See Psalms 115 through 118 and The Desire of Ages,
    p. 672.)
       Then Christ's group moved from the upper room to the Mount of Ol-
    ives.

         2. Warnings to Peter and the Ten (Mark 14:27-31).
        As they began the descent from the city gate toward Olivet the Lord
      shared some of His most profound and pertinent counsel with the
      Twelve—now reduced to eleven by the departure of Judas to his dreadful
      task. Jesus advised again as to what awaited Him and them in the next
      few hours (verse 27). He warned of their coming failure to endure and be
      loyal, but assured them of acceptance beyond their failure—after the res-
      urrection.

        What does this say to you about the mercy of God toward His faltering
      children, weak in faith? (See verse 28.)



       Peter—loving, blustering Peter—protested his greater loyalty that
      would permit no failure (verse 29).

         What purpose did Jesus have in telling Peter that he would deny his Lord
      at the time of the cock crowing? (See verses 30, 31.)


         "Christ's solemn warning was a call to heart searching. Peter needed
      to distrust himself, and to have a deeper faith in Christ. Had he in humil-
      ity received the warning, he would have appealed to the Shepherd of the
      flock to keep His sheep."—The Desire of Ages, p. 673.

DAY      3. Gethsemane Struggle (verses 32-52).

51       There in Gethsemane the destiny of a world—if not a universe—was
      being settled. The kaleidoscope of human forces at work there merits
      careful contemplation. Mark's crisp, clipped account gives the essen-
      tials. Much more data and background are provided by John in his Gos-
      pel, but it seems only right to await the future series of lessons when we
      will concentrate on his Gospel to study the details that he gives.
         Christ proceeded with the disciples to the olive-clad slope of the
      Mount of Olives. They were asked to sit and wait—two of the most taxing
      and testing activities in a crisis.

        Why did Jesus take Peter, James, and John in with Him to the deeper
      recesses of the garden? (Consider verses 33-35.)



        How much of the human in Christ's nature do you detect at this point?
      (See verses 33, 34.)



        Notice the rebuke addressed to Peter (verse 37). Was Christ more con-
      cerned with the future of the disciples or for His own coming struggle with
      Satan? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 687-689.)

                                                                                81
       Utv CM c 0110 fti5
     THINK IT THROUGH: Why did Christ permit someone in the group to
     have a sword and to attempt to use it to protect Him?



        There has been some thought that after the rest of the disciples had fled
      from the garden, John Mark—being less known—was attempting to fol-
      low Jesus wherever the mob would take Him. Verses 51 and 52 would
      then be a report that Mark alone could offer as an eyewitness.
         Let us now turn from the apostles (who finally fled) to Jesus in the
      Gethsemane struggle.

        What do you believe was at stake (at risk) when the Gethsemane cup was
      presented to Christ three times?


         "The awful moment had come—that moment which was to decide the
      destiny of the world. The fate of humanity trembled in the balance. Christ
      might even now refuse to drink the cup apportioned to guilty man. It was
      not yet too late. . . . Will the Son of God drink the bitter cup of humili-
      ation and agony? Will the innocent suffer the consequences of the curse
      of sin, to save the guilty? The words fall tremblingly from the pale lips of
      Jesus, '0 My Father, if this cup may not pass away from Me, except I
      drink it, Thy will be done.'
         "Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity
      shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the hu-
      man race comes up before the world's Redeemer. He sees that the trans-
      gressors of the law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees the help-
      lessness of man. He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamentations of
      a doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its impending fate, and His
      decision is made. He will save man at any cost to Himself."—The Desire
      of Ages, pp. 690-693.

DAY I11. ILLEGAL NIGHT TRIAL (Mark 14:53-72). Read these verses before
            proceeding.
LIJ.4
         1. Night trial (verses 53-65).
         In our caption we have suggested that this night trial was illegal be-
      cause it was just that in a number of ways. The fact that a trial was called
      in haste and at night was contrary to Jewish law.
        Most of the men who had Christ in hand held sacred office. They knew
      the law better than any. They were trained teachers of the law.

        When the human mind determines on a course of sin, what happens to
      the knowledge of truth and reasoning powers in weighing evidence?

      Try to explain when Jesus would and when He would not answer His
    accusers and why. (See verses 55-63.)



     THINK IT THROUGH: How would we apply the principles He followed to
     modem-day persecutions?


       What explanation can you offer for the way Christ was treated by the
     highest religious officials of His day when they had condemned Him only on
     the strength of His own testimony? (See verses 63-65.)



       2. Peter's Denial (verses 66-72).
       To us it seems difficult to believe that Peter would actually fulfill the
     Lord's prediction of betrayal. At first glance a non-Christian might as-
     sume that Peter's will had been taken from him and that robotlike he just
     found himself denying the Lord without any way to stop himself.

       How do you account for Peter's failure, in the light of the great promises
     he made to the Lord earlier? (See verses 26-31.)



       What encouragement can you find in Peter's weeping when he thought
     back on the warnings of his Lord? (See verse 72.)



       What accounts for the difference that led Peter to recover from his denial
     and become a leader of the early church while Judas, after his betrayal,
     ended his own life in despair?



DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "Christ was to be tried for-
   many before the Sanhedrin; but before Annas He was subjected to a pre-
®  liminary trial. Under the Roman rule the Sanhedrin could not execute the
   sentence of death. They could only examine a prisoner, and pass judg-
   ment to be ratified by the Roman authorities. It was therefore necessary
   to bring against Christ charges that would be regarded as criminal by the
   Romans. An accusation must also be found which would condemn Him
   in the eyes of the Jews. Not a few among the priests and rulers had been
   convicted by Christ's teaching, and only fear of excommunication pre-
   vented them from confessing Him. The priests well remembered the
   question of Nicodemus, `Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him,
   and know what he doeth?' John 7:51. This question had for the time
   broken up the council, and thwarted their plans. Joseph of Arimathaea

                                                                               83
r     &Mb CO eV OSP                                          Le son
and Nicodemus were not now to be summoned, but there were others
who might dare to speak in favor of justice. The trial must be so con-
ducted as to unite the members of the Sanhedrin against Christ. There
were two charges which the priests desired to maintain. If Jesus could be
proved a blasphemer, He would be condemned by the Jews. If convicted
of sedition, it would secure His condemnation by the Romans."—The
Desire of Ages, pp. 698, 699.

SUMMARY: We have had to pass all too swiftly over these gloriously
terrible events of Christ's passion. But there is nothing to prevent a
thoughtful hour of meditation on them every day for the rest of our lives.
We might start by studying what the following statement means: "Christ
[in the Garden of Gethsemane] was . . . standing in a different attitude
from that in which He had ever stood before"—The Desire of Ages, p.
686.
   Although the Lord's actual death awaited Calvary and the cross, His
decision was made in Gethsemane, and only angel intervention prevented
Him from dying in the garden.

APPLICATION: Judas' betrayal of Jesus was premeditated. Peter, on the
other hand, was caught off guard. He was tired and found himself in a
situation for which he was not prepared. Perhaps a good share of our
failures are like Peter's. We resolve to be loyal. Then, almost before we
are aware of danger, the temptation has come. When we fail, we are
shocked and dismayed.
   What procedures and spiritual resources are available to protect us
against this kind of experience? Write out specific steps that you might
take under the leading of the Holy Spirit to help you meet unexpected
temptation.

"Num11)4 r tail
            With the
Transgressors"
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 15:1-47.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "With him they crucify two thieves; the one on
    his right hand, and the other on his left. And the scripture was
1   fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors"
    (Mark 15:27, 28).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Jesus' trials demonstrated His perfect innocence
and made clear that Pilate intended to use Him as a means of pleasing and
satisfying the mob. But the point the Roman ruler could not grasp was
that the only perfectly Innocent One was counted a transgressor for us
that we might be counted saints unto God and be transformed by the in-
dwelling of the Spirit when our hearts have been broken at the foot of the
cross.

INTRODUCTION: This week we will study one of the shortest portions
of Scripture that we have addressed this quarter. But because it climaxes
in the cross, perhaps we can dwell on its message and significance until it
performs a specific ministry in our individual hearts.
   We have a wealth, too, of Spirit-indited and Spirit-directed commen-
tary to help us sense as fully as possible the supreme moment of the cross
and what it can or does mean to each of us.
   In our study of Mark we have been thinking about the ways in which
Christ supremely meets human needs. This event is the climax of such an
approach. It is the cross that fills Christ's hands with all the goodness of
God, all the gifts of the Holy Spirit that meet the needs of His church.
   His gifts are proportionate to the task He has laid upon us. Should we
not be expecting and prayerfully "demanding" more than we do, for His
sake?
                                                                           85
      IaRtudiarisill 1=11) (11.4p fticagwvam-17                     kon 31r1
         When Christ died on the cross, certain issues in the universe were set-
      tled forever. Any trace of sympathy for the fallen angel—the being who
      had attempted to thwart Christ's work and mission—was eradicated com-
      pletely by the cross. What seemed to be Satan's greatest triumph was his
      most signal defeat.
         The cross shows us once and for all how deadly sin is. When our be-
      loved Redeemer became our Sin Bearer—being numbered with sinners—
      He became for the first time in all eternity a person unacceptable to His
      Father. Christ's dreadful cry—"My God, my God, why hast thou for-
      saken me?"—reveals the measure of the hatefulness of sin of every kind
      to Heaven.
         Christ was sin's victim. Voluntarily, the innocent died for the guilt of
      all who take advantage of His sacrifice. As you study the details we have
      been given of His exquisite suffering unto death—His dying of a broken
      heart—can you continue to love your pet sins?

DAY I. MOCKERY OF JUSTICE (Mark 15:1-19). Read these verses before
       proceeding.
rO
 ."
         1. Before the Sanhedrin (verse 1).
         Annas, Caiaphas, and the selected members of the Sanhedrin (the rul-
      ing council) knew that their condemnation of Christ during the night was
      illegal. But with the coming of day they rectified that flaw in their proce-
      dure.
         Mark's "straightway" once again suggests to us the urgency with
      which the highest Jewish council was called, presumably to legalize the
      vote of the night session. They had found Jesus guilty of blasphemy and
      therefore worthy of death. The problem for the Jews was that the Romans
      had no concern for the sin of blasphemy.
         But when people are possessed by hatred and evil spirits there is no
      limit to the steps that they will take to destroy their target—no matter
      how sacred their official position or how innocent their victim.
         There was no question of the intent of this council of religious leaders.
      Had they not been under the Roman yoke, they would have attempted to
      kill the Galilean long before they did.

        What was their apparent verdict, and why did they then have to take
      Jesus before Pilate?



       Notice that Jesus was treated as a condemned criminal (bound,
      mocked, abused) before He had been legally condemned.

        2. Before Pilate (verses 2-5).
        Because only Rome could pass the death sentence, the Jews arranged
      for Christ to appear before Pilate.
        Pilate was not an admirer of Jews. But, because they had made his
      position insecure at Rome, he could not afford to have any trouble break


      88
         U OE                           aiktirritrOMI 1U1 att? Inlitangtinie
        out. His wife apparently was a woman of principle, with spiritual inclina-
        tions. (See Matt. 27:19.) She was not in favor of political expediencies or
        anything underhanded.

          What three civil charges did the Jewish rulers bring against Jesus? (See
        Luke 23:2.)



           If there are contentions in a congregation of believers or between various
        workers in the church, what does the example of Christ's restraint in reply-
        ing to the charges brought against Him teach us about how we should relate
        to such contentions?



DAY       3. Before Pilate Again (Mark 15:6-19).
          In such situations as that in which Pilate found himself there seems to
rl3
  1 1   be a strange instinct within a mob which tells it when it has the upper
        hand over some authority figure. The mob is able to play upon the fears,
        prejudices, and self-preservation concerns of the person in authority,
        who then becomes putty in their hands. And so it went with Pilate when
        faced by the mob at Jesus' trial.
           From Luke's Gospel (23:6-12) we learn that Pilate sent Christ to
        Herod, on hearing that He was from Galilee. Herod, frustrated when Je-
        sus did not cooperate in satisfying his demand for a miracle, sent Him
        back to Pilate.
           At some point in the procedure Pilate thought of a practice that could
        be used to make the Jews happy—for a moment. The release of a prisoner
        at the Passover was intended to take the edge off the hatred of the Jews
        for their Roman oppressors. Pilate had some vague hope that the people
        might want Jesus released rather than one of the worst insurrectionists in
        Jewish history—Barabbas.

          What led the people to call for the release of Barabbas in preference to
        the release of the spotless Saviour? (See Mark 15:6-15.)


          Undoubtedly Pilate did not know that demons were in that crowd and
        that the Jewish leadership was ready to lie, cheat, steal, bribe, and
        threaten to get rid of the Lamb of God.

          What does the mob action against Christ indicate to us about the kind of
        action that will be taken against God's remnant in our time?

        by Pilate? Why did they do this? (See verses 16-20.)

      11. CHRIST'S DEATH (Mark 15:20-41). Read these verses before pro-
          ceeding.

        If we have allowed our imaginations to begin to picture all that our
      blessed Lord had suffered before the actual crucifixion we will realize
      that the cross event was the keystone in the arch of Christ's suffering for
      us as our Sin Bearer—as though He were Himself a sinner of the greatest
      magnitude. But more, He bore the sins of the whole world. He paid a
      price that makes it possible for everyone that ever lived on the earth to be
      saved, providing they take advantage of His gracious provision.
        But even while Christ hung on the cross, two thieves reacted to His
      sacrifice—the one, believing, asked to be remembered when Christ
      would come into His kingdom; the other, cursing the Lord and all else,
      thereby chose perdition. Thus Calvary, with its three crosses, serves as a
      small picture of the destiny of every person who ever lived upon the
      earth.

DAY      As a study in salvation and consequent human destiny, trace, where pos-
      sible, what happened to those who were most involved in the trial, crucifix-
      ion, and burial of Jesus. The Gospels give us some clues, but The Desire of
      Ages, fills in many more details.
          1. Annas, Caiaphas, and the entire priesthood:


           2. Pontius Pilate and his wife:


           3. Herod:


           4. The Centurion:


           5. Nicodemus:


           6. Joseph of Arimathea:


           7. Simon of Cyrene:


           8. The women of Jerusalem, weeping:




      88
           9. Judas Iscariot:


          10. The disciples:


          11. The women who ministered to the Lord in life and in death:


          12. The guard at Jesus' tomb:


          Think about the challenge of the Jewish leaders and their promise to ac-
        cept Jesus as the Messiah if He would come down from the cross. (See verses
        29-32.)
          Could the Lord have come down? On what terms, what conditions, and
        with what results?



DAY       Of what earlier temptations of Jesus does this one—come down and we
        will believe—remind you? Who, then, was behind it?
01.it


          Why did the Father forsake the Son for the first time in all eternity? Why
        did Jesus die of a broken heart? Why did He die so quickly? (See verses 33-
        37.)



           When Jesus declared in trumpet tones "It is finished," what did His ex-
        clamation mean? (See John 19:30.)



        I11. IN THE TOMB (Mark 15:42-47). Read these verses before proceeding.

          There is nothing complex to explain about the burial of Jesus. It is
        gratifying that Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, men of wealth and
        influence, were released from their cautious and almost covert disciple-
        ship in the Sanhedrin to open, unabashed, and lavish discipleship. They
        could not give enough to their Lord. He who was born in a stable was
        buried in a hewn rock tomb—the provision of wealth. The balms and
        spices provided by Nicodemus and the women were lavish.
          The sun was about to set on that awful yet glorious day. The key to the
        devil's prisonhouse of death lay in the still hands of the Saviour in Jo-
        seph's new tomb. If Satan could, he would have piled mountain upon
        mountain over that tomb. But what difference would it have made?


                                                                                  89
         That is the kind of omnipotent Saviour that we have. By faith in His
      Father nothing was impossible to Him. By faith in the Son nothing is to be
      impossible to us. Why, then, do we not take full advantage of all that His
      life and death have made possible for us? What are we waiting for?
DAY                STUDY AND MEDITATION: "The spotless Son of God hung

E     upon the cross, His flesh lacerated with stripes; those hands so often
      reached out in blessing, nailed to the wooden bars; those feet so tireless
      on ministries of love, spiked to the tree; that royal head pierced by the
      crown of thorns; those quivering lips shaped to the cry of woe. And all
      that He endured—the blood drops that flowed from His head, His hands,
      His feet, the agony that racked His frame, and the unutterable anguish
      that filled His soul at the hiding of His Father's face—speaks to each
      child of humanity, declaring, It is for thee that the Son of God consents to
      bear this burden of guilt; for thee He spoils the domain of death, and
      opens the gates of Paradise. He who stilled the angry waves and walked
      the foam-capped billows, who made devils tremble and disease flee, who
      opened blind eyes and called forth the dead to life,—offers Himself upon
      the cross as a sacrifice, and this from love to thee. He, the Sin Bearer,
      endures the wrath of divine justice, and for thy sake becomes sin it-
      self."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 755, 756.
        Sabbath a Memorial of Redemption. "Now Jesus rested from the work
      of redemption; and though there was grief among those who loved Him
      on earth, yet there was joy in heaven. Glorious to the eyes of heavenly
      beings was the promise of the future. A restored creation, a redeemed
      race, that having conquered sin could never fall,—this, the result to flow
      from Christ's completed work, God and angels saw. With this scene the
      day upon which Jesus rested is forever linked. For 'His work is perfect;'
      and 'whatsoever God doeth, it shall be forever.' Deut. 32:4; Eccl. 3:14.
      When there shall be a 'restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by
      the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began' (Acts 3:21), the
      creation Sabbath, the day upon which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb,
      will still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in
      praise, as 'from one Sabbath to another' (Isa. 66:23) the nations of the
      saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and the Lamb."—The Desire of
      Ages, pp. 769, 770.

      SUMMARY: What conclusions can you draw on the greatest event of the
      ages? Or is it the greatest? Is it greater than the resurrection? than the
      virgin birth? than all the miracles? All of these were and are part of the
      victory Jesus gained for us over sin, death, and the devil.

      APPLICATION: This lesson on the events of the crucifixion day remind
      us of the value of spending time contemplating the life of Christ. Try to
      imagine what it would have been like to be abused and spit upon as He
      was. Then try to step into the experiences of thosd who witnessed the
      awful scene. What would you have done if you have been in their place?
      What patterns of character would have directed your actions? How might
      you have acted differently than they did?

"He Els Riisen"
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 16:1-20.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "He saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek
1   Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
    behold the place where they laid him" (Mark 16:6).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: If the crucifixion was essential to salvation, the
resurrection was equally so, and we need to recognize its great signifi-
cance in this closing week of this quarter that has been spent studying
Mark's fast-moving Gospel.

                              In Galilee (15-18)


INTRODUCTION: It was not much of a task for the apostolic church to
convince Jew and Gentile alike that Jesus of Nazareth died on a Roman
cross outside Jerusalem. What involved their risking life itself was their
claim that the same Galilean was no longer in Joseph's new tomb, nor in
any other tomb for that matter for "He is risen!" That was the electrify-
ing message that the apostles and their companions had to carry to a spiri-
tually dead Jewish world (one caught up in externals and ceremonies of
religion) and to a skeptically critical and not easily persuaded Gentile
world dominated by Greek logic and reasoning.
   The fact of the resurrection was earthshaking enough in itself. There
were so many witnesses to it and they were so frightened that they bab-
bled the truth until paid to tell lies. But lying does not pay for long, and it
soon was evident that the leaders had been involved in a cover-up.
   Christ's purpose in the limited number of contacts that are reported
during the few short weeks between the resurrection and the ascension
can be discovered in the accounts themselves. He did all He could to
implant firmly in the minds and hearts of His apostles and disciples that
He was their risen Saviour who was about to return to heaven where He
would continue to do everything He could to minister to their needs and

                                                                            91
     to the needs of the growing church. This quarter we have emphasized
     how Christ met human needs when He was here on earth. In this lesson
     we learn that He continues to meet every need of His people and His
     church.
        On the basis of His death and resurrection the promised baptism of the
     Holy Spirit—to be awaited for in Jerusalem—was soon due, and the
     Saviour outlined to His disciples the kinds of things the Spirit would do
     for them and in them to advance the gospel to the farthest limits of the
     inhabited world. What He promised them He promises us.
        Some of Ellen White's most powerful encouragement to the church is
     to be found in her comments on the verses we will study this week. In the
     strength of the risen Saviour the church was to concentrate on gospel
     outreach to a largely hostile world.
        We climax the quarter with a sharing of the inevitable jab of anxiety felt
     by the disciples as they watched their Lord slowly ascend from among
     them. He, at least, would be safe from His enemies and had promised His
     followers every needed help. Indeed, two of the angels who had so joy-
     ously come to escort Christ to heaven returned from the ascending
     retinue to give the disciples, craning for a last glimpse of their Lord, as-
     surances as to the future concern of the Saviour for His followers. "Your
     Lord will be back" is the essence of their encouraging message.
        As the cloudy chariot of angels received Him out of their sight, the
     disciples began to await eagerly the time when He would return. Now,
     after the passing of nearly 2000 years, we still await His return just as
     eagerly; but, unfortunately, not as eagerly as He longs to return.

DAY I. RESURRECTION (Mark 16:1-11). Read these verses before proceed-
       ing.

        In spite of His having lived the greatest life ever lived few attended
     whatever of a funeral was given the Saviour. At that moment in time it
     was not popular or safe to be associated with Him, at least as far as the
     authorities were concerned. But the strange and frightening events that
     had taken place that Passover weekend were much thought about and
     talked about.

      Note that His crucifixion and death had been witnessed by multitudes.
     Why was that necessary?


        But all that was past. Early on the morning of the first day of the week,
     after the Sabbath had been observed while the Lord rested in Joseph's
     tomb, the women who had begun to embalm His body before the Sabbath
     hours were back at the tomb with the first crack of dawning light. Mark
     tells about it in the graphic present tense—"they come" with spices for
     further work on the body. And while they were saying among them-
     selves, Where are men to roll away the stone for us?—they looked up to
     discover that the large round stone already had been rolled back in its slot
     (verse 4).
        They thus were able to enter the tomb, only to be further surprised by a

    92
      young man in white that seemed to flash as lightning. The women were
      amazed and fearful. But the young man seemed to know all that they
      wanted to ask, and he answered their unspoken questions. He invited
      them to enter what might have been an inner tomb where some of them
      had doubtless seen the body laid by the servants of Joseph and
      Nicodemus.
         But He is not here! He is risen! According to John 20:1, 2, Mary
      Magdalene had seen that the stone had been rolled away and had run to
      tell Peter and John even before this.
         "Another angel in human form" was there (The Desire of Ages, p.
      789). He commissioned the women to go to the disciples and tell them
      that Christ had risen as He said He would. He also asked them to tell
      Christ's followers that He would meet them in Galilee as He had prom-
      ised (Matt. 26:32). Included in the instructions was a special note for Pe-
      ter—tell His disciples and Peter. Why Peter? Not because he was to be
      the first pope as some think. But because he had been the one among the
      Twelve who was the most outspoken in his denial of Jesus. The Lord
      wanted him to have the precious assurance that he was forgiven.

         Who was the first person to whom Christ appeared after the resurrec-
      tion, and what was the significance of the fact that He appeared first to her
      and that His second appearance was to the other women who had come to
      the tomb? (See Mark 16:9-11; Matt. 28:9, 10.)


        "Perhaps God chose to make these godly women messengers of the
      joyful news of the resurrection, rather then to give the tidings directly to
      the disciples themselves, because of their continuing ministry of love and
      devotion at a time when the disciples had practically forsaken Him."—
      S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 555.

        Eventually Jesus' followers were able to get all the glorious, exciting
IL,   details together—each eager to contribute his or her bit to the fast-grow-
      ing picture of the resurrection of the Lord.

        Study carefully the following list of Christ's appearances:
         1. To Mary Magdalene (Mark 16:9; John 20:15-17).
         2. To the other women after they had left the tomb (Matt. 28:9, 10).
         3. To Peter prior to the walk to Emmaus (Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5).
         4. To two disciples on the way to Emmaus (Mark 16:12; Luke 24:13-
            32).
         5. To the disciples in the upper room (Mark 16:14; John 20:19-24).
            But Thomas was not present.
            (Additional appearances after the resurrection day:).
         6. To the eleven, Thomas being present, in the upper room a week
            later (John 20:26-29).
         7. To seven of the disciples as they were fishing on Lake Galilee
            (John 21:1-3).
         8. To about 500 on a mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16; Mark 16:7;
            1 Cor. 15:6).

                                                                                 93
          9. To James (1 Cor. 15:7).
         10. To the eleven immediately prior to the ascension (Mark 16;19, 20;
             Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:4-12).

DAY 11. MINISTRY TO THE DISCIPLES (Mark 16:12-18). Read these verses
        before proceeding.

         1. On the Road to Emmaus (verse 12).

      If we had only Mark's reference concerning the appearance to the two
    disciples on the way to Emmaus, we would have missed much of interest
    and significance. Read Luke 24:13-32. Then indicate below what impresses
    you most about this story.


       "These disciples had had no prominent place in Christ's work, but they
    were earnest believers in Him. They had come to the city to keep the
    Passover, and were greatly perplexed by the events that had recently
    taken place. They had heard the news of the morning in regard to the
    removal of Christ's body from the tomb, and also the report of the women
    who had seen the angels and had met Jesus. They were now returning to
    their homes to meditate and pray. Sadly they pursued their evening walk,
    talking over the scenes of the trial and the crucifixion. Never before had
    they been so utterly disheartened. Hopeless and faithless, they were
    walking in the shadow of the cross."—The Desire of Ages, p. 795.
       But, as a result of walking with Jesus, the shadow of the cross was soon
    lifted and replaced with the thrill of the knowledge of the risen Saviour.

       2. In the Upper Room (Mark 16:13, 14).
       There certainly seemed to be an unusual amount of unbelief that
    clouded the minds of those gathered in the upper room. They had been so
    convinced that Christ would become an earthly king that they found it
    difficult to accept anything else. When He let Himself be taken captive
    and put to death, their hopes and ambitions were dashed completely. It
    even was difficult for some to accept Peter's report.
       From Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem, Cleopas and his compan-
    ion hurried back at night to the upper room. They had to give their names
    before they were admitted. "The travelers find all in surprised excite-
    ment. The voices of those in the room break out in thanksgiving and
    praise, saying, 'The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.'
    Then the two travelers, panting with the haste with which they have made
    their journey, tell the wondrous story of how Jesus has appeared to them.
    They have just ended, and some are saying that they cannot believe it, for
    it is too good to be true, when behold, another Person stands before
    them. Every eye is fastened upon the Stranger. No one has knocked for
    entrance. No footstep has been heard. The disciples are startled, and
    wonder what it means. Then they hear a voice which is no other than the
    voice of their Master. Clear and distinct the words fall from His lips,
    `Peace be unto you.' "—The Desire of Ages, pp. 802, 803.


    94
DAY THINK IT THROUGH: Do we wonder at the disciples' level of unbelief?
    What about us today? Are we limited in what we are doing for the Lord
    because of unbelief? What evidence do we want?

       3. In Galilee (verses 15-18).
       Mark does not make it clear that there is a break in time between verse
     14 and the verses that follow. Because of the parallel record in Matthew,
     we take it that this instruction was given in Galilee in connection with the
     appointment Jesus had made with His disciples prior to the closing days
     of Passion Week.

        What relationship between believing and doing do you find in the instruc-
     tion the Lord gave at that time?


       The destiny of those who disbelieve reminds us of the words spoken in
     the hearing of Nicodemus nearly three years before. (See John 3:18.)
       The Lord proceeded to promise significant signs, wonders, and powers
     to His faithful followers. And while these gifts (somewhat reminiscent of
     the gifts of the Holy Spirit listed by Paul in several of his epistles, and
     particularly in 1 Corinthians 12 and 13) could be of value and comfort to
     believers anywhere, they seem to be adapted particularly to the needs of
     those who would be traveling in unfamiliar places, eating foods from a
     variety of countries, and needing to speak and understand languages of
     which they had no prior knowledge.

       How do you feel about your openness to such endowments of supernatu-
     ral powers and gifts?



        We must not let this portion of our lesson close without recommending
     earnestly to every reader the inspired counsel and commentary that we
     believe the Spirit has given to the proclaimers of the everlasting gospel in
     these last days. (See the section entitled "Further Study and Medita-
     tion.")

DAY I11. ASCENSION (Mark 16:19, 20). Read these verses before proceeding.

       The account of the ascension found in this part of Mark is quite brief. Is
     that because the event was insignificant? No, it is one of the pillars to the
     bridge of salvation, and thus absolutely essential. Christ's work was
     shifting. The blood He had shed was to be applied to the penitent believer
     who would soon come to realize that the temple at Jerusalem was not the
     focus for his atonement. The veil to the inner sanctuary already had been
     rent to show that the priestly services on earth were ended.
       Matthew does not mention the ascension. Mark mentions it briefly.
     But Luke deals with it at some length, especially in the book of Acts.
       The ascension took place somewhere near Bethany on the other side of
     the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem.

                                                                               95
        What emotions can you imagine surfacing in the minds and hearts of the
      disciples as the Lord was taken from them?



        What is the significance to us of the phrase "and sat on the right hand of
      God" (verse 19, last part)? Also read and meditate upon the magnificent
      passage found in The Desire of Ages, pp. 833-835.


        These last words of Mark's Gospel witness to the effectiveness of Je-
      sus' work for the disciples and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pente-
      cost. All that we learn about Jesus and study from the words of the Gos-
      pel have little meaning until they are put to work in the fulfillment of
      Christ's great commission. Is there not much food for thought in the fact
      that the preaching of the Word was confirmed by the signs given, rather
      than the reverse?

DAY   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages, chap-
      ter 86, entitled, "Go Teach All Nations," pages 818-828. Pages 821-825
®     deal especially with the verses from Mark, and it seems that they offer a
      particular mandate to those who carry the messages of the three angels to
      the world.
         Ascension. "As the place of His ascension, Jesus chose the spot so
      often hallowed by His presence while He dwelt among men. Not Mount
      Zion, the place of David's city, not Mount Moriah, the temple site, was to
      be thus honored. There Christ had been mocked and rejected. There the
      waves of mercy, still returning in a stronger tide of love, had been beaten
      back by hearts as hard as rock. Thence Jesus, weary and heart-burdened,
      had gone forth to find rest in the Mount of Olives. The holy Shekinah, in
      departing from the first temple, had stood upon the eastern mountain, as
      if loath to forsake the chosen city; so Christ stood upon Olivet, with
      yearning heart overlooking Jerusalem. The groves and glens of the moun-
      tain had been consecrated by His prayers and tears. Its steeps had echoed
      the triumphant shouts of the multitude that proclaimed Him king. On its
      sloping descent He had found a home with Lazarus at Bethany. In the
      garden of Gethsemane at its foot He had prayed and agonized alone.
      From this mountain He was to ascend to heaven. Upon its summit His
      feet will rest when He shall come again. Not as a man of sorrows, but as a
      glorious and triumphant king He will stand upon Olivet, while Hebrew
      hallelujahs mingle with Gentile hosannas, and the voices of the redeemed
      as a mighty host shall swell the acclamation, Crown Him Lord of all!
         "Now with the eleven disciples Jesus made His way toward the moun-
      tain. As they passed through the gate of Jerusalem, many wondering eyes
      looked upon the little company, led by One whom a few weeks before the
      rulers had condemned and crucified. The disciples knew not that this was
      to be their last interview with their Master. Jesus spent the time in con-
      versation with them, repeating His former instruction. As they
      approached Gethsemane, He paused, that they might call to mind the les-
      son He had given them on the night of His great agony. Again He looked

      96
upon the vine by which He had then represented the union of His church
with Himself and His father; again He repeated the truths He had then
unfolded. All around Him were reminders of His unrequited love. Even
the disciples who were so dear to His heart, had, in the hour of His hu-
miliation, reproached and forsaken Him.
  "Christ had sojourned in the world for thirty-three years; He had en-
dured its scorn, insult, and mockery; He had been rejected and crucified.
Now, when about to ascend to His throne of glory,—as He reviews the
ingratitude of the people He came to save,—will He not withdraw from
them His sympathy and love? Will not His affections be centered upon
that realm where He is appreciated, and where sinless angels wait to do
His bidding? No; His promise to those loved ones whom He leaves on
earth is, 'I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' Matt.
28:20."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 829, 830.

SUMMARY: This lesson accentuates the glorious challenge Jesus left for
us: "The gifts of the Spirit are promised to every believer according to his
need for the Lord's work. The promise is just as strong and trustworthy
now as in the days of the apostles. 'These signs shall follow them that
believe.' This is the privilege of God's children, and faith should lay hold
on all that it is possible to have as an indorsement [seal, sign, pledge,
support] of faith."—The Desire of Ages, p. 823.

APPLICATION: As you have studied the Gospel of Mark this quarter
have you met in a special way the Saviour who is able to meet all your
needs? As a result are you better able to share His grace and blessing with
those who have similar needs? How will you go about doing so?

PREVIEW OF NEXT QUARTER'S LESSONS: Note the outline on the
next page that introduces next quarter's lessons. When you receive your
new quarterly be sure to read the Introduction and table of contents in

 Lessons for Second Quarter, 1985
  Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult
Lessons for the second quarter of 1985 will be helped by the following
outline in studying the first two lessons. The title of this series is "Christ
Our Hope."

First Lesson:
THE FAMILY OF GOD

   MEMORY TEXT: Gal. 3:28.

   THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Tim. 1:1, 2; 4: 9-21.

bers of God's universal family through being adopted in Christ. They
then develop a family relationship with their brothers and sisters in Christ
that is often closer than natural family ties.

   11. Timothy's Love and Obedience (2 Tim. 4:9-21).

Second Lesson:
A YOUNG MISSIONARY

  MEMORY TEXT: Eccl. 12:1.

  THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Tim. 1:1-5.

   CENTRAL THOUGHT: The knowledge of the Scriptures is funda-
mental to the training of Christian character and for successful Christian
living.

    I. Timothy's Conversion (2 Tim. 3:15).
   11. Timothy's Call and Commitment (1 Tim. 4:12-16; 6:20).
