That's right. The special projects portion ($300,976) of your Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering, First Quarter, 1983, helped erect a new classroom building for the
boarding high school in Papeete, Tahiti. The school opened officially last year.

                                            merly Australasian Division) presents some
                                            exciting and important special projects:

           Introduction to Second Peter

                    fooa
             Chr315tian§
   The apostle Peter is the author of both the first and second
epistles that bear his name. The recipients of the second let-
ter are, in general, identical to those of the first, namely, Chris-
tians in Asia Minor or in the country now known as Thrkey.
   The apostle knows and loves the congregations to whom he
writes. As with his first letter, the theme of the second epistle
is pastoral, but its purpose is different. Peter acknowledges
that his readers have been grounded in the faith but is anx-
ious for them to grow in the principal Christian virtues (chapter
1). Aware that false teachers have been unsettling the believ-
ers, he uses forceful language to warn against the troublemak-
ers' wiles (chapter 2). He presents the hope of Christ's return
as the bulwark against skepticism and apostasy, and urges his
readers so to live that they may be found blameless at their
Lord's appearing (chapter 3).

        This Quarter's Lessons
   Although now retired, Bernard E. Seton has held a wide variety of po-
sitions during his forty-three years of denominational work. Among these
positions are: editor at the Sentinel Publishing Company in Cape Town,
South Africa; Sabbath School and Medical Secretary of the Southern Eu-
ropean Division; Secretary of the Northern European Division; President
of the British Union; and Associate Secretary of the General Conference.
Earlier in his career Dr. Seton served as a teacher, missionary, minister,
and evangelist. He and his wife Marjorie have a son and a daughter, Ge-
rard and Hilary. Dr. Seton loves classical music, especially Beethoven.
He enjoys playing the piano, painting, and reading. Recognized as an au-
thority on hymnology, he has written a book entitled Our Heritage of
Hymns that has been published by Andrews University Press.

    Supplemental Book: Meet Pastor Peter by Bernard
E. Seton is published by the Review and Herald Publishing Association.
It is available at your Adventist Book Center.
   Because the Second Epistle of Peter was not addressed to a specific
community other than the general Christian community, it can apply
readily to Christians in the twentieth century. Particularly is this true in the
light of Peter's exhortation to his readers to be faithful in preparing for
Christ's return. Peter draws a sharp contrast between those who will be
ready for the "day of the Lord" and the false teachers, skeptics, and half-
hearted Christians who will not be. The author's approach in this book is
as practical as Peter's was in his second epistle. Written to encourage
verse-by-verse study, Meet Pastor Peter shows us the general sweep of
Peter's letters, the background from which he wrote, and the modern im-
plications of his long-ago counsels.

INTRODUCTION: We Seventh-day Adventists have emphasized consis-
tently the primacy of the Bible in our doctrinal teaching. We have taken
pride in displaying the biblical foundation for our distinctive as well as
our general beliefs. Doing so has been. commendable, but it also has
posed a danger. Some have misused the proof-text approach by attempt-
ing to join scattered verses or passages that may not have been intended
to keep each other company. How can we escape the pitfalls that are in-
herent in such a procedure and enlarge our knowledge and appreciation
of God's Word in the right way? The answer lies in a study of the book as
its divine Source caused it to be written. Beyond dispute is the fact that
God decided to communicate His will mainly by means of many books,
small and large, that would eventually be gathered into one all-embracing
volume, the Holy Bible. Those books are the vessels into which the Cre-
ator has poured His revelation for our study and has conveyed His think-
ing on the past, present, and future of His creation.
   This quarter we will study the Second Epistle of Peter, with a passing
glance at the Epistle of Jude. A verse-by-verse study of Peter's message
will enable us to enjoy the letter as closely as possible in the form in
                                                                           7
          which the Holy Spirit moved the apostle to write it. We shall come to see
          why Peter wrote as he did. The inspiration that came to him in the first
          century provided him with a message that is well suited to the close of the
          twentieth century. The three chapters in Peter's second epistle abound in
          high-level spiritual counsel that presents the inward law as the moral
          standard for all Christians.
             During the next thirteen weeks we should discover the background to
          counsel that previously may have puzzled us. Glimpses of the courage of
          early believers may lead us to greater faithfulness in our own Christian
          witness. As we meet the Lord Jesus Christ in the sacred pages of these
          epistles, we need to allow Him to make us ready for His coming.

    DAY I. SALUTATION (2 Peter 1:1).

            Meet the writer. In John 1:42 we find Jesus addressing Andrew's
          brother as Simon, which in Hebrew or Aramaic means "hearing with ac-
          ceptance." In the Bible record that name was given for the first time to
          the son of Jacob and Leah (Gen. 29:33), and later became that by which
          Peter would be known to his family and friends.
            At the first encounter with Simon, Jesus revealed His ability to assess
          character and potential (John 1:42). He looked into the face of His pro-
          spective recruit and liked what He saw, but also was aware of inherent
          weaknesses. However, Peter's strengths outweighed his frailties. The
          sterling qualities that Jesus recognized justified the gift of a new name,
          Cephas (Aramaic), or Petros (Greek) from which the name Peter is de-

rived. It now is thought to signify a small stone. (See Matt. 16:18, 19.) In
spite of the prominence given Peter in the story of the early church, Peter
was no more than one among the twelve disciples, and his early promi-
nence soon gave way to Paul's dynamic gifts.

  What is unusual about the way that Peter introduces himself? 2 Peter 1:1.


   Some modern versions use "bond servant" to translate the word ser-
vant, but even that term does not convey the full force of the original
word. Doulos is the common New Testament Greek term for "slave" and
is used to express the depth of Christ's self-abasement in the incarnation
(Phil. 2:7). In his epistle Peter makes no claim to primacy. Instead, we
discover a voluntary self-effacement in the presence of his Lord.
   At the same time, he accepts humbly the designation "apostle" or "one
sent." His doing so harks back to the commissioning of the Twelve whom
Jesus "sent forth." (See Matt. 10:5-8; Mark 6:30; Luke 6:13.) They were
not consistently given that cherished title until after the resurrection
(Acts 1:2, 25, 26), and some beside the Twelve were also honored by the
same designation. (See Acts 14:14.)

   Meet the first readers. The readers introduced in the second part of
verse 1 are those who have accepted Jesus as their Saviour.
   There is no boasting in Peter's salutation in verse 1. In respect to the
gospel, the apostle sees himself in the same class as his fellow Chris-
tians—in need of forgiveness and redemption.
   The words like precious derive from a political term and suggest "of
equal standing" or "equally privileged." "Like precious faith" refers to
acceptance of and faith in Christ's redemption. It emphasizes the equality
of all Christians in respect of salvation. Just as "all have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23), so "whosoever will, let him
take of the water of life freely" (Rev. 22:17).

  Through what means is "like precious faith" made available to those who
seek it? 2 Peter 1:1, last part.


   Peter briefly describes the source of saving faith. It begins with the
righteousness or right doing or justice of Christ. Christ's death leaves
God's righteousness intact (Rom. 3:26). God's law has not been done
away with in order that He might save us from sin. Eternal life is an
untarnished gift. The Father has not diminished His rightness when He
enables us to "be made the righteousness of God in him [Christ]" (2 Cor.
5:21).
   Greek construction suggests that this last part of verse 1 could be trans-
lated more accurately as "our God and Saviour Jesus Christ." The writer
is speaking of one Person, namely, Jesus, through whom the Father has
brought about our redemption. (See Acts 4:12; 2 Cor. 5:19.) This Son is
very God, the Second Person of the Godhead. It is this Divine Being
whose righteousness secures our pardon.
DAY 11. CHALLENGE TO CONTINUE GROWING IN GRACE AND PEACE
         (2 Peter 1:2).

       The same challenge as that mentioned here is found in 1 Peter 1:2. Al-
    though Peter's greeting follows a pattern that was common in the first
    century its content and authority are specifically Christian. Peter's prayer
    that his readers receive the gifts of grace and peace in greater measure
    and in higher quality than they had hitherto enjoyed demostrates a possi-
    bility that challenges us even today to reach a higher plane in our Chris-
    tian experience.
       The word translated "grace" originally stood for that quality which
    gives pleasure or joy. It became linked to concepts of beauty, loveliness,
    and what we now imply by "gracefulness." But New Testament writers
    gave the word still deeper significance, relating it to the divine quality
    that God's love extends toward sinners. Its ultimate revelation comes in
    salvation—"by grace are ye saved through faith" (Eph. 2:8).
       Peter's prayer that his readers might have an increase in "peace" was
    not so much a desire for absence of strife as for the divine gift that follows
    release from sin and its condemnation. As with grace, so with peace: it is
    God's gift, from Himself and His Son (John 14:27; Phil. 4:7). The apostle
    wishes both grace and peace to increase in the lives of church members,
    and he tells how such an increase may be accomplished.

      How may we receive grace and peace in our lives? 2 Peter 1:2, second
    part.


       Peter here uses a significant Greek word (epignoosis) for "knowledge,"
    and, in so doing, probably refers to more than a passing knowledge or a
    mere nodding acquaintance with a person. The reference is to a deep per-
    sonal relationship and a saving experience with the Father and the Son.
    This is often expressed as "experiential knowledge," that which we gain
    by intimate experience. The apostle uses that word and its less emphatic
    form (gnoosis) eleven times in his letter, as a noun or as a verb. This
    suggests that he places great value on our acquiring that knowledge. How
    diligent, then, we ought to be in enlarging our personal acquaintance with
    the Godhead!
       We gain such full knowledge through careful study of the Bible and by
    prayerfully applying its teachings. The Scriptures paint word portraits of
    the Father and the Son, encouraging us to develop such godlike qualities.
    Bible study that does not produce such holy character fails in its most
    practical purpose. Conversely, a faithful study of Peter's second epistle
    will, if we allow it, stimulate our growth in grace and will deepen the qual-
    ity of that peace "which passeth all understanding" (Phil. 4:7).

DAY I11. GIFTS FOR GODLINESS (2 Peter 1:3).

      God and Christ repeatedly are blamed by sinful beings for the troubles
    that afflict humankind. Such blame is cruelly unjust. It would be just as
    reasonable to blame Henry Ford for all who have been maimed or killed

    10
    by Ford cars since he put the first one on the road! However, we are
    aware that roadside tragedies usually are the fault of those using auto-
    mobiles and not of the inventor. The fault in our lives, then, lies not with
    our Maker but in ourselves and with the sinful human predicament.
      The facts expose Satan's lie against God and His Son. They created
    human beings in Their own image, with the potential for infinite develop-
    ment, supplying all that was needed for "life and godliness." The refer-
    ence in verse 3 indicates that they continue to supply all that is needed for
    abundant Christian living.                  •

    READ verse three through several times until you are sure you understand
    what it is saying. What does divine power provide for us? How inclusive is
    what God promises?

       The word translated godliness refers to "piety" and became associated
    by Christians with the thought of worship and thus that excellence of life
    that should be seen in those who adore their Maker.
       There is no need for argument over the identity of the Giver of the gifts.
    The Father and the Son unitedly bestow eternal life on those who will
    receive the gifts. But all blessings come to us through Jesus, "who of God
    is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and re-
    demption" (1 Cor. 1:30).

       What provision has made it possible for us to receive God's life-bringing
    gifts if we choose to do so? 2 Peter 1:3, last part.


       It is good to know that eternal life can be ours, but unless we know how
    to receive it the news tantalizes rather than assures; and God never teases
    or frustrates His children. The life-giving gifts can be ours through the
    personal, experiential knowledge of the One who has invited us to share
    in His "glory and virtue." (See 1 Cor. 1:9; 1 Peter 2:9.)
       It is made clear here that it is the divine splendor and goodness that
    provide both the incentive and the power for us to receive eternal life and
    to attain moral excellence.

DAY IV. PROMISES WITH POWER (2 Peter 1:4).

       Although, for convenience sake, we examine Peter's letter in short sec-
    tions, we should maintain continuity in our study, seeking to follow the
    writer's stream of thought. Verses 3 and 4 belong together. The "where-
    by" or "through which" or "by means of which" in verse 4 point back to
    the "glory and virtue" at the close of verse 3. Peter declares that these—
    God's spiritual wealth and generosity—already have provided us with a
    store of "precious and very great promises."

      Consider some of the magnificent promises that might have been im-
    pressed on Peter's mind as he wrote these words.
      As we range over the thousands of promises that are found in the Bible,
    there are three limitations that Peter points out that need to be observed

                                                                               11
      in order for us to understand more fully what he had in mind:
         1. The promises should concern "life and godliness" (verse 3).
         2. The promises should encourage us to be "partakers of the divine
      nature" (verse 4).
         3. The selection should be drawn largely from the Old Testament (the
      only Bible known to early Christians) and possibly the words of Jesus as
      given in the Gospels, because the remainder of the New Testament was
      either not written, not circulating, or not yet recognized as inspired.
         With these restrictions a rich selection of divine assurances come read-
      ily to most Bible lovers' minds. A few of these are listed below in the
      order of their appearance in the Bible:
              Gen. 3:15; 49:10         Dan. 2:44; 7:27; 9:24-27
              Ex. 19:5, 6              Micah 5:2; 7:18, 19
             Job 19:25, 26             Matt. 1:21; 11:28-30; 24:12-14, 29-35
              Ps. 51:17; 91:1, 2       Luke 2:10-14; 19:10
              Isa. 7:14; 65:17         John 1:12, 13, 29; 3:16, 17;
              Jer. 31:31-34               8:12; 11:25, 26


DAY     Sharers in the divine nature. In the middle of 2 Peter 1:4 the writer
      reveals God's overall purpose in giving us His treasure of promises. They
      point to the power that is available to all who wish to partake of the divine
      nature.

      THINK IT THROUGH: The fact that we are studying these lessons indi-
      cates our interest in such a proposal, but do we currently understand the
      demands that such an ambition makes upon those who cherish it? Are we
      sure that we want to become "partakers of the divine nature"? Are we
      ambitious to become as loving, as patient, as self-sacrificing as God Him-
      self? Do we want to follow the example of the One who "so loved the
      world, that he gave his only begotten Son"? Do we want to become holy,
      sinless, and unselfish? That is our Maker's ambition for us. Is it ours? Let
      this second clause in 2 Peter 1:4 probe the quality of our spiritual desires
      and evaluate their sincerity. The power for their fulfillment is inherent in
      the promises we have just reviewed.

         While the call to godlikeness comes when we are "dead in trespasses
      and sins" (Eph. 2:1), the last part of 2 Peter 1:4 pictures us as having
      escaped from that sorry condition. As noted in our study of verse 1, Pe-
      ter's letter is addressed to those who "have obtained like precious faith"
      with him and other Christians. That has been gained by fleeing from or
      turning one's back upon the defiling passions that engulf "a world that is
      sunk in vice" (verse 4, Jerusalem Bible), and that cause shipwreck to
      many who have begun to follow Christ.
         More than 80 years ago Ellen White wrote these words that are disturb-
      ingly up to date today: "We are living in the midst of an 'epidemic of
      crime,' at which thoughtful, God-fearing men everywhere stand aghast.
      The corruption that prevails, it is beyond the power of human pen to de-
      scribe. Every day brings fresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and
      fraud. Every day brings its heart-sickening record of violence and law-

     lessness, of indifference to human suffering, of brutal, fiendish destruc-
     tion of human life. Every day testifies to the increase of insanity, murder,
     and suicide. Who can doubt that satanic agencies are at work among men
     with increasing activity to distract and corrupt the mind, and defile and
     destroy the body?"—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 142, 143.

DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Desire of Ages, pages

E  139, 244-246, 411-414, 811-817, in order to appreciate better Peter's back-
   ground and experience.
      Meditate on the following:
     "It is the glory of God to give His virtue to His children. He desires to
   see men and women reaching the highest standard; and when by faith
   they lay hold of the power of Christ, when they plead His unfailing prom-
   ises, and claim them as their own, when with an importunity that will not
   be denied they seek for the power of the Holy Spirit, they will be made
   complete in Him."—The Acts of the Apostles p. 530.
      "Sin not only makes a man unrighteous, it robs him of the glory of God.
   And if you understand that, you will realize how futile it is ever to think
   that you, by your works or activities, can ever be fit to stand in the pres-
   ence of God. Before we can truly know Him, and have communion with
   Him, let alone stand before the glory of His presence, we must have
   something of His glory. However good we may be, and however moral,
   we never shall and never can develop a Divine glory. But without it we
   can never see God and never stand in His presence. . . . What a terrible
   thing sin is! It robs us not only of righteousness, it robs us of 'the glory of
   God.' What a wonderful salvation this is! It not only gives me pardon and
   righteousness, it gives me glory: 'Whom he justified, them he also glori-
   fied.' Whatever we were before, if we have this faith in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and His perfect work, we are clothed with His righteousness, and
   something of the glory of God is implanted within us. We are 'made par-
   takers of the divine nature' (2 Peter 1:4)."—D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Ro-
   mans: An Exposition of Chapters 3:20 to 4:25 (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
   Zondervan Publishing House, 1970), pp. 52, 53.

     SUMMARY: In the light of the "exceeding great and precious promises"
     we have reviewed in this lesson there can be no excuse for the Christian
     not to grow in grace and peace. But doing so demands a personal acquain-
     tance with God through Christ that comes only from daily study of the
     Word and is accompanied by a growing trust and confidence in the fact
     that God wants us to have "all things that pertain to life and godliness."

     APPLICATION:
     • What basic challenge is offered in this introductory section of Second
       Peter, and how do I respond to it?
     • What have I learned about God and personal faith from this study that I
       can share with others?
     • How can I put what I have learned into practice in my life during the
       week to come? What errors should I avoid?
     • How can I fulfill the potential of the privileges in life and godliness that
       the Lord makes possible for me?

                                                                                 13

INTRODUCTION: In Lesson 1 we found Peter reviewing the basic spiri-
tual blessings that God gives to those who accept His salvation. In this
week's study we find the apostle offering a list of attributes that all who
have accepted Christ and become candidates for the kingdom of heaven
can cultivate by God's blessing. His list merits our close attention.
Cultivation of these qualities will play a vital part in preparing us for ser-
vice here and for life hereafter.
   In the area of Christian growth, as in other major areas of development,
Jesus is our example. He grew in the natural, ideal way, becoming a
model boy who must have brought great joy to his parents' hearts. He
also "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
His example sets the pattern for the spiritual development of His follow-
ers. Each Christian is to be born of the Spirit and to grow "to mature
manhood, measured by nothing less than the full stature of Christ" (Eph.
4:13, NEB). That growth begins with birth, the new birth by which we
abandon the old and embark on a new Christ-oriented existence that is
marked by a steady spiritual growth and has Christlikeness as its goal.
  The growing Christian is engaged in a "Pilgrim's Progress" from this
world to that which is to come. Unlike Bunyan's classic, this "progress"
14
     is not delivered under the similitude of a dream, but concerns the daily
     triumphs and failures of aspiring Christians. Peter himself, with the ups
     and downs and ups of his discipleship, is well equipped by his experience
     to help guide his fellow travelers along the Christian way.
        The passage assigned for this week's study presents a program for
     progress in spiritual growth. It shows that there is no instant full-fledged
     maturity. Instead, it outlines a steady development that produces a bal-
     anced Christian character that will ensure our being fruit-bearing follow-
     ers of our Lord Jesus Christ. (See verses 8-11.)

DAY I. PETER'S. LADDER (2 Peter 1:5-7).

221 of What  underlying traits are involved in the first three rungs in the ladder
       Christian development? 2 Peter 1:5.


        The phrase "and beside this" is not an afterthought but a logical conse-
     quence. Several modern versions bring out the full force of the opening
     phrase by translating it as "for this very reason," thereby linking verses 5
     through 11 with verses 1 through 4, and making each passage more signifi-
     cant. The first four verses of this chapter deal with the Godhead's deeds
     that make our salvation possible. The next seven verses concern ways in
     which we can cooperate with God through character development. The
     motive power for our efforts derives from the all-sufficient saving acts of
     Father and Son on our behalf.
        The phrase "giving all diligence" may have become weak by
     overfamiliarity. Variant translations help restore its impact: "Make every
     effort" (RSV), "you must do your utmost from your side" (Phillips), "you
     should try your hardest" (NEB). The original word from which these
     concepts are derived is also associated with "haste" or "eagerness," thus
     introducing a sense of urgency into Peter's counsel.
        Then follows the advice that has often been described as "Peter's lad-
     der." None of the steps represents self-salvation. Each one is based on a
     Heaven-imparted attribute that represents cooperation with what God al-
     ready has done. As the Greek implies, these attributes are "placed along-
     side" God's initiative, creating a fruitful partnership for spiritual develop-
     ment.
        "Add to your faith virtue." To the initial attribute of faith we should
     exert our spiritual energies to add "moral excellence" (NASB) or "good-
     ness" (NIV). Peter urges us to cooperate with God in building "virtue" or
     "goodness" into our own characters. (Compare with Phil. 4:8.)
         "After receiving the faith of the gospel, our first work is to seek to add
     virtuous and pure principles, and thus cleanse the mind and the heart for
     the reception of true knowledge."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 552.
        "Add . . . to virtue knowledge." The apostle gives the word knowledge
      spiritual value by making it refer to the Christian's knowledge of God and
      His will. This knowledge should supply principles that guide the believ-
      er's daily conduct and spark his or her moral aspirations. At conversion
      we are given the nucleus of such knowledge, but that is not enough. Our
      Lord expects us to grow in spiritual understanding, gaining clearer in-
      sights into Christian morality and becoming spiritually mature.
                                                                                 15
DAY What relationships can be observed between the next three desirable
   qualities? 2 Peter 1:6.


         Self-control. The Greek word egkrateia, used four times in the New
      Testament (Acts 24:25; Gal. 5:23; and twice in today's verse), is consis-
      tently translated as "temperance" in the KJV. Most other versions rightly
      render it as "self-control," for it derives from kratos, "strength," and im-
      plies power over oneself, that is, self-control. This gives a wider applica-
      tion to Paul's ninth "fruit of the Spirit" (Gal. 5:22, 23) and covers all areas
      of a Christian's life.
         Perseverance. One of the most-expected of Christian virtues is "pa-
      tience." Its practice is strongly recommended, especially in the New Tes-
      tament where the Greek word occurs at least 28 times with the meaning of
      "endurance," or "continuance." The word suggests steadfastness, perse-
      verance, constancy, as well as the ability to wait. These quiet qualities are
      needed in personal and public situations.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Compare the following texts in the King James
      Version with that of a more recent Bible version to see how "patience" has
      been translated:

           Luke 8.15

           Rom. 15:4, 5

           2 Cor 6.4

         Godliness. This also is a New Testament concept that the early Chris-
      tian writers borrowed from pagan usage. The word is found only in
      1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and 2 Peter. It suggests reverence or piety, devo-
      tion to God, and has been defined as "very practical awareness of God in
      every aspect of life."—Michael Green, Tyndale Commentaries, 2 Peter
      and Jude (London: Tyndale Press, 1968), p. 70.
         How greatly we need this quality today, both in our personal lives and
      in our church relationships! It can be fostered by simple devotional hab-
      its. Brother Lawrence, in his small but mighty devotional classic, de-
      scribes this as "the practice of the presence of God." In his seventh letter
      he writes: "It is not necessary for being with God to be always at church;
      we may make an oratory of our heart wherein to retire from time to time,
      to converse with Him in meekness, humility, and love. . . . Use yourself
      then by degrees thus to worship Him, to get His grace, to offer Him your
      heart from time to time in the midst of your business, even every moment
      if you can."—The Practice of the Presence of God (Old Tappan, N. J.:
      Fleming H. Revell Co., 1958), p. 50.

DAY     Define the two final steps that complete the ladder of Christian growth.

15    2 Peter 1:7.



      16
   While Peter makes no apparent effort to rate one quality higher than
another, we cannot escape the conviction that his thoughts are moving up
the ladder of Christian excellence. Arrival at this seventh attribute (faith
being the first and the key to the rest) suggests, as with Paul's classic list
in 1 Corinthians 13, that the six preceding capacities avail little if they are
not wrapped in love.
   Pastor Peter encourages his Christian readers to cultivate and exercise
brotherly love. In Scripture this term is used for affection, shown to mem-
bers of the same community (Rom. 12:10) and should be so used here.
Happy is the church where brotherly and sisterly kindness reigns! Its
balm soothes many wounds and dissolves many smoldering disagree-
ments.
   When we reach charity or love we are on the topmost rung of the ladder
that reaches from earth to heaven; for, of all the noble traits that the apos-
tle has been recommending, this is the highest. Without copying Paul, he
is echoing Paul's thought: "the greatest of these is love" (1 Cor. •13:13).
How easy it is to repeat the musical phrase; how difficult to practice in
every situation the principle it embodies! It refers to the queen of virtues;
it denotes self-sacrificing concern and action on behalf of another. This
love flows from God who Himself is love. (See 1 John 4:8.) Godly people
who aspire to share in the divine nature must abound in such love to all
about them.

THINK IT THROUGH: As you study, search your heart for evidence of
genuine Christian love for others, be they church members or otherwise.
If you find a lack in this area, it is time for you to heed Peter's counsel and
to ask the Lord to add generous doses of brotherly kindness and Christ-
like love to your store of Christian virtues.

ILLUMINATION: "These words are full of instruction, and strike the
keynote of victory. The apostle presents before the believers the ladder of
Christian progress, every step of which represents advancement in the
knowledge of God, and in the climbing of which there is to be no stand-
still. . . . We are saved by climbing round after round, mounting step
after step, to the height of Christ's ideal for us. . . .
   "All these successive steps are not to be kept before the mind's eye,
and counted as you start; but fixing the eye upian Jesus, with an eye single
to the glory of God, you will make advancement. . . .
   "By taking one step after another, the highest ascent may be climbed,
and the summit of the mount may be reached at last."—My Life Today, p.
95.
   "You are not to think that you must wait until you have perfected one
grace before cultivating another. No; they are to grow up together, fed
continually from the fountain of charity; every day that you live, you cal
be perfecting the blessed attributes fully revealed in the character of
Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
p. 943.

NOTES:


                                                                            17
DAY 11. BENEFITS FROM PROGRESS (2 Peter 1:8-11).

3     With what firm assurance does the apostle conclude his survey of ideal
    character development? 2 Peter 1:8.


       Children often are told to do things without being given a reason. Wise
    parents and teachers realize that a child usually performs better when the
    need for and the benefits accruing from requests are explained. Our Lord
    has always known the value of such instruction and has often taken great
    care to include information with His commands. (For examples, see Ex.
    20:8-12; Matt. 5:43-48; 16:24-27.)
       Peter has just issued some stark injunctions bidding us to add one fine
    quality to another. He concludes that instruction by promising fruitage
    from compliance. If we cooperate with God by building into our charac-
    ters the spiritual gifts that await our acceptance and use, then some very
    desirable results will follow. His use of the word i f allows for the
    possibillity that not all will follow his counsel, but we need not be among
    those who refuse. And, if we do not refuse, we can be sure that the Chris-
    tian graces and the peace they bring will be "multiplied" in us (verse 2).
       When we cooperate with God in cultivating our characters in the way
    that Peter has outlined, we reap benefits that are expressed negatively
    here: (1) We shall not be "barren," a word that is better rendered "idle"
    or "lazy"; and (2) we shall not be "without fruit." Both illustrations obvi-
    ously are drawn from agriculture. The negative, of course, implies the
    positive. A personal and ever-increasing knowledge of Jesus certainly
    will produce fruit in our lives. What fruitage are we bearing?

      How does the writer assess the usefulness of those who neglect to develop
    their Christian potential? Verse 9.


      No Christian need be numbered among the unfruitful. But those who,
    having committed themselves to Christ by baptism, neglect to cultivate
    the graces listed in verses 5 to 7, are pictured as being "blind," or short-
    sighted. Failing to see the benefit and the glory promised to those who
    develop Christian attributes, they forget the commitment made and the
    joy experienced at the time of initial surrender to Jesus. They see only the
    temporal, having lost sight of the victory over sin that God's "exceeding
    great and precious promises" (verse 4) have made possible. They are in
    danger of qualifying for Peter's later comparison when he speaks of pigs
    who return to their own filth (2:22).

DAY What further fruitage is promised to those who persevere in Christian
   development? 2 Peter 1:10.


      In view of the danger of backsliding and even of apostasy, there now
    comes earnest advice. This advice is addressed to "brethren" who have
    been earlier identified as "them that have obtained like precious faith

    18
    with us" (verse 1). These born-again Christians obviously include sisters
    also. Collectively, they are later called "beloved" (3:1, 8, 14, 17), an even
    more tender term. They are urged in 2 Peter 1:5 to give "diligence" or "to
    make every effort" (NIV), to make their "calling and election sure"
    (verse 10). This exhortation confirms that we have an active part to play
    in effecting our own salvation, not just a passive one as some suggest.
       The calling comes from God who, as Peter avers, is "not willing that
    any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" (3:9).

     NOTE: This view is sustained throughout Scripture. (See Isa. 55:1; Eze.
     18:23; 33:11; John 3:16; 7:37; 1 Tim. 2:4; Rev. 22:17.)

        We are free to accept or reject the divine invitation. Those who accept
     are described as "the called" in Romans 8:28.
        Peter urges us to make certain that we do not lose salvation by default.
     He exhorts us to do all that is necessary—to make sure for ourselves—
     that our calling and election are certain or confirmed. The counsel is fol-
     lowed by a promise. If we keep on doing those things—adding the graces
     listed in verses 5 to 7 and again referred to in verses 8 and 9, and ensuring
     that our calling and election are made certain—then we shall never fall
     away. The never is emphatic. The Jerusalem Bible translates the entire
     phrase as "there is no danger that you will ever fall away"—a stabilizing
     assurance!

       What assurance does Peter hold out to those who faithfully follow his in-
     spired counsel? 2 Peter 1:11.


        If we "give diligence to make" our "calling and election sure," we shall
     find that generous arrangements have been made for us to enjoy eternal
     life. Some of the original words that lie behind that promise deserve
     closer attention. "For so," that is, "in this way" as outlined in verse 10
     where we are urged to be diligent in making certain of our calling and
     election. "Entrance" (eisodos) is the reverse of exodos, and refers to the
     "way in" in contrast to an exodus, or way out. This suggests our exit
     from Egypt, or the world, and our admission into the Promised Land.
     Such a prospect will not be realized through our own efforts, but will be
     provided by Another's generosity, and that on a truly lavish scale. The
     word translated "abundantly" is related to the word for "wealth" or
     "riches." And what is the prospect? Entrance into "the everlasting king-
     dom" that will never pass away. (See Dan. 2:44; Rev. 11:15.) And whose is
     that kingdom? It belongs to the most powerful and most benevolent of all
     rulers—our own beloved Master and Saviour, Jesus.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: For a broadening of insight into
    the value of "Peter's Ladder" read The Acts of the Apostles, pages 529 to
    533, and The Great Controversy, page 470.
      Consider also the following:
      "The apostle has presented before us the importance of making contin-
    ual advancement in the Christian life. There is no excuse for our lack of

                                                                                19

spiritual understanding. The successive steps in the path of progress are
stated in the exhortation of the text, and we must take these steps if we
fulfill the requirement of God, and become fitted for the heavenly courts.
The work of progress is not left wholly dependent on our weak human
efforts; but as we endeavor to walk in the footsteps of the Redeemer, di-
vine strength will be imparted, that the righteousness of the law may be
fulfilled in us. Help has been laid upon One who is mighty to save, and as
we strive to add these virtues, He will multiply grace, according to our
need, from His own divine sufficiency."—Ellen G. White, Peter's Coun-
sel to Parents, p. 16.
   "No one will make any upward progress without persevering effort. He
who would overcome must hold fast to Christ. He must not look back,
but keep the eye ever upward, gaining one grace after another."—Testi-
monies, vol. 6, p. 147.
   "Seize every opportunity to contribute to the happiness of those
around you, sharing with them your affection. Words of kindness, looks
of sympathy, expressions of appreciation, would to many a struggling,
lonely one be as a cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of cheer, an
act of kindness, would go far to lighten the burdens that are resting heav-
ily upon weary shoulders. It is in unselfish ministry that true happiness is
 found."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 50.
   "Our love is frequently selfish, for we confine it to prescribed limits.
When we come into close union and fellowship with Christ, our love and
sympathy and our works of benevolence will reach down deeper and will
widen and strengthen with exercise. The love and interest of Christ's fol-
lowers must be as broad as the world. Those who live merely for 'me and
mine' will fail of Heaven."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 530.

SUMMARY: The act of beginning the joyful Christian pilgrimage is a use-
ful one, but it has little value unless it is followed by forward motion to-
ward the kingdom. This is marked by spiritual growth, the development
of character traits that play a vital part in fitting us for a sin-free eternity.

APPLICATION:
o As a Christian, I need to grow. There is no danger of my becoming too
  tall! The sky is the limit. I need continual spiritual growth.
o Which of the eight qualities listed in 2 Peter 1:5-7 are strong features in
  my character? Which are weakest? What attention am I going to give to
  the latter as a result of this week's study?
o My growth should result from my increasing personal knowledge of
  and living acquaintance with the Lord of my life.
o Such growth will not take place without deliberate and continuous ef-
  fort on my part. I must be diligent, adding my diligence to what God
  and Christ have already done and continue to do for me.
o As a Christian I need to be fruitful. My personal growth should also
  benefit others.

The Ministry of
Remembrance
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 1:12-15.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
    the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
1   bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
    you" (John 14:26).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: The pastor-spirit in Peter made him urge his
friends to recall the instruction and experiences that led them to become
Christians. Anticipation of his own martyrdom lent urgency to his exhor-
tations. This reminds us of our need to remember the teachings that drew
us to Christ and into His church.


                      OVERVIEW-2 Peter 1:12-15

  Verse 12    The apostle recognizes that his readers are knowledgeable
               concerning the principal tenets of their faith, but sees the
               need to refresh their memories.

  Verse 13    He intends to keep on reminding them of that need while
               his life is spared.

  Verse 14    Peter realizes that Christ's prophecy concerning his death
               will soon be fulfilled.

  Verse 15    His fervent desire is that they will remain faithful after his
               death.


INTRODUCTION: Memory is an essential function for living. Without it
physical life might continue with other people's aid, but meaningful life
would be impossible. Memory enables us to perform needful acts, to
learn life's lessons, to profit from its joys and sorrows, its successes and
failures, from instruction and from experience—indeed, experience is
based on memory. The ability to remember enables us to love and be
loved, for without it we would start each day with totally new encounters,
never associating our parents, our children, our wives, our husbands, or
our friends with those who brought joy and support to us yesterday. With-
out memory there would be no music, no poetry, no art of any kind. There

                                                                         21
    r 0=nm                                         annisaa co     Remembrance
    would be no past on which to build present and future achievements. Our
    only choice would be to live in an empty present.
       Without memory we would have no religion, for religion is founded on
    the past, serves the present, and prepares for the future. Thus it demands
    that we remember. Memory has played a central role in bringing us the
    Bible. The book of Genesis, for instance, enshrines many patriarchal rec-
    ollections; while the remainder of the Old Testament, including the major
    and minor prophets, is firmly based on the function of memory in the
    minds of those whom the Spirit chose to serve as writers. In the New
    Testament, Luke discloses his dependence on others' accounts of what
    they had known and heard (Luke 1:1-4), while John, aided by the Spirit,
    depended on memory for the composition of his Gospel and the accurate
    reporting of his apocalyptic visions.
       In this setting it should not surprise us that, in the passage we are
    studying this week, Peter declares his intention of stirring up his readers'
    memories of the history on which their faith is based. His own remem-
    brances were clear and abundant, from the day Jesus called him into part-
    nership (Matt. 4:18-20) to the hour when his Master was taken up into
    heaven and the Spirit came to lead the infant church into action. This
    same Spirit is ever needed by Christ's followers. As this week's memory
    text indicates, He is to teach us all things. He is to bring all things to our
    remembrance, and especially to help us recall the instructions of our
    Lord. It is against this background of things past that we now turn to
    study, for our present profit, the passage in which Peter underlines our
    need to remember.

DAY I. FAITHFUL TEACHER (2 Peter 1:12).

       Pastoral concern. Although the greeting at the beginning of this epistle
    tells us the name of the writer, it gives no clue to the identity of its recipi-
    ents apart from confirming that they were fellow Christians. Because his
    letter reveals a personal knowledge of his readers' needs and a deep con-
    cern for their spiritual welfare, some think that it is not difficult to accept
    the thought that Peter was at one time their pastor. Be that as it may, for
    him they are not "out of sight, out of mind." From afar he is with them,
    conscious of the situations that confront them and giving the counsel that
    is most suitable to their circumstances.
       It seems likely that the apostle expresses his instructions positively
    rather than in the negative form given in some versions of this passage.
    Far from being in any way negligent, he always intends to keep on re-
    minding them of the importance of those matters that he has been dis-
    cussing with them. The first word, "Wherefore," may primarily refer
    back to verse 11 with its prospect of their entrance into Christ's eternal
    kingdom. But "these things" must include the moral qualities promoted
    in verses 5 to 8 the diligence that will aid their "calling and election"
    (verse 10), and the certainty of their salvation (verse 11).

       What does Peter's example teach us about helping others learn and keep
    in mind the truths of the gospel message?


    22
   As a good teacher, Peter reviews the divine plan, refreshing his read-
ers' memories, fixing the essentials in their minds so that they will not fail
through forgetfulness. It is as if he were saying, "We have nothing to fear
for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us."—
Testimonies to Ministers, p. 31. He doubtless gave them similar instruc-
tion when he was with them; but, knowing human frailty, he now commits
it to writing that they might have it for repeated reference.

  In addition to Peter's instruction, on what other assistance may we de-
pend for recalling redemptive teaching? John 14:26.


  This is a promise from Christ's own lips, given primarily to His first
disciples; but it also is applicable to all who follow Him. We are to store
divine instruction in the almost limitless capacities of our minds. Stu-
dents of the human brain tell us that the average person uses less than 10
percent of his or her mental capacity. There is plenty of room, then, for
the storage of all the spiritual instruction that we are willing to receive,
and we can build a well-nigh inexhaustible reserve for present and future
use under the prompting and guidance of the Holy Spirit. First, we must
learn ("he shall teach you all things"); then, on an ongoing basis, we must
remember ("he shall bring all things to your remembrance"). In this re-
spect, the Spirit's mission is to remind us of Christ's teachings ("whatso-
ever I have said unto you").

SEARCH AND LEARN: What were some of the memories that awaited
Peter's recall?

Matt. 14:28-31

Mark 1:29-31

John 1:41, 42

John 13:8, 9

John 20:3-7

Acts 12:3-19

   There is so much detail that we long to know, and that Peter could accu-
rately give! But we must settle for what has been given. We would like to
know more, but let us be honest. Have we exhausted all the information
that is currently at our disposal in the Gospels and Epistles?
   Our minds may be likened to a bank wherein we deposit the records of
life's experiences and the lessons that they have taught us. In addition
there is the spiritual information and understanding that come from years
of study and learning. We are free to withdraw those recollections at any
time, to use them for guidance and inspiration. We can then return them
to the bank without incurring any penalty or loss, and even with some

                                                                            23
       Lesson                                                     Remem rance
      gain. The more we draw upon those deposits the greater our wealth be-
      comes—with one condition: we must continually make new deposits in
      order to avoid total dependence on the past. An active and current ac-
      count shows that we still are in business.

DAY     Why does Peter underline the continuing need for the study of Christian
      fundamentals even by mature believers? 2 Peter 1:12.


         The writer displays great tact. It is as if he were aware of a more re-
      cently discovered fact, namely, that all we hear, read, or experience is
      never lost; it is stored away in our minds, available for recall. The trouble
      with most of us is that we are not able to recall every desired piece of
      information when it is most needed. So the apostle recognizes that his
      readers know "these things" of which he has been writing, but he recog-
      nizes in addition that their memories need to be strengthened.
         He could be, and is, writing to each of us in the late twentieth century.
      Very few of us can claim ignorance of the facts of our religion. We know
      the "fundamental truths." Many of us can quote book, chapter, and verse
      in their support. Others feel doctrinally secure but are worried by
      fightings and fears within and without. Others harbor doubts that unsettle
      their faith. Because of problems such as these, Peter sees the need for
      reminding all of us to refresh our remembrance and understanding of the
      foundations of our belief and conduct. It is not that these pillars change,
      but that our grasp and application of them should develop as we mature in
      the practice of our religion.

        What is the significance of the phrase "present truth" in verse 12?


         From the Day of Pentecost there had been a recognizable body of doc-
      trine. The word present therefore alludes to the knowledge of religious
      truth that Peter's readers then possessed in common with other believers.
      They had been well instructed, yet they still needed to have their knowl-
      edge refreshed and enlarged. Do we not stand in similar need? "Let him
      that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall" (1 Cor. 10:12).

DAY 11. FAITHFUL SHEPHERD (2 Peter 1:13).

        Conscientious pastor. As it was with Paul—" Christ's love compels us"
      (2 Cor. 5:14, NIV)—so with Peter: love for his flock inspired his untiring
      ministry. "I think it meet," or "right" (NIV), he explains, using the Greek
      word that is related to the word for "righteousness," and which in New
      Testament usage can carry high moral overtones. His pastoral conscience
      impels him to remind them of the foundations of their faith. He repeatedly
      draws their attention to the historical and moral bases on which their reli-
      gion rests. His first efforts may not have seemed entirely successful, for
      he intends to keep on stirring up their sluggish memories, or to keep on
      waking them up to what they have been taught. Such reminders are a vital
      part of a pastor's ministry. His congregation's willing response, expressed
      in renewed belief and active loyalty, is a large part of that pastor's reward.
      24
    IWAIM11041.U:
    THINK IT THROUGH: Why should Christians exercise their memories?


       No effort that we make to remember what we have been taught will be
    lost. "It is a law of the mind, that it will narrow or expand to the dimen-
    sions of the things with which it becomes familiar. The mental powers will
    surely become contracted, and will lose their ability to grasp the deep
    meanings of the word of God, unless they are put vigorously and persis-
    tently to the task of searching for truth. The mind will enlarge, if it is
    employed in tracing out the relation of the subjects of the Bible, compar-
    ing scripture with scripture, and spiritual things with spiritual. Go below
    the surface; the richest treasures of thought are waiting for the skillful and
    diligent student."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 127.

DAY I11. FAITHFUL MARTYR (2 Peter 1:14, 15).

       Death draws near. The phrase "as long as I am in this tabernacle"
    (verse 13) introduces the topic of mortality. In Peter's case he was well
    instructed on the subject. Although he did not know the date of his death,
    he knew he was drawing near to that dread event. For more than 30 years
    he had carried with him the memory of his Master's postresurrection dis-
    closure, spoken beside the Tiberian Sea: "When thou shalt be old, thou
    shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
    whither thou wouldest not." He knew what those words meant: "This
    spake he [Jesus], signifying by what death he [Peter] should glorify God"
    (John 21:18, 19). (See also John 13:36.) And now, as in all probability he
    neared the age of 70 and the fulfillment of those solemn phrases came
    uncomfortably close, he viewed his coming death by crucifixion calmly,
    uncomplainingly: "I know," that is, he recognizes, "that I shall have to
    leave this body at very short notice" (2 Peter 1:14, Phillips). Although
    there is no firm clue as to its place of origin, if the letter were written from
    prison during Nero's persecution of Christians, it would have been sent
    from Rome. Yet there is no self-pity in the apostle's attitude. His thoughts
    are fastened not on his own welfare but on that of his distant Christian
    friends.
       The word Peter uses for tabernacle is not the usual New Testament
    term used to designate such a place. The reference is to the body in which
    he lives as in a tent. "Peter is thinking of his mortal, material body as but
    a temporary thing eventually to be replaced by an immortal one."—
    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 599. This immediately raises the
    question: If he lays aside his body, what happens to the rest of his being?
    Believers in the immortality of the soul speak of the departure of that
    entity to eternal bliss. We who find such a concept unscriptural, tie this
    reference to the Bible teaching of an unbroken sleep that will continue
    until the second coming at which time "this mortal must put on immortal-
    ity" (1 Cor. 15:53). In support of that position, note that Peter makes no
    reference to any heavenward sequel to the body's decease. He would,
    however, agree that "the spirit [or breath] shall return unto God who gave
    it" (Eccl. 12:7).
       The word translated "shortly" in the King James Version (verse 14)
    may be better expressed as "swiftly" or "speedily," thereby strengthen-
                                                                                   25
      ing the probability that he expected to die soon after writing his letter. If
      that was so, how precious that letter would be to contemporary Chris-
      tians in Asia Minor, and eventually to believers in all ages!

DAY     In the face of death, how does Peter reveal his deep concern for his read-
      ers' spiritual welfare? 2 Peter 1:15.


         The sense of urgency again shows itself in the apostle's message. The
      words "I will endeavour" may be translated, "I shall make haste," or "I
      shall speak earnestly," suggesting the seriousness of what he is about to
      say. This note is deepened by his speaking of his "decease," a reference
      to his impending death. In writing this, he employs the word exodos
      which, as mentioned in the last lesson, literally means "a way out." The
      most famous use of the word is for the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt. In
      this verse it evidently is used to depict Peter's departure from this life by
      crucifixion. Exodos is also used by Luke in recording the transfiguration
      scene where Moses and Elijah talk with Jesus concerning His "decease"
      or death at Jerusalem (Luke 9:31). If Peter had expected immediate trans-
      lation to heaven at the time of his death, he might well have used the well-
      known Greek word eisodos, that is, "a way into" or "an entry," suggest-
      ing entrance into heaven. His choice of exodos suggests that he was not
      expecting immediate entrance into glory, but viewed death as his exodus
      from this life with no thought of an immediate entry into a promised land.
         Without spending further words on his own imminent departure or
      death, Peter concentrates on his friends' well-being. To that end he writes
      his epistle with its frequent urgent emphases on "remembrance."

      NOTE that Peter already has made several references to the sources that
      are available for Christian development: verse 3—divinely given knowl-
      edge of the Lord Jesus, verse 4—"great and precious promises," verses
      5-8—moral graces that yield spiritual fruitage, verses 9-11—graces that
      will direct their steps toward the kingdom.

         In urging them to remember, it is possible also that Peter may have
      been referring to that body of instruction that Mark embodied in his Gos-
      pel, which usually is attributed to information he received from Peter.
      Beginning with verse 12 he repeatedly stresses the need for them to re-
      member what they have been taught, and now, in verse 15, he sets that
      counsel in the context of his own approaching execution. The exhorta-
      tions are a moving part of his last will and testament, and must have been
      most lovingly treasured and circulated.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read with sympathetic atten-
    tion, The Acts of the Apostles, pages 537, 538 that deal with Peter's death.
       Study the following quotations carefully:
       "Peter can hardly over-emphasize the importance of reminders. Here
    (2 Peter 1:13) he has just reminded his readers of the call of God, the need
    for growth in grace, and the heavenly home which awaits them. . . . It
    would seem that he could never forget His Lord's commission, 'When
      26
      EgJillIli LW Itr-17-9111-in                               Lesson
you are converted, establish your brethren.' He determines to continue
with it to the end of his days."—Michael Green, Tyndale New Testament
Commentaries, vol. 18, p. 78.
  "As a means of intellectual training, the Bible is more effective than any
other book, or all other books combined. The greatness of its themes, the
dignified simplicity of its utterances, the beauty of its imagery, quicken
and uplift the thoughts as nothing else can. No other study can impart
such mental power as does the effort to grasp the stupendous truths of
revelation. The mind thus brought in contact with the thoughts of the Infi-
nite cannot but expand and strengthen."—Education. p. 124.

SUMMARY: Ministerial faithfulness requires that pastors remind their
congregations of the principal convictions that led them to become Chris-
tians. On their side, all Christians need to review the foundations of their
faith and to invite the Holy Spirit's ministry of remembrance. Our memo-
ries are frail, and we need frequent refreshment of the hope that is within
us.

APPLICATION:
• How often do I allow the Holy Spirit to teach me all things? Only on
  Sabbaths? Why should I not seek His instruction every day?
• A thought for pastors and teachers: How faithful am I in reminding the
  members of my congregation or my class about the foundations on
  which their Christian faith must stand?
• As a baptized member, how faithful am I in reviewing and strengthen-
  ing my understanding of the basic teachings that led me to become a
  Seventh-day Adventist?
• How diligent am I in Bible study? Do I merely read, or do I meditate
  upon and study the inspired words? Do I grow in understanding
  through sharing what I learn with those about me?
• Am I as ready to face normal death as was Peter to face the horror of
  crucifixion?

 Eyewitness of Majesty
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 1:16-18.

 DAY MEMORY TEXT: "After six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and

LT   John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart,
    and was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,
     and his raiment was white as the light" (Matt. 17:1, 2).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: The certainty of our faith is founded on the incar-
nation of our Lord as Jesus of Nazareth. The transfiguration dramatized
that saving act and the coming of the future kingdom of glory. Even when
we study it today it focuses our attention on our Saviour's majesty and
His power over sin and death.


                     OVERVIEW-2 Peter 1:16-18

  Verse 16a    In telling the believers about the future kingdom of glory
                Peter insists that he did not follow "cunningly devised
                fables."

 Verse 16b     He was an eyewitness of the transfiguration—a miniature
                representation of Christ's coming kingdom.

 Verse 17      Peter's brief report of the transfiguration.

 Verse 18      He saw it, heard the voice, and never would be able to
                forget it.


INTRODUCTION: The apostle's readers lived in an idolatrous environ-
ment. Those who had the courage to become Christians in the first cen-
tury had to contend with the multitude of gods who were worshiped, in
varying degrees of sincerity and faithfulness, by most of their neighbors.
There was no way of escaping from the idol-ridden environment. Gate-
ways to every town and village were flanked by statues representing their
inhabitants' gods and goddesses. Public buildings were adorned by busts
of the same. Private homes had their niches where family deities were
housed. Even in the country, escape was impossible, for there the sacred
groves and grottoes, dedicated to the worship of one or more of the vast
pantheon, were held in no less esteem than the cities' temples.
  In such surroundings, the Christian was pledged to worship the invisi-
ble God who once had manifested Himself in the person of His Son.
Jesus, born as a Jew, taught the highest of all moralities and called His
28
      followers to its faithful observance. His religion was so different from all
      others that its adherents were marked men and women who needed incal-
      culable courage to be faithful to their newfound beliefs.
         Peter wrote his two letters in order to strengthen such stalwarts in their
      brave witness. In his second letter we have found him urging his fellow
      Christians to develop their spiritual potential (1:2), to grow in godliness
      (1:3, 4), diligently to add grace to grace (1:5-7), and to prepare for en-
      trance into Christ's kingdom (1:10). He recognized their continuing need
      of encouragement and instruction, and took care to remind them to be
      faithful to the rudiments of their religion (1:10-15).
         In verses 16 to 18 he practiced what he had been preaching about re-
      membering. He recalled, as vividly as if it had happened only a short
      while before, the splendor of his Master's transfiguration. Never, never
      would he forget that holy drama. He knew that sharing it would bring
      them strength and confidence for faithful witness in the pagan world in
      which they lived.

DAY I. FABLE OR FACT? (2 Peter 1:16).

121     Cunningly devised fables. The early Christians lived in a world whose
      major religions were formulated around fables and folklore that were
      fashioned to explain many of life's principal mysteries. Many such stories
      were embodied in Greek and Roman legends that were cast in poetical
      form. The mythical gods and goddesses of these legends assumed human
      guise, as artists represented them in exquisite sculptures. One firm ex-
      ception to this general trend was Judaism with its monotheism—"The
      Lord our God is one Lord"—yet even that was diluted by fantastic
      angelology and demonology and other nonbiblical concepts before the
      Christian era began.
         Into this fancy-laden astmosphere there came the reality of Bethle-
      hem's Babe, the silent but busy years at Nazareth, the recognition
      through John's baptism, the early preaching beside the Sea of Galilee, the
      quietly performed miracles, and Christ's acceptance and rejection in Je-
      rusalem. A few perceptive eyes penetrated the humanity that veiled
      Christ's divinity; but, for the most part, the Son of God was concealed by
      the Son of man. On one unique occasion the veil was lifted and heavenly
      splendor was allowed to shine through. That was on the mount where the
      Son of Mary stood revealed as the Son of God.
         Peter must have had all this in mind as he turned from his exhortations
      on remembering to appeal to the history in which he had participated.
        What were the "cunningly devised fables," or "cleverly devised myths"
      (RSV), or "cleverly invented stories" (NIV), or "tales artfully spun" (NEB)
      that Peter rejected?
        He might have been referring to the heathen mythology mentioned
      above, knowing that in Asia Minor his readers were daily exposed to such
      officially supported fiction. Or he may have been thinking of the fanciful
      distortions of Christian doctrine that were being peddled by false teach-
      ers such as those with whom we will find him dealing so energetically in
      chapter 2 of this epistle.

                                                                                 29

         How does the apostle relate the revelation of Christ's glory to His final
      triumph? 2 Peter 1:16.



         Our Lord's coming. Against the perverted notions being circulated
      Peter here appeals to either (1) his preaching of the gospel story, or (2) his
      account of Christ's life and ministry that came to be embodied in Mark's
      Gospel. These two possible applications are based on the words "we
      made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
      It should also be noted that Peter was not speaking solely on his own
      authority. He employs the apostolic "we" in this verse, undoubtedly
      bringing James and John into the picture as they saw and heard what he
      saw and heard on "the holy mount."
         Peter's words sustain a wider application still; for he uses the key New
      Testament word parousia, "coming" or "presence," which in 17 of its 22
      occurrences refers to Christ's second coming.

DAY NOTE how the second coming consistently is linked with a manifestation of
    "power" in Matthew 24:27-30; 1 Corinthians 15:53-58; 1 Thessalonians
[DJ 4:14-17; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2 Peter 3:10-13.

         It seems clear that, in addition to the fleeting magnificence of the trans-
      figuration, Peter also had his Lord's return (which it prefigured) in mind.
      That interpretation is supported by the close connection between the
      transfiguration and the second coming in the Gospel records. Matthew's
      account may be taken as typical, with Mark and Luke agreeing. In Mat-
      thew 16 Jesus concluded His discourse concerning His divinity (verses
      13-20), His death and resurrection (verses 21-23), and the superior worth
      of the soul over the world (verses 24-26) with an unmistakable reference
      to His climactic return (verse 27). He followed this with the promise in
      verse 28: "There be some of you standing here, which shall not taste of
      death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom." Chapter 17
      then describes the transfiguration (verses 1-9), implying that, in minia-
      ture, it prefigures Christ's return in glory. It might be described as a pre-
      view of His second coming.

       What impressive claim does Peter make concerning his presence on the
      mount of transfiguration? 2 Peter 1:16, last part.


         Each word in the clause "but were eyewitnesses of his majesty" is sig-
      nificant. The "but" relates to the writer's assertion that gospel messen-
      gers were not following myths or fables as they taught about Christ's
      power and His return. On the contrary, they were relating what they had
      actually seen. They were "eyewitnesses," a word translated from a
      Greek word that is used only here in the New Testament, but ordinarily
      applied to those who had been initiated into the higher mysteries as prac-
      ticed in pagan religions. By using that particular word, Peter asserts the
      superiority of his witness over that of those who promoted "cunningly

      30
    devised fables." He, with James and John, had been privileged beyond all
    comparison over other teachers. With his own eyes he had looked on the
    glorified Jesus. He had seen his Master in His regal majesty—a revelation
    that soared higher than any human initiation could ever reach. He and his
    two companions had seen the King in His beauty (Isa. 33:17).

DAY 11. DIVINE REALITY (2 Peter 1:17).

      Honor from heaven. The apostle now describes some aspects of the
    unique scene of which he was an eyewitness. He makes no effort to tell
    the entire story for which even the concise Mark uses nine verses (Mark
    9:2-10). He concentrates on those features that serve his immediate pur-
    pose—to stress the reliability of the Christian message in contrast to the
    unreliability of rival philosophies or of unorthodox Christian teachings.
    To this end he recalls the honor and glory that came to his Master on the
    mount: the honor and the glory which He had temporarily set aside but
    which He had possessed with God "before the world was" (John 17:5). In
    complete humility, the Son had left those attributes in His Fathers's
    hands, and from those hands again received them for a brief time prior to
    taking them again forever.
       "There came such a voice to him from [or by] the excellent glory." We
    do not know the form in which the Father and the Son communed with
    each other during our Lord's earthly life. But publicly audible exchanges
    appear to have been few: once at baptism (Matt. 3:17), again at the trans-
    figuration (Matt 17:5), and once more soon after Christ's triumphal entry
    into Jerusalem (John 12:28). How precious those acknowledgements
    must have been to the Son of man in His voluntary exile from His Fa-
    ther's home!

     ILLUSTRATION: To what may we in our restricted humanity compare
     the encouraging joy that such a pronouncement brought to the earth-
     bound Son? By way of faint comparison, imagine a young man on an ant-
     arctic expedition, marooned at the South Pole but in radio communica-
     tion with his faraway home, tuning in to hear his father's voice just as
     clearly as if he were beside him, giving the assurance that all was well,
     help was on the way, and that he would soon be home! Loneliness would
     vanish. The two would be close together again, and the wait would be
     endured with quiet confidence.

        What was the significance of the awesome acknowledgement that the dis-
     ciples heard upon the holy mount? 2 Peter 1:17, 18.



       Divine recognition. Apart from the majestic manifestation of the Fa-
     ther's glory that must have filled the disciples' hearts with holy awe, there
     came "a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in
     whom I am well pleased; hear ye him" (Matt. 17:5). They had heard the
     voice from heaven at Jesus' baptism, but so had the multitude that
     crowded Jordan's bank. They later were to be in Jerusalem when once

                                                                               31
                                                                     Ma'est
    again there came "a voice from heaven" (John 12:28). However, the oc-
    casion on the mount was different. They were far from the crowds, three
    frail men upon a mountain with three who rank among history's greatest
    spiritual leaders—Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. To say it was unique is a trite
    understatement; it must be declared one of the supreme moments in uni-
    versal history. It struck the note of triumph that was needed in the
    shadow of the cross. It revealed that the Almighty was and is in control.
    Peter and his companions saw and heard the resurrected Moses and the
    translated Elijah talk with Jesus about His sacrifice while looking ahead
    to His victory (Luke 9:31). Then there came the Father's voice acknowl-
    edging His beloved Son. What assurance that recognition must have
    brought to the disciples' hearts!


DAY I11. APOSTOLIC ASSURANCE (2 Peter 1:18).

      Confident witness. We do not know how long the transfiguration scene
    lasted, but it came at night while Jesus was immersed in prayer. Luke tells
    us that "Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep," so
    they would have been unconscious of the passage of time. But on waking
    "they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him" (Luke 9:32).
    (See also The Desire of Ages, pp. 420, 421.) That splendor they could
    never forget. In addition, there was the voice, a voice from another
    realm, reverberating over the mountaintop. It rang in their ears after the
    figures of Moses and Elijah had disappeared. Its celestial tones remained
    with them decades after they had gone down to the plain.
       How does an eyewitness set about convincing others of the reality of
    his unique experience? In Peter's case, two other trustworthy witnesses,
    James and John, had participated in the remarkable scene. Although
    James had been martyred and Peter and John were not often together
    after Pentecost, Peter could at any time call upon John to corroborate his
    account. He was therefore able to declare, "This voice which came from
    heaven we heard." If John had been separately cross-examined, he would
    have told the same story. This certainty allowed Peter to make his claim
    still more emphatic: "We ourselves heard this voice that came from
    heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain" (2 Peter 1:18,
    NIV).
       The link between the earthly and the heavenly, between the mountain
    under their feet and the unearthly splendor surrounding the three daz-
    zling figures, was the divine-human Jesus. The disciples were "with
    him," with the One whom they knew and loved, although they often had
    been puzzled as to His identity. A short while before the transfiguration
    Peter had confessed, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"
    (Matt. 16:16). And now, here was resplendent proof that the insight he
    had been given was correct.

      What misunderstanding was evident in Peter's response at the time of the
    transfiguration? Matt. 17:4.



    32
                                                                       Lesson" "`4`
       "The disciples are confident that Moses and Elijah have been sent to
     protect their Master, and to establish His authority as king.
       "But before the crown must come the cross. Not the inauguration of
     Christ as king, but the decease to be accomplished at Jerusalem, is the
     subject of their conference with Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, p. 422.
       While two celestial citizens, Moses and Elijah, talked with the God-
     man, Jesus, three mortals served as observers. This the mortals could do
     because Jesus belonged to both heaven and earth. When the scene faded,
     He would be peculiarly theirs again; then, after another six months or so,
     a cloud would receive Him out of their sight and He would return to His
     eternal Habitat—to that heavenly country where Moses and Elijah were
     then living. During those intervening months, the trio must often have
     recalled the revelation that had been granted them. When at last "a cloud
     received him out of their sight" (Acts 1:9) they remained nearer to Him
     because of the glimpse of His glory that had been granted them.

DAY REACT: Why are not more believers given the same kind of witness that the
    three disciples received at the transfiguration? What contribution to under-
    standing the answer can you gain from Paul's comparison in 2 Corinthians
    4:18 of the unseen against the visible?



       Our need of the awe-inspiring. Every Christian needs the confidence
     that can be gained from such other-worldly phenomena as Peter and his
     companions experienced while on the mountaintop. We may not obtain it
     with the dramatic directness that came to the privileged trio, but such
     experiences should become so real through study and personal knowl-
     edge of their actuality that we make them truly our own.
        Scripture is rich in suggestion about such needs and how they may be
     satisfied. In a most reassuring manner such experiences center on the
     Person of Christ, but they derive from the Trinity and involve God the
      Father and God the Spirit as well as God the Son. Examples are most
     easily identified by scriptures that deal with particular and essential hap-
     penings in the life of a Christian. The new birth is typical. Its essence is
     stated by the Saviour Himself: "Except a man be born again, he cannot
     see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3). No physical act indicates the begin-
     ning of such a spiritual new life. The miracle is internal, operating on the
     level of the spirit and not on the body. Yet, "except a man be born of
     water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John
     3:5). Mary looked back to her awe-inspiring encounter with Gabriel and
     ever remembered the words that changed her entire relation to life: "Fear
     not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou
     shalt . . . bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus" (Luke 1:30, 31).
        True religion, far from rejecting such possibilities of the supernatural,
     accepts and welcomes their proper manifestation.

     THINK IT THROUGH: Applying these convictions to our present-day
     lives, we become aware of our own need for contact with Divinity. Each
     of us needs his or her own individual miracle of grace. Its nature and time

                                                                                  33
     and place of occurrence are not the principal issues. It is more important
     to know for a certainty that we have met with God and have become
     intensely aware of His holiness, His power, His love, His call, and His
     personal interest in our welfare. The consciousness of having been in
     contact with God personally is of inestimable value to us.

        Moses had a thrilling personal contact with God as he drew near the
     burning bush (Ex. 3:1-6) and, to an even greater degree as he met the
     Lord in the tabernacle or on Sinai (Ex. 33:11; Deut. 34:10). Isaiah "saw
     the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up," and could declare,
     "Mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (Isa. 6:1, 5). Daniel
     had his vision of "the Ancient of days" (Dan. 7:9, 10). When Saul of Tar-
     sus journeyed from Jerusalem to Damascus, "suddenly there shined
     round about him a light from heaven" (Acts 9:3)). Most of us do not expe-
     rience such supernatural manifestations. It is much more common for
     God to speak to us through the "still small voice." But all of us should
     develop a sense of being in contact with God.

DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Compare the transfiguration ac-

to counts as given by Matthew (16:28 to 17:9), Mark (9:1-10), and Luke
   (9:27-36) and consider the purpose that lay behind Peter's reference to
   that event (2 Peter 1:16-18). Note that this is the only specific reference to
   the transfiguration apart from the Gospel accounts.
     For insights, information, and comment, read The Desire of Ages,
   pages 419 to 425; S.D.A. Bible Commentary, volume 5, pages 437 to 440;
   volume 7, pages 600, 601.
     Refresh your mind concerning Moses' death and resurrection (Deut.
   34:1-6 and Jude 9), and Elijah's translation (2 Kings 2:1-11).

     SUMMARY: Many years had passed since the transfiguration, but Peter
     could not forget that vivid and dramatic experience. Although we should
     not necessarily expect spectacular manifestations such as the one Peter
     saw, we each need our own personal sense of contact with or word from
     the Lord of hosts. Our eyes need to see "the king in his beauty" and to
     "behold the land that is very far off" (Isa. 33:17).

     APPLICATION:
     • What personal inspiration have I gained from this fresh look at Christ's
       majesty? How does it compare with that which Peter reports?
     • To what extent does materialism mold my life, to the exclusion of true
       spirituality?
     • What have been the most intense spiritual experiences in my Christian
       life? What blessings shall I gain by preserving my memory of them? In
       addition to recollections of conversion, baptism, marriage, election to
       church office, what other milestones in my spiritual career and Chris-
       tian development are worthy of recall?
     • On what should my faith be based—supernatural experiences, Scrip-
       ture, or my personal friendship with Christ?
     • Can those about me tell that I have had a personal experience with the
       Lord?

The Voice of Prophecy
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 1:19-21.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "The prophecy came not in old time by the will of
    man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
1   Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Although we have not been eyewitnesses of
Christ's majesty, the Word of God and, in particular, its prophetic pas-
sages can bring us a similar revelation along with inspiration and convic-
tion. Therefore we ought to study that Word diligently.


                     OVERVIEW-2 Peter 1:19-21

  Verse 19        Until the second coming we have God's revelation
                   given through the prophetic word as a sure means of
                   guidance and authority.

  Verses 20, 21   This revelation was not the product of human minds
                   but came from and only can be understood fully
                   through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.


INTRODUCTION: As we ourselves study the Scriptures, it is well to dis-
cover and remember to whom they were written, the purpose behind
their composition, and the circumstances under which they were com-
posed. It is not always easy to satisfy those requirements, but we should
do our best to meet them. In our present study we are accepting the prob-
ability that Peter's second message is addressed to those who received his
first epistle. We do well, then, to become acquainted with what life was
like for those early Christians in Asia Minor and to remember the setting
in which they practiced their newfound religion. Some of them may have
been expatriate Jews who were spread throughout the Mediterranean
world and the Middle East by what is known as the Diaspora or disper-
sion. These people would be acquainted with those Scriptures that we
call the Old Testament. They would also face the subtle and insistent dan-
ger of being influenced by the pagan philosophies that swirled around
them and would need constant recourse to the central teachings of their
Christian faith.
   Other members of the scattered congregations had come out of pagan-
ism and had many superstitions to overcome and much morality to learn.
However, they had become acquainted with the law and the prophets
and, accepting them as the word of God, had built their Christian faith on
the foundations of those Scriptures. Recognizing these varied needs,
                                                                        35
     Peter shared with both groups the revelation of his Master's glory as he
     saw it revealed on "the holy mount," and directed them to the additional
     and wider inspiration that comes from "prophecy of the scripture."
        Peter's experience. At this juncture we might well pause to review the
     miracle of the apostle's own development. He came from Bethsaida, a
     fishing village on the northeastern shore of Lake Galilee. As was natural,
     he became a fisherman, and probably had little formal education. Al-
     though Galilee was not noted for its religious fervor, Peter and his fellows
     must have benefited from synagogue instruction to such an extent that
     when his brother Andrew announced, "We have found the Messias"
     (John 1:41), Peter believed and followed the Man from Nazareth.
        At that stage his theology was limited, but association with the Master
     Teacher widened and deepened his understanding of true religion. By the
     time of Pentecost, and equipped by the Holy Spirit, he was able to draw
     enough on what he had learned to be able to fill the role of chief spokes-
     man for the infant church. About 35 years later his pastoral and apostolic
     experience gave him still wider knowledge of Scripture and profound in-
     sights into its teachings. Today we benefit from his spiritual gifts.

DAY I. HEED THE PROPHETIC LIGHT (2 Peter 1:19).

13     How is the transfiguration linked to the certainty of Bible prophecy?
     2 Peter 1:18, 19.


       "We have also a more sure word of prophecy." We should resist the
     temptation to see in these words a pitting of prophecy against the transfig-
     uration scene. The original wording may not warrant such an interpreta-
     tion. It can be understood to say, "We have the prophetic word [made]
     more sure," that is, the mountaintop revelation of the Master's divinity
     confirmed all that the prophets had foretold concerning the Redeemer.
     There could be no higher revelation than that—it was an unveiling of the
     Son's eternal glory, which was His before time began. The disciples'
     glimpse of that majesty made every detail of related Old Testament
     prophecy vividly significant. Not only could they say, "This
     voice . . . we heard"; they could just as emphatically declare, "This
     glory we saw."

        "Whereunto ye do well that ye take heed." This unforgettable experi-
     ence increased the disciples' appreciation for Bible prophecy and
     prompted them to recommend it to their converts who could not expect
     to have such an experience. Peter tells his friends: You will do well to give
     earnest attention to the prophetic word. He explained his reason for that
     counsel, basing it on prophecy's ability to throw beams of light into dark
     murky places.

     COMPARE with Deuteronomy 8:3; Amos 3:7; Matthew 22:29; and John
     7:17.

          "As unto a light that shineth in a dark place." The lamps of those days

     36
      were small clay vessels holding oil that fed a lighted wick. The shining
      refers to the bringing of light to dispel darkness. The dark or dusty, needy
      place probably refers to the pagan world in which the believers lived, but
      it also may refer to the unknown track we all have to tread. The lamp
      sheds sufficient light to show the traveler the right path to take. As the
      psalmist said, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my
      path" (Ps. 119:105). In either case, true prophecy, contained in the Word
      of God, in both the Old and New Testaments, does throw valuable light
      on the present and on the unexplored road that lies before each one of us.
      The Lord has given the light of prophecy to show us the right road, to
      illumine its dangers and its delights, and to guide us safely to our destina-
      tion—that far country where we shall have no need of the light of the sun,
      for the "Lord God giveth them light" (Rev. 22:5). No wonder the apostle
      recommends that his flock give thorough study to Bible prophecy. Its is-
      sues concern eternity and the Christian's relation to it.

DAY     For how long and why will prophecy be needed? Verse 19.


         In its final clauses verse 19 makes it clear that the beneficent ministry
      of prophecy will be needed until the end, either the end of the individual
      life, or the end of human history. The wording, while capable of more
      than one interpretation, does refer to a future event and does focus on
      individual involvement in that event. It speaks of a time during which
      prophecy will function—"until the day dawn." The word used for
      "dawn" can be more literally translated as "shine through," and refers to
      the time when light shines through darkness as it does at the dawn of each
      new day. The following phrase throws a light on the significance of the
      previous phrase by adding to the definition, saying, "and a day star arise
      in your hearts." The only New Testament use of the term day star is that
      found in this verse, but other passages such as Luke 1:78 ("dayspring"),
      Revelation 2:28 ("morning star") and Revelation 22:16 ("bright and
      morning star") support the interpretation that day star refers to Christ.
         What a beautiful way of depicting the illumination that flooded the
      minds of those who accepted Jesus as the Light of their world! Their new-
      found religion rose far above the best morality that paganism could offer
      and flooded their souls with brilliant spiritual light.

        What does Peter refer to in his use of the expression "until the day
      dawn"?

        He refers to the second coming of Christ as the climax to which most
      prophecies point. After the second coming God's people will not need the
      Scriptures, for they will talk to Him face to face.
        The New Testament reveals that the early Christians expected their
      Lord's soon return. This was a natural and commendable hope, based on
      their understanding of Christ's own promises and the apostles' early ex-
      pectations. In this sense, the "day star" of hope concerning Christ's re-
      turn arose in their hearts and encouraged them in the Christian way. The
      passage of time later led them to see that the second advent might lie

                                                                                 37
      farther in the future than either they or their teachers had first expected.

      comment on the deferred hope.)

DAY     11. A PRINCIPLE OF INTERPRETATION (2 Peter 1:20).

0       Warning of a Danger Involved. Mention of prophecy (verse 19) leads
      the writer to warn his readers against an ever-present danger in respect to
      prophecy. His warning is emphatic: "Knowing this first," that is, "keep
      this principle in the forefront of your thinking" as you seek to interpret
      prophecy. What principle? That "no prophecy of scripture [there is no
      article in the original] is of any private interpretation," or, literally, "of
      ones's own untying." Those words have been subject to at least two inter-
      pretations. The first suggests that prophets are not to intrude their own
      interpretations into the giving of the messages received from God. They
      are faithfully to deliver the prophetic words without adding their own un-
      derstanding of their import. The second and more widely held view is that
      individual Christians are not to foist upon the church their personal inter-
      pretations of prophetic messages. The second choice seems more appro-
      priate in the context of verse 19 and in the light of what is said about false
      prophets in chapter 2.

        What was Peter talking about in his day when he made his declaration
      concerning prophecy? 2 Peter 1:20.


         The reference is clearly to the Old Testament Scriptures—the main
      body of canonical writings known to the church in Peter's day. Those
      scriptures were confirmed by Christ's ministry and supported by the
      transfiguration scene when two Old Testament prophets, Moses and Eli-
      jah, appeared with Jesus on the mountain.

           What current application can be made of Peter's declaration?

        The apostle's words carry a weighty and relevant message for people
      today who are exposed to so many bewildering winds of interpretation,
      even more than were Peter's readers, for we have both the Old and New
      Testament prophecies and 1900 years more of speculation with which to
      contend. We need to study each prophecy in the total biblical setting to
      ensure that our understanding harmonizes with the complete prophetic
      pattern. The inspired counsel should also help to prevent us from riding
      "hobby horses" on particular portions of prophecy to the exclusion or
      distortion of the whole trend of divine revelation. We need to look at the
      total picture in order to grasp the entire story that it is seeking to tell.
        Having applied Peter's advice in the above ways, we also need to ac-
      knowledge two things: (1) how much we still have to learn about the fu-
      ture, and (2) how much we need to shun "private interpretations," recog-
      nizing our inability to foretell what will happen tomorrow and, still less,
      the exact course of more distant events, even those that are most clearly
      included in the grand sweep of Bible prophecy.

      38
DAY NOTE: After dwelling on the thought of "private interpretation," it
   should be acknowledged that the next verse (verse 21) is not dealing with
   that aspect. Therefore, we need to make room for seeing also in verse 20
   a reference to the origin of prophecy and to make an effort to forge a close
   link between the two verses.

       HI. THE SOURCE OF PROPHECY (2 Peter 1:21).

          Although prophecy plays such an important role in biblical literature,
       its origin and the way it was communicated to humanity lie largely unex-
       plained until we read these words from Peter's pen. Here, in a nutshell,
       he reveals the source of authentic prophecy. First comes the negative
       statement, literally translated: "Not by the will of man was carried [or
       brought] prophecy at any time." Indeed, as the record confirms, proph-
       ecy was sometimes proclaimed against some person's will—even at times
       against the will of the human agent who was conveying it. Three illustra-
       tions will suffice: Balaam (Numbers 22 to 24), Jeremiah (1:1-10), and Jo-
       nah (1:1-3). Even the men and women who accepted prophetic roles did
       not do so from personal choice but in response to a direct call from God;
       often while protesting their own inadequacies, as did Moses (Ex. 3:11;
       4:10-16) and Isaiah (6:5-8). Even willing spokesmen, such as Hosea, Joel,
       Micah, Zephaniah, and Haggai, made it clear that they were not speaking
       their own thoughts, but "the word of the Lord." Not one of the genuine
       prophecies that are preserved in the Old Testament came as the result of
       the prophet's own forecasts.

          What did David confess that illustrates how the prophets viewed them-
       selves in regard to being the Lord's mouthpiece? 2 Sam. 23:2.


         Sober thought convinces the Bible student that it could not be other-
       wise. Noah could not have foreseen the arrival of such a hitherto un-
       known phenomenon as rain, still less the resultant flood. In the early
       sixth century B.C., at the height of the Babylonian power, Daniel could
       not have seen beyond his own day to foretell the rise of Medo-Persia,
       Greece, and Rome.

DAY      To whom does Peter, in verse 21, attribute the origin of true prophecy and
1.6   how does inspiration function?


          It fell to Peter to crystallize such an insight in the authoritative words
       that close this first chapter: "But holy men of God spake as they were
       moved by the Holy Ghost." Those words are momentous enough to de-
       mand our close attention. The word translated but is an emphatic one,
       implying that far from prophecy's originating in human sources, it came
       from an infinitely higher Source, namely, the Holy Spirit. The verb
       rendered moved in the King James Version was sometimes used in a nau-
       tical setting in Peter's day. In Acts 27:15, 17 it is rendered "we let
       . . . drive" and "were driven," with reference to the ship on which Paul

                                                                                 39
and the Rome-bound party were traveling, which ran before a tempestu-
ous wind (verse 14). The apostle's use of the same word in connection
with the giving of prophecy suggests that the Holy Spirit came upon the
prophets with a driving force, giving them their message from God that
they in turn felt impelled by a force outside themselves to pass on to their
people. The entire final phrase of verse 21 might then be translated: "To
the contrary, impelled by the Holy Spirit men spoke from God." There is
no word "holy" attached to "men" in the original, and the words "from
God" refer not so much to the prophets as to the message that God gave
them to share with His people.
   The same concluding phrase throws light on the way that inspiration
worked on the prophet. The messenger believed himself to be God's in-
strument. He did not create the message; it was given him by God, and it
was his mission to share it with those for whom the Lord intended it. But
the prophet expressed that message in his own words, in language that
was best suited to his audience or readership. The message passed
through the mechanism of his own mind and personality and bore the
impress of his own individuality. That process gives us the vastly differing
styles of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, although each prophet delivered
messages that were given directly by the Holy Spirit.

  What additional light does Paul throw on the way inspiration works?
2 Tim. 3:16.



ILLUMINATION: "The union of the divine and human, manifest in
Christ, exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspi-
ration of God;' yet they are expressed in the words of men and are
adapted to human needs. Thus it may be said of the Book of God, as it
was of Christ, that 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.' And
this fact, so far from being an argument against the Bible, should
strengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who pronounce upon the
inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as divine while
they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that Christ, the divine,
partook of our human nature, that he might reach humanity. In the work
of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined."—
Testimonies , vol. 5, p. 747.

  While Peter's concern has been the origin of Scripture prophecy, he has
dealt mainly with the manner in which the prophets received and deliv-
ered their divinely given messages (verse 21). We are then indebted to
Paul for enlightenment concerning the written Word. He states that "all
scripture is given by inspiration of God," thereby making God the ulti-
mate Author of the complete biblical message.

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "Inspiration as a spiritual phe-
   nomenon is not common to all believers, but is divinely reserved for spe-
   cially authorized bearers of God's message. This does not, however, im-
   ply that the message transmitted by chosen prophets and apostles is a
   product of mechanical divine dictation. Inspiration neither suppresses
   the personalities of the writers, nor puts an end to their human fallibility.
   Although prophets and apostles remained fallible men who shared the
   culture of their times, God nonetheless revealed to them information be-
   yond their natural resources, and what they taught as doctrine has its
   basis in the Holy Spirit as ultimate author of their message."—Carl F H.
   Henry, "Inspiration," in New International Dictionary of the Christian
   Church, ed. J. D. Douglas (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing
   House, 1974), p. 512.
      "We need divine illumination, the interior grace that moves man to give
   his free assent to the external Word that confronts him. A grace that in-
    vites belief, moves to faith, and makes us eager to find God, to obey Him
   and to be faithful to Him. This is a light not from below but from above,
   which enables us to read the Bible with fresh and ever deeper understand-
   ing, precisely because it has been received as the revealed and inspired
    Word.
      "When we approach the Bible in this way, with the inner resources of a
    profound Christian awareness, its text seems to be lighted from within.
   The Word of God no longer confronts me as external to myself, as an
   object to be analyzed and dissected. It is a living arrow that pierces my
    heart, a sharp sword that penetrates to the joints and the marrow (see
    Heb. 4:12). The Word of God ceases to be an object, a thing. I see it as
    something alive. In and through the Word, God addresses me personally,
    not simply as an echo of the past but as a Word speaking now. I find words
    in the Bible I no longer simply read but that speak to me, introducing me
    to the crucial drama of life, the conflict between truth and falsehood, life
    and death, and communicate the message that God redeems those who
    trust in His mercy."—Raoul Dederen, "Revelation, Inspiration, and
    Hermeneutics," in A Symposium on Biblical Hermeneutics, ed. Gordon
    M. Hyde (Washington, D.C.: Biblical Research Institute of the General
    Conference, 1974), p. 13.
       Consider Moses' style in Deuteronomy 6, David's in Psalm 139, Isa-
    iah's in Isaiah 40, Daniel's in Daniel 7, and John's in Revelation 21. Listen
    appreciatively to the differing music that emerges as the Holy Spirit plays
    on the variety of instruments He has selected.

      SUMMARY: God speaks to us through His chosen human instruments.
      We must pay careful attention to His spoken Word and then allow the
      same Holy Spirit that inspired Bible writers to help us apply what we
      have learned.

Beware of FaIlse Teachers
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 2:1-9.

DAY MEMORY         TEXT: "The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but
1       the way of the ungodly shall perish" (Ps. 1:6).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: At no time in its earthly history can the church
expect to enjoy a trouble-free career. Its enemy will seek to seduce its
members by heretical teachings; but being forewarned can mean being
forearmed.


                        OVERVIEW-2 Peter 2:1-9


       Verses 1, 2
                 False prophets not only have introduced heresies
                  to God's people but will continue to do so. Chris-
     DESTRUCTIVE tians who follow such teachings bring discredit
       HERESIES   on God's church.

        Verses 3-8     False teachers are motivated by covetousness, and
                        the certainty of their judgment is illustrated by:
       HERESY'S         1. the fate of the angels.
       FRUITAGE         2. the destruction of the wicked in the Flood.
                        3. the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

        Verses 5-9    Yet, because God's mercy delivered Noah and Lot
                       from the judgments mentioned, believers can
        GOD'S          rely on God's wise administration of justice
       MERCIES         mixed with mercy.


INTRODUCTION: In chapter 1, Peter has offered the churches positive
spiritual instruction to inspire them in faithful Christian living and wit-
nessing. He now exercises the gift of prophecy and shares his foresights
with them. He foresees that past history will be reproduced, in different
forms, among the maturing congregations; and he earnestly forewarns
them of those coming dangers (2:1-3).
   To understand the true intent of those warnings we need to remember
the background against which the early Christian churches were estab-
lished. They were set in a world that was almost entirely pagan. The only
exceptions were the faithful Jews who worshiped the one true God in the
area we know as Palestine, and the communities of similar Jews who
were scattered in almost every section of the Roman Empire. Therefore,

42
    when the apostles preached the gospel outside of Palestine, their con-
    verts were initially drawn from Jewish congregations who shared a com-
    mon Abrahamic and Mosaic background with Christians. Gradually they
    appealed to the finer spirits in pagan communities, those who were hun-
    gering for something higher and holier than their own mythical and often
    disreputable deities. In addition, there were the honest agnostics who re-
    jected the pagan gods while being dimly aware of the need for a faith that
    would be more satisfying than any that they had yet discovered.
       As always, there were cranks and extremists who distorted even the
    best teachings of any group to which they were attracted. Judaism al-
    ready had suffered from such, and by the first century A.D. it had gath-
     ered many unbiblical teachings to itself. Heathen cults gave birth to bi-
     zarre philosophies that centered on many gods. Their offspring were
     demon worship and licentiousness that was encouraged and practiced un-
     der the guise of religion. The morality of the practitioners of such reli-
    gions could rise no higher than the level of their degraded sources.
       Because of the normal influx of half-converted pagans and the laxity of
     some of its members, the infant church could not remain untouched by
     such closely surrounding influences from without and by disruptive
     forces from within. The New Testament shows that from its early days
     the church was disturbed by non-Christian influences. Paul was troubled
     by Elymas the sorcerer, Jupiter worshipers in Lystra, the soothsaying
     damsel in Philippi, the philosophers at Athens, the exorcists at Ephesus,
     and by supporters of Artemis (whom the Romans named Diana) of the
     Ephesians. After Paul and other apostles had passed on their way, leaving
     the newly founded churches to the leadership of others, it is not surpris-
     ing that the fledgling congregations also came under attack from rival
     forces within.
       Peter was well aware of the dangers that assailed his beloved converts
     and friends, and warned them, in considerable detail, about the teachings
     that might weaken or destroy their faith.

DAY I. DESTRUCTIVE HERESIES (2 Peter 2:1, 2).

      False teachers. In the previous chapter Peter expressed his complete
    faith in the messages given by God through His prophets (1:19-21). Much
    of that ministry already had been recorded in the Old Testament Scrip-
    tures that Moses began in the second millennium B.C. and Malachi com-
    pleted almost 500 years before Peter wrote. The "holy men of God" had
    not been unopposed in their work. In chapter 2, Peter reminded his fellow
    Christians that there were, even then, "false prophets among the peo-
    ple"; that is, among the chosen people. From the day when the deceiver
    uttered his falsehood, "Ye shall not surely die" (Gen. 3:4), there had been
    no lack of those who were ready to contradict the warnings, the reproofs,
    and the statements of fact that God conveyed to His people through His
    servants the prophets.

    EXAMPLES: Miriam and Aaron were numbered among the waverers
    at least once, as were ten of the twelve spies (Numbers 12 to 14). Moses
    had to warn Israel against such deceptions during the wilderness

                                                                             43
      wanderings (Deut. 13:1-5). In the days of the judges and throughout the
      later years of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel similar troubles plagued
      rulers and people. (See 1 Kings 22 for example.) The effects of Jeremiah's
      ministry were often weakened by rival prophets who falsely foretold
      peace instead of the destruction that came upon Judah (Jer. 14:13-16;
      28:1-17; 29:30-32), while Micah and Zephaniah felt compelled to warn
      against similar apostates (Micah 3:5-12; Zeph. 3:4).

        What application to his readers does Peter make of Israel's past experi-
      ences with false prophets? 2 Peter 2:1.


         Peter's awareness of the dangers that confronted church members was
      doubtless heightened by his Lord's warning that "many false prophets
      shall rise, and shall deceive many" (Matt. 24:11) and that deception
      would continue to plague the church until the end of time (Matt. 24:23-
      27). For the most part, the apostle wrote in the future tense saying,
      "There shall be false teachers among you" (2 Peter 2:1, emphasis sup-
      plied). Later in the chapter (verse 10 and following) Peter uses the present
      tense to indicate that he was well acquainted with the troublemakers'
      aims and methods. The state of the churches seemed to be fairly firm at
      the time he wrote; but, beyond doubt, disturbers would arise. Therefore,
      he did his best to alert the believers to the dangers that threatened them.

      NOTE that the "false" ones that shall come are not called prophets but
      "teachers." This may suggest that they will not introduce new doctrines
      or lay claim to prophetic visions, but will distort those already received
      by the Christian congregations. We would hope that the apostle's
      warnings were so well heeded as to save many in the churches from being
      deceived. The language is specific enough to justify the hope that his firm
      words enabled his readers to identify false teachings. With that hope, we
      can now turn to examine briefly some of their distortions.

DAY     What reason do you see for the strong language used to identify the evil
      that comes from false teachings? 2 Peter 2:1, 2.


         False teachings. The phrase "privily shall bring in" may be rendered
      literally "shall bring in alongside," or could be translated "introduce se-
      cretly or maliciously." In Galatians 2:4 a similar word is translated as "un-
      awares brought in," confirming the impression that the deceivers, like the
      false prophets, far from being imported from outside, arose among the
      believers themselves. The strong accusation that they would secretly in-
      troduce "damnable heresies" may be more accurately and acceptably ex-
      pressed as "destructive heresies" or "heresies that lead to perdition."
         Here we may pause to suggest a definition of "heresy" and to apply
      that to the conditions that Peter foresaw. The Greek word used is capable
      of several applications. It was used for the capturing of a town, or a tak-
      ing for oneself, therefore "choosing" or "choice." It also came to refer to
      a philosophy, the style of thought, thence to a "sect" (see Acts 24:5), and
      44
     thus to unorthodox teaching (Acts 24:1.4), and, as in Christian usage, to
     "heresy."

     NOTE how the early church made use of the term, employing it for disrup-
     tive teachings. Gal. 5:20; 1 Cor. 11:19.

        In 2 Peter 2:1 the term is used specifically for teachings that are judged
     to be unacceptable to the church. Some of these can be identified from
     what follows in the second chapter—denial of Christ as divine Redeemer
     (verse 1), promoting conduct unworthy of a Christian (verse 2), and mak-
     ing merchandise of believers, that is, using them for the teachers' own
     profit (verse 3) or for immoral ends (verses 10, 13, 14, 18). Unfortunately,
     such teachings were not limited to Peter's time. They seem to have
     started a trend that has appeared many times in subsequent church his-
     tory.
        Effect of False Teachings. As we look at the teachings Peter mentions,
     their destructive nature is readily apparent. First and worst is the denial
     of "the Lord that bought them." The seducers must at one time have ac-
     knowledged Christ as their sovereign Lord and have been numbered
     among those who had been "bought" by His redeeming sacrifice. (The
     same word for "bought" is used in 1 Corinthians 6:20—"ye are bought
     with a price.") Later, for undisclosed reasons, they apostatized to the
     point of denying the divinity of Him "who is the image of the invisible
     God" (Col. 1:15). (Compare 1 John 2:18-22.) What worse accusation
     could be leveled against any professing Christian? Peter, remembering his
     own cowardly denial, must have formed that phrase with deep contrition
      as well as strong conviction. He must have shrunk from seeing others
     follow his shameful example and must have exerted all his spiritual pow-
      ers to turn them from such denial. Unless they repented of their blas-
      phemy, their fate was sealed, not by any arbitrary act on God's part, but
      because their conduct would "bring upon themselves swift destruction"
      (compare Phil. 3:18, 19), that is, eternal death.



a
DAY The effect of evildoing rarely falls on the sinner alone. Who else suffers?
    2 Peter 2:2.


         Others also suffer. In this case Peter sees that "many shall follow their
      pernicious ways" (2 Peter 2:2). The original wording calls for a more spe-
      cific description of the false teachers' conduct, the reference being to "li-
      centious conduct" or "sexual debaucheries" or "dissolute practices"
      (NEB). This translation is confirmed by the writer's later charges of
      "filthy conversation" (verse 7) or "immoral conduct" (TEV) and to "lusts
      of the flesh" in verse 18. Such a life-style harms not only the wrongdoers
      but those who copy their lamentable example. In this case Peter foresees
      that many otherwise faithful church members would be led into sin. If
      teachers, claiming to be divinely commissioned, commit heinous sin, it is
      hardly surprising that those who look to them for models will follow their
      example. Satan always has played on sexual allurement, from Noah's day
      (Gen. 6:1-5) throughout Israel's history (Ex. 32:1-6, 19, 25; Num. 25:1-9;

                                                                                45
    2 Sam. 11:1-5; 1 Kings 14:21-24), into the history of the early church, and
    on to our own day. We should listen carefully to what history tells us.

    THINK IT THROUGH: How widespread is the influence of immoral con-
    duct among Christians today? What special dangers beset present-day
    Christians?
       Truth maligned. The harboring of false teaching raises the danger that
    the church will fall into disrepute. That danger is great indeed when the
    heresies foster immorality; for, no matter how tolerant the world may be
    of its own who break its moral standards, it is quick to scorn those who
    profess Christianity while flouting its extremely high ideals.
       Peter, then, is touching upon a sensitive spot when he asserts that "the
    way of truth shall be evil spoken of" because of those who have followed
    "pernicious ways" or "dissolute practices." The words "by reason of
    whom" may apply either to the false teachers or to those who have fallen
    prey to their wiles. It is possible that both classes are included, for both
    bring the church into disrepute.
       The phrase "the way of truth" refers to the church, as it also does in
    Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14, 22 where it simply is identified as "the
    way." The wider definition here, "the way of truth," stands in stark con-
    trast to the falsehood of the heretical teachers and exalts the Head of the
    church who is Himself "the way" and "the truth" (John 14:6). This brings
    added encouragement for us as Christians to live truthfully.

DAY H. HERESY'S FRUITAGE (2 Peter 2:3-8).

         How does Peter clearly unmask the false teachers' disguise? 2 Peter 2:3.


       The false teachers earn condemnation not only because of their the-
    ological abberations, serious and dangerous as those are, but also be-
    cause of weakness in character. They are covetous or greedy. This trait
    leads them to prey on their dupes. They employ "feigned" or false words,
    the original adjective being that from which we derive our term "plastic,"
    in the sense of imitation as distinct from the genuine. They do this for
    mercenary ends. They have taken up the Christian religion not because of
    sincere conviction but because of what they can gain from it.
       In Peter's world, as in ours, many hypocritical religionists profess
    Christianity only because of the material profit that they obtain from it,
    whether in money, property, or free board and lodging. To this end, those
    who would plague Peter's congregations would "make merchandise of"
    them. From the Greek root for this expression comes the English word
    emporium—a large store, a market, a house of merchandise. This vividly
    illustrates the mercenary motives that lead false and covetous teachers to
    manipulate the faithful for personal gain. What can be more despicable?
    Their unmasking in these verses should warn all ministers and church
    employees to resist the temptation to enrich themselves at the expense of
    the membership and to be transparently honest at all times.
       There is light on the horizon. These merchants will not be allowed to
    operate undisturbed. Their "judgment" or punishment is assured, and
    46
    will not be delayed long. As promised in verse 1, "swift destruction"
    awaits them. In verse 3, Peter uses the same word as Matthew employs in
    recording the parable of the ten virgins who "slumbered" while the bride-
    groom tarried (Matt. 25:5). The assurance here is that the destruction of
    the false teachers will not become drowsy or fail. Their end is certain.
    This assurance must have strengthened those who would suffer from
    their attentions.

    THINK IT THROUGH: What can we who read these words today learn
    from Peter's counsel?

       What three illustrations are given concerning the inevitability of God's
    judgments? 2 Peter 2:4-8.
       I. Rebellious Angels (verse 4). The point here is that, if God did not
    spare the hitherto sinless angels when they sinned, He will not pass over
    the sins of the false teachers. The fallen angels were "consigned to
    Tartarus" and "gloomy dungeons" (NIV), presumably until judgment
    day. What a bleak outlook for those who lead God's children astray!
       2. The Antediluvian World (verse 5). This illustration refers to the
    Flood that destroyed the antediluvian world, and from which only Noah
    and his family were saved through belief in God's warning word (Gen.
    6:5-22). In citing this brighter side of the fearful flood, Peter encourages
    Christians to persevere in righteousness instead of succumbing to general
    godlessness. They should emulate Noah, "a preacher" or "a herald" of
    righteousness who preached by deed as well as by word.
       3. Sodom and Gomorrah (verse 6-8). The dissolute cities of Sodom
    and Gomorrah were burned to ashes because of their wicked ways. Yet,
    as Peter implies, this need not have been. The angels who warned Abra-
    ham and Lot about the imminent destruction of the two cities also
    searched those towns for inhabitants who would repent and escape the
    holocaust (Gen. 18:20-32). Only four residents qualified. They were Lot,
     his wife, and their two daughters (Gen. 19:15, 16); and even their spiritual
    caliber was frail. Yet the Lord, in His generous mercy, described Lot as
    being "just" and "vexed" by the dissolute conduct of his neighbors. Lot
    certainly was far from perfect. The Bible story pictures him as being
    weak and selfish, choosing to dwell among the ungodly. Neveriiheless, he
    accepted the divine offer of salvation from the destruction to be visited on
    Sodom. These negative and positive aspects of his character offer both
    warning and encouragement for us today.

DAY I11. GOD'S MERCIES (2 Peter 2:5-9).

      Fearing that his readers might become discouraged by reading of the
    false teachers and their evil influence, Peter includes pOsitive encourage-
    ment that is based on his knowledge of the Lord's qualities.

      Where and how do we find deliverance from temptation? 2 Peter 2:9, first
    part.

       Peter may have been recalling Jesus' prayer asking the Father to "lead
                                                                              47
    us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil" (Matt. 6:13). The petition
    embodies two aspects of deliverance from temptation. The first keeps us
    out of trouble; the second rescues us from temptation's toils should we
    have fallen into them. This should serve to remind us, as one writer has
    well expressed it, that "Christianity is no insurance policy against the
    trials of life." But we should note that even the "godly" need deliverance
    from temptation.
       Having made these general observations based on the standard transla-
    tions of 2 Peter 2:9, we turn to consider other emphases and possible in-
    terpretations.
       "The Lord knoweth" stresses God's total knowledge, even of evil, for
    "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
    have to do" (Heb. 4:13). He is therefore well able to care for His own, the
    "godly" or "God-fearing" or "devout," being constantly alert to their sit-
    uations—be they comfortable or otherwise.
       The word translated "temptations" may also be expressed as "trial,"
    referring to the trouble that comes from the ungodly. This reminds us of
    the psalmist's assurance: "The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and
    delivereth them out of all their troubles. . . . Many are the afflictions of
    the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all" (Ps. 34:17-19).
    Peter already has illustrated these truths by referring to the rescue of
    Noah and Lot from their dire emergencies (2 Peter 2:5, 7).
       Warning. As surely as the Lord is able to deliver the godly from their
    troubles, so He is certain to reserve or keep the wicked unto the final day
    of judgment to be punished (verse 9). The words "to be punished" would
    relegate punishment to a future date, but a more accurate translation ren-
    ders the relevant word as "being punished." This implies that the disturb-
    ers of the faith, for Peter still has the false teachers in mind, receive some
    of their punishment during this life, prior to judgment day. Some may ap-
    pear to flourish as a green bay tree (Ps. 37:35), but their lives are by no
    means a bed of roses, and the day of judgment awaits them.

DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Relate the second paragraph on

®  page 478 of The Desire of Ages to Peter's counsel as discussed in this
   week's lesson.
    SUMMARY: False teachers always have been used and will continue to
    be used by Satan to disrupt if possible the work and progress of God's
    church. Many will be led astray by them; but, in order to be ensnared by
    false teachings, they will have to ignore the clear warning that God gave
    the church through Peter and the warnings that He continues to give the
    church today.
    APPLICATION:
    • How susceptible am Ito subversive teachings?
    • What progress have I made during the past year in understanding ma-
      jor Christian doctrines?
    • How is the "way of truth" spoken of by those who observe my way of
      life?
    • How faithfully do I fortify my soul and mind through regular Bible
      study and prayer?

INTRODUCTION: Does it bother you when you hear about someone in
the church teaching something contrary to the fundamental doctrines that
characterize the Adventist Church? It is clear that Peter is filled with
indignation as he thinks about the devastation that might be wrought in
his beloved Christian assemblies by the work of unprincipled teachers.
Yet his first thought, remembering the Lord's power to deliver from evil,
is positive and encouraging, both to him and his readers. At the same
time, he is no less sure about the punishment of the unjust (verse 9). By
way of warning, and in an outpouring of indignation directed primarily at
heretical teachers, he lists the latter's shortcomings, showing them to in-
clude sensuality, flouting and defamation of authority, rudeness, an ex-
cessive love of pleasure, and covetousness. He contrasts their rebellious
                                                                         49
    attitudes to those of angels who refrain from judging the rebels. The sinful
    ways of the unprincipled teachers remind him of Balaam's conduct.
       That portrayal of evil—and evil it must be called as we see the damage
    it produces in the lives of people everywhere—does not have merely his-
    torical value. It has been preserved as part of inspired Scripture "for our
    admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come" (1 Cor. 10:11). It
    will serve as a touchstone to enable us to discern between good and evil,
    to avoid theological and spiritual pitfalls, and to hold fast in the church to
    "whatsoever things are true, . . . whatsoever things are pure, whatso-
    ever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report" (Phil. 4:8).
       This lesson should not lead us to point the finger of scorn at some per-
    son we might consider less godly or less orthodox than ourselves. Instead
    it should cause us to look within at the fountain from which our thoughts
    and actions spring. A knowledge of true doctrine is not enough to keep us
    from the kind of heresy that concerns Peter. Christ must control our
    thoughts and motives.

DAY I. DELIVERANCE OR JUDGMENT? (2 Peter 2:9, 10).

       Verse 9 draws the contrast between the fate of the righteous and the
    fate of the wicked in the final judgment but is most concerned with what
    happens to both groups in the present life.

      What does the Lord "know," and how effective is His ability to put this
    knowledge into practice?


      The Lord is portrayed here as "knowing" two things: (1) how to deliver
    the godly out of temptation, and (2) how to reserve the unjust unto the
    day of judgment to be punished.
      Delivering the godly out of temptation. "Temptation" here refers both
    to enticement to sin and the trials that come upon those who steadfastly
    resist sin. In verses 5 and 7 Peter cites the illustrations of Noah and Lot.
    Peter might have spoken from personal experience. If he had done so, he
    could have mentioned his denial of Christ and how Jesus had warned him
    of what he would do, thus helping him withstand the discouragement that
    followed his denial. He also could have mentioned his deliverance from
    prison recorded in Acts 12:5-17.

    ILLUMINATION: "To all who are reaching out to feel the guiding hand of
    God, the moment of greatest discouragement is the time when divine help
    is nearest. They will look back with thankfulness upon the darkest part of
    their way. 'The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly.' 2 Peter 2:9. From
    every temptation and every trial He will bring them forth with firmer faith
    and a richer experience."—The Desire of Ages, p. 528.

      Reserving the unjust unto the day ofjudgment. Peter has illustrated this
    fact in what happened at the Flood (verse 5) and to Sodom and Gomorrah
    (verse 6). The "day of judgment" is to be equated with the "day of the
    Lord" (2 Peter 3:7, 10).

    50
      ILLUMINATION: "To be punished. Literally, 'being punished.' There are
      two well-defined schools of thought concerning Peter's theology:
         "1. That the participle 'being punished' expresses purpose, as re-
      flected in the translation 'to be punished,' that is, for the purpose of being
      punished. This explanation assigns the punishment here mentioned to the
      day of judgment.
         "2. That the participle should be translated 'while being punished,'
      with reference to the retribution that sin brings to the unjust during their
      earthly lives. This interpretation accords more closely with the first half
      of v. 9, according to which the godly are delivered from the temptations
      and trials that beset them in this life. But the unjust, at the same time, are
      suffering as a result of their misdeeds."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol.
      7, pp. 606, 607.

DAY     What does Peter add to his thorough list of the "lawless deeds" or
      shortcomings of the heretical teachers? 2 Peter 2:10.


         At this point we might think that Peter has said all that is needed about
      the ungodly teachers; but no, he has much more to add, hence the words
      "but chiefly" or "especially" (NIV). Beginning with verse 10, he enlarges
      on their despicable characters. They are "them that walk after the flesh,"
      that is, they pursue fleshly pleasures to the exclusion of higher concerns.
      (Compare Rom. 8:1-8.) In the New Testament "flesh" is the opposite of
      "spirit" and refers to the lower nature in which animal desire dominates
      over the spiritual. In this case, the renegade teachers are said to "indulge
      the flesh in its corrupt desires" (NASB). Some read a reference to homo-
      sexuality in Peter's strong words, although they are not as explicit as
      Paul's in Romans 1:24-27. Nevertheless, they strongly condemn the sex-
      ual license taken by the apostates.
         "And despise government." The seducers also "despise government"
       or "look down upon authority." A literal translation of the Greek word
       here rendered as "government" suggests "lordship" which, in the light of
       verses 1 and 11, would refer to their denial of Christ's royal authority.
       This blasphemy (the Greek word occurs at the end of verse 10, but is
       translated in the King James Version as "speak evil of") is hardly surpris-
       ing for the false teachers are further described as "presumptuous" or,
       translating more accurately, as "audacious," and as being "stubborn" or
       "arrogant," having no natural respect for dignities (literally "glories"),
       that is, glorious beings who can be identified as angels or be seen to in-
       clude all of God's celestial family. Some commentators, however, prefer
       to limit the reference to disrespect for church authorities on earth.

DAY IL ANGELS OR ANIMALS? (2 Peter 2:11-14).

5        The example of angels (verse 11). Human beings often regard them-
       selves as the norm, setting their own standards as if there were no higher
       orders of creatures in the universe. Knowing the temperaments of the
       enticers, the apostle contrasts them with the greatly superior order of an-
       gels, "which are greater in power and might." This reminds us that in the

                                                                                  51
Judeo-Christian world of the first century angels played a much more
prominent role than they seem to in ours.
   But mention of angels brings no comfort to the adversaries. To the con-
trary, the writer appeals to angelic conduct as a rebuke to the irreverent
and blasphemous railings of the enemy. The apostle appears to be refer-
ring to the loyal angels "which are greater in might and power" in con-
trast either to the defeated angels (compare Rev. 12:7, 8) or to the evil
teachers who would be weaker still.
   The original words translated as "railing accusation" in the King James
Version of verse 11 may be more accurately rendered as "blasphemous
judgment," revealing the audacity of those who criticize heavenly au-
thorities in God's presence ("before the Lord") and those whom God has
placed in authority in His church.

THINK IT THROUGH: Church leaders, being human, sometimes make
mistakes. What does 2 Peter 2:11 indicate should be our attitude when we
are convinced that something they are doing is wrong? How should we go
about doing what we can in expressing our opinion in a Christian way?



  Why do you think Peter makes the caustic analysis that he does of the
seducers' characters? 2 Peter 2:12-14.



  Creatures of Instinct. Peter now returns (verse 12) to an unmasking of
the delinquents' additional shortcomings, which are many. He does not
mince words. He compares them to "natural brute beasts" or unreason-
ing animals, creatures of instinct, produced to be captured and destroyed
or hunted for food. They have allowed themselves to descend to a brutish
level. What a devastating description of any human being, let alone those
who claim to be spiritual advisors! In the heat of his disgust he directly
accuses the teachers of blasphemy, for they speak irreverently of divine
matters of which they are demonstrably ignorant. Their interests have
been so earthly that they have become incapable of discerning the heav-
enly. As a result, they will be destroyed by their own depravity. "Whatso-
ever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh
shall of the flesh reap corruption" (Gal. 6:7, 8). That is not an arbitrary
judgment, but a natural outcome of evil. Persistent sinners bring about
their own destruction—" sin, when its finished, bringeth forth death"
(James 1:15).

NOTE how such a retribution for wickedness is in accord with that which is
foretold concerning "the prince of Tyre," who typifies Satan. Eze. 28:18.

   Sinners are destroyed by that which comes from inside themselves—
sin brings forth "a fire from the midst" of them and that fire consumes
them. That consuming process is not limited to the time of the final judg-
ment but is evident in the sinners' unhappiness and dissatisfaction in this
life.

52
DAY To what blasphemous lengths do these depraved apostates go? 2 Peter
   2:13 (last part), 14.
Ei
         In the original there is no verse division between the phrases that we
     identify as verses 13 and 14, and neither verse is a complete sentence.
     This continuity influences our understanding of Peter's denunciation of
     the depraved apostates. They are described in verse 14 as "having eyes
     full of adultery." Some think that the "feast" Peter mentions is the cele-
     bration of the Last Supper. Even during the most sacred of all commemo-
     rations, these wicked men look with lustful eyes on the women members
     of the congregation. They have so fed their minds with sensual thoughts
     that they cannot break the cycle of their fleshly desires. Their lusts crowd
     out the loftier aspirations that should rule the mind during the commu-
     nion service. Even in the presence of God they "cannot cease from sin."
     They are insatiable in their sexual appetites. Worse still, they beguile un-
     stable souls, that is, they lure others, especially the weak, to follow their
     deplorable example. Any who are tempted to engage in such practices
     should recall the Master's warning: "Whoso shall offend [that is, cause to
     stumble] one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for
     him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were
     drowned in the depth of the sea" (Matt. 18:6).
         The catalog of these beguilers' weaknesses is not complete even then.
     Their hearts or affections are said to get their exercise (the Greek word is
     based on that from which we derive "gymnastics") by fostering covetous
     desires. Instead of being content, they allow themselves to become "past
      masters in mercenary greed" (NEB). How different would have been
     their reputation if they had heeded Christ's counsel to "beware of covet-
      ousness" (Luke 12:15) and had recognized the truth of Paul's analysis that
      "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil" (1 Tim. 6:10, NIV). And
      how much happier our lives will be if we learn, at an early stage, to con-
      trol our possessive instincts and decide, like Paul, in whatsoever state we
      are, therewith to be content (Phil. 4:11). Greed is its own worst enemy, as
      it never can be satisfied.
         The final words in verse 14, "cursed children," may be taken as an
      exclamation that bursts from the writer's anguished heart as he surveys
      the harm done to his flock by the godless conduct of the false religionists.

DAY I11. COMPARISON WITH BALAAM (2 Peter 2:15, 16).

       In what ways is it appropriate for Peter to compare the heretical teachers
     with Balaam? 2 Peter 2:15, 16.


        Confrontation with the covetousness of the venal instructors reminds
     Peter of their prototype, Balaam the son of Beor. (See Numbers 22
     through 24 for his story.) This man, who certainly could have been an
     effective prophet of the Most High God, sold himself to Israel's enemy for
     financial gain. The unfaithful leaders in Asia Minor succumbed to a simi-
     lar temptation. Following Balaams's example, they had forsaken the right

                                                                               53
     or the upright way. That shows that they had known the true from the
     false, the righteous way of life from the unrighteous. But they had wan-
     dered from the right path. As was true in the case of Balaam, their greed
     led them to prefer "the wages of unrighteousness," "of injustice" or
     "wrongdoing," over the less tangible rewards of rightdoing.
        We must not infer from that description of the "wages" or "reward"
     that were offered to Balaam (see Num. 22:17, 18; 24:13) that all profit is
     evil. The morality of having wealth largely depends on the manner in
     which it is gained and used. Peter here uses the intensive Greek word for
     "loved," possibly indicating the depth of the dissemblers' greed and at-
     tachment to material things. As did Balaam, they seek financial gain at
     the expense of spiritual integrity.
        The writer now brings his long sentence (verses 12-16) to a close with a
     phrase that is an integral part of verse 15: "But was rebuked for his iniq-
     uity," or his violation of law, God's law. The rebuke came first from the
     donkey's refusal to continue the journey on which Balaam was bent, and
     then from the angel whose presence the donkey had sensed (Num. 22:22-
     27). The prophet's persistence in a course of action that was motivated by
     greed is described as "madness" (2 Peter 2:16). Obstinate persistence in
     wrongdoing amounts to insanity. The apostle's plain speaking is intended
     to set a loud bell ringing in his readers' minds. He does not want them or
     us to follow misleading models. He knew Balaam's end: "Balaam also the
     son of Beor they [the Israelites] slew with the sword" (Num. 31:8).

     "Temptations" or "Trials." "These trials of life are God's workmen to
   remove the impurities, infirmities, and roughness from our characters,
   and fit us for the society of pure, heavenly angels in glory. But as we pass
   through these trials, as the fires of affliction kindle upon us, we must not
   keep the eye on the fire which is seen, but let the eye of faith fasten upon
   the things unseen, the eternal inheritance, the immortal life, the eternal
   weight of glory; and while we do this the fire will not consume us, but
   only remove the dross, and we shall come forth seven times purified,
   bearing the impress of the Divine."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 706, 707.

     SUMMARY: God delivers the righteous out of temptations. The record of
     His dealings with His people in the past assures us that He is more than
     capable of and willing to deliver His people from temptation today. On the
     other hand, the wicked are destroyed by their own corruption. Sin is self-
     destroying.

     APPLICATION:
     • As you recall occasions when the Lord has delivered you out of temp-
       tation, was your cooperation required? In what ways did you cooper-
       ate?
     o Which, if any, of the five or six undesirable attitudes listed in 2 Peter
       2:10 operate in your life?
     • Do you allow room in your life for the ministry of angels? In what ways
       ought you to do so?

INTRODUCTION: Many of the words and phrases Peter uses in his sec-
ond chapter sound extremely harsh to our ears. However, we need to
remember the background against which he wrote this letter. He loved his
readers. It is possible that he knew some of them personally and believed
in the genuineness of their conversions, for he describes them as having
"obtained like precious faith with us" (2 Peter 1:1). From afar he has
heard of the disruptive work being done among them by those who claim
to be teachers, but who live such dissolute lives and teach such destruc-
tive doctrines that they are destroying the congregations that Peter him-
self may have helped to establish.
   News of such harmful activity prompts the apostle to write in defense
of the faith in order to fortify believers and to expose the errors of those
who are leading so many astray. These objectives help to explain the
strong, blunt language that Peter uses in chapter 2. It tears off the mask of
false sanctity and reveals the seducers for the renegade sinners that they
truly are.
   If that were all that the epistle accomplishes, it would have merely his-
torical value some 1900 years later. But we find that, as so often in Scrip-
ture, the ancient words are remarkably up-to-date and their message suits
 many of the circumstances that confront us in the late twentieth century.
Thus this week's study can be both interesting and profitable for each of
 us today.

                                                                          55
DAY I. DECEIVERS UNMASKED (2 Peter 2:17-19).

       Waterless wells (verse 17). Peter now turns from the historical illustra-
    tions that he has been using to underline the evil nature of the heretical
    teachers—antediluvians, Sodom and Gomorrah, rebellious angel—to
    deal with those teachers' characters. He takes a leaf out of his Lord's
    notebook and virtually tells his congregations, "By their fruits ye shall
    know them" (Matt. 7:20). In powerful strokes he paints vivid pictures of
    the deceivers (verse 17). Because he is writing to those who were often
    dependent on wells or springs for their water, his first two metaphors
    would catch their immediate attention.

       What is the significance of the way Peter illustrates the barren nature of
     the seducers' ministry? 2 Peter 2:17.



       Few among those who read or heard his words would fail to grasp the
    immediate significance of his charge that the perverters were as useless
    and as dangerous as "wells without water." The initial readers would
    know from experience the frustrations and perils that lurked in dry wells.
    The thirsty would run to a well from which water had been regularly
    drawn, only to hear the empty bucket bang against the dry soil that held
    not a drop of moisture. They would hurry to the next well, only to repeat
    the discovery. Fear of widespread drought would strike their minds.
       Peter implies in a similar way that church members would go to pro-
    fessed teachers and ministers expecting them to provide the water of life,
    drawn from the wells of salvation. Alas, many thirsty souls were doomed
    to bitter disappointment. These false teachers had no spiritual water with
    which to quench the believers' thirst. They were full of destructive criti-
    cisms, disloyal suggestions, covetous desires, and poor theology; but
    they were empty of positive, orthodox scriptural teaching. If left
    undisturbed they would destroy the churches that had been raised up by
    the faithful apostles and their colaborers.
       Rainless clouds (verse 17). In a similar but different illustration the
    writer reinforces his condemnation of those who were undermining the
    churches. He likens them to clouds or mists that bring hope of rain to
    drought-stricken people but quickly are dissipated or driven away by a
    squall of wind, leaving the thirsty ones thirstier than ever. Peter's congre-
    gations would appreciate that picture, for their hopes had risen when the
    teachers had first appeared. The believers were thirsting after righteous-
    ness. They welcomed the bold instructors, hoping that they were bringing
    them the water of life, but soon discovered that they were empty of
    lifegiving teaching. Their disappointment was no less keen than that of
    the thirsty traveler who was robbed of his hope of finding water. Such a
    thirst would be more intense than when the deceptive teachers first ap-
    peared. It would be heightened by the spiritually dry, lifeless teachings of
    the false ones.

         What bleak future is assured for such false teachers? 2 Peter 2:17.


    56
          Such deceptive teaching meets its just punishment. For them, says
       Peter, "the mist of darkness is reserved for ever." The apostle's figure of
       speech actually is more vivid than the King James Version implies. He
       declares that the apostates will be sent into "the blackness of the dark-
       ness," or "the blackest darkness." He sees them sharing the same eternal
       fate as that of "the angels that sinned," whom God had delivered into
       similar gloom (verse 4).
DAY The Water of life. The contrast between the false prophets' service and
1,

1,
       that of the One whom they claimed to serve is heightened by Peter's
   ..4 choice of illustration. They are "wells without water," but Christ pro-
       vides "a well of water springing up into everlasting life" (John 4:14).
       Whereas they could not even fill a spiritual cup with life-giving liquid,
       Jesus gives His true followers "living water" so that they "shall never
       thirst" (John 4:10). The dramatic differences furnish us with a means of
       measuring the efficacy of human ministry—does it meet the spiritual
       needs of those who "thirst after righteousness" (Matt. 5:6)? If it does not,
       the remedy lies first with a change in those who have been deceiving the
       churches. They need to drink from the Fount of Life, for "whosoever
       drinketh of the water" that Christ "shall give him shall never thirst"; and
       that water "shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting
       life" (John 4:14).

          What principal method did the teachers use to ruin the believers' Chris-
       tian experience? 2 Peter 2:18.


          The apostle now turns from figures of speech and in plain, but power-
       ful, language identifies the seductions of the apostate teachers. In doing
       so, he unmasks the means by which they lure the honest but weak Chris-
       tians into their snares. They "speak great swelling words of vanity." Such
       pompous and boastful words are devoid of genuine spiritual significance.
       Their principal instrument of seduction is "the lusts of the flesh," that
       age-old inducement to sin that the devil has used so successfully among
       God's children.

       SEARCH AND LEARN: Show how the texts that follow illustrate the dev-
       il's success in using the "lusts of the flesh" to cause people to sin.

         Add two more



         Peter's scathing words gain added justification as we learn that the se-
       ducers' victims were "those that were clean escaped from them who live
                                                                                 57
       in error" (2 Peter 2:18). This reveals that many of those who were caught
       in the lustful teachers' toils were new converts. Having recently escaped
       from the errors of paganism. they had not put sufficient distance as yet
       between their new life and their old. They were not mature enough Chris-
       tians to withstand the sexual enticements that were dangled before their
       eyes. As of today Satan has not found it necessary to change his principal
       tools of seduction. They are as effective now as they were in the days of
       the first church. How open-eyed we need to be to discern right from
       wrong!

DAY      To what basic law does the false teacher's conduct point? 2 Peter 2:19.


          The Galilean fisherman had gained deeper spiritual insight since the
       day when he "forsook all, and followed" Jesus (Luke 5:11). From a dis-
       tance, piecing together the distressing news that reached him from Asia
       Minor, he rightly analyzed the tactics of those who were leading new con-
       verts astray. They were employing some of the same sophistries that still
       are being used today—promising liberty, freedom for each to indulge his
       or her own pet sins while professing allegiance to Christ. They were re-
       versing the process described by Paul when he wrote of being "delivered
       from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of
       God" (Rom. 8:21). They were falsely proclaiming freedom from the
       "bondage" of the gospel and, in so doing, were ensnaring new Christians
       in the kind of sin from which it would be harder to escape than when they
       first left paganism.

         In what way were the false teachers living illustrations of the falseness of
       their own claims? Verse 19.


          "They themselves are slaves of depravity" (NIV). It was not possible
       for the false teachers to lead others astray without setting the evil exam-
       ple themselves. Conversely, it was not possible for them to set others
       truly at liberty without enjoying freedom from overt sin in their own lives.
       Unknown to themselves, they truly were "slaves of sin," enslaved by the
       evil one as surely as if they were shackled literally to Satan. This truth is
       stated by Peter in a most perceptive way: "Of whom a man is overcome,
       of the same is he brought in bondage" (verse 19), or "a man is the slave of
       whatever has mastered him" (NEB). This profound truth needs empha-
       sizing in our permissive age. Also it should alert all Christians to the dan-
       ger of becoming enslaved by a specific sin, as well as by weaknesses in
       general.
       NOTE how Peter may have been echoing the Lord's judgment recorded in
       John 8:34.

DAY 11. THE ENTANGLEMENT OF DECEPTION (2 Peter 2:20-22).

1.55     How relevant to our situation today is the apostle's description of teach-
       ing heresy and engaging in warfare against the church? 2 Peter 2:20.

       58
          It is preferable to see the remaining verses in this chapter as referring to
       the apostate teachers ("they themselves" in verse 19) rather than to those
       whom they had duped (those who had recently escaped from paganism).
       The deceivers had, at one time, "escaped the pollutions" (shameful
       deeds and crimes; hence, moral pollutions) "of the world." This they had
       done by their personal knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ—
       the only way of escape. This suggests that those teachers had been born-
       again Christians but had lost their first love, had become enamored of
       worldly pleasures and vices, and had apostatized. They were living
       warnings to faithful Christians.
          Although the writer refers primarily to the wayward teachers, his suc-
       ceeding comments provide warnings to us as Christians today. For that
       purpose he employs fisherman terminology. We, like the apostates, can
       be "again entangled therein [like fish in a net] and overcome" by "the
       pollutions of the world." Paul, to a similar end, admonishes us: "Let him
       that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall" (1 Cor. 10:12). (See also
       Heb. 2:1, 3.)
          There is no doubt in Peter's mind as to the fate of those who, having
       intimately known the Lord, reject Him and return to serve His enemy.
       The "latter end is worse with them than the beginning" (verse 20). This
       mournful but just pronouncement agrees with the opinion expressed in
       Hebrews 6:4-6: "It is impossible for those who were once
       enlightened, . . . if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repen-
       tance." (See also Matt. 12:31; Heb. 10:26-29.) This is one of the saddest
       judgments in history, but it is not arbitrary. It is the inevitable outcome of
       the free choice made by those who, once having accepted, now reject
       Christ's freely offered salvation. "He who has once been a Christian but
        has gone back to the world becomes spiritually hardened and less respon-
       sive to spiritual appeals. His salvation thus becomes more difficult."—
       S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 610.

       NOTE the significant title by which Peter pays homage to his Master. He,
       and he alone, speaks of the Redeemer by His composite title, "the Lord and
       Saviour Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:11; 2:20; 3:18).

         "God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (1:1) and "the Lord and Saviour"
       (3:2) come close to the full reverence of the longer title. Only Paul, in
       Titus 1:4, comes near to that description as he speaks of "the Lord Jesus
       Christ our Saviour." Of the Gospel writers, only Luke, recording the an-
       gel's announcement, writes of "a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord"
       (2:11); while John, preserving the Samaritans' verdict, records, "this is
       indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world" (4:42). Our own reverence
       can be strengthened by contemplating the breadth of meaning found in
       Peter's loving recognition of his Master's multiple offices.

DAY       To what sad conclusions had Peter come concerning the deceivers?
        2 Peter 2:21.
OUP,

          Recognition of the perils of apostasy leads to agreement with the con-

                                                                                   59
      clusion expressed in 2 Peter 2:21. Possession of knowledge always brings
      responsibility. When once we have heard of a law, for instance, we cannot
      plead ignorance of its requirements; we have become subject to it. So it
      was with the backsliders. They had known from personal experience "the
      way of righteousness," that is, the Way, the Christian way that leads to
      righteousness through faith in Christ Jesus. They had known it well
      enough to become its prophets and teachers, albeit unworthy ones. It
      would have been better for them not to have known it; then they would
      have stood on neutral ground and been able to evaluate the Christian
      message at its true worth and to respond wholeheartedly to its high call-
      ing. This they could not now do, for they had turned from it and were
      persuading others to reject it. In so doing they brought themselves under
      judgment, against which they could not plead ignorance.
         The holy commandment. At the close of verse 21 Peter reveals the root
      cause of the disaster that struck the apostate teachers. They had turned
      "from the holy commandment delivered unto them." This was a deliber-
      ate act on their part. Indeed, some of the Greek manuscripts imply that
      they "turned back from," that is, they turned their backs on the holy com-
      mandment that had been delivered to them. And what was that "holy
      commandment"? A literal interpretation might lead to Luke 10:27, "Thou
      shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, . . . and thy neighbour as
      thyself." That commandment summarizes the essence of true Christian-
      ity and all the laws of God. A more specific application sees Peter's
      phrase as an indictment of the apostates' antagonism to law in general;
      their claim to be above law, free from it, able to do whatsoever their im-
      pulses urged them to do. In this philosophy there was nothing new—it
      was the same old story of human beings wanting to go their own way and
      indulge their own appetites and inclinations, even when contrary to the
      law of God which is "the holy commandment."

        In what blunt language does the apostle describe the conclusion of the
      course pursued by the false prophets? 2 Peter 2:22.


         The apostolic indictment against those who were leading God's people
      astray concludes in verse 22 with two picturesque but withering judg-
      ments: (1) "the dog is turned to his own vomit again," and (2) "the sow
      that was washed to her wallowing in the mire." Neither reproach is pleas-
      ant, but both are justified, for those who leave the way of sin to follow
      righteousness and then revert to the sinful, law-rejecting life are choosing
      on a moral level what dogs and pigs choose in their animal existence.
      Peter's blunt language must have led many first-century church members
      to serious thought and should do the same for us today.

DAY               STUDY AND MEDITATION:
        Responsibility of church leaders: "The people will seldom rise higher
      than their minister. A world-loving spirit in him has a tremendous influ-
      ence upon others. The people make his deficiencies an excuse to cover
      their world-loving spirit. They quiet their own consciences, thinking that
      they may be free to love the things of this life and be indifferent to spiri-

      60
tual things, because their ministers are so. They deceive their own souls,
and remain in friendship with the world, which the apostle declares to be
enmity with God.
   "Ministers should be examples to the flock. They should manifest an
undying love for souls and the same devotion to the cause which they
desire to see in the people."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 645, 646.
   For our twentieth century. "It does our generation little credit that such
passion [as Peter's] for truth and holiness strikes an alien note in our
minds. Peter's plain speaking in this chapter [Second Peter 2] has a very
practical purpose, just as Jesus' warnings had: 'What I say unto you I say
unto all, Watch!' We would be mistaken to assume, It could never hap-
pen to us.' Both Scripture and experience assure us that it
could. . . . Covetousness, sophistical arguments, pride in knowledge,
gluttony, drunkenness, lust, arrogance against authority of all kinds, and,
most of all, the danger of denying the lordship of the Redeemer—are
these not all the paramount temptations of money-mad, sex-mad, materi-
alistic, anti-authoritarian, twentieth century man?"—Michael Green,
Tyndale New Testament Commentaries, vol. 18, p. 122.
    "Self-righteousness is a curse, a human embellishment, which Satan
 uses for his glory. Those who garnish the soul with self-praise and flattery
prepare the way for the seven other spirits more wicked than the first. In
 their very reception of the truth these souls deceive themselves. They are
 building upon a foundation of self-righteousness. The prayers of congre-
gations may be offered to God with a round of ceremonies, but if they are
 offered in self-righteousness God is not honored by them. The Lord de-
clares, will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not
 profit thee.' In spite of all their display, their garnished habitation, Satan
 comes in with a troop of evil angels and takes his place in the soul, to help
 in the deception. The apostle writes, 'If after they have escaped the pollu-
 tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus
 Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is
 worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to
 have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to
 turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them' "—Ellen G.
 White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1093.

SUMMARY: When professed Christians turn back to their old life of sin,
they give up true freedom in Christ to become slaves to sin once again.
The fact is that their latter state is worse than their former one because
once having apostatized it is more difficult to find freedom from sin in
Christ again.

• Judging by the fruits I produce, what quality of tree does my life repre-
  sent?
• Which of the sins that are uncovered in this week's lesson cause me the
  most trouble?
• When did I last drink of the living water that only Christ can give?
• When spiritually thirsty people come to me for refreshment, how thor-
  oughly and pleasantly is their thirst quenched?

    THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 3:1-7.

    DAY MEMORY TEXT: "Now all these things happened unto them for en-

    IT  samples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the
        ends of the word are come" (1 Cor. 10:11).

    CENTRAL THOUGHT: No matter how unchangeable the course of hu-
    man history may appear to be, the Christian places his confidence in pro-
    phetic forecasts and looks forward to the "last days" and Christ's return.

    INTRODUCTION: In chapter 2 Peter forcefully expresses his righteous
    indignation against the immoral and deceptive teachers who would lead
    his flocks to spiritual ruin. In chapter 3 he readdresses himself to his cen-
    tral purpose—the strengthening of the believers' commitment to Christ.
    To this end, he develops the theme begun in his first chapter—spiritual
    growth in preparation for entrance "into the everlasting kingdom of our
    Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:11). Of course, there were no
    chapter divisions in the original letter. It was written as one continuous
    message.
       We should embark on our study of the closing third of the epistle in an
    appreciative and respectful spirit. This final chapter stands head high
    with the best that the New Testament offers. We should prepare to find
    and digest Peter's counsel, whatever its message may be and whatever
    the Spirit may tell us through its verses.

DAY I. SCORNFUL CRITICISM EXAMINED (2 Peter 3:1-4).

3     No matter how strong the Bible writers' language may have been in
    denouncing heresy and wrongdoing, their spirit is tender toward the inno-
    cent and faithful Christians whom they address. In this closing chapter of
    his second epistle, Peter uses the term "beloved" for his readers in four

    62
     places—here in verse 1 and in verses 8, 14, and 17. He follows each use
     with an exhortation, "by way of remembrance" (verse 1), "be not igno-
     rant" (verse 8), "be diligent" (verse 14), and "beware" (verse 17).

       For what general purpose did the apostle write "this second epistle"?
     2 Peter 3:1.


       The purpose behind Peter's second letter is identical with that which
     prompted his first. Although the word both is italicized in some editions
     of the King James Version to indicate that there is no word corresponding
     to it in the original, its inclusion is justified by the Greek construction.
     Peter wrote his first and second letters to remind his readers of the in-
     struction that they had received already from the Scriptures and from
     apostolic teaching (verses 1, 2). He expected the church members to re-
     ceive his reminder, for they had "pure minds," or, more accurately, "the
     pure mind" or "the sincere mind." The Greek word translated "pure"
     suggests "tested by the sun's warmth." Flaws in sculpture in those days
     often were patched by wax which would melt in sunlight. When unflawed
     works were described in Latin they were said to be sine cera, "without
     wax," whence our word sincere or pure. The use of "pure" here testifies
     to Peter's high regard for his readers. He believed them to be genuine
     Christians and encouraged them to measure up to his estimate of their
     charkters.

       What two particular ends did the writer have in mind for his readers?
     2 Peter 3:2.


       The pastor first wanted to remind his readers of the "holy" prophets'
     messages. This must refer to the Old Testament prophecies, particularly
     those that foretold the work of Christ and His coming. Then he wanted to
     remind them of the commandment or moral instruction given by "your
     apostles? rather than "us the apostles." This wording delicately avoids
     any touch of arrogance on Peter's part. He is but one among several au-
     thorities who had been appointed by "the Lord and Saviour" to serve the
     young churches and their members. Neither he nor the prophets nor the
     apostles laid claim to personal authority. They were only the Lord's
     spokesmen, and His divine authority sufficed.

DAY     How does Peter disclose the specific line of prophetic and apostolic teach-
   d ing that is being attacked by the skeptics? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
rial

       The doubters' principal attacks were directed against the doctrine of
     the second advent. "Where is the promise of his coming?" In view of this
     the writer gives the topic first place, saying, "Knowing this first," and
     relating the skeptics' subversive questions to "the last days." The refer-
     ence is to the days that were to pass between Christ's ascension and His
     second coming. The continual hope of the disciples, their converts, and

                                                                                63

their successors was for the speedy return of their Master. (For extended
comment on the hope and the passage of time before its fulfillment, see
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp, 630-633, "Additional Note on Ro-
mans 13.")
   To Peter and his fellow believers Christ's return was an ever-living
hope, based on their Lord's teachings (Matthew 24), His promise (John
14:3), and that of the angels at the ascension scene (Acts 1:11). But to the
literal minded and the materialists, the passage of time brought doubt and
severe erosion of faith in the certainty of Christ's return. Those whom
Peter described as "scoffers" or "mockers" would be susceptible in a par-
ticular way to such doubts, for their spiritual integrity already had been
weakened by their personal habits. They were the false teachers who
were described so forcefully in chapter 2. They were attempting the im-
possible task of professing Christianity while indulging their fleshly appe-
tites. They had no inner core of spiritual honesty on which to build a firm
faith. They were materialists. Their spiritual capacity had been so weak-
ened by persistent sin that they were incapable of exercising a childlike
faith in the promises recorded in Scripture or in those that were passed on
orally by the apostles.

APPLICATION TO OUR TIME: "Looking down through the ages to the
close of time, Peter was inspired to outline conditions that would exist in
the world just prior to the second coming of Christ. 'There shall come in
the last days scoffers,' he wrote, 'walking after their own lusts, and say-
ing, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,
all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.' But
`when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh
upon them.' 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Not all, however, would be ensnared by
the enemy's devices. As the end of all things earthly should approach,
there would be faithful ones able to discern the signs of the times. While a
large number of professing believers would deny their faith by their
works, there would be a remnant who would endure to the end."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 535, 536.

  What significance do you see in the way that the scoffers expressed their
doubts concerning the second coming? 2 Peter 3:4.


  The apostle must be quoting the type of question by which the false
teachers revealed their skepticism about Christ's return. Their question,
"Where is the promise of his coming?" is not concerned with the place in
the Bible where a particular promise is recorded, but with the fulfillment
of the many declarations that Jesus would come again. Because such a
question is natural to human nature, and therefore valid, Peter had no
quarrel with that aspect of their inquiry. His objection lay in the spirit in
which their question was nurtured. It was negative, arising from their ma-
terialistic outlook, their scorn of the spiritual, their devotion to pleasure,
their unrepentant sensuality.
  The mockers' attitude has a certain plausibility arising from their ap-
peal to nature. Their reference to "since the fathers fell asleep" may be to

64
    Lritm-frair        Vaantiriati                                  1103=
    the 30 post-resurrection years during which many prominent church lead-
    ers had died. It is more likely, however, that they are employing the New
    Testament term for the Old Testament "fathers" or patriarchs. (For exam-
    ples see Acts 3:13; 5:30; 26:6; 28:25; Rom. 9:5; 15:8; 1 Cor. 10:1; Heb.
    1:1.) Note also that the doubters employ the biblical term for death, "fell
    asleep." They then appeal to the apparent unchangeability in nature—
    "all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation." The
    sun rises and sets each day, the moon's phases reappear each month, the
    seasons follow with annual regularity. This cycle, they imply, will con-
    tinue without interruption. Although using a similar rationale, these scoff-
    ers should not be identified with present-day evolutionists, for Peter indi-
    cates that they believed in Creation.

DAY 11. THE FLOOD AND THE FUTURE (2 Peter 3:5-7).

       The wayward teachers have appealed to the apparent immutability of
    nature in an effort to pour scorn on hopes that God would intervene dra-
    matically in human history by visibly sending His Son into the human
    arena a second time. Peter turns that approach back upon the dissidents
    by appealing to the irrefutable fact that global catastrophe once had
    stricken our world when the Flood occurred.

      How does Peter counter the argument concerning the uninterrupted
    course of human history? 2 Peter 3:5, 6.


       In view of the severe judgments contained in chapter 2, it is not surpris-
    ing to find the apostle attacking the disturbers' emphasis on the appar-
    ently uninterrupted continuance of history since the world was created.
    He accuses them of willfully ignoring creation's dependence on the word
    of God. Some see in this a reference to the personal Word, the Son, by
    whom "all things were made" (John 1:3). Such a subtlety is unlikely in
    this context. The clearer reference is to God's spoken word as the cre-
    ative agent. (See Gen. 1:3, 6, 9; compare with Ps. 33:6, 9.) The Creator's
    word sufficed to create the atmospheric heavens (the Greek word is in the
    plural) "of old" or "long ago." By the same power the earth came into
    existence. The close reliance on Genesis 1 is clear. Our globe emerged
    from "the waters" (Gen. 1:2, 6, 7, 9, 10).
       But the implication is that what can be done by that almighty word can
    also be undone by the same. He who created the earth "by the breath of
    his mouth" (Ps. 33:6) also told Noah that He would "bring a flood of wa-
    ters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh" apart from Noah and his family
    and selected animals (Gen. 6:17-19). Then comes the irony described in
    2 Peter 3:6. There the first word, "whereby," represents two words in the
    original that today we would translate "by which." This may be reason-
    ably seen as a reference to the creative word and the waters from which
    our world first appeared. The sad irony lies in the subsequent destruction
    by that same element, water, of most of the creation by which the Lord
    had clothed and populated the globe. As is so often the case in nature, its
    blessings also can bring catastrophe. The beneficent sun that so pleas-

                                                                              65
         Lesson                                      l2=111g1g33 frir3 Mtuailmg3




       antly warms can scorch also, and life-giving water also can drown and
       destroy. In the case we are considering, Peter's conclusion is terse—"the
       world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished." Of course,
       it was human, animal, and vegetable life that "perished," not the globe
       itself.

DAY       After reminding his readers of the Flood, Peter then turns to the prospect

15    of a future cataclysmic judgment. What contrasting cleansing agent to that
       used in the Flood will God use in the final judgment, and why does He
       choose a different agent? 2 Peter 3:7; Gen. 9:15.


         We may need to remind ourselves that the apostle still is considering
       "words" and their role in God's design for this world. (See verses 2 and
       5.) The writer now asserts that "by the same word," that is, by God's
       word whether through the prophets and apostles (verse 2) or by direct
       speech at Creation (verse 5), the present heavens and the earth have been
       kept in store (verse 7). And for what purpose? They "are being kept" or
       "reserved" with a view to being cleansed by fire at judgment day. The
       description of the judgment he gives in verse 10 is not difficult for those
       who live in the atomic age to comprehend.

       SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the following texts to discover more of
       what the Bible has to say about the final judgment as it develops a consis-
       tent picture of a fiery cleansing of our world:
                   Ps. 21:9            Nahum 1:5, 6
                   Ps. 50:3            Mal. 4:1
                   Ps. 97:3-5          Matt. 3:11, 12
                   Isa. 66:15, 16

         Judgment day, with its cleansing fires, will purify the earth that has
       been polluted by centuries of sinful conduct. But "the day of judgment"
       will specifically bring "perdition" to "ungodly men." The word translated

       66
                                                                      esson
     "perdition" is related to the verb rendered as "punished" in 2 Peter 3:6.
     Both words are associated with the thought of destruction, ruin, and even
     annihilation that will be the final fate of the ungodly. The author has used
     the same word in chapter 2, verses 1 and 3, where it is translated as "dam-
     nable," "destruction," and "damnation." Peter sees no indication that
     the false teachers will repent of their deceptive work. He sees them in-
     cluded among those who will suffer irreparable punishment. There is di-
     vine justice in such an end, for they are impious and godless (compare
     Jude 15, 18).

     THINK IT THROUGH: How can those who reject God and work against
     Him and His purposes expect to share a sinless eternity with Him and those
     who have been redeemed from evil?

DAY NOTE ON THE SECOND COMING: Our study this week has brought us
ICJ face to face with the biblical teaching about our Lord's return. We shall
    meet this glorious topic again during our remaining studies this quarter,
    but shall have less space for its detailed consideration. Therefore, before
    this week's study closes, we should dwell on some of its features that will
    not be touched on in our study of the remainder of Peter's third chapter.
        1. Its necessity. No omnipotent Creator can permit a rebellious world
    to continue its career unchecked. Such a policy would perpetuate rebel-
    lion, weaken the Almighty's program, and ensure the continuance of sin
    with all its related cruelty, suffering, and death. Therefore it is necessary
    that sin's reign should end and God reign supreme. This can come to pass
    only through Christ's return and the subjection of all to God the Father
    (1 Cor. 15:24-28).
        2. Its certainty. In the celestial timetable there never has been any
    doubt about the certainty of Christ's second advent. It has been foreseen
    and planned from eternity. It does not depend on human skills and is not
    to be frustrated by human frailties. Our slowness, our failures, even our
    apostasy can delay the fulfillment of the eternal purpose, but because all
    is foreseen by the Omniscient, the day of the Lord will come at the time
    the Lord has foreseen.
        3. Its proximity. By the exercise of hindsight we can see how difficult it
    would have been for the Master to return at earlier points in history. The
    conditions for return were not fulfilled. The earth was not fully explored;
    the church had not developed its potential; not all sections of earth were
    open to evangelization; means of travel and communication were rudi-
     mentary. Much yet remains to be done, but the means are available. No
     less significant is the horrible negative—human beings now hold in their
     hands the means of worldwide destruction. The possibility of annihilation
     through nuclear destruction increases every passing year. Thus our safety
     lies in the proximity of the second coming (2 Peter 3:11-13).
        4. Its finality. The war to end wars has been fought often but never has
     accomplished its objective. But when Christ shall come again to deliver
     His people He will accomplish His objective. He shall come at the right
     time. If there were a better time for Him to have come, the All-wise One
     would have chosen it. All who really wish to be saved, who prefer righ-
     teousness to sin, who trust in Christ and not in themselves for salvation

                                                                               67
      will be ready to say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he
      will save us" (Isa. 25:9). (See Rev. 22:17.)

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
      "Scoffers. In Jude (verse 18) the same Greek word is rendered mock-
    ers. The word means those who deride, reproach, ridicule. There is usu-
    ally in the word the idea of contempt, or malignity towards an object.
    Here the sense seems to be that they would treat with derision or con-
    tempt the predictions respecting the advent of the Saviour, and the end of
    the world. It would appear probable that there was a particular or definite
    class of men referred to; a class who would hold peculiar opinions, and
    who would urge plausible objections against the fulfillment of the predic-
    tions respecting the end of the world, and the second coming of the
    Saviour—for these are the points to which Peter particularly
    refers. . . . The eye of the apostle is evidently on a particular class of
    men, the special form of whose reproaches would be the ridicule of the
    doctrines that the Lord Jesus would return; that there would be a day of
    judgment; that the world would be consumed by fire, etc."—Albert
    Barnes, Notes on the New Testament, vol. 10, p. 254.
       Antediluvian conditions repeated. "The sins that called for vengeance
    upon the antediluvian world exist today. The fear of God is banished from
    the hearts of men, and His law is treated with indifference and contempt.
    The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the gen-
    eration now living. . . .
       "That which is lawful in itself is carried to excess. Appetite is indulged
    without restraint. Professed followers of Christ are today eating and
    drinking with the drunken, while their names stand in honored church
    records. Intemperance benumbs the moral and spiritual powers and pre-
    pares the way for the indulgence of the lower passions. Multitudes feel
    under no moral obligation to curb their sensual desires, and they become
    the slaves of lust. Men are living for the pleasures of sense; for this world
    and this life alone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 101, 102.

      SUMMARY: In chapter 1, Peter wrote about "exceeding great and pre-
      cious promises" (verse 14). In chapter 3 he centers the attention of his
      readers on the greatest and most precious of them all—Christ's promise
      to return and undo the damage done by sin. Apparently, the false teachers
      had been scoffing at this promise in particular, but Peter testifies to its
      certainty. His witness means much to those waiting eagerly for Christ's
      return today.

      APPLICATION:
      o In what ways has my mind been stirred this week to recall the words of
        the prophets and apostles concerning Christ's return?
      o What influence, if any, do scoffers in A.D. 1985 have upon my confi-
        dence in the second coming?
      o As I think of the prime features of our Lord's return—its majesty, its
        demonstration of divine reliability, its note of triumph over evil, its as-
        surance of salvation—which of these, or other features, holds most sig-
        nificance for me?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 3:8-10.

DAY MEMORY TEXT: "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as
      some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not will-
1     ing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance"
      (2 Peter 3:9).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: It behooves us to be more deeply aware of the
nature and character of Him "with whom we have to do" (Heb. 4:13).
Our salvation is closely linked to our personal acquaintance with God and
our knowledge of His character (John 17:3).

INTRODUCTION: In common with most human beings, the early Chris-
tians and those who were trying to lead them astray had inadequate ideas
about the One whom they professed to worship. They observed some of
the rudiments of adoration, but, as is true of most of us, their perceptions
of God's eternal and loving nature were limited and distorted. They
needed to get clearer visions of the Almighty. Peter determined to help
them meet that need.
   To that end he contrasted humanity's relation to time with that of the
Lord's (2 Peter 3:8). That in itself provided an effective argument to
counter the skepticism about Christ's return (verse 4). He repudiated the
charge that God is unconcerned about the human race, and emphasized
God's desire "that all should come to repentance" (verse 9). But, know-
ing those whom he was trying to help as well as those whose teachings he
 rejected, he found it necessary to warn both parties that the Lord's com-
ing would be unexpected and cataclysmic (verse 10).
   The apostle's careful attention to these questions that were troubling
 his readers has been helpful to Christians throughout succeeding ages. It
should prove useful to us particularly in this time of worldwide distress
 and fear. We should study Peter's instruction earnestly, for it reveals
 much that will enable us to overcome doubt and to confirm the certainty
 of the advent.

                                                                         69
DAY I. GOD AND TIME (2 Peter 3:8).

      The pastor-spirit in Peter was deeply concerned over the impact that
    unscriptural and unspiritual teaching was having on the congregations to
    whom he was writing. This led him to expose the skeptical and secular
    nature of the teachers who had been professing to interpret Scripture to
    the church members. It prompts him at this point in his epistle to defend
    the Lord's dealings with humanity, both in the past and in the days to
    come. He shares his concern in a most gentle manner, employing his fa-
    vorite form of address, "beloved." He asks his readers to pause and con-
    sider the apparent delay in their Lord's appearing in the light of God's
    eternal nature. This surely was a wise approach. We easily can be misled
    by listening to human reasoning when we would be wiser to consider the
    Godhead's outlook on any problem that disturbs us. This is Peter's re-
    sponse to the heretical suggestions that are worrying his flock. He applies
    his remedy earnestly and clearly, as a careful study of verse 8 reveals.

      What universal principle lies behind the observation Peter makes in his
    reasoned response to the doubters' negative outlook on Christ's return?
    2 Peter 3:8.


       The persuasiveness of Peter's exhortation, "be not ignorant of this one
     thing," is better expressed in the paraphrase "let not this one fact escape
     your attention." Who could resist such a plea? Not Peter's readers, we
     may be sure.

    THINK IT THROUGH: Do we have a responsibility to be informed, not to
    be ignorant, and not to neglect vital information, particularly when it con-
    cerns the nature and the character of God?

       To God the Father and God the Son there is no time as we know it with
    its restrictions and pressures. They are independent of time. In the light
    of this understanding, Peter can confidently make the significant observa-
    tion: "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
    as one day." Understanding this truth concerning the divine nature has an
    important bearing on our attitude toward the passage of time in relation to
    the second coming. As were the members of the early church, we are
    impatient for our Lord's return. And this is by no means to be con-
    demned. Before the close of the first century, John the revelator was re-
    cording: "Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus"
    (Rev. 22:20). Such is the natural prayer of the dedicated heart. There is
    something wrong when we feel no interest in our Master's speedy appear-
    ing. But Peter reminds his readers of the difference between their view of
    time and the way the Lord relates to what we know as "time." His use of
    the comparison between one day and a thousand years does not imply a
    difference of one day as against -the passage of 365,000 days (which no
    ordinary human being has experienced). It rather suggests the intensity of
    the Eternal's understanding of each day's significance. The illustrations
    also emphasize that the Almighty does not need to measure the passage

    70
    of days, years, centuries, and millenniums. He lives in an eternal present.
      The psalmist expresses this in a picturesque way when he says, "A
    thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a
    watch in the night" (Ps. 90:4). (Compare Isa. 55:8, 9.) Such revelations
    remind us that no matter how dedicated we are to the pursuit of a saving
    knowledge of God, a complete understanding of the divine nature eludes
    us because of our human limitations. That realization need not distress
    us. Eternity will be long enough for us to increase our knowledge. In the
    meantime, we must resist the temptation to attempt to create God in our
    own image.

DAY 11. GOD AND MERCY (2 Peter 3:9).

      The answers to many questions that perplex us lie in a deep under-
    standing of the mind of God. The more we understand His character, the
    better we shall understand His ways. Peter had known this for decades,
    and he uses that knowledge to help his troubled congregations under-
    stand more about the apparent delay in their Lord's return.

      What divine characteristics help explain the fact that the Lord has not
    returned as yet? 2 Peter 3:9.


      "The Lord is not slack," declares the apostle, or as J. B. Phillips ren-
    ders the phrase, "It is not that he is dilatory." That is a heartening and
    necessary assurance, especially for impetuous Peter and his impetuous
    successors. God is not subject to human weaknesses, as some would
    reckon Him to be. His "purposes know no haste and no delay."—The
    Desire of Ages, p. 32. (Compare Hab. 2:3.)
      But that fact has by no means been easy for many of God's children to
    accept. At critical junctures in history there have been long periods of
    waiting that have been difficult for even the most trustful believers to ex-
    plain. Abraham was 75 years old when he obeyed the Lord and left Haran
    in route to Canaan. He carried with him the promise of being the founder
    of "a great nation," yet had to wait 25 years before his promised son was
    born. (See Gen. 12:1-4; 21:5.) He could not then foresee the centuries that
    would lapse before his descendants would become even a small nation.
    They would first have to move into pagan Egypt, prosper, and then be
    enslaved by a pharaoh who did not know Joseph, to say nothing of Abra-
    ham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then came the first 80 years of Moses' life before
    deliverance by the Exodus, with 40 more years of wilderness wandering
    before his people possessed the land that had been promised to Abraham.
       As we review the subsequent checkered history of the chosen people,
    we see a host of them exiled in Babylon for 70 years. Just a few returned
    from Persia to Judea with Ezra. There was further waiting until Nehe-
    miah led his countrymen back to Jerusalem from Persia. And, over-
    shadowing all, we see the 4000-year wait from Eden to Bethlehem for the
    Messiah.
       By bearing in mind such waiting we shall better understand our Lord's
    "longsuffering," and be conscious of our need for patience as we wait for

                                                                             71
      His return. We may conclude then that what God foresees to be best He
      will fulfill, and that He longs for His Son's return to occur to put an end to
      sin and to usher in everlasting righteousness (Dan. 9:24). "The promise,"
      rather than "his promise," clearly refers back to verse 4 where the doubt-
      ers ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" Peter covers their argu-
      ments conscientiously and makes a reasoned approach to their skepti-
      cism.
         After defending the Eternal against the charge of delay, the apostle then
      turns to a positive evaluation of the divine character. He introduces his
      appraisal with a strong word for "but" which suggests "on the other
      hand," or "to the contrary," utterly repudiating any idea of God being lax
      in His dealings with humanity. He then uses one of the Bible's great
      words—"longsuffering," a composite term that originally linked the
      thought "of long duration" with "the soul" or "passion." It then came to
      signify "great in patience," or "longsuffering."

DAY SEARCH AND LEARN: In the texts listed below discover how prominently
    the quality of long-suffering figures in the listings of our Maker's attributes:


                               Ex. 34:6            Ps. 86:15
                               Num. 14:18          Rom. 9:20-24



        The usage of this term in Second Peter brings Christians face to face
      with the Lord's long-suffering toward themselves. In this way Peter not
      only answered the mockers but brought reassurance to the faithful. And
      his words still can do the same for us. We should never forget: "It is of the
      Lord's mercies that we are not consumed" (Lam. 3:22).
        The most dastardly lie in the universe is that God is indifferent to His
      creations's welfare. He is "not willing," that is, He does not even wish
      "that any should perish." "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no plea-
      sure in the death of the wicked" (Eze. 33:11). This saving desire on God's
      part does not refer just to the first or physical death, although that also
      must be included because death is repellent to Him who is Life. The more
      significant reference is to the "second death," for the word translated
      "perish" refers to utter destruction.

           What is the Creator's will for all who live on earth? 2 Peter 3:9.


         For the second time in this sentence the emphatic "but" is used to
      show the strong contrast between the preceding clause with its "perish"
      and the following clause with its emphasis on repentance and salvation.
      He who made man and woman in the beginning does not want any of His
      creatures to be lost. He wants all to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4). Those who
      have turned from Him He invites to turn again and find pardon and salva-
      tion (Lam. 3:31-33; Eze. 18:32; Micah 7:18, 19). If the Lord had His way,
      all would repent and be saved. But because the human race has the privi-
      72
     lege and the weighty responsibility of free exercise of the will, unnum-
     bered multitudes choose the way of death instead of the path of life.
        The insights contained in 2 Peter 3:9 throw light on many moral issues
     that perplex earnest Christians. This text also contributes to our under-
     standing of divine justice. How can a loving God allow His creatures to
     be lost? God wants all human beings to be saved and is exceedingly pa-
     tient in giving them time for repentance and for returning to Him in con-
     trition. Such considerations make this verse worthy of memorization and
     deep meditation. It will richly repay any effort expended upon it. When
     embedded in the mind it can illumine many a troublesome question and
     enable us to keep a balanced picture of the Father of mercies whom we
     serve and in whom we believe.

     COMPARE 2 Peter 3:9 with Paul's paean of praise in Romans 11:33-36.
     Notice how doing so provides us with an inspiring revelation of the mind of
     Him with whom we have to do.

DAY I11. GOD AND THE FUTURE (2 Peter 3:10).

El     Peter's second epistle has been turning false teaching and even skepti-
     cal questions to good account. It has used the destructive doubts of the
     scoffers as opportunities for teaching men and women essential truths
     about God (3:8, 9). This provides an illustration of how the word causes
     even the wrath of men to praise Him.

       On which prominent aspect of his Master's return does Peter now focus
     his readers' attention, and why does he give it this emphasis? 2 Peter 3:10.


        There can be no reasonable doubt as to the events on which the apos-
     tle's mind is set. "The day of the Lord" is a widely used scriptural term
     that enshrines all that God's people expect at the consummation of all
     things. It covers a wide range of expectations and does not merely refer
     to a 24-hour day but rather to that space of time in which God will accom-
     plish all that is needed to inaugurate sinless eternity. (See Isa. 13:6; Joel
     1:15; 2:1, 31; Zeph. 1:14; Mal. 4:1.) In our study of this passage of Scrip-
     ture there is little room for doubt about the identity of "the day of the
     Lord," for Peter clearly refers to words from his Lord's own lips as Jesus
     foretold conditions that will herald His return. The Gospels give promi-
     nence to the Saviour's emphasis on the unexpectedness of His appearing.
     (See Matt. 24:42-44; Mark 13:33-37; Luke 12:34-37; 21:34-36.) Jesus
     stated that His arrival will be as unexpected as a thief's entry into an
     unsuspecting household. It therefore seems most appropriate that His
     disciple should phrase his warning in similar terms, "as a thief."
        In the passage we are studying (3:10) the word for "will come" is
      placed first in the sentence in the original Greek, emphasizing that the
      Saviour will return in spite of all that false teachers might declare. No-
      where does the writer try to set a time for his Lord's advent.
     NOTE: It probably was Peter who informed Mark of the Master's teaching
     concerning the time of His return. Read Mark 13:32.
                                                                               73
        But the personal message is the same as when Jesus instructed the dis-
      ciples, "Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of
      man cometh" (Matt. 24:44). If only we knew when our Lord would re-
      turn, how well prepared we would be! But the Saviour knew that long
      years of waiting lay ahead and that human nature would put off prepara-
      tory work until it would be too late. Then, the unprepared would be taken
      unawares and be lost at His coming. Therefore He says, "Be ye also
      ready."

DAY     What dramatic cosmic events does Peter foresee as accompanying the sec-
'6    ond advent? 2 Peter 3:10.


        The apostle is not hewing his own path into the unseen future. He is
      rather summarizing, in apocalyptic language, what other prophets, in-
      cluding Jesus, had firmly foretold.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Some of the prophecies Peter most likely was sum-
      marizing follow. Read as many from the following list as you can:

           Ps. 50:3             Isa. 64:1-4               2 Thess. 1:6-10
           Ps. 97:5, 6          Isa. 66:15, 16            Jude 14
           Isa. 13:9-13         Matt. 24:30, 31           Rev. 6:12-17
           Isa. 34:4            Luke 21:25-27

         These revelations are based upon the nature of divinity—its purity,
      glory, and power. We need to stamp upon our minds the awe-inspiring
      glimpses of the Godhead that are unveiled in such texts as Daniel 7:9, 10;
      Habakkuk 3:3-6; and Hebrews 12:29. When this is done, we will be able
      to conceive more fully the burning radiance that will fill every corner of
      the universe as the Son of man comes "with power and great glory."
         As our twentieth century draws to its close, it is not unnatural for us to
      read into the remainder of verse 10 a reference to nuclear destruction. Of
      course, Peter had no inkling of such. He here endeavors to convey the
      awe-inspiring majesty of "the day of the Lord." Fulfillment of the scrip-
      tures listed in the preceding "Search and Learn" exercise is sufficient to
      account for the convulsions that will accompany the appearing of the
      King of kings and Lord of lords, and the apostle simply uses the most
      vivid words at his command to portray that "grand and awful time."
        The Greek word translated "with a great noise" occurs only here in the
      New Testament and may well refer to the crackle and roar of flames, in
      which case it is linked to verse 7 where Peter states that "the heavens and
      the earth . . . are . . . reserved unto fire against the day of judgment."
      The meaning of the word translated "elements" is not clear. Probably
      "Peter here speaks of the physical elements of which our world is com-
      posed, matter that will 'melt' under the cleansing fires of the last day."—
      S.D.A. Bible Commentary vol. 7, p. 616.
         The final clause of verse 10, "the earth . . . burned up," may be trans-
      lated in several ways, due to some uncertainty about the original reading.
      An acceptable alternative reads, "the earth with all that is in it will be laid

      74
     bare" (NEB). The end result is the same—devastation and the prepara-
     tion of the way for "new heavens and a new earth" (verse 13).

DAY FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
       God and time. Peter replies to "Where is the promise of his coming?"
    with the law of contrast. "In effect he says that we must never confuse
    time with eternity, the time of man with the time of God. God sees time
    quite differently from man. Man's outlook is limited. With God there is no
    `long' or 'short' time. With Him a thousand years are as one day. The real
    things are not measured by time; God's holy purposes do not follow a
    time schedule. Relativity is now a commonly accepted concept. A suf-
    ferer finds time long on his hands; a lover finds time short. [An apparent]
    delay on God's part in the fulfilling of his purposes must not be regarded
    as unconcern for its fulfillment (vs. 9)."—The Interpreter's Bible (New
    York: Abingdon Press, 1957), vol. 12, p. 198.
       God's infinity. "Man has but a short time to live, and if he does not
    accomplish his purposes in a very brief period, he never will. But it is not
    so with God. He always lives; and we cannot therefore infer, because the
    execution of his purposes seems to be delayed, that they are abandoned.
    With him who always lives it will be as easy to accomplish them in a far
    distant period as now. If it is his pleasure to accomplish them in a single
    day, he can do it; if he chooses that the execution shall be deferred to a
    thousand years, or that a thousand years shall be consumed in executing
    them, he has power to carry them onward through what seems to us to be
    so vast a duration. The wicked, therefore, cannot infer that they will es-
    cape because their punishment is delayed: nor should the righteous fear
    that the Divine promises will fail because ages pass away before they are
    accomplished."—Albert Barnes, Notes on the New Testament. vol. 10,
     p. 259.
        See also The Great Controversy, "The Controversy Ended," pp. 671 to
    673.

     SUMMARY: Peter vividly but briefly portrays the events connected with
     Christ's return and the final judgment, pointing out that God's long-suffer-
     ing and mercy have prevented up until now earth's fiery conclusion. But,
     because mercy holds back the final destruction, we should not scoff at the
     Bible's predictions. Christ will return and "the earth also and the works
     that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10).

      APPLICATION:
      • How should I relate to the difference between God's sense of time and
        my own?
      • If the Eternal is not willing that any should perish, how should I relate
        to those who spurn my efforts to bring them to repentance?
      • How conscious have I been of the Lord's long-suffering toward me?
        How can I more effectively show my gratitude to Him?

INTRODUCTION: The immediate purpose for the writing of the Second
Epistle of Peter was to warn of the destructive activity of the apostate
teachers. But, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Peter did not wish to
conclude his letter on a negative note. Instead he chose to close with high
quality spiritual counsel.
  Peter's exhortations are inspired by his visions concerning his Master's
return and the events that will bring human history to its close (verse 10).
No thoughtful believer can contemplate the prospective fiery drama with-
out being moved to awe and fear. Atmospheric explosions, solids reduced
to molten masses, and the earth's surface broken up and denuded of its
natural coverings—the description of the coming catastrophe could bring
even the careless to their knees. And those who first read or heard the
apostles's words were far from thoughtless. In the midst of paganism they
had heard the gospel preached and had bravely accepted its challenge, in
spite of the fact that their new-found belief might cost them their lives.
Even such believers must determine to live worthily that they might es-
cape the destruction that accompanies the close of human probation. To
encourage them in this high resolve Peter now exhorts them to examine
their conduct and to mold it to New Testament ideals.
   Such counsel is most appropriate to those who live much closer to their
Lord's return than did Peter's first readers. Each generation needs to face
the truth that is framed in Paul's words to Roman Christians: "For now is
our salvation nearer than when we believed" (Rom. 13:11). Beyond dis-
pute is the fact that in 1985 we are closer to the end than we have ever

76
     been. We need to fashion our lives in the light of that recognition. Peter's
     graphic description of "last things" will help us discharge that responsi-
     bility.

DAY I. PREPARING FOR THE DAY OF GOD (2 Peter 3:11, 12)..

        The Bible was not written as a morally neutral history book. Its histori-
     cal passages are built into a system of morality that makes historical per-
     sonages accountable for their acts. The same is true of its proplietic'pok-
     tions. They are not mere foretellers of future events; they are involved
     deeply in moral judgments. Their ultimate objective is the relation of
     deeds to divine intentions for individuals and for the entire universe. We
     find those principles operating in Peter's second letter.

       What do you understand to be the point of the searching question with
     which the apostle summarizes the significance of his portrayal of events as-
     sociated with "the day of the Lord"? 2 Peter 3:11.



        Having evaluated the certainty of divine intervention in history as it
     relates to human kind, and having repeated the substance of his Master's
     declaration that "ye know not what hour your Lord doth come" (Matt.
     24:42-44), the apostle proceeds to make an acute personal application of
     that foreseen event. He faces his readers and us with the stark question:
     "What manner of persons ought ye to be?" We cannot stay the winds and
     the waves; we cannot prevent earthquakes; we cannot extinguish raging
     infernos as disintegration begins. Our part in the drama consists in having
     a right relationship with God. When we relate to Him as we should His
     moral standards will be engraved firmly on our hearts.
        For unassailable reasons our Maker has decided that only "he that
     walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth-in
     his heart" shall dwell in His holy hill (Ps. 15:1, 2). "Who among us shall
     dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting
     burnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; . . . and
     shutteth his eyes from seeing evil" (Isa. 33:14, 15). Such uprightness is
     essential for a sinless eternity.
        The requirements are summarized in Peter's reference to "holy conver-
     sation and godliness" where the word translated "conversation" is better
     rendered as "behavior" or "conduct." "Godliness" includes "piety" and
     "religion" and is used only by Peter (2 Peter 1:3, 6, 7) and by Paul in the
     pastoral epistles to Timothy and Titus. The apostle is therefore reminding
      his readers to develop a genuine Christian character and life-style that
     will prepare them to meet their Saviour unashamedly. An enriching
      thought is injected into Peter's admonition when we note that the original
      words for "conversation" and "godliness" are both in the plural. Their
      manifestation in a Christian's life cannot be limited.




                                                                               77
DAY      In what two specific ways can we hasten the return of Christ? How are we

15    reminded once again of the fiery overthrow of the atmospheric heavens and
       the earth? 2 Peter 3:12.


         Because holy conduct and piety are personal qualities, they do not
       cover a Christian's total duty to God and humanity. In verse 12 two exten-
       sions of duty are emphasized, being expressed somewhat obscurely in
       the King James Version as "looking for and hasting unto the coming."
       "Looking for" represents the eager watching for Christ's coming, while
       "hasting unto" becomes more meaningful when seen as "hastening on"—
       that is, " 'causing the day of the Lord to come more quickly by helping to
       fulfill those conditions without which it cannot come.' (Trench, on 'The
       Authorized Version of the New Testament')."—Marvin R. Vincent, Word
       Studies in the New Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans
       Publishing Co., 1969), vol. 1, p. 707.
         To which we must add the outreach of active witness, the preaching of
       the gospel into all the world, "and then shall the end come" (Matt. 24:14).
         The "day of God" clearly is the same as the "day of the Lord" (2 Peter
       3:10), and probably embraces all the end-of-the-world events that are
       foretold in the Old and New Testaments. It is significant that the apostle
       uses the advent word parousia, the special New Testament word for
       "coming," and then emphasizes its dramatic nature by again referring to
       the fire which will "dissolve" the heavens or cause them to disintegrate
       (as in verse 10).
         Then comes a stronger word for "melt" than that which was used in
       verse 10. It implies that "the elements" will be liquified. The picture that
       Peter paints is vivid. He uses it as encouragement for us to be well pre-
       pared for the Son of man's return. We know "what manner of persons"
       we ought to be. The object of his teaching is to help each one of us to
       become such persons.

DAY 11. PROMISE OF A NEW EARTH (2 Peter 3:13).

         The apostle has not passed lightly over the distressing events that pre-
       cede Christ's return. He has described them in clear language (verses 10-
       12). He now turns to the prospect that will compensate the Redeemer and
       the redeemed for all the distress that has gone before.

         On what basis can the Christian look for a new universal order? 2 Peter
       3:13.


          Peter's more than 30 years of ministry since the ascension has been
       built on divine promises. (See Acts 1:8; 2:15-21, 33, 39 and throughout the
       early chapters of the book of Acts.) In this epistle he is relying still on the
       fulfillment of such promises (1:4; 3:9, 10). He now directs his readers'
       attention to predictions that speak of "new heavens and a new earth."
       The primary reference must be to the prophecies given through Isaiah
       (11:4-9; 65:17-25; 66:22, 23), Jeremiah (23:5-8; 33:15, 16), and Daniel

       78
    (2:44), together with Jesus' own sayings concerning the kingdom (for ex-
    ample, Matt. 6:10; 25:31-34). To Peter these would be the "more sure
    word of prophecy" (2 Peter 1:19). They are reliable; underwritten by
    God, His Son, and His Spirit.
      The Greek word that he used for "new" with both "heavens" and
    "earth" refers to that which is new in quality, or different, in contrast to
    the old heavens and earth which have been spoiled by sin. (Compare with
    Rev. 21:1 where the same word also is used with "a new heaven and a new
    earth.") The "new heavens" hardly can be God's own dwelling place, but
    rather the term must apply to the atmospheric heavens around our earth
    that also have been polluted by sin. They will need renewal even as does
    the earth that has been defiled by millenniums of wrongdoing.
       The quality of life in the "new heavens and a new earth" is guaranteed
    by the assurance that in them "dwelleth righteousness." And that act of
    dwelling is to be permanent, for Peter uses a specific word that suggests
    "making a home in," even as Paul does in Ephesians 3:17 where he writes
    of Christ's making "His home in your hearts through your faith"
    (Weymouth's translation). "There shall in no wise enter into it anything
    that defileth," says John (Rev. 21:27), speaking of the New Jerusalem.
    That answers the question, "What manner of persons?"

       When viewing the prospects of new heavens and a new earth, what did
     Peter perceive to be of greatest importance? 2 Peter 3:14.


        Again, the warmhearted leader addressed his readers as "beloved."
     Such apostolic affection added persuasive power to his admonition which
     is based on their common hope of Christ's return and the new life it will
     bring to all that love His appearing. But, as the writer pointed out, waiting
     for the advent is not enough. There must also be preparation on the part
     of those who wait. "Wherefore" or "therefore," because they "look for
     such things" or, better, eagerly anticipate "these things" that have been
     set out in -verses 8 to 13, they need to be prepared for their arrival. To this
     end Peter used another of his key injunctions, "be diligent" to indicate the
     need for careful preparation.

DAY COMPARE: Chapter 1, verses 5, 10, and 15, where Peter also exhorts the
    readers to diligence.

       Peter's exhortation has a high end in view. He wants the Redeemer/
     Judge to find His people "without spot and blameless" and, as a conse-
     quence, at peace with Him. This is no new standard. It is the New Testa-
     ment expectation. Those who are diligent spiritually may, by the grace of
     Christ and the Spirit's power, make that preparation and enjoy the assur-
     ance of being prepared for Christ's return.
       The affectionate exhortation conveyed in verse 14 raises a question
     concerning the means whereby we become fit for heaven and its sinless
     company. We are urged to "be diligent," which calls for an effort on our
     part. Does that mean that our fitness for heaven depends on our own ef-
     forts? Is there a hint of "salvation by works" in the apostle's words? No,

                                                                                 79
     there is not. But we must allow Christ to do what He wants to do in and
     for us.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Consider how each of the five scriptures listed be-
     low throws light on the question of whether we are saved by works or by
     grace:
                         1 Cor. 1:7, 8        1 Thess. 5:23
                        Phil. 1:10, 11        1 John 2:28
                        Phil. 2: 13-15

        In 1 Corinthians 1:7, 8 we discover that it is "our Lord Jesus Christ"
     who enables us to become "blameless." In Philippians 1:10, 11 the stan-
     dard to be reached is attained "by Jesus Christ" and in Philippians 2:13,
     by "God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good plea-
     sure." First Thessalonians 5:23 contains a prayer that "the very God of
     peace" might sanctify us completely; while I John 2:28 counsels us to
     "abide in him," that is, Jesus, so that we shall "not be ashamed before
     him at his coming." We need to desire holiness, but such desires will
     never be fulfilled until we allow divine power, brought to us by the Holy
     Spirit, to raise us above ourselves, to enable us to abide in Christ, to
     direct our minds in thinking His thoughts after Him, and to help us climb
     the ladder of spiritual growth that we studied in Lesson 2.
       Concerning the words "abide in him" in 1 John 2:28 the following com-
     ment can be helpful. "In the process of bringing salvation to the hearts of
     men God is ever the first! . . . By his Spirit he invades the heart of the
     sinner. Thus the sinner, who has now become, in principle, a saint, has
     received power to abide in Christ. The more he does so, the more he will
     experience Christ's loving presence . . . , but the responsibility of abid-
     ing in Christ is placed squarely upon man's shoulders, exactly where it
     belongs. Without exertion there is no salvation. But the power to exert
     oneself and to persevere is God-given! "—William Hendriksen, A Corn-
     mentary on the Gospel of John, vol. 2 (London: The Banner of Truth
     Trust, 1964), p. 299.

DAY I11. PAUL'S SUPPORTING TESTIMONY (2 Peter 3:15, 16).
FA,
        The title "our beloved brother Paul" raises no difficulties in this con-
     text. The book of Acts and the Pauline epistles reveal the deep affection
     in which the great apostle was held. The adjective "beloved" would then
     be justified totally and used sincerely. Paul recorded that he had opposed
     Peter on the question of ritual separation of Jewish Christians from Gen-
     tile believers at Antioch (Gal. 2:11-14), but that was an honest difference
     of opinion, and it prevented neither of the two apostles from giving honor
     to the other.
        And about "the wisdom given unto him" (Paul) there could be no
     doubt. It is one of the many evidences of the inspiration that produced his
     writings. If Peter was crucified about the same time that Paul was be-
     headed, this passage reveals that the latter's epistles were circulating
     among scattered Christian communities during the early sixties of the
     first century. From Colossians 4:16 it also is safe to deduce that each epis-

     80
  TT   at   44E= UMMIEte
tle helped more churches than the one to which it was addressed
originally. The first church to receive a letter probably had copies made
for the benefit of other congregations. In that way a greater number of
believers were edified. By his reference to "the other scriptures" (2 Peter
3:16) Peter indicates that the early church had accepted Paul's letters as
inspired and had begun to lay the groundwork for the sacred canon of the
New Testament.
   The above considerations enlarge our view of church life in Asia Minor,
and beyond, during the early decades after Christ's ascension. Although
in most cases the groups of believers were scattered, they communicated
with each other. More interestingly still, it is possible to see Peter and
Paul both working in that large geographical area with both contributing
to the faith and works of congregations in which each was particularly
interested. We might wonder if the paths of the two missionaries often
crossed, and where, before the leaders' martyrdoms in Rome between
A.D. 66-68.

   What are "these things" (verse 16) in Paul's writings that Peter finds dif-
ficult to understand?


   The context of verses 15 and 16 is clearly Peter's extended discussion
of the second coming (verses 8-14). Should the search be widened, it may
include the whole epistle, but that is scarcely needed, although Paul's vo-
luminous letters certainly covered most of the ground traversed by Peter
in this epistle. However, the main thrust of the reference to Paul's epistles
concerns "some things hard to be understood" that have been twisted by
the "unlearned and unstable" (verse 16). The Greek word for "un-
learned" is the opposite of the Greek word for learner or disciple. The
word translated "unstable" refers to those who have no support. It is
easy for such people to "wrest" or twist the Scriptures. The original word
for "wrest" referred to torture on the rack when a victim's limbs were
twisted or dislocated—a most vivid and painful picture of distortion of
truth.
   Few Bible students will quarrel with Peter's comment on Paul's epis-
tles, "in which are some things hard to be understood." Indeed, the
casual Bible reader might describe it as an understatement, while the ear-
nest student will agree as to its truth. But the difficulties in those epistles
largely arise from the magnitude of the subjects with which they deal as
well as with Paul's involved sentence structure. A finite being, although
inspired, is struggling to grasp infinity; a human is seeking to explain the
divine; a mortal is trying to describe the immortal; a time-bound mind is
grappling with the nature of the eternal. It is not surprising that we who
work on lower planes should find it difficult to follow the workings of a
 mastermind such as Paul's. When the inspiration factor is added we must
expect our mental and spiritual capacities to be stretched beyond their
normal limits. We should welcome the challenge and cheerfully engage in
the spiritual exercise of studying "the deep things of God" (1 Cor. 2:10)
with the aid of the Holy Spirit (John 16:13). Some of us engage all too
little in such exercise.

                                                                            81

    mic upheaval preceding Christ's return read The Great Controversy,

       The second coming and Christian behavior. "The expectation of the
    Lord's return always inspires Christians to a holy life. (Compare 1 John
    2:28). Disbelief in the Lord's return all too often produces indifferentism
    in behavior, as it had with these errorists [in Second Peter 2 and 3]. There
    is an indissoluble link between conduct and conviction. Barclay gives
    three superb examples from heathen tombs of what happens when men
    reject the theological view of history, the belief that creation has a goal, a
    climax, which is one of the main themes of the doctrine of the advent. It
    leads to hedonism: 'I was nothing; I am nothing; so thou who art still
    alive, eat, drink, and be merry.' It leads to apathy: 'Once I had no exis-
    tence; now I have none. I am not aware of it. It does not concern me.' It
    leads, finally, to despair: ' "Charidas, what is below?" "Deep darkness."
    "But what of the paths upward?" "All a lie" . . . "Then we are lost." '
    Barclay concludes, rightly, that without the truth, embodied in the second
    coming doctrine, that life is going somewhere, there is nothing left to live
    for."—Michael Green, New Testament Commentaries vol. 18, p. 139.
       "The day and the hour of His coming Christ has not revealed. He
    stated plainly to His disciples that He Himself could not make known the
    day or the hour of His second appearing. Had He been at liberty to reveal
    this, why need He have exhorted them to maintain an attitude of constant
    expectancy? There are those who claim to know the very day and hour of
    our Lord's appearing. Very earnest are they in mapping out the future.
    But the Lord has warned them off the ground they occupy. The exact time
    of the second coming of the Son of man is God's mystery,"—The Desire
    of Ages. p. 632.

      SUMMARY: Peter not only warns his readers about the coming judgment
      and the destruction of the world, but he instructs them how to prepare for
      it and urges them to do so. His counsel should inspire his modern readers
      to Christlike living and to the urgency of preparing those about us for
      what is coming.

      APPLICATION:
      o How expectant am I concerning the second coming? Has what seems
        to have been a delay in Christ's coming been reflected in any way in my
        life-style?
      o In addition to "looking for" my Master's return, how actively am I
        "hastening on" His appearing? What am I doing to help others prepare
        for His coming?
      o If Jesus should return at the end of this quarter, or if I should die, will I
        truly be ready to meet Him "in peace"?
      o Apart from the study of this lesson, how much Bible study have I done
        this week? What message did I get from it?

                  Introduction to the


        Book of Jude
   Alarmed by news of the havoc being wrought by false
teachers in the church, Jude, "the brother of James" (verse 1),
wrote a brief epistle designed to unmask false teachings and
to urge his readers to a bold defense of the faith. Jude is known
as a "catholic" or "general epistle" because it does not
specify any individual or church as its recipient. The similarity
of this epistle to that of Second Peter indicateS that it was
written in the latter half of the first century, probably to the
same group of churches to which Peter wrote.
   The epistle concludes with a series of exhortations: Remem-
ber the words spoken by the apostles (verse 17), remain in
the love of God (verse 21), and remove those in danger of the
fires of judgment from the fate awaiting the unsaved (verse
23). These exhortations are followed by a glorious doxology
that praises God for His ability to keep His followers from
falling into Satan's traps.

CENTRAL THOUGHT: In this short book of only 25 verses, Jude
unmasks the false teachers in the church and urges his readers to a bold
defense of the faith and to concentrate on preparing to meet the Lord.

OUTLINE:
  I. Authorship and background.
 11. False teachers unmasked (verses 1-11).
I11. Five metaphors characterize the false teachers (verses 12, 13).
IV. Their certain doom prophesied (verses 14-16).
 V. Exhortation to the believers (verses 17-25).

INTRODUCTION: By comparing Jude 4 through 18 with 2 Peter 2:1
through 3:3 we discover that much of Jude's material also is found in Sec-
ond Peter. "Not only the same thoughts, but in many instances the same
words are used, with some words quite unusual. Did Jude borrow from 2
Peter, Peter from Jude, or did they both borrow from a common but un-
known source? This question cannot be answered with finality. Most Bib-
lical scholars think that Jude is the earlier of the two letters, since it
would be difficult to explain why Jude would write a letter at all if he had
little to say beyond what was already well expressed in 2 Peter. These
scholars assert that it is easy to explain how Peter might have used
thoughts expressed in Jude's brief epistle, and then have added material
to it. Literary studies show that the shorter of two similar works is usu-
ally the earlier. However, a minority of scholars defends the priority of 2
Peter over that of Jude. Among the reasons set forth are the following: (1)
2 Peter 2:1 speaks of the future appearance of false teachers whereas Jude
gives the impression that these teachers are already at work (Jude 4). (2)
Jude speaks of the warning about the coming of skeptics as being in the
past (vs. 17, 18), whereas Peter utters a current warning (2 Peter 3:3).
   "The arguments on either side are not sufficiently decisive to deter-
mine which of the two epistles, Jude or 2 Peter, was the earlier. . . . For
this reason it is impossible to date Jude's letter. If written before 2 Peter it
must have been composed before A.D. 67, the probable year of Peter's
death . . . ; if Jude followed 2 Peter, it may have been written between
the years A.D. 70 and 85.

        Li • • • From v. 3 it would appear that the author intended to write a regu-

     lar pastoral epistle to confirm the believers in their Christian faith, but
     news of the havoc being wrought by libertine teachers led him, under the
     guidance of the Divine Spirit, to change his original plan and to urge his
     readers to a bold defense of the faith. . . . For an understanding of the
     contents of the epistle frequent reference to and comparison with 2 Peter
     is necessary."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 701, 702.

DAY I. AUTHORSHIP AND BACKGROUND (verses 1-11).

        Although 2 Peter and Jude cover much of the same material and use
     similar language, Jude's individuality, personality, and way of thinking
     still shine through.

        What gives us a clue as to which of the several Judes (or Judases) men-
     tioned in the New Testament was the author of this short epistle? Jude 1.


       The New Testament mentions the following persons who were named
     Juda or Judas:
       1. Judas Iscariot (Mark 3:19).
       2. Juda, the brother of James, Joses, and Simon (Mark 6:3).
       3. Judas "not Iscariot" (John 14:22).
       4. Judas of Galilee (Acts 5:37).
       5. Judas of Damascus (Acts 9:11).
       6. Judas surnamed Barsabas (Acts 15:22).
       The writer of this epistle most likely was the second in the list as he
     mentions that he is the "brother of James." This James, as stepbrother of
     our Lord, presided at the Jerusalem Council and is considered to be the
     author of the Epistle of James. This would make Jude a stepbrother to
     Jesus too. Jude does not claim to be an apostle.

     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND: "The epistle contains no direct state-
     ment concerning the circumstances that led to its being written, and no
     clue as to the congregation to which it was addressed, but certain infor-
     mation can be deduced from its contents. It is clear that disruptive
     elements had crept into the church (vs. 4, 8, etc.) and drawn many away
     from the purity of the gospel. Allusions in Colossians, the pastoral epis-
     tles, and Revelation indicate that Gnostic heresies had begun to come
     into the churches of Asia Minor. It is therefore possible that Jude's letter
     was addressed to these churches."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
     701.

DAY 11. FALSE TEACHERS UNMASKED (Verses 1-11).
       Jude confesses that "he gave all diligence to write unto you of the com-
  A mon salvation" (verse 3), but was deflected from his first intent by an
    emergency that arose among his readers. It would appear that the arrival
    of "ungodly men" (verse 4) among his flock led him to turn from his origi-
    nal purpose and to devote most of the remainder of his letter to fortifying
    the congregation against heretical teachings (verse 3).

                                                                                  85
  NOTE the similarities and the differences between this passage and
2 Peter 2:1-16.

   Jude's approach differs from Peter's in many ways. He makes no men-
tion of "false prophets" or "false teachers" (2 Peter 2:1). Instead, he
speaks of "certain men" who are "ungodly" or "impious," "lascivious"
or "immoral," and who deny the lordship or divinity of Christ. He then
markedly departs from Peter's outline, making no reference to Noah or to
Lot, but writing of Israel's escape from Egypt and the death of the un-
grateful, unbelieving multitude (verse 5). (Compare Num. 14:26-33.)
Jude's comment on the rebellious angels is close to Peter's but stresses
the finality of their punishment, for they were to be shackled "in everlast-
ing chains" from which there would be no escape until judgment day. In a
manner somewhat similar to Peter's he comments on the fate of the twin
cities of the plain. But he adds "the cities about them," which confirms
their gross immorality and the irreversible nature of their end—they suf-
fered "the vengeance of eternal fire," that is, unquenchable fire (verse 7).
   But these are differences in approach only. There is no conflict between
Peter and Jude in their assessment of the dangers confronting their
churches. It is inevitable that there should be differences between Peter
and Jude, for the apostle devotes 22 verses (2:1-22) or a whole chapter to
the destructive work of the errant teachers, while Jude uses only 12
verses (5-16) for the same purpose. Furthermore, Jude spends more
space on certain topics than does Peter, so the difference between the two
epistles grows even greater. This is emphasized when we note that Peter
deals with "the angels that sinned" in verse 4 and does not refer to "an-
gels which are greater in power and might" until verse 11, six intervening
verses later. Jude, by contrast, makes his corresponding references in
verses 6 and 9, with only two intervening verses. It will also be noted that
Peter's reference to great and powerful angels in verse 11 does not men-
tion "Michael the archangel," whereas Jude is specific, introducing the
angelic leader by name and identifying the topic of dispute, "the body of
Moses" (verse 9).
   Closer examination of Jude's message reveals that while he gives more
attention to the dispute over Moses, he deals only briefly with Balaam,
and then refers to others whom Peter does not even mention, namely,
Core or Korah (Jude 11; see also Numbers 16) and Cain. This may suggest
that the two authors were writing for different groups of readers—Jude
for Jewish Christians, Peter for Gentiles. Neither author slavishly repro-
duces the other's work, although the similarities are close enough to de-
mand our recognition.

     What apostasy did the false teachers present to the church? Verses 4-8.


  1. Perverting the words of Scripture for their own immoral purposes.
(See 2 Peter 2:2.)
  2. Denying the lordship or divinity of Jesus Christ.
  3. Rejecting established order. (See 2 Peter 2:10.)


86
      What source did Jude use for his reference to Michael (Christ) contend-
    ing with the devil about the body of Moses, and what significance can be
    found in such use? Verse 9.




       Jude appears to be referring to a particular historical event that is not
    recorded in the Old Testament. It is thought that Jude draws on material
    found in the noncanonical book The Assumption of Moses. There the
    devil is said to claim Moses' body from Michael the archangel on the ba-
    sis that the man of God belonged to him because he had slain an Egyptian
    overseer. Michael, who is Christ (see Dan. 12:1; Rev. 12:7; 1 Thess. 4:16),
    did not argue with Satan but left the faithful leader in God's hands. Ignor-
    ing the devil's vindictive charge, God resurrected His servant and gave
    him eternal life. If Michael the archangel were so restrained during such a
    contest, how much more subdued should be the erring instructors!
       The Assumption of Moses "probably consisted originally of two dis-
    tinct books, the Testament of Moses and the Assumption. The author, a
    Pharisee, attempted to draw his compatriots back to the old paths of im-
    plicit obedience to the Torah. Patriotically, he looked for the return of the
    ten tribes and felt that it was the duty of Israel to keep the law and to pray
    God to intervene in their behalf. This work seems to have been written
    during the 1st century A.D. Early Christian writers connected Jude 9
    with this book, but Jude's words are not found in the Assumption in the
    sections that are extant today."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p.
    89.
       If Jude used this book as his source, that does not mean that he recog-
    nized it as inspired. Many Bible writers used uninspired sources, with
    which their readers were familiar, to document or illustrate a point that
    they were making.

DAY SEARCH AND LEARN: What three classic sins were the false teachers
    guilty of that characterized the following individuals?

       1. Cain (Genesis 4)

       2. Korah (Numbers 16)

       3. Balaam (Numbers 22-24)

    I11. FIVE METAPHORS CHARACTERIZE THE FALSE TEACHERS
         (Verses 12, 13).

        In 2 Peter 2:17, the apostle used some strong metaphors to characterize
     the false teachers. In Lesson 8 we studied these: wells without water,
     slaves to sin, and sows that returned to the mire.
        Jude uses five scathing metaphors to depict the character of the false
     teachers.


                                                                               87
       1. Spots (or reefs) in the Christian love feasts. They were concerned
    about their own interests and needs and not only careless of the needs of
    others but brazenly cared for themselves at the expense of others.
       2. Clouds without water. They no more fulfill the promise of spiritual
    blessing than do the rainless clouds that pass over a drought-stricken land
    fulfill the promise of physical relief.
       3. Autumn trees without fruit. At a time when fruit was to be expected
    they were "without fruit." They are "twice dead." That is, not only fruit-
    less, but plucked up by the roots. They have returned to the state they
    were in before they found Christ.
       4. Untamed waves of the sea. Their ungoverned passions were evident
    to all.
       5. Wandering stars. They serve no useful purpose, giving neither con-
    stant light nor guidance.

DAY IV. THEIR CERTAIN DOOM PROPHESIED (Verses 14-16).

      Jude here refers to another noncanonical book, the first book of
    Enoch.
      "Jude's reference to Enoch and his quotation of that patriarch's proph-
    ecy has occasioned much comment. Commentators are in general agree-
    ment that the pseudepigraphical [writings falsely ascribed to famous per-
    sons of the past] book called 1 Enoch was in circulation among the Jews
    by the middle of the 1st century B.C. . . . Chapter 1:9 of this non-
    canonical work reads as follows: 'And behold! He cometh with ten thou-
    sands of His holy ones to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all
    the ungodly: and to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness
    which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard things which un-
    godly sinners have spoken against Him' (R. H. Charles, The Apocrypha
    and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament, vol. 2, p. 189).
      "It is commonly believed that Jude quoted from this noncanonical

    from 1 Enoch it was because the Holy Spirit led him to do so. . . .

    ment of the deceivers."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 708.

    COMPARE Jude 16 with 2 Peter 2:10, 12, 13, 18.


      Although the phraseology differs, the message of each writer has the
    same objective—to warn against the deceptions aired by false prophets
    and to fortify church members in "the faith which was once delivered
    unto the saints" (Jude 3). Jude's letter undoubtedly succeeded in its laud-
    able purpose.

DAY V. EXHORTATION TO THE BELIEVERS (Verses 17-25). '
rel
      REVIEW: Inserted in the quarterly immediately before Lesson 12 is a
      page that introduces the book of Jude. As you restudy that page, note the
      series of exhortations in verses 17 to 23 that are summarized under the
      words remember, remain; and remove.

        To what prophecy does Jude refer in verses 17-19?


         In verses 17 to 19 Jude refers to an earlier prophecy that apparently
      was well known in the church. That forecast came from "the apostles of
      our Lord Jesus Christ," and dealt with sensual skeptics who would deride
      the thought of the second coming. The only such specific prophecy re-
      corded in the Bible is found in 2 Peter 3:3, 4. As we already have dis-
      cussed that prophecy in lesson 9, we need only deal here with the relation
      between the two passages. If, as seems probable, Jude refers to Peter's
      prophecy, Peter's letter must have been written earlier. In that case, Jude,
      consciously or otherwise, made use of that epistle when writing his
      briefer but still powerful message. We also recognize that Peter's instruc-
      tion could have been based on still earlier prophecies that were known in
      Christian communities but had not been written in gospels or letters that
      were later incorporated into the Bible.
         Jude balances the efforts that believers should make toward their own
      spiritual development (verses 20-23) against the primacy of the Godhead
      in effecting our salvation (verses 24, 25). We are expected and encour-
      aged to build up ourselves in our most holy faith (verse 20). We shall not
      be carried into the kingdom as patients are wheeled into an operating
      room. We are to cooperate with the Father, who is described as "God our
      Saviour" (verse 25), by taking every opportunity to strengthen our grasp
      and practice of the Christian faith as fortification against false teaching,
      no matter where it comes from. We are to pray under the guidance of the
      Holy Spirit and to make our efforts to remain within the orbit of God's
      widereaching love. This is to be done unselfishly, for we also must do all
      in our power to help others to share in the same salvation (verses 22, 23).
         "Others save with fear." Not only does Jude exhort his readers to pull
       those whose garments have been "spotted by the flesh" "out of the fire,"
       but those who do so "are to be under the constant stimulus that comes
      from a realization of the fate awaiting the unsaved and from a recognition
      of their own inadequacy in view of the magnitude of the task that con-
       fronts them."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 710.

      BENEDICTION: Jude's letter concludes with a benediction that is matched
      in majesty only by Paul's prayers in Romans 16:25-27 and Ephesians 3:20,
      21.

DAYFURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "There are three aspects of the

T   salutation of this catholic letter. First of all, the writer identifies himself
    by his given name, his close relationship to James the apostle, and his
    absolute servitude to Jesus Christ. If he was a relative of Jesus [as we

                                                                                89
suppose], he does not state it directly. Modesty prevented him from going
that far. To be associated with James, the leader of the Jerusalem church,
was quite enough. Most important, however, is the fact that he was a
servant or 'slave' of Jesus Christ. Christians are expendable in the cause
of Christ. . . .
  "Second, he speaks of his readers as those who are called, beloved in
God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ. Though . ... unnamed these
Christians share with Christians of all time three great experiences—
called, beloved, kept. All Christians are called; that is, they have been
summoned from what they are to what they should become. Calls of
many kinds come to everyone, but this call is unique, decisive, and pro-
phetic. All Christians are recipients of the love of God the Father. All
Christians are kept not only as they pass through the trials of this life, but
they are kept for the future Day of Jesus Christ. God is the guardian and
guarantor of the Christian's deliverance here and in the end.
  "Third, Jude prays that three graces may be multiplied in the lives of
his readers—mercy, peace, and love. Mercy is the active and outgoing
and continuous favor of God; peace is the deep blessedness that comes to
those who are reconciled to God; love is the overarching and undergird-
ing good will of God which is the context of 'life's little day,' and its future
glory."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 12, pp. 321-323.
  "The instruction given by Jude from verse twenty to the close of the
chapter, will make our work a complete whole, teaching us how to con-
duct the warfare in the service of Christ. No one-sided extravagance is to
be revealed, no indolence or shiftlessness is to be indulged. We are not to
ignore any man's individuality, or in any way to justify cold-hearted,criti-
cism or selfish practice.
  "This scripture brings to view the fact that there is most earnest work
to be done, and we need divine intuition that we may know how to work
for souls ready to perish."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 953.

SUMMARY: Jude joins Peter in warning the early church against the de-
ceptive teachings and influence of false teachers in their midst. He ex-
horts the believers to stand true to their faith and assures them that God is
able to keep them from falling into Satan's snares.

APPLICATION:

[Ideals For Christians
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 3:17, 18; Jude 24, 25.

DAY MEMORY       TEXT: "Now unto him that is able to keep you from fall-
1     ing, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
      exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
      dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen." (Jude 24, 25).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Christian ideals can be attained through watch-
fulness against backsliding, by growth in grace and in knowledge of
Christ, and by dependence on divine power.

OVERVIEW: The concluding messages of both Second Peter (3:17, 18)
and Jude (20-25) present us with exalted spiritual counsel. Peter warns us
against the danger of backsliding (verse 17), and recommends continuing
growth in grace and knowledge (verse 18). Jude also urges us to foster
faith, prayer, and a close connection with the Godhead while working for
others' salvation (verses 20-23). Each completes his letter with a doxol-
ogy. Peter's is brief (verse 18, last part). Jude's longer passage touches
heavenly heights (verses 24, 25).

INTRODUCTION: After three months of study, we have become better
acquainted with the author of the Second Epistle of Peter, whom we be-
lieve to be the apostle Peter himself. Many will undoubtedly understand
and love him more deeply because of their study and will acknowledge a
touch of sadness in concluding this study. Similar sentiments may arise
from the glimpse we have had of Jude's briefer letter. Twelve weeks of
companionship with such godly writers have enriched our sympathies
with the early Christian communities and have brought us closer to the
Master whom they served so faithfully.
   Peter wrote a well-ordered letter. He has given us a clear introduction
that conveys rich spiritual insights (chapter 1:1-4), followed by down-to-
earth counsel (verses 5-12) and instructive biographical information
(verses 13-21). In chapter 2 he unmasked and condemned the false teach-
ers, and in chapter 3:1-7 he armed his readers against the apostates'
wiles. From verse 8 onward he placed the advent hope in perspective,
and brought his letter to an apt conclusion in verses 17 and 18.
   Jude's epistle is no condensation of Peter's; neither is Peter's an expan-
sion of Jude's. Each writer makes his own approach to his readers' imme-
diate and long-term needs. Jude completes his shorter letter with a longer
conclusion (verses 20-25) and in it gives us his sovereign address to God
 our Saviour.

                                                                           91
DAY I. CONCLUDING WARNING (2 Peter 3:17).

0     The apostle Peter wrote to encourage, counsel, and warn his readers.
    Before closing the letter he paused to give a final admonition which
    shows that his readers' exposure to heretical teaching was much in his
    mind, even after his thorough analysis of the deceivers' tactics through-
    out chapter 2.

      In what tactful way did Pastor Peter alert his friends to the continuing
    danger that confronted them? 2 Peter 3:17.


      "You therefore, beloved, foreknowing be on your guard" is a literal
    rendering of the pastoral warning. The writer has not shaken off his
    awareness of the dangers that threaten the churches. Like specters, the
    images of the subverters continue to haunt him, and he gives some part-
    ing counsel that differs from all that has gone before. He couches that
    advice in phrases that are laden with love.
       For the fourth time in this chapter he calls his readers "beloved" (see
    verses 1, 8, 14), clearly wishing to assure them of the Christian affection
    that prompts his every word to them. Then he underlines the reason for
    his emphatic exposure of those who have tried to lead them astray. He
    wants his readers to build up their own defenses and to lay in a store of
    personal knowledge, for he will not always be present to shield them from
    evil. As with Paul, so with Peter himself—the time of his departure is at
    hand (compare 2 Tim. 4:6) and the believers must learn to detect error
    and remain loyal to truth. To that end they must be on their guard against
    deceptions and recognize the danger of their being led astray even as oth-
    ers had been. Was the disciple remembering his own earlier weaknesses
    (Matt. 26:31-35) and his Master's repeated warnings (see Matt. 16:6-11;
    24:4-12)?
      There is no doubting the forcefulness of the apostolic warning here. He
    wants his readers to be aware of the possibility of their being "led astray
    with the error of the wicked." The language suggests the danger of their
    being led away by the specious reasoning of the lawless ones, the Greek
    word for "error" referring to a wandering or a roaming about. The word
    rendered "wicked" can be more precisely expressed as "without rule" or
    "lawless," "unprincipled." Those who refuse to be governed by law or
    principle are literally "lawless," "without law," but they forget or reject
    the fact that they still are subject to the "law of God." Once again, while
    being alert to dangerous heresies in the realm of theology, we should be
    careful not to apply Scripture spitefully to those who sincerely hold dif-
    ferent views from our own. There is a vast difference between being im-
    moral and guilty of leading souls to perdition, as were the false teachers,
    and having a sincerely held difference of opinion on matters that might
    not be vital to salvation.
      The last phrase in verse 17 reveals Peter's ultimate concern for his dis-
    tant friends. He does not want them to go the same way as those who are
    trying to deceive them. "Beware," says he, "that you do not fall out of
    your own firm position." Such counsel strengthens the exhortation al-

    92
    ready given in verse 14: "Be diligent that ye may be found of him in
    peace." This also harmonizes with other advice given by Christian lead-
    ers. "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable"
    (1 Cor. 15:58). Still •more clearly it echoes Christ's urgent words to His
    disciples as given in Luke 21:36, "Watch ye therefore."

DAY 11. GROWING UP INTO CHRIST (2 Peter 3:18).

       Long familiarity may have dulled the edge of our appreciation for the
    apostle's valedictory words. But we should not skim over them lightly, for
    they contain the formula for Christian living. They also present us with
    the ultimate prayer, the doxology, that should be in our hearts, on our
    lips, and evident in our lives now, and that will accompany us into eter-
    nity.

       In his parting advice, what does Peter recommend to his fellow Chris-
    tians? 2 Peter 3:18.


       We do not know how long a time remained to the beloved leader, or if
    other opportunities came to send further messages to those whom he ad-
    dressed in this epistle. So far as we know, these were his last written
    words to any church or group of churches. They must have been treas-
    ured by the original recipients, for they were preserved when much other
    correspondence was lost and were passed on to succeeding generations
    of the faithful. Eventually, they became part of Holy Scripture, to the
    strengthening of multitudes of believers. They should be precious in our
    eyes too. We should give earnest heed to them so that their rich signifi-
    cance does not escape our attention and our application.
       Peter may have introduced some of his readers to the gospel personally
    and may have seen them begin a new life in Christ. But he knew that this
    was not enough. Just as a baby is beautiful in its miniature perfection, but
    brings anguish to its parents if it does not grow in normal ways, so is a
    newborn Christian in the eyes of his spiritual parents. If the church mem-
    ber does not increase in spiritual stature, he remains stunted spiritually
    and will not fulfill the promise that attended his baptism. If lack of growth
    persists, he will remain as helpless as a babe and spiritually will die pre-
    maturely.
       The tender shepherd was well aware of the dangers that confronted his
    flock. He therefore counseled each member not merely to grow, but to
    "keep on growing" (the present continuous tense in the Greek). Such
    growth accords with natural development. A child who fails to keep on
    growing will be stunted. An adult who reaches physical maturity and
    ceases to develop his mental capacities becomes an intellectual dwarf.
    Unfortunately, many young Christians who have begun a new life in Jesus
    fail to increase in spiritual capacity. They may be adult in body but remain
    babes in all that concerns the spirit. To lessen the number of such trage-
    dies, Peter urges us to "keep on growing." This already has been stressed
    in chapter 1 where Peter urges us to be "partakers of the divine nature"
    and to add to our store of Christian virtues (verse 3-8).

                                                                              93
DAY      How does the growth mentioned in 2 Peter 3:18 take place? The apostle
      provides the answer. We are to "grow in grace" and in "knowledge." In
      this development, "grace" is more than an external adornment that
      makes us "gracious." It is a many-sided attribute that enables us to be-
      come like Christ. (See comment on 2 Peter 1:2 and on 1:5-8 in Lesson 1
      for a fuller discussion of "grace," and the S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol-
      ume 6, pages 503, 504, and 660.)
         For "knowledge" (gnoosis) we might, in view of Peter's earlier sensi-
      tivity to the word (chapter 1:2, 3, and 8), have expected to read
      epignoosis . (See comment in Lesson 1.) But the distinction concerning
      grades of knowledge is not needed here, for Peter defines his own mean-
      ing by writing of "the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
      This far transcends a mere knowledge of facts. It embraces a personal
      acquaintance with Jesus and the experience of His converting and sus-
      taining power in our lives. Above all else it includes deep love for the One
      who "loved us, and hath given himself for us" (Eph. 5:2). As in a love-
      filled marriage the partners' knowledge of and love for each other grow
      ever deeper, so should our knowledge of and love for our Redeemer con-
      tinue to deepen and grow during this life in preparation for boundless de-
      velopment through the eternal years.
        What should we spontaneously give to our Lord and Saviour? Why
      should we do this? 2 Peter 3:18.


         We might have assumed that concluding an epistle with a doxology or
      expression of praise was the standard New Testament procedure. But, of
      the 21 letters in the New Testament, only three close with direct praise to
      a member of the Godhead—Romans 16:27; 2 Peter 3:18; and Jude 25—
      while Hebrews 13:20, 21 satisfies the formula but does not close the let-
      ter, being followed by four verses of a general nature. This observation
      enables us to appreciate the lofty quality of Peter's contribution. He is not
      following a standard procedure, conforming to a stereotype, but is exer-
      cising thoughtful individuality by directing his readers to the privilege of
      ascribing glory to their Lord.
         There is no doubt about the object of the apostle's paean of praise, for
      Jesus Christ is declared to be its recipient. The writer expects that growth
      in grace and knowledge will incite and inspire developing Christians to
      render the highest possible praise to Christ. This confirms belief in our
      Lord's divinity, for it is only to One who is God that the glory would be
      offered. The use of the definite article before the Greek word for "glory"
      in the original indicates that Peter here is referring to the glory or honor
      that belongs to Divinity alone and to no others in the universe. And such
      honor relates not merely to the passing present, but will continue "for
      ever" or more literally, "unto the day of the age," that is, into eternity.
         The apostle also implies that it is by their conduct that his readers will
      now render the most exalted praise. Mere words, no matter how beautiful
      or how well spoken, are not enough. A believer's life, growing in grace
      and in knowledge, will offer to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit the sweetest
      of all doxologies. An ever-developing Christian life presents the sincerest
      sacrifice of praise to our Creator.
      94
       On this stimulating note Peter brings his epistle to its close. Within its
     modest length he has set before us the highest of Christian ideals—"all
     things that pertain unto life and godliness," that we might be "partakers
     of the divine nature" (chapter 1:3, 4). He has encouraged us to make our
     "calling and election sure" (verse 10). To that end he has reminded us of
     the glory and the implications of the transfiguration (verses 12-21), of
     dangers from false teachers (chapter 2), of the realities of the Deluge
     (chapter 3:1-7), and of the certainties of our Lord's return (verses 8-16).
     Careful consideration of his message should enable us to fulfill by God's
     grace the ideals that our Father has for His children.

DAY I11. COMPARISON WITH JUDE 17-21.

15      As we have already noted there is no regular pattern of similarity be-
     tween the Second Epistle of Peter and that of Jude. Threads of thought
     that are common to both letters are so tangled that it is difficult to follow
     them verse by verse. There is, for instance, no direct equivalent in Jude
     of Peter's consideration of the Flood (2 Peter 2:5 and 3:5-7). Neither does
     the extended study of the second coming in 2 Peter 3:8-14 find its counter-
     part in Jude, while Peter makes no reference to Michael the archangel nor
     to Enoch (Jude 9 and 14). Such differences run throughout the two letters
     and culminate toward their close. Peter spends verses 15 and 16 of his
     closing chapter on Paul and his writings. Jude makes no reference to Paul.
     Peter concludes his letter with a final warning against deception (verse
     17) and a concise benediction and doxology. Jude devotes three of his
     closing verses (17-19) to recalling apostolic counsels and includes a refer-
     ence (verse 18) to mockers that may be a quotation from Peter's letter
     (3:3) or, more remotely, from Paul's letter to Timothy (2 Tim. 3:1-5). Then
     Jude makes a positive pastoral application of the scoffers' skepticisth by
     urging his readers to build on their "most holy faith" and to keep them-
     selves "in the love of God" while awaiting the advent (verses 20, 21).
     And, to save them from un-Christlike reactions against any who have
     been led astray, he commends compassionate treatment of waverers
     (verses 22, 23).

       Note the exalted tone with which Jude ends his epistle. Jude 24, 25.

        There is no doubt as to the subject of Jude's closing words. The author
     obviously addresses "the only wise God our Saviour" in verse 25, where
     the best manuscripts omit the word "wise" and clearly refer to the one
     and only true God. Other well-attested readings include the phrase
     "through Jesus Christ our Lord." This makes clear that the principal ref-
     erence is to the Father who effects our salvation through His willing Son.
     This harmonizes with John 3:16 and 1 John 4:9. In his pastoral epistles
     Paul also underlines the Father's initiative several times (1 Tim. 1:1; 2:2,
     3; 2 Tim. 1:8, 9; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4), supporting Jude's use of the title "the
     only God our Saviour." How increasingly grateful we ought to be for the
     Eternal's gift of His Son for our salvation!
        The above thoughts enable us to identify "him that is able to keep you
     from falling" (Jude 24). He is the Lord God Omnipotent. What comfort

                                                                                  95
      that realization brings to those of us who also are "tossed about with
      many a conflict, many a doubt." Our God is able to guard us from stum-
      bling, particularly over false teachings that trouble the faithful in every
      age, in Jude's day and in ours. He does not remove us from the possibility
      of falling. That would deprive us of all initiative—we could not be bad if
      we wanted 10. But he does promise to uphold us so that even when sin
      trips us up, we do not go down to total defeat. He raises us up, He holds
      us steady, and He renews our determination to attain to His standards.

DAY      What more does God do? He gives to faulty human beings the incompa-
      rable privilege of ultimately being "faultless," that is, blameless or with-
rfi   out blemish. "By the enabling grace of Christ the Christian lives with a
      confident belief in God's power to keep him from falling into sin and to
      enable him, eventually to stand spotless and unashamed in His glorious
      presence."—S.D.A Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 710.
         In the face of such a revelation, do we need to wonder at the sublimity
      of Jude's gratitude? Should ours be any less intense? As already noted,
      after the title "God our Saviour," Jude included the words "through Jesus
      Christ our Lord" (NEB). This teaches that we can offer acceptable praise
      to the Eternal only through Christ's good offices. Shall we not join him in
      ascribing to God "glory and majesty, might and authority" (NEB)? Those
      supercharged words are inadequate to identify all that we shall want to
      attribute to our divine Redeemer when we come into His holy, eternal
      presence. We shall humbly recognize then what we can perceive only
      dimly now, that the Saviour God whom we worship has always possessed
      and shall forever retain those attributes—they are eternal, "Before all
      time, now, and for evermore" (NEB).

      MEDITATION: Study Jude 24, 25 thoughtfully. Then indicate below what
      the following phrases mean to you:

        "him that is able"

        "keep you from falling"

        "present you faultless"

        "presence of his glory"

        "with exceeding joy"

        "the only wise God our Saviour"

        After you are sure that you understand what these verses are saying,
      repeat them in prayer several times, putting in "me" instead of "you" and
      "my" instead of "our."

DAY REVIEW OF THIS QUARTER'S LESSONS: One good approach would
    be to read Second Peter and Jude straight through at one sitting.
      The general title for this quarter's lessons, Ideals for Christians, is

      96
closely related to the substance of Peter's and Jude's concerns for their
fellow Christians. They wanted to help them live victoriously in a pagan
world. To this end they gave counsel that was eminently suited to their
circumstances. It is part of the miracle of Holy Writ that this advice,
given almost 2000 years ago, still is most appropriate for those of us who
live on the verge of the twenty-first century.
   Let us conclude our quarter's study by identifying some of the Chris-
tian ideals that are emphasized in the two epistles. Sothe already have
been emphasized, notably, our need for "grace" and "knowledge," "great
and precious promises," and those qualities that form part of Peter's lad-
der (2 Peter 1:5-7). We might profitably review these and evaluate the part
each plays in our own personalities and life-styles as believers.
   In addition, we may wish to refresh our understanding and exercise of
these other positive qualities (sometimes expressed negatively) that fig-
ure prominently in the second letter written by Peter:
          Diligence                          1:10; 3:14
          Remembrance                        1:12, 13, 15; 3:1, 2
          Understanding of prophecy          1:19-21
          Avoidance of covetousness          2:3, 15, 16
          Other-worldliness                  2:5-8
          Sexual purity                      2:10, 13, 14, 18, 20
          Awareness of history               3:3-7
          Knowledge of God's patience         3:8, 9
          Preparedness for the advent         3:10-14
          Spiritual growth                    3:18
          Reverence for divinity              3:18
   The Holy Spirit is waiting to assist each of us in developing these Chris-
tian ideals in our characters.

APPLICATION: "Jesus says, 'Without Me ye can do nothing.' Our
growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all depend upon our union with
Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly,—by abiding in
Him,—that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the Author, but the
Finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He is to be with
us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at every step
of the way. David says, 'I have set the Lord always before me: because
He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.' Psalm 16:8."—Steps to
Christ, p. 69.
  "No subject of contemplation will tend more to humble the mind, than
thoughts of God. . . . But while the subject humbles the mind, it also ex-
pands it. He who often thinks of God, will have a larger mind than the
man who simply plods around this narrow globe. . . . The most excellent
study for expanding the soul, is the science of Christ, and Him crucified,
and the knowledge of the Godhead in the glorious Trinity. Nothing will so
enlarge the intellect, nothing so magnify the whole soul of man, as a de-
vout, earnest, continued investigation of the great subject of the De-
ity."—C. H. Spurgeon, quoted by J. I. Packer, Knowing God (Downers
Grove, I11.: Inter-Varsity Press, 1973), pp. 13, 14.

            .7, p. 941.
           In John 3:14 we find Jesus ellMg Nicodemus that
         must be "lifted up" on the c oss. To lift up is to place
                                        reat center of attraction
         on the cross becomes the beings are drawn toge
         draws. Thus God and hum all that separates, is o
             rebellion, the sinfulness, es as the mighties
