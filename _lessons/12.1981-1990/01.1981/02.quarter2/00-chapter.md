Dear Sabbath School Members Around The World:

A wonderful bond of fellowship and strength comes by being members of the Sabbath
School. Through this heaven-ordained institution, a weekly view of the world church
membership, busily engaged in sharing the good news of salvation in Christ, is
acquired. Sabbath School provides a grand opportunity to support the world church
program through personal gifts of love.

Your Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects Offering designated for the Far Eastern
Division this quarter, will strengthen three specific areas of tremendous need.

Mt. Klabat Girls' Dormitory - Mt. Klabat College is located in a magnificent tropical
setting in the eastern part of Indonesia, near the city of Manado. Students there
receive a thorough Adventist education, which includes work experience. Many key church
leaders, both lay and ministerial, have been trained at this school. However, dormitory
space is at a premium. A new girls' dormitory is desperately needed to replace the
present,very inadequate, temporary housing facility.

Central Philippine Union College - With two colleges in the Philippines filled to
overflowing, a third college is urgently needed. A beautiful location has already
been selected and land has been purchased. It is planned that this school will be
in full operation soon after the special projects offering is received. Students
have been refused entrance into the colleges because of lack of space. This new
school provides an answer.

Philippine Barrio Chapels - In a country where the church membership is growing
very rapidly, there is an immediate need for additional churches and chapels. A
new national highway has been built from the northern part of the Philippines to
the south. It is planned that along this highway a new Seventh-day Adventist Church
will be erected in most of the small towns and village barrios. The members are
anxious to assist with the buildings but they need the help of our church members
around the world to provide these church homes.

Thank you for asking the Lord to bless this building program. Could you personally
visit the projects you have supported in the past from your generous Thirteenth
Sabbath Offerings, I know you would rejoice to see the results. Please join with
me, June 27, in taking advantage of another great opportunity to give for the
glorious advancement of God's ever-expanding church.

   cerely,

            THE CHURCH HOME AT LAST
                                      Introduction

   The establishment and triumph of the church—when she will be "home at last'—is
linked directly with the coming of Christ in history and is foretold in prophecy.
   In history Christ established the church to be His mouthpiece to the world both in
Old and New Testament times. Originally Christ would visit Eden to communicate
with the human family. Sin put an end to this face-to-face communication between
God and man. In the intervening years. the law and the prophets became God's
medium of expression.
   Nearly 4000 years passed as the world inched closer to the first coming of Jesus.
Angels would make the glad announcement. God in Christ would once more com-
mune with man face-to-face. This would neither abolish the law nor negate the
prophets. They would continue as instruments of instruction, but would yield to the
glory of the law's Author and the prophets' Mentor. Men would for 33 brief years be
brought face-to-face with the substance of the messages of the law and prophets.
The latter were and are in a sense substitute teachers. They are but a pale reflection of
the real. Jesus Christ is the key to both history and prophecy. Compared to Him, the
law and the prophets were but satellites about the sun.
   When Christ ascended on high, the Holy Spirit assumed the primary teaching
function for the church and the world (John 16:13). The church is His medium of
personal communication. The church may involve herself in many things, but she can
best serve her Master when she is preaching the gospel.
   It is the carrying out of this divine commission that brings the church under fire.
Satan hates the gospel, by whose knowledge men are saved. The church is the one
institution that stands between Satan and his complete takeover of this planet. His
 plan therefore calls for its destruction.
   The pages of history are red with the blood of Christian martyrs. Christians were
used as flaming torches at the fun games of the Circus Maximus. But the "blood of
 martyrs is the seed of the church.- The sword did not succeed.
    But Satan would subvert what he could not execute. He entered church councils,
 perverted church doctrines, and'in many instances produced a love of ease and lack
 of fervor.
    Demons love nothing better than to mute the voice of Christian witness. If God can't
 be heard, He can more easily be misrepresented. Men must be told of the love of God.
 They must be taught the Bible way of life. Christians must understand why God must
 destroy sinners. The church must carry to a hopeless world a message of hope. The
 gospel is essential to the enrichment of life here and hereafter. Men must know this
now, for the end is near. The devil knew 1900 years ago that he had but a "short time."
 He is working day and night to abort the church's mission by confusing her priorities
 and watering down her message. But in all of this he is doomed to failure. The power
 of God will anoint the church. She will arise as a giant, stirring from slumber; and she
 will finish her God-given task. The world will be made aware of the love of God. The
 prophecies will be fulfilled. The gates of hell will not prevail!

             Part 1   How does God early reveal His deep interest in man's wel-
          MEETING fare, an interest supremely manifested in the incarnation?
        MAN'S NEED
                      "The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be
                    alone; I will make him an help meet for him" (Gen. 2:18).

                        "God made from the man a woman, to be a companion and
                     helpmeet for him, to be one with him, to cheer, encourage, and
                     bless him, he in his turn to be her strong helper. All who enter
                     into matrimonial relations with a holy purpose—the husband to
                     obtain the pure affections of a woman's heart, the wife to soften
                     and improve her husband's character and give it completeness
                     —fulfill God's purpose for them."—The Adventist Home, p. 99.

                        In anticipation of man's greater need, what agreement to
                     send Jesus was made before the Creation? Note the implica-
                     tion in Revelation 13:8.

                        "God and Christ knew from the beginning, of the apostasy of
                     Satan and of the fall of Adam through the deceptive power of the
                     apostate."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 250.
                        "Before the foundations of the world were laid, Christ, the
                     Only Begotten of God, pledged Himself to become the Re-
                     deemer of the human race, should Adam sin. Adam fell, and He
                     who was partaker of the Father's glory before the world was,
                     laid aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and stepped down
                     from His high authority to become a Babe in Bethlehem, that by
                     passing over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell, He
                     might redeem fallen human beings."—Selected Messages, bk.
                     1, p. 226.

                        When he was created, did man have any inherent or built-in
                     liabilities? Gen. 1:31; Ps. 8:4, 5.

                       "This sinless pair wore no artificial garments. They were
                     clothed with a covering of light and glory, such as the angels
                     wear. While they lived in obedience to God, this circle of light
                     enshrouded them. Although everything God had made was in
                     the perfection of beauty, and there seemed nothing wanting
                     upon the earth which God had created to make Adam and Eve
                     happy, yet he manifested his great love to them by planting a
                     garden especially for them."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 34.

THINK IT THROUGH       Can God's precious provisions for man's needs, before and
                     after his sin, lead me to trust Him for my special needs?

             Part 2   With what power was man invested that especially reveals
          FREEDOM the wisdom and love of God?
         OF CHOICE
                      "If it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this
                    day whom ye will serve ... ; but as for me and my house, we will
                    serve the Lord" (Joshua 24:15).

                      In what way did the rich young ruler illustrate later the tragic
                     misuse of this great gift of God to man? Luke 18:18-24.

                       "Christ's words were verily to the ruler the invitation, 'Choose
                     you this day whom ye will serve.' Joshua 24:15. The choice was
                     left with him. Jesus was yearning for his conversion."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 520.

                        How did man abuse this God-given power? Gen. 3:6.

                        "Adam regretted that Eve had left his side, but now the deed
                     was done. He must be separated from her whose society he had
                     loved so well. How could he have it thus. His love for Eve was
                     strong. And in utter discouragement he resolved to share her
                     fate. He seized the fruit and quickly ate it, and like Eve felt not
                     immediately its ill effects. Adam disobeyed and fell."—Spiritual
                     Gifts, vol. 3, p. 42.
                       There was no reason for mankind to sin against God. There is
                     none today. Sin was and is contrary to reason. It is a deviation,
                     an abnormality. To explain it is to justify it. This much is sure: by
                     a free exercise of his will, Adam elected to disregard the will of
                     God and thus plunged the human family into misery and woe.
                     There was nothing in Adam's nature or the Edenic environment
                     to induce man to sin.
                       The first misuse of the power of choice was entered upon
                     gradually, little step by little step. "Eve's curiosity was aroused.
                     Instead of fleeing from the spot, she listened to hear a serpent
                     talk. It did not occur to her mind that it might be that fallen foe,
                     using the serpent as a medium. It was Satan that spoke, not the
                     serpent. Eve was beguiled, flattered, infatuated. Had she met a
                     commanding personage, possessing a form like the angels and
                     resembling them, she would have been upon her guard.... But
                     she entered into a controversy with the serpent."—The Story of
                     Redemption, p. 33.

THINK IT THROUGH        In how many experiences of life do I, like Eve, attempt to
                      argue with my conscience rather than to accept that the Holy
                      Spirit may be trying to impress me with God's will?

            Part 3     What were the basic, crucial consequences of man's first
      THE BURDEN     disobedience to God?
 OF DISOBEDIENCE
                       "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
                     death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all
                     have sinned" (Rom. 5:12).

                       "Through man's disobedience, death entered the world.
                     Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the fruit
                     of which he had been forbidden to touch. His transgression
                     opened the floodgates of woe upon our race."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 988.

                       What is the way of escape from the fate that awaits all who
                     sin? Rom. 6:23. (Compare Rom. 8:1; 10:1-6.)

                        "By this law, which governs angels, which demands purity in
                     the most secret thoughts, desires, and dispositions, and which
                     shall 'stand fast for ever' (Ps. 111:8), all the world is to be judged
                     in the rapidly approaching day of God. Transgressors may flat-
                     ter themselves that the Most High does not know, that the
                     Almighty does not consider; He will not always bear with them.
                     Soon they will receive the reward of their doings, the death that
                     is the wages of sin; while the righteous nation, that have kept
                     the law, will be ushered through the pearly gates of the celestial
                     city, and will be crowned with immortal life and joy in the

                        The human heart recoils at the thought of judgment, con-
                     demnation, punishment. Some would strip the gospel of this
                     aspect of God's character. They cannot understand how a lov-
                     ing God could destroy sinners in a lake of fire. They cannot
                     understand the nature of sin. Sin is by its very nature divisive. It
                     separates man from God. If it continued to exist, might it not
                     ultimately unseat divine authority. Jehovah will allow neither.
                     Sin must be blotted from this planet. Anything that separates
                     God from man is a violation of His love. This He cannot allow.
                     "Christ must be Lord of all if He is to be Lord at all." Hellfire is
                     prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). It will involve
                     people only as they choose to be sinners.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have I come to the place in my Christian experience where I
                     would rather die than sin? (See Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 53;

          Part 4     For what supreme purpose was Jesus born into our world?
        SAVIOUR
       FROM SIN      "She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
                   JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins" (Matt.
                   1:21).

                     "Christ gave Himself, an atoning sacrifice, for the saving of a
                   lost world. He was treated as we deserve, in order that we might
                   be treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in
                   which He had no share, that we might be justified by His righ-
                   teousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the death
                   which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His.
                   'With His stripes we are healed.' Isaiah 53:5."—Testimonies, vol.
                   8, pp. 208, 209.

                     What would His life and death accomplish? Heb. 10:12.
                   (Compare Rom. 5:9, 10.)

                     "This was He whom seers had long foretold. He was the
                   Desire of all nations, the Root and the Offspring of David, and
                   the Bright and Morning Star. The name of that helpless little
                   babe, inscribed in the roll of Israel, declaring Him our brother,
                   was the hope of fallen humanity."—The Desire of Ages, p. 52.
                     The coming of Christ to this world was to accomplish many
                   purposes. Can you add to the following?
                     1. He was to reveal the true character of God, distorted by
                   Satan's warpings of truth.
                     2. He was to live without yielding to temptation, though
                   tempted as we are.
                     3. He was to suffer the "second death," as though an unre-
                   deemed sinner.
                     4. He was to rise from the dead, victorious over sin, death, and
                   the devil.
                     5. He earned the right to become our mediating High Priest.
                     Man needs to know his possibilities and limitations. Christ
                   came to demonstrate in the flesh that Adam need never have
                   sinned. In Him there was no sinful propensity, yet He "was in all
                   points tempted like as we are" (Heb. 4:15). Christ succeeded
                   where Adam failed, and He did it for Adam and for us!

THINK IT THROUGH    Have I accepted fully and personally Christ's atonement for
                   my sins?

              Part 5   How was Satan affected by the death of Christ on the cross?
       BRUISING THE
         SERPENT'S     "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
               HEAD between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and
                     thou shalt bruise his heel" (Gen. 3:15).
                       "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of
                     this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
                     draw all men unto me" (John 12:31, 32).

                         What evidence does Paul record that Christ rose from the
                       dead? 1 Cor. 15:5-8.

                          "Why, Paul reasoned, should it seem incredible that Christ
                        should rise from the dead? Once it had thus seemed to him, but
                        how could he disbelieve that which he himself had seen and
                        heard? At the gate of Damascus he had verily looked upon the
                        crucified and risen Christ, the same who had walked the streets
                       of Jerusalem, died on Calvary, broken the bands of death, and
                       ascended to heaven. As verily as had Cephas, James, John, or
                       any others of the disciples, he had seen and talked with Him.
                       The Voice had bidden him proclaim the gospel of a risen
                       Saviour, and how could he disobey?"—The Acts of the Apos-
                       tles, pp. 436, 437.
                          It is interesting to note how the resurrection affected Christ's
                       enemies and His friends. Satan's last hope of containing Christ
                       was that He remain sealed in the tomb. The resurrection filled
                       demons with dread. By it Satan knew that his doom was sealed.
                       The priests lived in constant dread of meeting Christ on the
                       street. "Nevermore would peaceful sleep come to their
                       pillows."—The Desire of Ages, p. 785. But for His disciples the
                       resurrection was their own rebirth. They had seen Him
                       crucified. They had fled for their own lives. When finally they
                       believed the news of His resurrection when it reached them, and
                       Jesus and the Holy Spirit ministered to them, evangelistic fires
                       were rekindled and the disciples were never the same again.
                       Serving the Living God makes all of the difference in the world.
                          Without the resurrection of Jesus the "good news" would be
                       incomplete and ineffective. We might be making pilgrimages to
                       the tomb of Christ, but we could have no hope of eternal life; for
                       the devil would have held our Lord in his prison house of death.
                       We would have no heavenly Intercessor and no hope of a return-
                       ing Lord to complete the eradication of sin from the universe.

THINK IT THROUGH         Is the true meaning of Christ's resurrection from the dead
                       and all that it implies as real to me as it was to the twelve
                       disciples?

The Church Fallen and Redeemed                LESSON 1                   ❑ Friday
                                                                             April 3

         Part 6      How long and for what purpose did Christ linger here on
           THE     earth after His resurrection?
     ASCENDING
         LORD        "To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by
                   many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and
                   speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God."
                     "When he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he
                   was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight"
                   (Acts 1:3, 9).

                      After He rose from the grave, Christ ascended on high and
                   received His Father's blessing. He then returned to the earth
                   and was seen of men for 40 days in spite of man's treatment of
                   Him. It would seem that man's malice and disloyalty would have
                   checked any desire on His part to associate with man. But love is
                   different. Christ was not turned off by rejection. For 40 days He
                   lingered near the familiar haunts, almost as if He were reluctant
                   to depart. But the important work for man awaiting Him in the
                   heavenly temple called for Him to leave.

                     By what process of the mind could you measure the impact
                   of Christ's promised return on the disciples—before and after
                   the cross? What is the impact on us? John 14:1-3.

                     Psalm 115:16 says, "The heaven, even the heavens, are the
                   Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men." In
                   the New Jerusalem is the throne of God. The earth was created
                   as man's habitation. When Christ left the earth, He said, "I go to
                   prepare a place for you." The true meaning of this promise is
                   this: "I go to establish your right to be where I am." This world is
                   scheduled for destruction by fire. The saints will need to leave
                   this world for a place of safety. The New Jerusalem is that place
                   of safety. The mediatorial work of Christ secures access for the
                   saints to the Holy City.
                      Having completed this vital work of grace, Christ will return to
                   the earth, as He says, "and receive you unto myself; that where I
                   am, there ye may be also" (John 14:3). Lovers cannot long
                   remain apart. Christ will come for His beloved. When He leaves
                   the most holy place of the sanctuary in heaven, urgent prepa-
                   rations will be made for His return. The time for these events is
                   near at hand. Now is the hour of preparation for the saints. Now
                   is the day of salvation.

              THE    advent besides the following?
         PROMISED
              ONE      "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
                     government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
                     called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlast-
                     ing Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6). (See also Gen.
                     49:10; Isa. 53:3-5.)

                       "To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave
                     His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family,
                     forever to retain His human nature. This is the pledge that God
                     will fulfill His word. 'Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
                     given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.' God has
                     adopted human nature in the person of His Son, and has carried
                     the same into the highest heaven. It is the 'Son of man' who
                     shares the throne of the universe. It is the 'Son of man' whose

                     puzzling message did the Lord send with an angel to Mary?

                     He assumed the liabilities of human nature, to be proved and
                     tried. In His humanity He was a partaker of the divine nature. In

                       When Joseph decided to be kind to Mary in her embarrass-
                     ing condition, how did Heaven step in to help? Matt. 1:19, 20.

                       Joseph was puzzled by Mary's pregnancy. He decided that his
                     planned marriage was all a mistake. Out of consideration for
                     Mary he would put her away privately.
                       He did not then understand the high honor that was his. He
                     had been chosen to oversee the birth and early training of the
                     Son of God. The angel warned him not to put her away. To his
                     everlasting credit, he obeyed the Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH       Am I like Joseph, always immediately obedient to the will of
                     the Lord as revealed to me through the promptings of the Holy
                     Spirit, even when I cannot understand all the reasons for it?
                     (See Heb. 4:7, last part.)

                                                                         April 6

         Part 2      What reception did Joseph and Mary get at the inn?
      NO ROOM
                     "There was no room for them in the inn" (Luke 2:7).

                     "With amazement the heavenly messengers beheld the indif-
                   ference of that people whom God had called to communicate to
                   the world the light of sacred truth.... The priests and teachers
                   of the nation knew not that the greatest event of the ages was
                   about to take place. They rehearsed their meaningless prayers,
                   and performed the rites of worship to be seen by men, but in
                   their strife for riches and worldly honor they were not prepared
                   for the revelation of the Messiah."—The Desire of Ages, p. 44.
                     All hotels at Bethlehem were crowded when Joseph and Mary
                   sought lodging. They were turned away. Had the innkeepers
                   known the true identity of the Babe that Mary carried, would
                   they not have made room? All Israel looked forward to the birth
                   of the Messiah. The honor of having housed the Deliverer in
                   one's hotel at His birth would be significant as a fact of history
                   and an aid to business.
                     Perhaps there was a divine hand in it all. Being born in a
                   manger, Christ consented to the lowest of earthly environ-
                   ments. No man can now claim that the Master does not under-
                   stand poverty and humble circumstances. He is not out of touch
                   with any level of human need. He has experienced it all and is
                   therefore able to understand and anticipate every need.

                     Under what circumstances was Jesus born? Luke 2:7, first
                   part.

                      "Born amidst surroundings the rudest, sharing a peasant's
                   home, a peasant's fare, a craftsman's occupation, living a life of
                   obscurity, identifying Himself with the world's unknown
                   toilers,—amidst these conditions and surround ings,—Jesus
                   followed the divine plan of education. The schools of His times,
                   with their magnifying of things small and their belittling of
                   things great, He did not seek. His education was gained directly
                   from the Heaven-appointed sources; from useful work, from the
                   study of the Scriptures and of nature, and from the experiences
                   of life—God's lesson books, full of instruction to all who bring to
                   them the willing hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding
                   heart."—Education, p. 77.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is it possible that I today, like the innkeepers approached by
                   Joseph, can be blinded by a lack of spiritual discernment as to
                   the true identity of the One who is knocking at the door of my
                   heart?

          Part 3     While shepherds tended their flocks, what startling scene
          PEACE broke upon their visions?
         TO MEN
                     "Lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of
                 the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
                 ... And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
                 heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the
                 highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men" (Luke 2:9,
                 13, 14).

                      "At these words, visions of glory fill the minds of the listening
                   shepherds. The Deliverer has come to Israel! Power, exaltation,
                   triumph, are associated with His coming. But the angel must
                   prepare them to recognize their Saviour in poverty and humilia-
                   tion. . . .
                      "The heavenly messenger had quieted their fears. He had told
                   them how to find Jesus. With tender regard for their human
                   weakness, he had given them time to become accustomed to
                   the divine radiance. Then the joy and glory could no longer be
                   hidden."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 47, 48.

                     Under what circumstances were the wise men of the East
                   alerted? Matt. 2:2.

                      "The wise men had seen a mysterious light in the heavens
                   upon that night when the glory of God flooded the hills of
                   Bethlehem. . . . That star was a distant company of shining
                   angels, but of this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they were
                   impressed that the star was of special import to them.... The
                   prophecy of Balaam had declared, 'There shall come a Star out
                   of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel.' Num. 24:17.
                   Could this strange star have been sent as a harbinger of the
                   Promised One? The magi had welcomed the light of heaven-
                   sent truth; now it was shed upon them in brighter rays. Through
                   dreams they were instructed to go in search of the newborn
                   Prince."—The Desire of Ages, p. 60.
                     The importance which Heaven attached to this grand event is
                   evidenced by the angel band that was its forerunner. The Word
                   was being made flesh to dwell among us. God identified Himself
                   with mankind by becoming mankind's kin. And throughout end-
                   less ages, Christ will carry His human body as a badge of His
                   victory. The scars of His crucifixion will be visible eternally. A
                   great and effectual door is thus opened to us.

THINK IT THROUGH     Christ's first advent found ancient Israel unprepared for His
                   coming. Will His second advent find us, Laodicean Israel,
                   equally unprepared for His return?

           Part 4     Whom do you hold accountable for Herod's cruel reaction?
           SAVED
         TO SAVE      "Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise
                    men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the
                    children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof,
                    from two years old and under, according to the time which he
                    had diligently enquired of the wise men" (Matt. 2:16).

                      "This calamity the Jews had brought upon themselves. If they
                    had been walking in faithfulness and humility before God, He
                    would in a signal manner have made the wrath of the king
                    harmless to them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 65.

                      How does the first advent affect our salvation? Heb. 10:10-
                    12; Rom. 5:15.

                      "This glorious Being loved the poor sinner and took upon
                    Himself the form of a servant, that He might suffer and die in
                    man's behalf. Jesus might have remained at His Father's right
                    hand, wearing His kingly crown and royal robes. But He chose
                    to exchange all the riches, honor, and glory of heaven for the
                    poverty of humanity, and His station of high command for the
                    horrors of Gethsemane and the humiliation and agony of Cal-
                    vary. He became a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,
                    that by His baptism of suffering and blood He might purify and
                    redeem a guilty world. 'Lo, I come,' was the joyful assent, 'to do
                    Thy will, 0 My God.--Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 121.

                     Why did Christ's own disciples misunderstand His mission?
                    Matt. 20:21-23.

                       Groaning under the yoke of Rome, the disciples shared with
                    all Jews the hope of a temporal kingdom and a Messiah who
                    would come and depose the Roman master. Israel would then
                    come into her own. James and John wished to be partners in
                    this glory.
                       Christ sought to open their eyes to the true nature of His
                    kingdom. "Are ye able to drink the cup?" He asked. "We are
                    able," they answered (Matt. 20:22). Had He answered their
                    mother's petition and their own, there at the crucifixion James
                    would have hung on one cross and John on the other instead of
                    the two thieves. But their request was not wholly unanswered.
                    James was beheaded and John suffered longest of all the disci-
                    ples for the name of the Lord. It was difficult for them—until
                    after the resurrection—to understand that Christ's coming
                    would deliver the world from satanic bondage.

            Part 5      What did the life of Christ demonstrate as to our potential?
       HIS BLOOD
           AVAILS       "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
                     Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
                     live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
                     himself for me" (Gal. 2:20).

                       "Christ came in human form to show the inhabitants of the
                     unfallen worlds and of the fallen world that ample provision has
                     been made to enable human beings to live in loyalty to their
                     Creator."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 227.
                       Christ did not take advantage of His divine nature in resisting
                     evil. He fought temptation with the same spiritual weapons that
                     are available to us. He thus demonstrated that sin may be over-
                     come. With this example we are moved to believe, attempt, and
                     persevere! The Holy Spirit, who wrought in Him the purposes of
                     God, will grant us strength for weakness, hope for despair,
                     shelter in the time of storm, ever pointing us to the unfailing
                     adequacy of the merits of Jesus Christ.

                       What did His death provide? 1 John 1:9.

                         The believers who lived before the cross were given the sacri-
                      ficial system to remind them that Messiah would come. Those
                      who lived after the cross partake of the Lord's Supper as a
                     reminder that Messiah has come. For those who lived before the
                     cross and after, the remedy was the same—namely, faith. Both
                     the ordinances and the sacrificial system were given to educate
                     and strengthen our faith. For it is still true as ever that "the just
                     shall live by faith."
                         In this Christ demonstrated to us that in Him we experience a
                     perfection otherwise alien to our nature and state. When we by
                     faith embrace Christ as Lord and Saviour, He confers on us the
                     absolute perfection that is His. And this while we are yet imper-
                     fect. Our new "wholeness" is the fruitage of faith in Christ.
                     There occurs in further consequence a healing of the attitude
                     which produces disciplined behavior.
                         "Every dying victim was a type of Christ, which lesson was
                     impressed on mind and heart in the most solemn, sacred cere-
                     mony, and explained definitely by the priests. Sacrifices were
                     explicitly planned by God Himself to teach this great and
                     momentous truth, that through the blood of Christ alone there is
                     forgiveness of sins."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 107.

         Part 6   What measure of strength and victory is available to us
       NEWNESS through Christ's death?
        OF LIFE
                  "Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into
                Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are
                buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
                raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
                also should walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:3, 4).

                      Dare we, in this life, be assured of life in the hereafter?
                    1 Cor. 15:19; Heb. 11:13, 16.

                        "So those who had been raised [in conjunction with Christ's
                    resurrection] were to be presented to the universe as a pledge of
                    the resurrection of all who believe in Christ as their personal
                    Saviour. The same power that raised Christ from the dead will
                    raise His church, and glorify it with Christ, as His bride, above all
                    principalities, above all powers, above every name that is
                    named, not only in this world, but also in the heavenly courts,
                    the world above. The victory of the sleeping saints will be glori-
                    ous on the morning of the resurrection. Satan's triumph will
                    end, while Christ will triumph in glory and honor. The Life-giver
                    will crown with immortality all who come forth from the
                    grave."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 305, 306.
                        Christians die differently from other people, for their view of
                    death is brightened with hope of life in the hereafter. For this
                    same reason they live differently.
                        Death is not the end of life for saint or sinner. Each must face
                    his own hereafter. And that hereafter has some influence on his
                    behavior here.
                        For the Christian, this life is a practice "run" as men and
                     women prepare to live with angels. This expectation is a source
                    of joy here and an enrichment of the present experience. We
                     sacrifice nothing vital to life here as we long for a better world
                     than this. Life can be rather hectic here, and the burden is made
                     lighter by the hope of a better world to come.

                      How limited was the Old Testament era in its understanding
                    of the hope of the "blood of the lamb"? 2 Cor. 3:13-15.

                      "As Moses saw the day of Christ, and the new and living way
                    of salvation that was to be opened through His blood, he was
                    captivated and entranced."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.

           Part 1     How did the Old Testament prophets describe the second
      "THE LORD     coming of the Lord?
        COMETH"
                      "Behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the
                    inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall
                    disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain" (isa.
                    26:21). (See also Ps. 50:3-5.)

                       The Lord's "place" is the heaven of heavens. (See Ps. 115:16.)
                    He ascended there some 1900 years ago. One might say that
                    Christ had come "out of his place" to provide for man a way of
                    escape from the prison house of sin. For 33 years He lived in
                    what was for Him a foreign atmosphere. Sin was and is repulsive
                    to His nature. Because of His deep love for man He endured it
                    all, even the death on the cross, that we through His sacrifice
                    might be saved.
                       Words cannot capture the degree of pain, the depth of
                    humiliation, or the agony of a broken heart; but all this He
                    endured just for us.
                       Having completed His sacrifice for us, He was caught up to
                    God. Isaiah says that He will once again come "out of his place."
                    This time to execute judgment on the wicked and reward the
                    righteous. Mankind's rebellion against his Maker cannot go
                    unpunished. It is but a part of a larger conspiracy against the
                    government of God led by Satan himself.

                      Why was the second coming predicted so far ahead of its
                    fulfillment? See Rom. 15:4.

                       Mankind cannot live without hope. He may exist, but not truly
                    live. Hope brings light to the eye, spring to the step, and a song
                    to the heart. Said one, "The birds sing sweetly in the bosom of
                    him who hopes." The physician's balm works best on patients
                    whose desire to live is strongest. Hope feeds that desire.
                       The promise of the coming of Christ inspires hope. The
                    human experiment with sin has long ago turned sour. Our
                    problems become more acute with every passing hour. The
                    things that plague this sinful planet multiply. The coming of the
                    Lord is the one light at the end of the tunnel of human probation.
                    The promise of His coming appears early in Scripture so that
                    people of bygone centuries might have hope. They must know
                    that "Shiloh" will come again and that unto Him will the gather-
                    ing of the people be.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does the "blessed hope" mean more to me each day as I
                    draw nearer to the end?

                                                                           April 13

            Part 2     With what words did angels announce to the apostles the
        "SHALL SO    specific promise of Christ's return?
           COME"
                       "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
                     this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall
                     so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven"
                     (Acts 1:11).

                        "Upon reaching the Mount of Olives, Jesus led the way across
                     the summit, to the vicinity of Bethany. Here He paused, and the
                     disciples gathered about Him. . . . With hands outstretched in
                     blessing, and as if in assurance of His protecting care, He slowly
                     ascended from among them, drawn heavenward by a power
                     stronger than any earthly attraction. As He passed upward, the
                     awestricken disciples looked with straining eyes for the last
                     glimpse of their ascending Lord. A cloud of glory hid Him from
                     their sight; and the words came back to them as the cloudy
                     chariot of angels received Him, 'Lo, I am with you alway, even
                     unto the end of the world.' At the same time there floated down
                     to them the sweetest and most joyous music from the angel
                     choir."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 830, 831.
                        Angels announced the first coming of Christ as a Babe in
                     Bethlehem. Music accompanied the ascension. It is appropriate
                     that angels will announce the second coming of the Lord amid
                     the "sweetest and most joyous music." Our Lord's return will be
                     for the saints a cause of great rejoicing, for it will come at a time
                     of dire peril and persecution. His followers will then desire His
                     coming with a desperation that defies description. The tame
                     "longing" of this Laodicean era will be replaced with a passion
                     that aches. Then only will the Lord return.

                       What predicted actions of the Lord clearly indicate angel
                     participation in the second coming? Matt. 25:31.

                       "When the divine Presence was manifested upon Sinai, the
                     glory of the Lord was like devouring fire in the sight of all Israel.
                     But when Christ shall come in glory with His holy angels the
                     whole earth shall be ablaze with the terrible light of His
                     presence. . . . 'The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
                     with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on
                     them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel.' 2 Thes-
                     salonians 1:7, 8."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 339, 340.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is it more important to me that I will be living when Christ
                     comes or that I will be ready when He comes?

              Part 3     How tightly did Christ tie the assurance of His return to the
           "A PLACE    reality of His departure?
          FOR YOU"
                         "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
                       also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were
                       not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
                       And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
                       receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
                       also" (John 14:1-3).

                          "In that day, as in the time of Jerusalem's destruction, God's
                       people will be delivered, everyone that shall be found written
                       among the living. Isaiah 4:3. Christ has declared that He will
                       come the second time to gather His faithful ones to Himself:
                       'Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see
                       the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
                       great glory. And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a
                       trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four
                       winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' Matthew 24:30,
                       31."—The Great Controversy, p. 37.

                         Through the revelation of John, what element of urgency
                       does Christ add to the promise of His return? Rev. 22:7,12, 20.

                          "Behold, I come quickly," the Master said. He has not chosen
                       to reveal the day or the hour, but it is near at hand. Of course, we
                       realize that Christians of every generation were taught to expect
                       the Lord's return in their own time.
                          But there are special evidences that this is the last generation.
                       Has not nuclear capacity increased to the point that man may
                       now destroy himself? Has the pollution of nature passed the
                       point of no return? Is human society corrupting itself to a point
                       of self-destruction? Is not this the end of "the age of man"?
                          "You must be wrestlers for the crown of life. Strive, for the
                       grasp of Satan is upon you; and if you do not wrench yourselves
                       from him, you will be palsied and ruined. The foe is on the right
                       hand, and on the left, before you, and behind you; and you must
                       trample him under your feet. Strive, for there is a crown to be

THINK IT THROUGH         If I am making spiritual preparation for Christ's return during
                       "the time of the end," does it automatically follow that I will be

          Part 4     Will Christ come so that everyone will know it, or will it be a
     "EVERY EYE    secret rapture as many claim?
          SHALL
       SEE HIM"      "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see
                   him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the
                   earth shall wail because of him" (Rev. 1:7).
                     "Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
                   and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall
                   see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power
                   and great glory" (Matt. 24:30).

                     "Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about
                   half the size of a man's hand. It is the cloud which surrounds the
                   Saviour and which seems in the distance to be shrouded in
                   darkness. The people of God know this to be the sign of the Son
                   of man. . . . Jesus rides forth as a mighty conqueror. Not now a

                   comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge the living and the
                   dead. . . . With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a
                   vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 640.
                     The inhabitants of the earth turn pale at the awesome sight.
                   The saints will, for the first time, see Him face-to-face. The sheer
                   force of the cataclysmic presence of thousands of angels will be
                   earthshaking in itself. But the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,
                   awakening the righteous dead. This is not secret rapture. This is
                   a center-stage event. The inhabitants of the whole earth are
                   aware of it. The wicked "mourn." The saved rejoice. By an act of
                   visible, overwhelming power, Christ comes to take away His
                   church.

                     What signs in the heavens indicate the nearness of Christ's
                   coming and also occur in connection with the advent itself?
                   Matt. 24:29; Rev. 6:12, 13.

                     "December 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the shaking
                   of the powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord said
                   'heaven,' in giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark, and
                   Luke, He meant heaven, and when He said 'earth' He meant
                   earth. The powers of heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They
                   rule in the heavens. The powers of earth are those that rule on
                   the earth. The powers of heaven will be shaken at the voice of
                   God. Then the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their
                   places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of
                   God."—Early Writings, p. 41.

       "WARS AND nears?
        RUMORS"
                    "Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
                  not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
                  end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and king-
                  dom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pesti-
                  lences, and earthquakes, in divers places" (Matt. 24:6, 7).

                      "Probationary Time Running Out.—Already kingdom is ris-
                   ing against kingdom. There is not now a determined engage-
                   ment. As yet the four winds are held until the servants of God
                   shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the powers of earth will
                   marshall their forces for the last great battle. How carefully we
                   should improve the little remaining period of our probation!"—

                   968.

                     How close does the Bible come to describing today's soci-
                   ety? Could this be coincidence only? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
                     Religious formalism denies the power of God. How does
                   John symbolize this noncommitment? Rev. 3:15, 17.

                      "The true Christian will love to wait and watch for the teach-
                   ings of God and the leadings of His Spirit. But with many,
                   religion is merely a form. Vital godliness is lacking. Many dare to
                   say, I will do this, or that, or I will not do this; and the fear of
                   offending God is scarcely thought of. Those thus described, I
                   saw, could not enter heaven as they are. They may flatter them-
                   selves that they will be saved, but God has no pleasure in them.
                   Their lives do not please Him. Their prayers are an offense to
                   Him.
                      "Christ now calls them: 'Be zealous and repent.' He kindly
                   and faithfully admonishes them to buy gold, white raiment, and
                   eyesalve. They can choose either to be zealous, and partake
                   largely of salvation, or be spewed out of the mouth of the Lord
                   as disgusting, and be thrust from Him. God will not bear always.
                   He is of tender pity, yet His Spirit will be grieved away for the last
                   time. Mercy's sweet voice will be no more heard. Its last pre-
                   cious notes will have died away, and those described will be left
                   to their own ways, to be filled with their own doings."—

THINK IT THROUGH     Is my desire not to grieve the Holy Spirit based alone on my
                   desire to be saved or on my desire not to "crucify ... the Son of

Coming Again       LESSON 3                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                        April 17

        Part 6   How may the lukewarmness of soul of the Laodiceans be
   "BUY OF ME" overcome?

                     "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
                   mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
                   clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
                   and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see"
                   (Rev. 3:18).

                     Nothing short of personal response to God's pleadings can
                   shake the Laodicean lethargy that now grips the saints. "Buy of
                   me gold." This speaks of a priceless personal experience with
                   Christ that improves with testing. "White raiment" is the charac-
                   ter of Christ with which we are to be clothed. "Eyesalve" is the
                   wisdom of the Holy Spirit which deepens spiritual insight.
                      "Buy of me" and "anoint thine eyes" are action phrases.
                   Inspired by the Spirit, we must take those initiatives that will
                   invoke the power of God in our behalf. Christ-motivated action
                   is one of man's most effective forms of prayer.

                   ' What wise counsel from Amos can challenge those living in
                    the last days? Amos 4:12.

                   "In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the
                   clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John [the Baptist] is to
                   be done. God calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in
                   the great day of the Lord.... Our message must be as direct as
                   was the message of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity.
                   Notwithstanding that his life was imperiled, he did not hesitate
                   to declare God's word. And our work in this age must be done as
                   faithfully."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 332.

                     What timely advice concerning last-day needs of the church
                   does Jesus give? Luke 21:34, 36.

                     "The word of God has been neglected. In that are the warn-
                   ings to God's people which point out their dangers. But they
                   have had so many cares and perplexities that they hardly allow
                   themselves time to pray. There has been a mere empty form
                   without the power. Jesus prayed, and, oh, how earnest were His
                   prayers! And yet He was the beloved Son of God!
                     "If Jesus manifested so much earnestness, so much energy
                   and agony, how much more need for those whom He has called
                   to be heirs of salvation."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 151.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is there a difference between living in and being a part of the
                   Laodicean era and being a Laodicean?

           Part 1   Why must Jesus come again?
           "AND
         RECEIVE    "If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
           YOU" receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
                  also" (John 14:3).
                    "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
                  which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
                  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
                  works that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10).

                     When Jesus shall come, the visible church will be in extreme
                   peril. The prophecies of Revelation 13 indicate that the saints
                   will someday face deliberate extermination. Only Christ's "thief
                   in the night" return will prevent this. When the future of the
                   faithful seems hopeless, Christ will pierce the skies. When
                   hopelessness like midnight darkens the horizon, Christ will
                   deliver His people. He will allow them to drink the cup of bitter-
                   ness till thoroughly purged. His image or character being per-
                   fectly reflected in His people, He will honor their faith by receiv-
                   ing them unto Himself.

                     How will the coming again of the Lord affect the destiny of all
                   nations? Compare the nations represented in Nebuchadnez-
                   zar's dream with those on earth today. Dan. 2:44.

                      "A Dual Representation.—The image revealed to Nebuchad-
                   nezzar, while representing the deterioration of the kingdoms of
                   the earth in power and glory, also fitly represents the deteriora-
                   tion of religion and morality among the people of these king-
                   doms. As nations forget God, in like proportion they become
                   weak morally.
                      "Babylon passed away because in her prosperity she forgot
                   God, and ascribed the glory of her prosperity to human
                   achievement.
                      "The Medo-Persian kingdom was visited by the wrath of
                   heaven because in this kingdom God's law was trampled under
                   foot. The fear of the Lord found no place in the hearts of the
                   people. The prevailing influences in Med o-Persia were wicked-
                   ness, blasphemy, and corruption.
                      "The kingdoms that followed were even more base and cor-
                   rupt. They deteriorated because they cast off their allegiance to
                   God. As they forgot Him, they sank lower and still lower in the
                   scale of moral value."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible

                   way I live from day to day? Is it uppermost in my living and

      "DISTRESS of Christ to establish His kingdom here?
    OF NATIONS"
                   "There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
                 stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity;
                 the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for
                 fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on
                 the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken" (Luke
                 21:25, 26).

                       "Those who are watching for the Lord are purifying their
                    souls by obedience to the truth. With vigilant watching they
                    combine earnest working. Because they know that the Lord is at
                    the door, their zeal is quickened to co-operate with the divine
                    intelligences in working for the salvation of souls. These are the
                    faithful and wise servants who give to the Lord's household
                    'their portion of meat in due season.' Luke 12:42. They are
                    declaring the truth that is now specially applicable. As Enoch,
                    Noah, Abraham, and Moses each declared the truth for his time,
                    so will Christ's servants now give the special warning for their
                    generation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 634.

                      Is the secular world really aware that Christ will return?
                    Luke 21:35.

                       "The day is at hand when the destiny of every soul will be fixed
                    forever. This day of the Lord hastens on apace. The false
                    watchmen are raising the cry, 'All is well'; but the day of God is
                    rapidly approaching. Its footsteps are so muffled that it does not
                    arouse the world from the deathlike slumber into which it has
                    fallen. While the watchmen cry, 'Peace and safety,' sudden
                    destruction cometh upon them,' and they shall not escape'; 'for
                    as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the
                    whole earth.' It overtakes the pleasure-lover and the sinful man
                    as a thief in the night. When all is apparently secure, and men
                    retire to contented rest, then the prowling, stealthy, midnight
                    thief steals upon his prey. When it is too late to prevent the evil, it
                    is discovered that some door or window was not secured. 'Be ye
                    also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man
                    cometh.' "—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 335,
                    336.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What have I done today to witness to others of my faith that
                    Christ will soon return? (See Christian Service, p. 168.)

              Part 3     What description of the effects of sin upon the earth does
        THE DEFILED    Isaiah give that has further application to our own time?
             EARTH
                         "The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
                       because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordi-
                       nance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the
                       curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are
                       desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
                       and few men left" (Isa. 24:5, 6).

                          "The earth also is defiled. God is holy. He gave His law to
                       keep men pure and the world undefiled. By rejecting that law,
                       men defile both themselves and the world in which they live. The
                       contagion of sin has infected the very ground beneath our feet,
                       the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe (see
                       Gen. 3:17; Num. 35:33; Ps. 107:34). With every passing year the
                       earth becomes more and more corrupt. If God were not to
                       intervene, the time would come when the defilement of sin
                       would so debase the human race as to make life itself utterly
                       impossible (see Gen. 6:5, 11, 12; DA 36, 37)."—S.D.A. Bible
                       Commentary, vol. 4, p. 197.

                         Is Heaven restless for the final act in the drama? Rev. 7:1-3.

                          "With almost impatient eagerness the angels wait for our
                       co-operation; for man must be the channel to communicate
                       with man. And when we give ourselves to Christ in
                       wholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that they may speak
                       through our voices to reveal God's love."—The Desire of Ages,
                       p. 297.

                         What do we see in the world about us to indicate that the
                       experiment with sin is well-nigh over?

                         "We see calamities of every kind and in every degree coming
                       upon the earth, and why? The Lord's restraining power is not
                       exercised. The world has disregarded the word of God. They live
                       as though there were no God. Like the inhabitants of the
                       Noachic world, they refuse to have any thought of God. Wick-
                       edness prevails to an alarming extent, and the earth is ripe for
                       the harvest."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 389.

THINK IT THROUGH         Read Jeremiah 8:20. Will I be so spiritually prepared that I
                       will have no need to utter this in the final day? God grant that I
                       will.

           Part 4     What last-day application of Psalm 50 provides another
        "GOD IS     reason why Christ must return?
         JUDGE"
                       "Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
                    devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
                    about him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the
                    earth, that he may judge his people. Gather my saints together
                    unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sac-
                    rifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for
                    God is judge himself" (Ps. 50:3-6).

                       "Shall come. That is, to judgment, in a primary sense to
                    expostulate with the inhabitants of earth, as the body of the
                    psalm indicates. In a unique sense the words are also a predic-
                    tion of the judgment at the end of the world (see Matt. 25:31;
                    Acts 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1 . . .).
                       "Shall not keep silence. God will make a pronouncement on
                    man's conduct.

                    on Mt. Sinai (see Ex. 19:16, 18).
                       "Gather. At the second coming of Christ the angels will be
                    charged with the task of gathering the redeemed (see Matt.

                    judgment, the children of God will have no cause for fear' (PP

                    (Gen. 31:54; 46:1; Lev. 3:1; etc.). The ancient Sinaitic covenant
                    was ratified by the sacrifice of oxen and the sprinkling of blood
                    (Ex. 24:5-8; cf. Gen. 15:9-18). The new covenant was ratified by
                    the blood of Christ (Heb. 9:18-23; PP 371). At the coming of
                    Christ the saints who will be gathered are those who have
                    accepted the covenant sealed by the sacrifice of Christ. . . .

                    folded together. .. . That holy law, God's righteousness, ... is
                     now revealed to men as the rule of judgment' (GC 639)."—

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my relationship with Christ so close that in the time of
                    trouble I can be hidden, as it were, from the onslaughts of

             Part 5   How will Christ finally deal with His enemies?
            "THAT
          WICKED"     "Then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
        DESTROYED consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
                    the brightness of his coming" (2 Thess. 2:8).

                        "That Wicked. Gr. ho anomos, literally, 'the [one] destitute of
                     law,' hence, 'the violator of the law,' the lawless one,' or 'the
                     wicked one.' The reference is to the 'man of sin' (v. 3), or the
                     'mystery of iniquity' (v. 7). According to one view 'the lawless
                     one' is the papacy.... According to a second view, he is not only
                     the papacy, but more importantly, Satan himself, the supreme
                     Antichrist, as he impersonates Christ just before the last day....
                        "Revealed. Gr. apokaluptd. . . . Applied to the papacy this
                     would refer to its assumption of power following the decline of
                     the Roman Empire. The reference could also be to the time yet
                     future when the papal power will be revived ... , and to the time
                     when following this brief period of revival the true nature of the
                     system will be unveiled, or exposed."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                     tary, vol. 7, p. 273.
                       Commandment keepers have long smarted over the apparent
                     prosperity of the wicked. David deals with this question in Psalm
                     37. In the Revelation the souls under the altar cry out, "How
                     long, 0 Lord?" Rev. 6:10. Followers of God in all ages have lived
                     for the day when right will triumph and wrong will be forever
                     dethroned. The second coming of Christ will provide this satis-
                     faction. God has revealed this to us in advance so that we faint
                     not in the hour of extreme peril.

                      How will the wicked react to the final judgments of God?
                     Rev. 6:16, 17; 16:21.

                        "With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of
                     evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense
                     blackness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the
                     earth. Then a rainbow, shining with the glory from the throne of
                     God, spans the heavens and seems to encircle each praying
                     company. The angry multitudes are suddenly arrested. Their
                     mocking cries die away. The objects of their murderous rage are
                     forgotten. With fearful forebodings they gaze upon the symbol
                     of God's covenant and long to be shielded from its overpower-
                     ing brightness."—The Great Controversy, pp. 635, 636.

THINK IT THROUGH       What will be the difference in the way the wicked will react
                     and the way the righteous will react upon Christ's return?

Why Coming Again?         LESSON 4                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                         April 24

         Part 6      After her final deliverance, what praise will the church con-
       SONG OF     fer upon her Saviour?
     MOSES AND
      THE LAMB       "They sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
                   song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,
                   Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
                   saints" (Rev. 15:3).

                      "There is a day just about to burst upon us when God's
                   mysteries will be seen, and all His ways vindicated; when jus-
                   tice, mercy, and love will be the attributes of His throne. When
                   the earthly warfare is accomplished, and the saints are all
                   gathered home, our first theme will be the song of Moses, the
                   servant of God. The second theme will be the song of the Lamb,
                   the song of grace and redemption. This song will be louder,
                   loftier, and in sublimer strains, echoing and re-echoing through
                   the heavenly courts. Thus the song of God's providence is sung,
                   connecting the varying dispensations; for all is now seen
                   without a veil between the legal, the prophetical, and the gos-
                   pel. The church history upon the earth and the church re-
                   deemed in heaven all center around the cross of Calvary. This is
                   the theme, this is the song,—Christ all and in all,—in anthems of
                   praise resounding through heaven from thousands and ten
                   thousand times ten thousand and an innumberable company of
                   the redeemed host. All unite in this song of Moses and of the
                   Lamb. It is a new song, for it was never before sung in
                    heaven."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 433.

                     May we be sure that after God's judgments are visited, the
                   sin experience will not be repeated? Nahum 1:9.

                     "The whole universe will have become witnesses to the na-
                   ture and results of sin. And its utter extermination, which in the
                   beginning would have brought fear to angels and dishonor to
                   God, will now vindicate His love and establish His honor before
                   the universe of beings who delight to do His will, and in whose
                   heart is His law. Never will evil again be manifest.... The law of.
                   God, which Satan has reproached as the yoke of bondage, will
                   be honored as the law of liberty. A tested and proved creation
                   will never again be turned from allegiance to Him whose charac-
                   ter has been fully manifested before them as fathomless love
                   and infinite wisdom."—The Great Controversy, p. 504.

THINK IT THROUGH     We have heard much of D day near the end of World War 11.
                   We look forward now to the greatest D day—"Deliverance
                   Day"—at Christ's second coming! (See Prophets and Kings, p.

                                                                             April 26

              Part 1   What indication might the early Christian church have had
                THE in John's revelation that trouble for the church lurked just
          LEOPARD- ahead?
         LIKE BEAST
                       "I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and
                     seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head
                     a blasphemous name. The beast I saw resembled a leopard,
                     but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion.
                     The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great
                     authority" (Rev. 13:1, 2, NIV).

                        In the series of worldly powers represented in Revelation 13,
                      the total span of the Christian era is covered by the dragon
                      (verse 2), the leopardlike beast (verse 1), and the lamblike beast
                      (verse 11). It is worthy of note that the leopardlike beast receives
                      his power from the dragon as its power rises, and from the
                      lamblike power as its power wanes. The beast's restoration,
                      aided by the lamblike power is such that all the world wonders
                      after the beast and is urged to bow to his authority on pain of
                      hunger and death itself (verses 15-18).
                        If the early church had no clear picture of what was coming in
                      these persecuting powers, it knew that the dragon power had
                      nothing but hostility toward those who, through the grace of
                      Christ, were obedient to the commandments of God. (See Rev.
                      13:17.) They were already acquainted with the power of the
                      dragon.

                        What further identifying marks of the beast power are pro-
                      vided, with ominous foreboding for the true church? Rev.
                      13:5, 6.

                         "The apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the
                      coming of Christ in his day. 'That day shall not come,' he says,
                      'except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be
                      revealed.' 2 Thessalonians 2:3.... Paul covers with his caution
                      the whole of the Christian dispensation down to the year 1798. It
                      is this side of that time that the message of Christ's second
                      coming is to be proclaimed."—The Great Controversy, p. 356.
                         In the last days a false revival will sweep the land. At the same
                      time the people of God will experience latter-rain power. How-
                      ever, the two may be readily distinguished. The false revival will
                      emphasize natural immortality and Sunday sacredness. The
                      true revival will teach the commandments of God and the faith
                      of Jesus. None need be deluded now or ever. The Scriptures
                      prayerfully searched and humbly obeyed are now and ever will
                      be a safeguard against error.

            Part 2   How did the papacy (the beast of Revelation 13 and the little
        CHANGING horn of Daniel 7) seek to pervert doctrine?
           TIMES
        AND LAWS     "He shall speak great words against the most High, and
                   shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change
                   times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
                   time and times and the dividing of time" (Dan. 7:25).

                       "The man of sin has instituted a false sabbath, and the pro-
                    fessed Christian world has adopted this child of the papacy,
                    refusing to obey God. Thus Satan leads men and women in a
                    direction opposite to the city of refuge; and by the multitudes
                    who follow him, it is demonstrated that Adam and Eve are not
                    the only ones who have accepted the words of the wily foe.
                       "The enemy of all good has turned the signpost round, so that
                    it points to the path of disobedience as the path of happiness.
                    He has insulted Jehovah by refusing to obey a 'Thus saith the
                    Lord.' He has thought to change times and laws."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1172.

                      In its use of state power, how fully was the beast able to
                    intimidate the true church? Rev. 13:11-17 (also 12:11).

                      Today believers are advised: "Those who would overcome
                    must put to the tax every power of their being. They must
                    agonize on their knees before God for divine power.... Christ,
                    by His own example, made it evident that man may stand in
                    integrity. Men may have a power to resist evil—a power that
                    neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master; a power that will
                    place them where they may overcome as Christ overcame. Di-
                    vinity and humanity may be combined in them."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1082.
                      The Christian church may have had much clearer understand-
                    ing of the passing of prophetic milestones than we might ex-
                    pect. There is some evidence, for example, that the church
                    prayed for the continuation in power of the pagan dragon of
                    Rome, preferring its reality to the feared power of the beast (also
                    the little horn, man of sin, antichrist) of papal Rome yet to come.
                    (See L. E. Froom, The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers

                    1950], vol. 1, p. 19.)

THINK IT THROUGH       What will be the difference, if any, between the persecution
                     of the early church and the persecution that is yet to come
                     during the time of trouble?

Enemies of the Church           LESSON 5                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        April 28

             Part 3  How long did the papacy continue as a persecuting power?
            YEARS,
          MONTHS,    "They shall be given into his hand until a time and times and
          AND DAYS the dividing of time [31/ 2 times)" (Dan. 7:25).

                       Nebuchadnezzar was banished from his throne for seven
                     years. The Bible calls this seven times (Dan. 4:32). The Septua-
                     gint (Greek version of the Old Testament) offers a prophetic
                     time key of one "time" to equal one year. Our text specifies
                     three and one half times as the period of papal persecutions.
                     This is three and one half prophetic years.
                       This same prophetic period, covering or matching parallel
                     events, is variously described as three and one half times, 42
                     months, or 1260 days. Although a prophetic year happens to be
                     an approximation of the Jewish calendar month and year, we
                     have a more specific internal key to the prophetic time clock
                     that gives 30 days to the month, 12 months to the year or "time."
                     Forty-two months, 1260 days, three and one half times (or years)
                     in these time prophecies regarding the enemies of the church
                     are one and the same period. On the prophetic principle of a day
                     standing for a year, and with the clusters of historical events
                     marking the rise and seeming end of the papacy, the period of
                     1260 years from A.D. 538 to 1798 is recognized by historicist
                     interpreters as the period of papal supremacy.

                       What new force will arise to do in the New World what the
                     papacy did in the old? How will this force support the papacy
                     throughout the world? Rev. 13:11.

                        "What nation of the New World was in 1798 rising into power,
                     giving promise of strength and greatness, and attracting the
                     attention of the world? The application of the symbol admits of
                     no question.... A European journal in 1850 spoke of the United
                     States as a wonderful empire, which was 'emerging,' and 'amid
                     the silence of the earth daily adding to its power and pride.'—
                     The Dublin Nation. Edward Everett, in an oration on the Pilgrim
                     founders of this nation, said: 'Did they look for a retired spot,
                     inoffensive for its obscurity, and safe in its remoteness, where
                     the little church of Leyden might enjoy the freedom of con-
                     science? Behold the mighty regions over which, in peaceful
                     conquest, . . . they have borne the banners of the cross!'—

THINK IT THROUGH       In what three ways can I be spiritually prepared for what-
                     ever is in store for me—even persecution—before Christ's
                     return? (See 1 Thess. 5:17; John 5:39 and 2 Tim. 2:15; Mark

          Part 4     With what diligence will the image of the beast pursue papal
          LIKE A   policy?
     LAMB—AS A
        DRAGON        "I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
                   had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he
                   exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and
                   causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
                   first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth
                   great wonders ... , and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
                        ; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should
                   make an image to the beast" (Rev. 13:11-14).

                      Who can contemplate the triumphal visit of Pope John Paul II
                   to the United States and other countries in 1979 without think-
                   ing again of the words of John and of the modern inspired
                   commentary on those words?
                      "When the leading churches of the United States, uniting
                   upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common,
                   shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain
                   their institutions, then Protestant America will have formed an
                   image of the Roman hierarchy. . . .
                      "The beast with two horns 'causeth [commands] all, both
                   small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark
                   in their right hand, or in their foreheads.' ... The third angel's
                   warning is: 'If any man worship the beast and his image, and
                   receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
                   drink of the wine of the wrath of God.' The beast' mentioned ...
                   is ... the papacy. The 'image to the beast' represents that form
                   of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the
                   Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the
                   enforcement of their dogmas."—The Great Controversy, p.445.

                    Can these persecuting powers prevail against the saints?
                   Rev. 14:1, 4.

                      "In the issue of the contest, all Christendom will be divided
                   into two great classes—those who keep the commandments of
                   God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and
                   his image and receive his mark. . . . The prophet of Patmos
                   beholds 'them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and
                   over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his
                   name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God' and

             Part 5      There are those who feel that the time for the arising of the
          MIRACLE-    persecuting powers described by Daniel, Paul, and John, and
          WORKING     identified more specifically by Ellen White, has passed. It is said

                      ments, the rise of the evangelicals, the charismatic movement,
                      the ecumenical efforts, and the popularity of the occult.

                        When spiritualism adds its deceptive force to the Protestant
                      apostasy, will this complete the trinity of deception?

                        "They are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
                      forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
                      gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty"
                      (Rev. 16:14).

                        "The miracle-working power manifested through spiritualism
                      will exert its influence against those who choose to obey God
                      rather than men. Communications from the spirits will declare
                      that God has sent them to convince the rejecters of Sunday of
                      their error, affirming that the laws of the land should be obeyed
                      as the law of God. They will lament the great wickedness in the
                      world and second the testimony of religious teachers that the
                      degraded state of morals is caused by the desecration of Sun-
                      day. Great will be the indignation excited against all who refuse
                      to accept their testimony."—The Great Controversy, pp. 590,
                      591. (Emphasis supplied.)

                        How effective will these combined powers be? Rev. 13:16;
                      14:18-20; 16:14-16.

                        Satanism, Protestantism, and Catholicism will be strangely
                      united in the very end time. By sheer physical force they will
                      seek to compel the conscience. Many will yield to their blan-
                      dishments. They have not made Christ their dependency and
                      truth their anchor. The true Trinity—God the Father, the Son,
                      and Holy Spirit—are more than a match for the dragon, the
                      beast, and false prophet.

THINK IT THROUGH        How is spiritualism making not only insidious but even overt
                      overtures to cause the remnant to be ensnared?

             Part 1     What promise have we that the church will triumph at last?
          THE LAMB
           ON ZION      "I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
                      him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's
                      name written in their foreheads" (Rev. 14:1). (See also Rev.
                      7:1-17; 14:13-16; 22:3, 4, 18-20.)

                        The exact identity of the 144,000 is unknown. God has not
                      chosen to reveal all concerning them. There is, however,
                      enough said about them to inspire confidence. And if we are
                      saved, we shall know beyond doubt just who they are.
                        "While John was shown the last great struggles of the church
                      with earthly powers, he was also permitted to behold the final
                      victory and deliverance of the faithful. He saw the church
                      brought into deadly conflict with the beast and his image, and
                      the worship of that beast enforced on pain of death. But looking
                      beyond the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company
                      upon Mount Zion with the Lamb, having, instead of the mark of
                      the beast, the 'Father's name written in their foreheads.' And
                      again he saw 'them that had gotten the victory over the beast,
                      and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of
                      his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God'
                      and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb."—Testimonies,

                       For what selfless purpose was the church put on the earth?
                      Mark 16:15; Matt. 28:19, 20.
                         "A moment of respite has been graciously given us of God.
                      Every power lent us of heaven is to be used in doing the work
                      assigned us by the Lord for those who are perishing in igno-

                      to proclaim the truth during the respite that has been granted....
                         "Every day we have been associating with men and women
                      who are judgment bound. Each day may have been the dividing

          Part 2     When the gospel's task is finished, what long-awaited event
     GOSPEL OF     will happen?
   THE KINGDOM
                     "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                   world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
                   come" (Matt. 24:14).

                      "Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take posses-
                   sion of the whole church so that everyone shall be working for
                   Him according to his ability. When the members of the church of
                   God do their appointed work in the needy fields at home and
                   abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commission, the whole
                   world will soon be warned and the Lord Jesus will return to this
                   earth with power and great glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
                   111
                      Who can escape the chastisement of the following words?
                      "Men and women are in the last hours of probation, and yet
                   are careless and stupid, and ministers have no power to arouse
                   them; they are asleep themselves. Sleeping preachers preach-
                   ing to a sleeping people!"—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 337.
                      How indeed may we profess with our lips to love the Lord
                   Jesus—and live only for ourselves. With literature to be distrib-
                   uted, Bible studies to be given, and with healing, publishing and
                   teaching ministries to be fulfilled, there is a work for every pair
                   of hands to do. Inertia cannot be explained in times like these.
                   Thousands of the saints are sleepwalking in the very shadow of
                   the eternal world. As individuals we cannot now wait to be told
                   what must be done. It is our privilege to "work the works" while
                   it is day.

                     What other human endeavor can rival the spreading of the
                   gospel in determining the destiny of the race? Mark 16:16.

                      The work of the church is to complete the work begun by the
                   Lord. "Just as we trace the pathway of a stream of water by the
                   line of living green it produces, so Christ could be seen in the
                   deeds of mercy that marked His pathway at every step. Wher-
                   ever He went, health sprang up and happiness followed wher-
                   ever He passed. The blind and deaf rejoiced in His presence. His
                   words to the ignorant opened to them a fountain of life. He
                   dispensed His blessings abundantly and continuously. They
                   were the garnered treasures of eternity, given in Christ, the
                   Lord's rich gift to man."—Counsels on Health, p. 499.

THINK IT THROUGH    Does the hope of Christ's soon coming burn as fervently in
                   my heart as when I first embraced the third angel's message?

                   nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face

                        Demons are real! They are fallen angels who have nothing to
                     do but to afflict and torment men. They were ejected from
                     heaven with Satan himself. They are confined to this earth. They
                     will perish here. They are doing their best to get every human
                     being possible to share their miserable fate.
                        "Satan has great advantages. He possessed the wonderful
                     intellectual power of an angel, of which few form any just idea.
                     Satan was conscious of his power, or he would not have en-
                     gaged in a conflict with the mighty God, the everlasting Father,
                     and the Prince of Peace. Satan closely watches events, and
                     when he finds one who has a specially strong spirit of opposi-
                     tion to the truth of God he will even reveal to him unfulfilled
                     events, that he may more firmly secure himself a seat in his
                     heart. He who did not hesitate to brave a conflict with Him who
                     holds creation as in His hand, has malignity to persecute and
                     deceive. He holds mortals in his snare at the present time.
                     During his experience of nearly six thousand years he has lost
                     none of his skill and shrewdness. All this time he has been a
                     close observer of all that concerns our race."—Testimonies,

                  "The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
                mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out
                of his mouth" (Rev. 12:16).

                     "Persecution [as the long period of papal oppression began]
                   opened upon the faithful with greater fury than ever before, and
                   the world became a vast battlefield. For hundreds of years the
                   church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity. Thus
                   says the prophet: 'The woman fled into the wilderness, where
                   she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her
                   there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.' Revelation
                   12:6."—The Great Controversy, pp. 54, 55.

                     How does John describe the return of persecution to the
                   remnant church? Rev. 13:7; 12:17.

                      "God's word has given warning of the impending danger; let
                   this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the
                   purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape
                   the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are
                   exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and
                   in the hearts of men.... All that she desires is vantage ground,
                   and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall
                   feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall
                   believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach
                   and persecution."—The Great Controversy, p. 581.

                     How severe will this persecution of the remnant be? Rev.
                   14:13.

                      "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, per-
                   suade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of
                   divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments.
                   Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for
                   truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order
                   to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a law
                   enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which
                   has cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected."—The

             Part 5      How strong is the Lord's assurance that He will again de-
              "MY     liver His sealed people?
           JEWELS"
                        "They shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day
                      when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
                      spareth his own son that serveth him" (Mal. 3:17).

                        "The eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon the
                      crisis which His people are to meet, when earthly powers shall
                      be arrayed against them. Like the captive exile, they will be in
                      fear of death by starvation or by violence. But the Holy One who
                      divided the Red Sea before Israel, will manifest His mighty
                      power and turn their captivity. 'They shall be Mine, saith the
                      Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels; and I will
                      spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.'
                      Malachi 3:17. If the blood of Christ's faithful witnesses were
                      shed at this time, [after probation's close] it would not, like the
                      blood of the martyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for
                      God."—The Great Controversy, p. 634.
                        At this point the future of the saints seems hopeless. The
                      darkness that engulfed our Saviour in Gethsemane surrounds
                      them. Evil men and demons seek to overthrow their faith. The
                      outlook is dim, lighted only by the promises of the Scriptures. At
                      the midnight hour of their torturous experience, the Saviour will
                      reveal His power. During the time of trouble the blessed hope
                      alone will light their days. The bankruptcy of all things earthly
                      will now be clearly seen by all who desire the Lord's return.

                        By what dramatic act will God intervene for His people? Rev.
                      16:15; 22:12.

                         "In the time of trial before us God's pledge of security will be
                      placed upon those who have kept the word of His patience.
                      Christ will say to His faithful ones: 'Come, My people, enter thou
                      into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself
                      as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.'
                      Isaiah 26:20. The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the rejectors of His
                      grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obedient and faithful. The
                      pillar of cloud which speaks wrath and terror to the transgressor
                      of God's law is light and mercy and deliverane to those who
                      have kept His commandments."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 404.

         Part 6     How will the church be rewarded for clinging by faith to the
       "THIS IS    Lord when His face was not revealed to them?
      OUR GOD"
                      "It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
                   waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have
                   waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation"
                   (Isa. 25:9).

                      "From garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds,
                   from mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the
                   caverns of the sea, Christ will gather His children to Himself. On
                   earth they have been destitute, afflicted, and tormented. Mil-
                   lions have gone down to the grave loaded with infamy because
                   they refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By human
                   tribunals the children of God have been adjudged the vilest of
                   criminals. But the day is near when 'God is judge Himself.' (Ps.
                   50:6). Then the decisions of earth shall be reversed. 'The rebuke
                   of His people shall He take away.' Isa. 25:8. White robes will be
                   given to every one of them. (Rev. 6:11.) And 'they shall call them
                   the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord.' Isa. 62:12."—
                   Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 179, 180.
                      We have waited for him.—The saints do not succumb to the
                   impatience of the scoffers. Their service and allegiance are
                   based on something deeper than "time of arrival." Their union
                   with Christ is based on faith, love, and respect. The quality of
                   that faith, the depth of love, and the height of their respect will
                   determine their ability to endure. And you may be sure that the
                   saints described in the preceding quotation built up these vir-
                   tues sufficiently to power them through the end. Prayer, Bible
                   study, and Christian service strengthen the soul fiber—
                   rendering the Christian shock resistant. We can and must now
                   hasten the buildup of these inner resources so that when the
                   storm breaks we will be safe.

                     How complete will be the triumph of the saints? Rev. 21:4.

                     "There [the eternal city] the redeemed greet those who led
                   them to the Saviour, and all unite in praising Him who died that
                   human beings might have the life that measures with the life of
                   God. The conflict is over. Tribulation and strife are at an end.
                   Songs of victory fill all heaven as the ransomed ones take up the
                   joyful strain, Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and lives
                   again, a triumphant conqueror."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
                   602.

                       damnation" (John 5:29)? Rev. 20:5.

                         "At the close of the one thousand years, Jesus, with the
                       angels and all the saints, leaves the Holy City, and while He is
                       descending to the earth with them, the wicked dead are raised,
                       and then the very men that 'pierced Him,' being raised, will see
                       Him afar off in all His glory, the angels and saints with Him, and
                       will wail because of Him. They will see the prints of the nails in
                       His hands and in His feet, and where they thrust the spear into
                       His side. The prints of the nails and the spear will then be His
                       glory. It is at the close of the one thousand years that Jesus
                       stands upon the Mount of Olives, and the mount parts asunder
                       and becomes a mighty plain. Those who flee at that time are the
                       wicked, who have just been raised. Then the Holy City comes
                       down and settles on the plain. Satan then imbues the wicked
                       with his spirit. He flatters them that the army in the city is small,
                       and that his army is large, and that they can overcome the saints
                       and take the city."—Early Writings, p. 53.

THINK IT THROUGH         Ponder the everlasting difference in being on the inside of
                       the Holy City looking out, rather than being on the outside of
                       the city looking in!

Life for Death                       LESSON 7                        ❑    Monday
                                                                          May //

          Part 2     What attitude toward death characterizes the Christian?
     NO FEAR IN
     THE VALLEY      "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
                   death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
                   staff they comfort me" (Ps. 23:4).

                      "Every redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels
                   in his own life. The angel who was his guardian from his earliest
                   moment; the angel who watched his steps, and covered his
                   head in the day of peril; the angel who was with him in the valley
                   of the shadow of death, who marked his resting place, who was
                   the first to greet him in the resurrection morning—what will it be
                   to hold converse with him, and to learn the history of divine
                   interposition in the individual life, of heavenly co-operation in
                   every work of humanity!"—Education, p. 305 (Emphasis
                   supplied.)
                      Some Christians view death as the gate to endless life. This
                   view was borrowed from the Egyptians by Pla10. Christians
                   adopted from his writings the doctrine of natural immortality.
                   According to the Bible no part of a human can live on after
                   death. Death is an interruption of life, not a continuation
                   thereof.
                      For the redeemed, therefore, the second coming of Christ
                   assumes fresh significance. (See John 5:28, 29.)

                     How do the wicked regard the prospect of death? Matt. 8:12.

                      The answer to this question depends on the view of God, life,
                   and death that each individual has adopted. Death is really an
                   enemy to both saint and sinner. But hope of life in the hereafter
                   is there to cushion the impact on the Christian. No such bless-
                   ing truly sustains the sinner. In death he faces only the darkness
                   of the abyss. One needs only to read the dying words of Voltaire
                   and Lord Byron to measure the pain of a Christless death.
                   Having lived by the elixir of surface satisfactions, the sinner
                   must content himself with a sunless death.
                      "The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
                        And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
                      Await alike, th' inevitable hour:—
                        The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
                             —Thomas Gray, "Elegy Written in a
                           Country Churchyard."

THINK IT THROUGH     Ponder 1 Corinthians 15:26, 51-55. Death will be a thing of
                   the past!

             Part 3   How will the coming of Christ affect the human administra-
          ENDLESS tion of the nations represented in Nebuchadnezzar's dream?
          KINGDOM
                      "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
                    kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
                    shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and
                    consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever" (Dan.
                    2:44).

                         When God created the world, He made mankind its steward,
                      His vicegerent, subject only to His own direction. When we
                      sinned, a new system of government evolved, with human ad-
                      ministration of national affairs. Even ancient Israel chose to go
                      this way. And so history provides the record of the human
                      experiment in self-government. We have the names of tyrants
                      and benevolent rulers who have brought sorrow and joy to the
                      lives of millions. Historically however, sorrows far outweigh the
                      joys. But the coming of Christ will change all of this. "The
                      kingdom shall not be left to other people." Christ will resume
                      His rightful place as Ruler of the planet.

                        When will this dramatic change be implemented? Eze.
                      21:27.

                         The administration of justice and the overall leadership of
                      men and nations have suffered since the fall of Adam. While
                      ruling over the basic flow of events, God has permitted men and
                      demons to hold sway subject only to His control. But no more.
                      Christ's return to the earth will change all this. He will once
                      again rule this planet, this time unchallenged. "Affliction shall
                      not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).
                         "From the rise and fall of nations as made plain in the pages of
                      Holy Writ, they need to learn how worthless is mere outward and
                      worldly glory. Babylon, with all its power and its magnificence,
                      the like of which our world has never since beheld,—power and
                      magnificence which to the people of that day seemed so stable
                      and enduring,—how completely has it passed away! As 'the
                      flower of the grass' it has perished. So perishes all that has not
                      God for its foundation. Only that which is bound up with His
                      purpose and expresses His character can endure. His principles
                      are the only steadfast things our world knows."—Education, p.
                      183.

                                                                      May 13

          Part 4     What change will be made in our mortal nature at the sec-
       LIKE HIM    ond coming?

                     "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
                   appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
                   appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is"
                   (1 John 3:2). (See also 1 Cor. 15:51-55.)

                      "The earth mightily shook as the voice of the Son of God
                   called forth the sleeping saints. They responded to the call and
                   came forth clothed with glorious immortality, crying, 'Victory,
                   victory, over death and the grave! 0 death, where is thy sting? 0
                   grave, where is thy victory?' Then the living saints and the risen
                   ones raised their voices in a long, transporting shout of victory.
                   Those bodies that had gone down into the grave bearing the
                   marks of disease and death came up in immortal health and
                   vigor. The living saints are changed in a moment, in the twin-
                   kling of an eye, and caught up with the risen ones, and together
                   they meet their Lord in the air. Oh, what a glorious meeting!
                   Friends whom death had separated were united, never more to
                   part."—Early Writings, p. 287.

                    What dramatic reversal of experience will the saints ulti-
                   mately know? Mal. 4:3.

                     Perhaps the supreme tragedy in this reversal is that those who
                   once knew the Lord were enticed away by the evil one. "This
                   class threw themselves into a current of temptation and kept
                   where the enemy led them successfully, and he has so easily
                   controlled their minds and corrupted their entire experience
                   that in all probability they will be unable to recover themselves
                   out of his snare and obtain a healthful exprience.
                     "The fires of the day of God will consume the stubble and
                   chaff, and there will be nothing left of any who continue in the
                   ungodly course which they have so long loved. This class have a

THINK IT THROUGH     What undesirable traits in my character do I need to discard
                   in order to "lay aside every weight"? Or is it a matter of
                   opening the heart door to the heavenly Merchantman? (See

               Part 5     How does the "blessed hope" inspire the believer toward
           PURE AS      purity of life?
         HE IS PURE
                          "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
                        even as he is pure" (1 John 3:3).
                          Not that the believer ever expects to feel pure enough to be
                        worthy of the kingdom, apart from the merits of Jesus, but hope
                        of life in the hereafter improves the quality of life here. By
                        beholding we become like that which claims our attention. To
                        feed on the ashes of earth's depressing scene is to wither and
                        die when living really counts. Spirituality is fed from above.
                        Through prayer and the study of the Word we breathe the sweet
                        atmosphere of heaven. To pursue the hereafter is to enrich our
                        sojourn here!
                          While the Prince of Wales was on a visit to the Midlands, he
                        went into a certain workingman's home. Next day the working
                        man told his mate sadly, "We never expected him. The house
                        was untidy, and I hadn't washed. We shall never forgive our-
                        selves. If we had known that he was coming, we should have
                        been ready for him." Unfortunately, this sad lament will fall from
                        the lips of countless thousands who face One greater than the
                        Prince of Wales—the coming of the King of kings!
                          Eternal fellowship with Christ is the Christian's goal. Will he
                        ever achieve it? Rev. 14:4; 7:4, 9.
                          Who is the present strength of the believer? Isa. 40:31.
                           "Christ is saying to you today: 'I am with you, co-operating
                        with your faithful, trusting efforts, and giving you precious vic-
                        tories. I will strengthen you as you sanctify yourselves to My
                        service. I will give you success in your efforts to arouse souls
                        dead in trespasses and sins.'
                           "Unswerving faith and unselfish love will overcome the dif-
                        ficulties that arise in the path of duty to hinder aggressive
                        warfare. As those inspired by this faith go forward in the work of
                        saving souls, they will run and not be weary, will walk and not
                        faint."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 243.
                           Many obese persons spend their lives worrying about their
                        weight. The bad news that the scales bring daily keeps them in a
                        state of depression. Their time could be better spent on a
                        weight-reduction program. Concentrating less on the scales
                        and more on consistent weight-reducing measures would ac-
                        complish more. To those who have eyes that see and ears that
                        hear, this illustration speaks volumes.

THINK IT THROUGH          Do I desire eternal life because I fear eternal death, or
                        because I love Christ so dearly that I want to live in His
                        presence eternally?

Life for Death                       LESSON 7                            ❑ Friday
                                                                          May 15

          Part 6     What conditions must be met by those expecting to enter
       RIGHT TO    the city?
       THE TREE
         OF LIFE     "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they
                   may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
                   gates into the city" (Rev. 22:14).

                     Sometimes, in this text, the blessing is spoken to those "who
                   wash their robes," (NEB, RSV). Either way, it points to the heart
                   of salvation. He who remembers that His robe is clean only
                   because it has been washed in the precious blood of the Lamb is
                   going to hunger and thirst after the righteousness of Jesus. He
                   pleads that in his own life might be seen wholehearted obedi-
                   ence to the commandments of God by the power of the Holy
                   Spirit. The harmony of grace and righteousness that has always
                   existed in the heart of God will be reflected in the heart of the
                   redeemed believers.

                     Will the church someday enjoy the Holy City? Heb. 11:16.

                                                                               May 17

             Part 1    At the second coming of Christ what will happen to the
       EVERLASTING wicked?
       DESTRUCTION
                       "God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble
                    you and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well.
                    This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven
                    in blazing fire with his powerful angels. He will punish those
                    who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord
                    Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and
                    shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of
                    his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy
                    people and to be marveled at among all those who have
                    believed. This includes you, because you believed our tes-
                    timony to you" (2 Thess. 1:6-10, NIV).

                         "At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face
                      of the whole earth—consumed with the spirit of His mouth and
                      destroyed by the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people
                      to the City of God, and the earth is emptied of its inhabitants."—
                      The Great Controversy, p. 657.
                         The wicked have slighted 6000 years of grace dispensed at
                      infinite cost. They have caused the persecution of preachers,
                      prophets, and messengers of God. And finally the greatest price
                      of all was paid in the death of the only-begotten Son of God. So
                      that in a real sense they deserve their fate. God has, beyond all
                      this, surrounded us with those support systems that sustain life.
                      And, though scarred by 6000 years of abuse, this planet has
                      retained much in nature that would gladden the eye and rejoice
                      the heart. The sinner literally has to blind himself to the mercies
                      of God in order to put himself in the path of God's wrath. He has
                      to hurdle obstacle after obstacle, each a reminder of the Mas-
                      ter's love, to reach the fiery judgments of Jehovah.

                        How is the ultimate triumph of the redeemed over death
                      portrayed by the apostle Paul? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

                        The glory of the translation of the saints succeeds the mid-
                      night of persecution and sorrow. All affection for this world will
                      be ironed out of us by God's permitted affliction. Indeed, that is
                      the purpose of it. The fires of affliction will burn fiercest just
                      before the dawn of the second coming. We will be brought to
                      long for Him as "the hart panteth after the water brooks" (Ps.
                      42:1).

THINK IT THROUGH         In the parable, the wheat and the tares were to grow to-
                      gether until the harvest. Is there anything still in or about my
                      life that will cause me to be among the tares rather than the
                      wheat at Christ's appearing? (See Matt. 13:30, 40.)

                                                                       May 18

         Part 2      What will the righteous do in heaven?
     KINGS AND
       PRIESTS        "I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
                   given unto them."
                      "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrec-
                   tion: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall
                   be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a
                   thousand years" (Rev. 20:4, 6). (Compare with 1 Cor. 6:2, 3.)

                     "After the saints are changed to immortality and caught up
                   together with Jesus, after they receive their harps, their robes,
                   and their crowns, and enter the city, Jesus and the saints sit in
                   judgment. The books are opened—the book of life and the book
                   of death. The book of life contains the good deeds of the saints;
                   and the book of death contains the evil deeds of the wicked.
                   These books are compared with the statute book, the Bible, and
                   according to that men are judged. The saints, in unison with
                   Jesus, pass their judgment upon the wicked dead. . . . This, I
                   saw, was the work of the saints with Jesus through the one
                   thousand years in the Holy City before it descends to the
                   earth."—Early Writings, pp. 52, 53.

                     How long will they remain there? Rev. 20:2, 6.

                     "The saints will rest in the Holy City and reign as kings and
                   priests one thousand years; then Jesus will descend with the
                   saints upon the Mount of Olives, and the mount will part asun-
                   der and become a mighty plain for the Paradise of God to rest
                   upon. The rest of the earth will not be cleansed until the end of
                   the one thousand years, when the wicked dead are raised, and
                   gather up around the city."—Early Writings, pp. 51, 52.

                     At this same time, what will be the condition of the earth?
                   Jer. 4:23-26.

                     For 1000 years the earth will lie desolate. This time period is
                   bound by the second coming of Christ at the beginning and the
                   descent of the New Jerusalem at the end. During this time the
                   saints are in heaven, and the wicked are dead on the earth.
                   Contrary to popular thought, there will be no preaching to or
                   conversion of the Jewish nation at this time. All conversions will
                   take place before the millennium. For when the millennium
                   begins, destinies will have been fixed.

THINK IT THROUGH      What have I done today to ensure that my destiny will be
                   fixed for eternal life and not for everlasting destruction, when
                   the books in heaven are closed? (See 1 Tim. 5:24.)

              Part 3   Under the symbol of the king of Babylon, what ambition is
           JEALOUS attributed to Lucifer, son of the morning?
         "CREATOR"
                       "How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the
                     morning! ... For thou hast said in thine heart, ... I will be like
                     the most High" (Isa. 14:12-14).

                         If Lucifer aspired to be like the Most High, he would undoubt-
                      edly covet creative power. The creation of this world and of man
                      could have coincided in some measure with Lucifer's rebellion
                      in heaven.
                         "Especially was His [God's] Son to work in union with Himself
                      in the anticipated creation of the earth and every living thing
                      that should exist upon the earth. His Son would carry out His will
                      and His purposes but would do nothing of Himself alone. The
                      Father's will would be fulfilled in Him.
                         "Lucifer was envious and jealous of Jesus Christ."—The
                      Story of Redemption, pp. 13, 14.

                        With 1000 years to prove his credentials as a creator, how
                      does Lucifer (Satan) perform?

                         The original sin was related to the desire of Lucifer to be
                      consulted in the creation of mankind and the earth. Instead,
                      however, Christ was invited into council with the Father in the
                      planning of this creative act. Lucifer's heart was filled with
                      jealous but carefully controlled rage, and he went about in-
                      sinuating against the government of God with such effective-
                      ness that many of the angels in heaven accepted his story.
                         Now Lucifer was the highest of all created beings, but the fact
                      that he was created indicated that he did not have creative
                      power. (See Eze. 28:15.) He rebelled against his limitations and
                      was cast out into the earth.
                         During the millennium he could have 1000 years to demon-
                      strate any creative power. But, alas, at the end of the 1000 years
                      he will not, in all of this time, have created a single living flower.
                      His credibility, in this and all respects, will have been destroyed.
                      He must divert the attention of his angel followers away from
                      himself. The arrival of the City of God at the end of the 1000
                      years provides him with this opportunity. He inspires a sense-
                      less attack against the saints in the City. Fire comes down from
                      God out of heaven and destroys all the wicked—angels and
                      people.

THINK IT THROUGH        Whatever is left of the world's coveted oil will add to the fires
                      for destroying the wicked and cleansing the earth. (See

          Part 4   What unparalleled event will signal the close of the millen-
      THE BRIDE nium?
       ADORNED
                   "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
                 God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her hus-
                 band" (Rev. 21:2). (See also Rev. 20:9; 21:10.)

                     "After the judgment of the wicked dead had been finished, at
                   the end of the one thousand years, Jesus left the city, and the
                   saints and a train of the angelic host followed Him. Jesus de-
                   scended upon a great mountain, which as soon as His feet
                   touched it, parted asunder and became a mighty plain. Then we
                   looked up and saw the great and beautiful city, with twelve
                   foundations, and twelve gates, three on each side, and an angel
                   at each gate. We cried out, 'The city! the great city! it is coming
                   down from God out of heaven!' And it came down in all its
                   splendor and dazzling glory and settled in the mighty plain
                   which Jesus had prepared for it."—Early Writings, p. 291.

                    What possible clue does the Bible present as to where the
                   Holy City will rest? Zech. 14:4, 9.

                      Whereas the prophecy of Zechariah 14 might have had an
                   earlier fulfillment at Christ's first advent, had Israel been faithful
                   to God, it now remains for the New Jerusalem to occupy the plain
                   yet to be formed in the midst of the Mount of Olives.
                      "Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of the
                   city. There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance
                   of silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls most glorious
                   to behold. These were to be inhabited by the saints. In each was
                   a golden shelf. I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take
                   off their glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out
                   into the field by the houses to do something with the earth; not
                   as we have to do with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light
                   shone all about their heads, and they were continually shouting
                   and offering praises to God."—Early Writings, p. 18.

                   to desire eternal life, what will? "Oh, what a beautiful city!"

             Part 5     At the close of the millennium, what events turn the Holy
            "CAMP     City into the "camp of the saints" for a time?
            OF THE
           SAINTS"       "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
                      years were finished."
                         "And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and com-
                      passed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and
                      fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
                      And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
                      and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and
                      shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever" (Rev. 20:5,
                      9, 10).

                         "At the first resurrection all come forth in immortal bloom, but
                      at the second, the marks of the curse are visible upon all. All
                      come up as they went down into their graves. Those who lived
                      before the Flood, come forth with their giantlike stature, more
                      than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth, and well
                      proportioned. The generations after the Flood were less in sta-
                      ture....
                         ". . Although the whole earth, with the exception of that
                      portion where the city rests, will be wrapped in a sea of liquid
                      fire, yet the city is preserved as was the ark, by a miracle of
                      Almighty power. It stands unharmed amid the devouring
                      elements."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-

                        Describe the final judgment. Rev. 20:13.

                        A merciful God will not destroy until the nature of sin is fully
                      revealed. Men and angels, fallen and unfallen, will get a final
                      lesson before the great white throne. From that time, iniquity
                      will no longer be a mystery. Sin will stand revealed for what it
                      really is—rebellion against the Creator. Opposition without rea-
                      son, rebellion without cause, high treason against the govern-
                      ment of God—this is sin. The reasonableness of hell will at that
                      time be nondebatable. Saint and sinner, human and celestial,
                      will understand the necessity of the final solution.
                         "As soon as,the books of record are opened, and the eye of
                      Jesus looks upon the wicked, they are conscious of every sin
                      which they have ever committed. They see just where their feet
                      diverged from the path of purity and holiness, just how far pride
                      and rebellion have carried them in the violation of the law of
                      God."—The Great Controversy, p. 666.

One Thousand Years-Of What?             LESSON 8                       ❑ Friday
                                                                         May 22

          Part 6   What is the fate of wicked men who failed to accept Christ's
       "NEITHER salvation?
      ROOT NOR
       BRANCH"     "Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all
                 the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and
                 the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of
                 hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch" (Mal.
                 4:1).

                      Here in detail is the consequence of not believing the gospel,
                   as Christ explained the matter to Nicodemus (John 3:16-18).
                      "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years
                   he has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe and causing
                   grief throughout the universe. The whole creation has groaned
                   and travailed together in pain. Now God's creatures are forever
                   delivered from his presence and temptations. 'The whole earth
                   is at rest, and is quiet: they [the righteous] break forth into
                   singing.' Isaiah 14:7....
                      "While the earth was wrapped in the fire of destruction, the
                   righteous abode safely in the Holy City. Upon those that had part
                   in the first resurrection, the second death has no power. While
                   God is to the wicked a consuming fire, He is to His people both a
                   sun and a shield. Revelation 20:6; Psalm 84:11."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 673.

                    What produces the "utter end" of devils, death, and hell?
                   Rev. 20:10, 14, 15.

                     " 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
                   the first earth were passed away.' Revelation 21:1. The fire that
                   consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of-the curse
                   is swept away. No eternally burning hell will keep before the
                   ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.
                      "One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear
                   the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His
                   side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the Cruel work
                   that sin has wrought. Says the prophet, beholding Christ in His
                   glory: 'He had bright beams coming out of His side: and there
                   was the hiding of His power.' Habakkuk 3:4, margin. That
                   pierced side whence flowed the crimson stream that reconciled
                   man to God—there is the Saviour's glory, there 'the hiding of His
                   power.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 674.

                         "Divine pity marked the countenance of the Son of God as He
                      cast one lingering look upon the temple and then upon His

          Part 2     How does the apostle Peter characterize the divine at-
      THE LONG- titude toward sinners?
      SUFFERING
           GOD     "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
                 count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
                 that any should perish, but that all should come to repen-
                 tance" (2 Peter 3:9).

                      "I hope and pray that you may walk in all lowliness of mind,
                    that you may be a blessing to one another. 'Yet a little while, and
                    He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.' The bridal
                    lamps must be kept trimmed and burning. Our Lord delays
                    because of His long-suffering to usward, 'not willing that any
                    should perish, but that all should come to repentance.' But
                    when we, with all the redeemed, shall stand upon the sea of
                    glass, with harps of gold and crowns of glory, and before us the
                    immensity of eternity, then we shall see how short was the
                    waiting period of probation. 'Blessed are those servants, whom

                      What is in the nature of sin that decrees its own destruction?
                    James 1:15; Rom. 6:23.

                       By nature, sin is anti-God. It is contrary to the nature of God. It
                    is a cancer in the universe that must be cut out. If left alone, it
                    would both contaminate and destroy. Left to natural results, sin
                    would have destroyed itself and its victims long ago. But God
                    intervened in mercy in order to rescue all who would accept His
                    gift of salvation. However, God's mercy has limits. Justice still
                    demands the eradication of sin. The cost to heaven and earth is
                    high. God will put an end to sin, sinners, and sin's wages. And
                    when He does, the on-looking universe will declare Him just.
                        "By this law, which governs angels, which demands purity in
                    the most secret thoughts, desires, and dispositions, and which
                    shall 'stand fast for ever' (Ps. 111:8), all the world is to be judged
                    in the rapidly approaching day of God. Transgressors may flat-
                    ter themselves that the Most High does not know, that the
                    Almighty does not consider; He will not always bear with them.
                     Soon they will receive the reward of their doings, the death that
                     is the wages of sin; while the righteous nations, that have kept
                     the law, will be ushered through the pearly gates of the celestial
                     city, and will be crowned with immortal life and joy in the
                     presence of God and the Lamb."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p.

             Part 3      Since we live in a moral universe, what does this require of
              GIVE     us in terms of justice?
        ACCOUNT OF
          YOURSELF       "Every one of us shall give account of himself to God" (Rom.
                       14:12). (Compare Eccl. 12:13, 14.)

                          "In matters of conscience the soul must be left untrammeled.
                        No one is to control another's mind, to judge for another, or to
                       prescribe his duty. God gives to every soul freedom to think, and
                       to follow his own convictions. 'Every one of us shall give ac-
                       count of himself to God.' No one has a right to merge his own
                       individuality in that of another. In all matters where principle is
                       involved, 'let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.'
                       Rom. 14:12, 5. In Christ's kingdom there is no lordly oppression,
                      . no compulsion of manner. The angels of heaven do not come to
                       the earth to rule, and to exact homage, but as messengers of
                       mercy, to co-operate with men in uplifting humanity."—The
                       Desire of Ages, pp. 550, 551.

                       What ultimately is at stake in this controversy between
                      Christ and Satan? Isa. 44:6, 7; Eze. 28:6, 7.

                         The claims to Deity are brought close to us in the claims of the
                      God-Man, Jesus Christ. His contemporaries recognized the
                      weight of His claims in a measure when they accused Him of
                      blasphemy. His claims were confirmed in His rising from the
                      dead.
                         "Over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Christ had proclaimed in
                      triumph, 'I am the resurrection, and the life.' These words could
                      be spoken only by the Deity. All created beings live by the will
                      and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of
                      God. From the highest seraph to the humblest animate being,
                      all are replenished from the Source of life. Only He who is one
                      with God could say, I have power to lay down My life, and I have
                      power to take it again."—The Desire of Ages, p. 785.
                         The allegiance of mankind and angels was at stake in the
                      challenge to the character and law of God. If the law and its
                      claims were left unsatisfied, the issue of sin would forever re-
                      main unsettled. And the longer this was undecided, the longer
                      the spreading rebellion was multiplied. In taking our place be-
                      fore God, Christ bore in His own body the curse of the law for us.
                      This places us on vantage ground. Such love draws us to God.
                      Angels touch their harps in rapture at the divine impulse. Who
                      wouldn't serve a God like this?

THINK IT THROUGH        Ponder the awful outcome for the human beings on this
                      planet had not Christ died for them. Then for reassurance read
                      or recite John 3:16.

Divine Justice—With Love        LESSON 9                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     May 27

          Part 4   What is Satan's immediate objective in pressing the rebel-
          YOUR lion against the government of God?
     ADVERSARY
      THE DEVIL    "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
                 a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour"
                 (1 Peter 5:8). (Compare Rev. 12:12.)

                      Like the proverbial dog in a manger, Lucifer does not really
                   want heaven; but he does not want us to have it either. He seeks
                   to wound Christ by wounding the church.
                      "Satan . . . [after Christ's ascension] counseled with his
                   angels, and with bitter hatred against God's government told
                   them that while he retained his power and authority upon earth
                   their efforts must be tenfold stronger against the followers of
                   Jesus. . . . He related to his angels that Jesus had given His
                   disciples power to rebuke them and cast them out, and to heal
                   those whom they should afflict. Then Satan's angels went forth
                   like roaring lions, seeking to destroy the followers of Jesus."—
                   Early Writings, pp. 191, 192.

                     What is God's final answer, in His overall plan, to the rebels
                   against His government? Isa. 66:15, 16.

                     It.must be remembered that man chooses his own destiny. He
                   may despise the salvation so freely offered and literally cast
                   himself into hell. The restraints of heaven have been deliber-
                   ately cast aside, and the transgressor has chosen his own hard
                   way. There is no joy in heaven over the death of the wicked.
                   Christ is not willing that any should perish, but that all should
                   come to repentance.
                     "The feet of the wicked will never desecrate the earth made
                   new. Fire will come down from God out of heaven and devour
                   them—burn them up root and branch. Satan is the root, and his
                   children are the branches. The same fire that will devour the
                   wicked will purify the earth."—Early Writings, pp. 51, 52.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why will so many be lost in spite of the fact that Christ died
                   to save sinners? How can I know I have been covered and
                   cleansed by the blood of Jesus? (Study John 15:1-14 and The

Divine Justice-With Love               LESSON 9                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                              May 28

               Part 5     As indicated in the introduction to this week's lesson, no
         DESTROYED      other teaching within the Christian church has made more
          "IN HELL"     enemies for God than the teaching of an eternally burning hell.
                        No other teaching has made it harder to accept that divine
                        justice is with love. In spite of some Bible texts that would seem
                        to support a continuing punishing of the impenitent, there are
                        clear statements of the total destruction of the wicked. The gift
                        of God to the wicked is not eternal life—neither "in hell" nor
                        anywhere else!

                          What is one of the clearest statements of the concept given
                        above?

                          "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
                        soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and
                        body in hell" (Matt. 10:28). (Compare also Rev. 20:13-15; Mal.
                        4:1.)

                           "Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is
                        broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn
                        forth. Devouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The
                        very rocks are on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an
                        oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and
                        the works that are therein are burned up. Malachi 4:1; 2 Peter
                        3:10. The earth's surface seems one molten mass—a vast,
                        seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and perdition
                        of ungodly men—' the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year
                        of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.' Isaiah 34:8."—The
                        Great Controversy, pp. 672, 673.
                           To complete the picture of events at the close of the millen-
                        nium, we note the preservation of the "camp of the saints" and
                        the cleansing of the earth:
                           "While the earth was wrapped in the fire of destruction, the
                        righteous abode safely in the Holy City. Upon those that had part
                        in the first resurrection, the second death has no power. While
                        God is to the wicked a consuming fire, He is to His people both a
                        sun and a shield. Revelation 20:6; Psalm 84:11."—The Great
                        Controversy, p. 673.

                          According to Peter, what kind of power will God release in
                        "the day of the Lord"? 2 Peter 3:10, 11.

THINK IT THROUGH         Read Proverbs 1:26 and Psalm 2:4. How should we har-
                        monize these two texts with the thought in Ezekiel 33:11?

Divine Justice-With Love         LESSON 9                                ❑ Friday
                                                                            May 29

          Part 6     There are a number of reasons why God has not closed the
    "PRISONERS     account of the human race already, why time lingers. One of the
      OF HOPE"     chief of these is His great yearning for the souls of men—as
                   when Christ wept over His rejection by Jerusalem.

                     What earnest appeal from the heart of love is conveyed
                   through Zechariah?

                     "Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to
                   day do I declare that I will render double unto thee" (Zech.
                   9:12).

                     "We are to reveal to the universe, to the world fallen and to the
                   worlds unfallen, that there is forgiveness with God, that through
                   the love of God we may be reconciled to God. Man repents,
                   becomes contrite in heart, believes in Christ as His atoning
                   sacrifice, and realizes that God is reconciled to him.
                     "We should cherish gratitude of heart all the days of our life
                   because the Lord has put on record these words: 'For thus saith
                   the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is
                   Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
                   contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and
                   to revive the heart of the contrite ones.' The reconciliation of
                   God to man, and man to God, is sure when certain conditions
                   are met."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 370.

                     Under the personification of "wisdom," how does the wise
                   man point out the reasons for the eternal loss of many in spite
                   of God's loving appeals? Prov. 1:23-27.

                      "If the sinner still refuses to heed the voice of mercy which
                   calls after him with tender, pitying love, his soul will be left in
                   darkness. If he neglects the opportunity presented him, and
                   goes on in his evil course, the wrath of God will, in an unex-
                   pected moment, break forth upon him. 'He, that being often
                   reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and
                   that without remedy.' ... The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
                   wisdom. It lies at the foundation of a proper education. Those
                   who, having a favorable opportunity, have failed to learn this
                   first great lesson, are not only disqualified for service in the
                   cause of God, but are a positive injury to the community in
                   which they live."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 208.

THINK IT THROUGH     Since it is unnecessary that anyone be lost, why put off any
                   longer being assured that we are Christ's?

    Ita The New Creation
        "Behold, I create new heavens and a    a view of the New Jerusalem that is
     new earth: and the former shall not be    marvelous in its vivid portrayal. Ellen
     remembered, nor come into mind"           White was given a view of other

                                                                         May 31

          Part 1   In preparation for the new creation, what steps does the
     EVERLASTING Lord take to cleanse the earth of every trace of sin (and
     DESTRUCTION sinners)?

                     "In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
                   God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
                   who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
                   presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power" (2 Thess.
                   1:8, 9).
                     "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
                   which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
                   elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
                   works that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10).

                      "The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. Proverbs
                   11:31. They 'shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn
                   them up, saith the Lord of hosts.' Malachi 4:1. Some are de-
                   stroyed as in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are
                   punished 'according to their deeds.' The sins of the righteous
                   having been transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only
                   for his own rebellion, but for all the sins which he has caused
                   God's people to commit.... After all have perished who fell by
                   his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. In the cleansing
                   flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and branch—Satan
                   the root, his followers the branches. The full penalty of the law
                   has been visited; the demands of justice have been met; and
                   heaven and earth, beholding, declare the righteousness of
                   Jehovah."—The Great Controversy, p. 673.

                     What act of creation will Christ then perform? Isa. 65:17.

                      "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of
                   God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tire-
                   less flight to worlds afar—worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the
                   spectacle of human woe and rang with songs of gladness at the
                   tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the chil-
                   dren of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen
                   beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understand-
                   ing gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God's
                   handiwork. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of
                   creation—suns and stars and systems, all in their appointed
                   order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all things, from the least
                   to the greatest, the Creator's name is written, and in all are the
                   riches of His power displayed."—The Great Controversy, pp.
                   677, 678.

THINK IT THROUGH     Can we ever comprehend in its fullness what it will mean to
                   "mount up with wings as eagles"? (Isa. 40:31).

         Part 2   How will the animal world relate to mankind in the new
     ORDER AND earth?
      HARMONY
                  "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion
                shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's
                meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
                saith the Lord" (Isa. 65:25).

                     Early in her experience, Ellen White saw in vision what had
                   been forseen by Isaiah the prophet: "Then we entered a field full
                   of all kinds of beasts—the lion, the lamb, the leopard, and the
                   wolf, all together in perfect union. We passed through the midst
                   of them, and they followed on peaceably after."—Early Writ-
                   ings, p. 18.

                     Will there be rental housing units in the new earth? Isa.
                   65:21, 22.

                      "In the earth made new the redeemed will engage in the
                   occupations and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam
                   and Eve in the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in
                   garden and field."—The Adventist Home, p. 549.
                      Thousands live in substandard housing. Falling plaster,
                   creaking staircases, rat holes, faulty plumbing, and filth on filth
                   is the daily lot of the urban poor. Absentee landlords who flout
                   city housing codes are the rule, not the exception. In fact, seven
                   to ten occupants in a single room is not unusual in some ghetto
                   areas. Thousands grow up whose values are alien to the na-
                   tional consensus. In some great cities of the earth millions are
                   born, live, and die upon the streets. No place is home. The high
                   crime rate in the cities is no mystery to the social worker. Behind
                   the facade of prosperity in some sections there are the areas of
                   internal rot that make life for millions a matter of day-to-day
                   survival.
                      To all these the promise of a new world where all will partake
                   of the horn of plenty must have a strong appeal. Hope is fed by
                   the promise of better days ahead. But even this, the glory of the
                   world to come, is pale when compared with the prospect of
                   eternal fellowship with our Maker and Redeemer.

THINK IT THROUGH     There will be, we are told, no lazy or idle among the re-
                   deemed in the new earth, according to Isaiah 65:21-23. Since
                   earth is the preparation place as it were, how can I possibly
                   entertain idleness in my daily life here and now?

              Part 3   How does the prophet Isaiah indicate the end of all our
             EVERY- troubles once heaven becomes our home?
            THING'S
             RIGHT!    "They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for
                     they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their off-
                     spring with them" (Isa. 65:23).

                         "The Bible does not acknowledge a believer who is idle,
                      however high his profession may be. There will be employment
                      in heaven. The redeemed state is not one of idle repose. There
                      remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God, but it is a rest
                      found in loving service."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                      Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1164.

                        What is the apostle John's parallel assessment of the new
                      creation? Rev. 21:4.

                        "There are homes for the pilgrims of earth. There are robes
                      for the righteous, with crowns of glory and palms of victory. All
                      that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world
                      to come be made plain. The things hard to be understood will
                      then find explanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before
                      us. Where our finite minds discovered only confusion and bro-
                      ken promises, we shall see the most perfect and beautiful
                      harmony."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 286.

                        What promise for the handicapped that found only a mea-
                      sure of fulfillment at Christ's first advent is assured to us at the
                      second? Isa. 35:5, 6.

                         "The earth promised to the meek will not be like this, dark-
                      ened with the shadow of death and the curse. 'We, according to
                      His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
                      dwelleth righteousness.' 2 Peter 3:13. . . .
                         "There is no disappointment, no sorrow, no sin, no one who
                      shall say, I am sick; there are no burial trains, no mourning, no
                      death, no partings, no broken hearts; but Jesus is there, peace
                      is there."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 17.

                      whom have suffered severe affliction and endured many
                      handicaps in this life, able to walk, run, and even fly, with no

                                                                        June 3

           Part 4    Large areas of this earth are desert. How will it be in the new
       POOLS ON earth, in Eden restored?
        PARCHED
         GROUND      "The parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
                  land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
                  each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. And an high-
                  way shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of
                  holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for
                  those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein"
                  (Isa. 35:7, 8).

                     In the simpler language of her earliest testimonies, Ellen
                   White painted a similar picture of the earth made new:
                     "I saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked
                   them, I cried out: 'They will never fade.' Next I saw a field of tall
                   grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green, and had a
                   reflection of silver and gold, as it waved proudly to the glory of
                   King Jesus."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 68.
                     The Lord intends for His children to be interested in and eager
                   for the beauties and glories of the better world, else He would
                   not have given us as much colorful language in describing its
                   realities. Yet we must ever recognize that human language
                   cannot do justice to the realities of heaven and the new earth.
                   We borrow words from Paul, who wrote primarily of the glories
                   of God's saving grace when he declared: "Eye hath not seen,
                   nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
                   things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Cor.
                   2:9).
                     Not only is the present world marred by the corroding, cor-
                   rupting forces of sin, but our capacity to appreciate the glory
                   that remains is limited by our close contact with sin. So no
                   matter who dreams of that better land, reality will infinitely
                   exceed his dreams.

                      What basic change will occur in the human attitude? Isa.
                    35:10.

                      "Our Saviour claims all there is of us; He asks our first and
                    holiest thoughts, our purest and most intense affection. If we
                    are indeed partakers of the divine nature, His praise will be
                    continually in our hearts and upon our lips. Our only safety is to
                    surrender our all to Him and to be constantly growing in grace
                    and in the knowledge of the truth."—The Sanctified Life, p. 95.

THINK IT THROUGH      No sacrifice is too great to make; no sin is too sweet to
                    cherish; no time is any better than now to prepare to meet our
                    God.

            Part 5   War has plagued the human family since the advent of sin.
        STUDY WAR In Isaiah's prophecies of an Israel open to her Messiah, what
          NO MORE promises of perpetual peace remain to be fulfilled by "the
                   church" of all ages in the Promised Land?

                       "He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
                     people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
                     their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
                     against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" (Isa.
                     2:4).
                        Heaven will provide a homecoming that is beyond imagina-
                     tion. So many surprises of God's providence will then be made
                     known. Souls redeemed will greet those who, perhaps all-
                     unknown now, were the instruments of God for their salvation.
                     Tumult and strife are gone forever. Eternal peace reigns. Men
                     and angels will, in genuine ecstasy, unite voices and instru-
                     ments in harmonies of praise to the Redeemer. "Worthy, worthy
                     is the Lamb that was slain"!

                       Who will be the permanent Ruler of the new order? Dan.
                     2:44; Rev. 11:15.
                       "About His coming cluster the glories of that 'restitution of all
                     things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy
                     prophets since the world began.' Acts 3:21. Then the long-
                     continued rule of evil shall be broken; 'the kingdoms of this
                     world' will become 'the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ;
                     and He shall reign for ever and ever.' Revelation 11:15. 'The
                     glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
                     together.' The Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to
                     spring forth before all the nations.' He shall be 'for a crown of
                     glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of His
                     people.' Isaiah 40:5; 61:11; 28:5.

      KINGS AND neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and
        QUEENS they shall reign for ever and ever" (Rev. 22:5). (Compare 20:6.)

                      In the words of the Scriptures and of Ellen White, the royal
                   status of the redeemed is persistently affirmed. Who can begin
                   to comprehend the privileges of sharing the throne and gov-
                   ernment of heaven?
                      " 'These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He
                   goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first
                   fruits unto God and to the Lamb.' Revelation 14:4. The vision of
                   the prophet pictures them as standing on Mount Zion, girt for
                   holy service, clothed in white linen, which is the righteousness
                   of the saints. But all who follow the Lamb in heaven must first
                   have followed Him on earth, not fretfully or capriciously, but in
                   trustful, loving, willing obedience, as the flock follows the
                   shepherd."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 591.

                     How does Ellen White picture the triumphant church?

                      "Now the decisions of earth are reversed. 'The rebuke of His
                   people shall he take away.' Isaiah 25:8. 'They shall call them,
                   The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord.' He hath appointed
                   `to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
                   the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.' Isaiah 62:12;
                   61:3. They are no longer feeble, afflicted, scattered, and op-
                   pressed. Henceforth they are to be ever with the Lord. They
                   stand before the throne clad in richer robes than the most
                   honored of the earth have ever worn. They are crowned with
                   diadems more glorious than were ever placed upon the brow of
                   earthly monarchs. The days of pain and weeping are forever
                   ended. The King of glory has wiped the tears from all faces;
                   every cause of grief has been removed. Amid the waving of palm.
                   branches they pour forth a song of praise, clear, sweet, and
                   harmonious; every voice takes up the strain, until the anthem
                   swells through the vaults of heaven: 'Salvation to our God
                   which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.' And all the
                   inhabitants of heaven respond in the ascription: 'Amen: Bless-
                   ing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and

          OF LIFE
                      "Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
                    that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
                    also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of
                    good and evil" (Gen. 2:9).

                      "The tree of life is a representation of the preserving care of
                    Christ for His children. As Adam and Eve ate of this tree, they
                    acknowledged their dependence upon God. The tree of life
                    possessed the power to perpetuate life, and as long as they ate
                    of it, they could not die. The lives of the antediluvians were
                    protracted because of the life-giving power of this tree, which
                    was transmitted to them from Adam and Eve."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 988.

                      On what condition would the race forfeit immortality? Gen.
                    2:17.

                       "Christ never planted the seeds of death in the system. Satan
                    planted these seeds when he tempted Adam to eat of the tree of
                    knowledge which meant disobedience to God."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1082.
                       Death is the sure result of sin. God made us, under conditions,
                    to live forever. He built into nature all of the support systems.
                    This was true of human beings. Had we remained true to God,
                    we could have received immortality. But the intruder entered
                    and succeeded all too well in alienating us from our Maker.
                      New words entered the human vocabulary. Death, graveyard,
                    sickness, and pain became household words. But more seri-
                    ously they mirror the human experience, trapped in the sin
                    experiment.
                      The residual effects of our parents' eating the fruit of the tree
                    of life are obviously running thin. Six thousand years of attrition
                    have literally "done us in." By prayer, the study of the Bible, and
                    Christian service we may replenish our spiritual resources; but
                    our bodies are locked into a descending scale until the resur-
                    rection morning, when "this corruptible" puts on incorruption
                    and "this mortal" puts on immortality.

THINK IT THROUGH      Through the first Adam, sin came into the world. Through
                    the second Adam, sin is eradicated from the universe. (See

         Part 2       By what related acts did the first pair stray from the divine
           LIFE     plan for their lives?
   COMPROMISED
                      "The Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
                    hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me,
                    and I did eat." "Unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hear-
                    kened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of
                    which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it:
                    cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it
                    all the days of thy life" (Gen. 3:13, 17).

                        Satan convinced Eve that God had withheld something good.
                    If the fruit of the tree was good for food, why should she not have
                    some? Eve was led to distrust God. This is fatal to anyone.
                    Intellectual distrust led to emotional imbalance. Eve had lost
                    her protection against deception. The act that would plunge the
                    world into misery was thus assured.
                        Adam, however, made a clear choice between life and death.
                    He chose death, and it has been passed on to all of his descen-
                    dants.
                        "She [Eve] then plucked for herself of the fruit and ate, and
                    imagined she felt the quickening power of a new and elevated
                    existence as the result of the exhilarating influence of the for-
                    bidden fruit. She was in a strange and unnatural excitement as
                     she sought her husband with her hands filled with the forbidden
                     fruit. She related to him the wise discourse of the serpent and
                     wished to conduct him at once to the tree of knowledge. She
                     told him she had eaten of the fruit, and instead of her feeling any
                     sense of death, she realized a pleasing, exhilarating influence.
                     As soon as Eve had disobeyed she became a powerful medium
                     through which to occasion the fall of her husband."—The Story
                    of Redemption, pp. 35, 36.

                      What precautions did God take to prevent the race from
                    becoming immortal sinners? Gen. 3:22-24.

                      "Angels were commissioned to immediately guard the way of
                    the tree of life. It was Satan's studied plan that Adam and Eve
                    should disobey God, receive His frown, and then partake of the
                    tree of life, that they might perpetuate a life of sin. But holy
                    angels were sent to debar their way to the tree of life. Around
                    these angels flashed beams of light on every side, which had the
                    appearance of glittering swords."—The Story of Redemption, p.

         AND DEATH
                         "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
                       very day his thoughts perish" (Ps. 146:4).
                         "The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
                       any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the mem-
                       ory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and
                       their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a
                       portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun" (Eccl.
                       9:5, 6).
                          In the final conflict of the remnant church with the forces of
                       darkness, the entire issue of the nature of the human family will
                       be for some as traumatic as the issue of the Sabbath day. "Upon
                       the fundamental error of natural immortality rests the doctrine
                       of consciousness in death—a doctrine, like eternal torment,
                       opposed to the teachings of the Scriptures, to the dictates of
                       reason, and to our feelings of humanity. According to the popu-
                       lar belief, the redeemed in heaven are acquainted with all that
                       takes place on the earth and especially with the lives of the
                       friends whom they have left behind. But how could it be a
                       source of happiness to the dead to know the troubles of the
                       living, to witness the sins committed by their own loved ones,
                       and to see them enduring all the sorrows, disappointments, and
                       anguish of life? How much of heaven's bliss would be enjoyed
                       by those who were hovering over their friends on earth?"—The
                       Great Controversy, p. 545.

                         What ringing declaration by Christ permits the dying to look
                       forward to life after death? John 5:28, 29.
                          "Christ declared to His hearers that if there were no resurrec-
                       tion of the dead, the Scriptures which they professed to believe
                       would be of no avail.... God counts the things that are not as
                       though they were. He sees the end from the beginning, and
                       beholds the result of His work as though it were now ac-

                       saint who dies, will hear the voice of the Son of God, and will
                       come forth from the grave to immortal life. God will be their
                       God, and they shall be His people. There will be a close and
                       tender relationship between God and the risen saints. This
                       condition, which is anticipated in His purpose, He beholds as if
                       it were already existing. The dead live unto Him."—The Desire

           Part 4    What change of nature may the redeemed church expect at
      DEATH AND     Christ's return?
        VICTORY
                      "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
                    shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
                    the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
                    be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this
                    corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
                    on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on
                    incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
                    then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death
                    is swallowed up in victory" (1 Cor. 15:51-54).

                      The most persistent problem of life—the problem of death—
                    will have its answer in the resurrection and translation of the
                    saints. "Jesus is coming, but not as at His first advent, a babe in
                    Bethlehem; not as He rode into Jerusalem, when the disciples
                    praised god with a loud voice and cried, 'Hosanna'; but in the
                    glory of the Father and with all the retinue of holy angels to
                    escort Him on His way to earth.... Then only those who are holy,
                    those who have followed fully the meek Pattern, will with rap-
                    turous joy exclaim as they behold Him, `Lo, this is our God; we
                    have waited for Him, and He will save us.' And they will be
                    changed 'in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
                    trump.' "—Early Writings, p. 110.

                       What solution does the universal search for human longev-
                    ity find in this after-life? Luke 20:35, 36; John 11:26.

                      "The last thing they [the redeemed] acknowledged was the
                    pangs of death. When they awake the pain is all gone.. .
                      "Here they stand, and the finishing touch of immortality is put
                    upon them, and they go up to meet their Lord in the air. The
                    gates of the city of God swing back upon their hinges, and the
                    nations that have kept the truth enter in. There are the columns
                    of angels on either side, and the ransomed of God walk in
                    through the cherubims and seraphims. Christ bids them wel-
                    come and puts upon them His benediction. 'Well done, thou
                    good and faithful servant: ... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'
                    What is that joy? He sees of the travail of His soul, and is

             Part 5      Who alone has immortality now by nature and by right?
       IMMORTALITY
         BESTOWED       "Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and
                      only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only
                      hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can ap-
                      proach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom
                      be honour and power everlasting. Amen" (1 Tim. 6:15, 16).

                         In demonstration of the truth that only God now has immortal-
                      ity, Christ made a challenging claim when He was here on earth
                      as man: " 'I am the resurrection and the life.' This language can
                      be used only by the Deity. All created things live by the will and
                      power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of the
                      Son of God. However able and talented, however large their
                      capabilities, they are replenished with life from the Source of all
                      life. Only He who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light and
                      life, could say, 'I have power to lay down my life, and I have
                      power to take it again.' All the human beings in our world take
                      their life from Him. He is the spring, the fountain of life."—Ellen
                      G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1113.

                       May we in this life partake of the quality of eternal life while
                      we wait for the reality in the life to come? 1 John 5:11, 12.

                         In conversion, we now must claim by faith what Adam had
                      potentially by nature—life eternal upon meeting the conditions.
                      In the resurrection we will receive by nature what we now claim
                      by faith. In the resurrection this corruptible will put on incorrup-
                      tion, and this mortal shall put on immortality. Amen!
                         The attractiveness of living forever depends upon the charac-
                      ter each person develops. The seasoned sinner loses any desire
                      to live forever. Sin has its pleasure but it is transitory. The
                      indulgence of sinful pleasure soon sours.
                         Those who find joy in the prospect of life eternal are those
                      who find Christ here! The enrichment of the human experience
                      here whets the appetite for more of the same in the hereafter.
                      Only the righteous would want to live forever. Death is merciful
                      to the sinner.

THINK IT THROUGH        My character here determines what I shall be when I shall
                      see Him as He is! Oh, solemn thought!

          Part 6   To possess Christ is to enjoy life to the fullest, now and
        ETERNAL eternally. What evidence do we have that this is so?
           LIFE,
        ETERNAL    "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might
            JOY  have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of
                 good cheer; I have overcome the world."
                   "These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might
                 remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my
                 commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
                 you" (John 16:33; 15:11, 12).

                     "In His parting conversation with His disciples on the night
                   before the crucifixion the Saviour made no reference to the
                   suffering that He had endured and must yet endure. He did not
                   speak of the humiliation that was before Him, but sought to
                   bring to their minds that which would strengthen their faith,
                   leading them to look forward to the joys that await the
                   overcomer."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 23. (Emphasis
                   supplied.)

                     What special privilege will be accorded those who victori-
                   ously survive the final tribulation? Rev. 14:3, 4.

                      With all the redeemed, the 144,000 share the unending joy of
                   the earth made new. "There [in the City of God], immortal minds
                   will contemplate with never-failing delight the wonders of crea-
                   tive power, the mysteries of redeeming love. . . . There the
                   grandest enterprises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspira-
                   tions reached, the highest ambitions realized; and still there will
                   arise new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new
                   truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the powers of
                   mind and soul and body."—The Great Controversy, p. 677.

                     Is life in eternity likely to be exciting and challenging?

                     "Many seem to have the idea that this world and the heavenly
                   mansions constitute the universe of God. Not so. The redeemed
                   throng will range from world to world, and much of their time
                   will be employed in searching out the mysteries of redemption.
                   And throughout the whole stretch of eternity, this subject will be
                   continually opening to their minds. The privileges of those who
                   overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their
                   testimony are beyond comprehension."—S.D.A. Bible Com-

          Part 1    What assurance did Christ express to His disciples that He
           "I AM   would never forsake them or us?
      WITH YOU"
                     "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
                   commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
                   end of the world. Amen" (Matt. 28:20).

                      When we wonder how this promise of Christ's was fulfilled to
                   faithful John the Baptist, we might want to consider the follow-
                   ing words of encouragement:
                      "Though no miraculous deliverance was granted John, he
                   was not forsaken. He had always the companionship of
                   heavenly angels, who opened to him the prophecies concern-
                   ing Christ, and the precious promises of Scripture. These were
                   his stay, as they were to be the stay of God's people through the
                   coming ages. To John the Baptist, as to those that came after
                   him, was given the assurance,         I am with you all the days,
                   even unto the end.' Matt. 28:20, R.V., margin."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 224.

                     Is Christ's promise to be with His disciples true even when
                   they are under direst persecution? Isa. 43:2.

                      "As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in
                   the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily
                   in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right. He who
                   walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace will be with
                   His followers wherever they are. His abiding presence will com-
                   fort and sustain."—Prophets and Kings, p. 513.
                      The knowledge that Christ is with us when all else turns
                   against us is comforting indeed.
                     A little boy accompanied his father on a long journey. On their
                   return trip, night fell. His father lighted a lantern as they entered
                   the dark forest. Soon the night obscured the father's form as he
                   led the way, carrying the lantern.
                      "Father, I don't see you: I'm scared," shouted the little boy.
                      "Can you see the light, Son?" the father asked.
                     "Yes, Daddy,7 came the answer. "But I can't see you."
                      "No matter," answered the father, "just follow the light."
                     The light of God's Word never shone more brightly than
                   today. We do not always understand the fiery trials or heavy seas
                   through which we pass. But we may know that He is with us,
                   whether or not we feel His presence; for to follow the light is to
                   follow Him.

         Part 2  In a parallel to the call made by Isaiah to God's ancient
     "MAKE YOU people, what urgent preparation should God's modern mes-
        CLEAN" sengers urge every Christian to undertake in readiness for
                Christ's soon return?

                     "Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your do-
                   ings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil" (Isa. 1:16).

                      "Oh, how many will be found unready when the Master shall
                   come to reckon with His servants! . . . Self-righteousness will
                   then be of no avail. Only those can stand the test who shall be
                   found having on the righteousness of Christ, who are imbued
                   with His spirit, and walk even as He walked, in purity of heart and
                   life. The conversation must be holy, and then the words will be
                   seasoned with grace."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 317, 318.

                     Describe the part to be played by prayer in this preparation
                   for the advent. Matt. 26:41.

                     "'Watch and pray,' is an injunction often repeated in the
                   Scriptures. In the lives of those who obey this injunction there
                   will be an undercurrent of happiness that will bless all with
                   whom they are brought in contact. Those who are sour and
                   cross in disposition will become sweet and gentle; those who
                   are proud will become meek and lowly."—Counsels to
                   Teachers, p. 293.

                     Faced by the rejection of unbelieving persecutors, how will
                   the triumphant saints be fortified in their times of test? Isa.
                   26:3.

                     "Let all who are afflicted or unjustly used, cry to God. Turn
                   away from those whose hearts are as steel, and make your
                   requests known to your Maker. Never is one repulsed who
                   comes to Him with a contrite heart. Not one sincere prayer is
                   lost. Amid the anthems of the celestial choir, God hears the cries
                   of the weakest human being. We pour out our heart's desire in
                   our closets, we breathe a prayer as we walk by the way, and our
                   words reach the throne of the Monarch of the universe. . . .
                   Nothing can drown the soul's desire. It rises above the din of the
                   street, above the confusion of the multitude, to the heavenly
                   courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our prayer is
                   heard."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 174.

THINK IT THROUGH     I must develop a strong prayer life now so that in the final
                   crisis I will be able to lay hold of divine strength in order to
                   endure to the end.

          Part 3   How basic is the part played by the Word of God in the
         "EVERY development of spiritual life?
         WORD"
                   "He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
                 bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
                 mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4).

                      The promises of Christ and His instruction were not limited in
                   application to those who first heard them. "With the conse-
                   crated worker for God, in whatever place he may be, the Holy
                   Spirit abides. The words spoken to the disciples are spoken also
                   to us. The Comforter is ours as well as theirs."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 51. (Emphasis supplied.)

                     What must be the Christian's attitude toward the words of
                   God as he stands for Christ and truth in the last days? 2 Tim.
                   2:15.

                      "We must cherish carefully the words of our God lest we be
                   contaminated by the deceptive workings of those who have left
                   the faith. We are to resist their spirit and influence with the same
                   weapon our Master used when assailed by the prince of
                   darkness—'It is written.' We should learn to use the Word of
                   God skilfully. The exhortation is, 'Study to show thyself ap-
                   proved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,
                   rightly dividing the word of truth.' There must be diligent work
                   and earnest prayer and faith to meet the winding error of false
                   teachers and seducers; for 'in the last days perilous times shall
                   come.' "—Evangelism, pp. 625, 626.
                      God has revealed Himself to man in many ways. Intuitively
                   man senses that there is a God. Nature in her order and beauty
                   adds evidence. And then there is, of course, the supreme revela-
                   tion of God in Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is His living succes-
                   sor. But visible to the eye is the Book—in fact 66 books—
                   authored by 40 Spirit-filled men as God's unerring guide to the
                   better world. It has been vilified, neglected, and rejected by
                   some; studied, believed, respected, and obeyed by others.
                   Blessed are the latter, for they shall indeed inherit the world to
                   come.

THINK IT THROUGH     In the physical realm, it is a fact that in many circumstances,
                   one seeking to help another finds that he has in the process
                   prolonged his own life. In a spiritual sense, this is likewise
                   true. In helping to save others through the merits of Jesus—
                   "ye are complete in him" (Col. 2:10)—we are in an attitude to
                   maintain a saving relationship to Christ and His righteous-
                   ness which alone makes possible the salvation of our own
                   souls.

                                                                      June 17

        Part 4   In what sense is Christian fellowship and church attendance
        "NOT where possible a strength to the believer in the time of the
    FORSAKING" end?

                    "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
                  manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much
                  the more, as ye see the day approaching" (Heb. 10:25).
                    "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow-
                  ship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
                  cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).

                    In moments of discouragement members sometimes stop
                  attending church. These fail to recognize that the church is a
                  hospital for sinners, not an honor society for saints. The most
                  needy souls should never miss an opportunity to fellowship and
                  worship. When under extreme pressures, we most need the
                  encouragement of fellow travelers on the King's highway. Jesus
                  Christ established the church. It is His body (1 Cor. 12:12-27).
                  We are members of His body. We are not in this world alone. As
                  church members, we share our joys and sorrows. While we need
                  our God, we also need each other.

                    In a time of prevailing apostasy and daring challenges to
                  the Majesty of heaven, what special recognition was given to
                  those who supported each other in loyalty to Jehovah? Mal.
                  3:16.

                    "[Mal. 3:16,17 quoted.] It will pay ... to improve the privileges
                  within our reach, and, even at some sacrifice, to assemble with
                  those who fear God and speak for Him; for He is represented as
                  hearkening to those testimonies, while angels write them in a
                  book. God will remember those who have met together and
                  thought upon His name, and He will spare them from the great
                  conflagration. They will be as precious jewels in His sight, but
                  His wrath will fall on the shelterless head of the sinner. It is not a
                  vain thing to serve God. There is a priceless reward for those
                  who devote their life to His service."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p.
                  107.
                    "In chs. 3:16-18 and 4:2 [of Malachi] God acknowledges the
                  faithful few in Israel who remain loyal to Him and assures them
                  of His unfailing love. At the same time (ch. 4:1, 3) He warns the
                  wicked of their fate on the day of final judgment. The message of
                  Malachi closes with the assurance that prior to the great day of
                  the Lord a messenger will appear to assist Him in the work of
                  preparing the 'jewels' for His crown and preserving them
                  through the day of judgment (ohs. 4:4-6, 2; 3:17)."—S.D.A. Bible

          Part 5   What promises of angel ministry given to the psalmist will
         ANGELS have supreme testing during the times of trouble before Jesus
      IN CHARGE comes?

                      "He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
                   all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou
                   dash thy foot against a stone" (Ps. 91:11,12). (Note the whole
                   psalm.)

                      "The power and malice of Satan and his host might justly
                   alarm us were it not that we may find shelter and deliverance in
                   the superior power of our Redeemer. We carefully secure our
                   houses with bolts and locks to protect our property and our lives
                   from evil men; but we seldom think of the evil angels who are
                   constantly seeking access to us, and against whose attacks we
                   have, in our own strength, no method of defense.... But those
                   who follow Christ are ever safe under His watchcare. Angels
                   that excel in strength are sent from heaven to protect them. The
                   wicked cannot break through the guard which God has
                   stationed about His people."—The Great Controversy, p. 517.

                     In the Mount of Olives discourse, what instruction did Jesus
                   give those who would be interrogated by authorities because
                   of their loyalty to Him? Mark 13:11.

                     "Every soul who believes present truth will be brought where
                   he will be required to give a reason of the hope that is in him....
                   The universe is looking upon the controversy that is going on
                   upon the earth. At an infinite cost, God has provided for every
                   man an opportunity to know that which will make him wise unto
                   salvation. How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail
                   himself of this opportunity"-Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp.
                   415, 416.

                     In our times of test, in what way does the Holy Spirit support
                   the ministry of angels? John 14:26.

                     Beyond concern for power to endure physical hardship and
                   punishment, the persecuted follower of Jesus needs the assur-
                   ance of being given Christlike words to speak.

THINK IT THROUGH     During the time of trouble when we will be hailed before civil
                   and political authorities to answer for our faith, what only can
                   the Holy Spirit bring to my mind of the promises and truths of
                   God's Word?

          Part 6    What assurance have we been given as to how long God's
        HE WILL    mercy and redeeming power will overshadow the faithful?
     PERFORM IT
                     "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath
                   begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus
                   Christ" (Phil. 1:6).

                      One of the simplest statements of the divine plan to save
                   sinners has long been in the hands of God's people:
                       "There are those who have known the pardoning love of
                   Christ and who really desire to be children of God, yet they
                   realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty, and they
                   are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been renewed by
                   the Holy Spirit. To such I would say, Do not draw back in despair.
                   ... Said the beloved John, 'These things write I unto you, that ye
                   sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
                   Jesus Christ the righteous.' 1 John 2:1. And do not forget the
                   words of Christ, 'The Father Himself loveth you.' John 16:27....
                   If you will but yield yourself to Him, He that hath begun a good
                   work in you will carry it forward to the day of Jesus Christ."—
                   Steps to Christ, p. 64. (Emphasis supplied.)

                     In "the day of the Lord," what words of welcome to the
                   kingdom of glory await the saints? Matt. 25:34.

                     "Come in his glory. At His first advent Jesus veiled His divine
                   glory and lived as a man among men.... The kingdom He then
                   established was the kingdom of His grace.... However, He will
                   come again, 'in his glory,' to inaugurate His eternal kingdom
                   (Dan. 7:14, 27; Rev. 11:15 . . .). Jesus' second advent is the
                   theme of Matt. 24 and 25. . . .
                     "Throne of his glory. Or, 'His glorious throne.' Christ was
                   seated upon the throne of the universe prior to His incarnation
                   (DA 22, 23). Upon His ascension He was once more enthroned
                   (AA 38), as Priest and King (Zech. 6:13; AA 39), and shared His
                   Father's throne (DA 832; Rev. 3:21). At the completion of the
                   work of investigative judgment, begun in 1844 . . . , Jesus will
                   receive 'His kingdom' (GC 426, 613, 614; EW 55, 280). The final
                   coronation and enthronement of Christ as King of the universe
                   takes place at the close of the millennium, before all men—
                   those who are subjects of His glorious kingdom and those who
                   have refused allegiance to Him."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

            Part 1     What biblical evidence have we that the world was created
         "IT WAS     free from sin?
      VERY GOOD"
                       "God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
                     very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth
                     day" (Gen. 1:31).
                       Of our first parents, it is commented that:
                       "It was not the will of God that this sinless pair should have
                     any knowledge of evil. He had freely given them the good but
                     withheld the evil. Eve thought the words of the serpent wise, and
                     she received the broad assertion, 'Ye shall not surely die: for
                     God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
                     shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and
                     evil'—making God a liar. Satan boldly insinuated that God had
                     deceived them to keep them from being exalted in knowledge
                     equal with Himself. God said: If ye eat ye shall surely die. The
                     serpent said, If ye eat, 'ye shall not surely die.' "—The Story of
                     Redemption, p. 34.

                       Why has God permitted sin's continuance these many cen-
                     turies? 2 Peter 3:9.
                        One of the greatest of life's meanings is that God has an
                     answer for the sin problem for those earnestly choosing to
                     receive it.
                        "We are living in an age when all should especially give heed
                     to the injunction of the Saviour: 'Watch and pray, that ye enter
                     not into temptation.' Let everyone bear in mind that he should
                     be true and loyal to God, believing the truth, growing in grace
                     and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Saviour's invitation
                     is: 'Learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall
                     find rest unto your souls.' The Lord is willing to help us, to
                     strengthen and bless us; but we must pass through the refining
                     process until all the impurities in our character are burned
                     away. Every member of the church will be subjected to the
                     furnace, not to consume, but to purify."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p.
                     485.
                        Should God move now to punish sinners, He would find so
                     many of His children unprepared. He must be seen, then, as
                     delaying judgment for the sake of the saints and the salvation of
                     sinners, rather than because He is tolerant of sin. He is "not
                     willing that any should perish" (2 Peter 3:9). And so mercy has
                     lingered and lingers still.

THINK IT THROUGH       How much of an answer can we find to the question of why
                     God seemingly permitted sin to enter this particular planet
                     only?

         Part 2      For what basic purpose did God place the church on the
              A    earth, and how well is it being realized?
    WITNESSING
       CHURCH        "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                   world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
                   come" (Matt. 24:14).

                      Every convert should be a convert-maker. Ministry is not the
                   exclusive privilege of the clergy. This state of things took place
                   after the first century of the church. Jesus commissioned all
                   men to bear His message. The possessor of truth becomes
                   debtor to the world. We cannot know what we know and keep it
                   to ourselves. We cannot. We must not. We will not.
                      Surely life could have no more realistic purpose or meaning
                   than that which inspiration has here portrayed:
                      "God and the angels are watching. God desires His people to
                   show by their lives the advantage of Christianity over worldli-
                   ness, to show that they are working on a high, holy plane. He
                   longs to see them showing that the truth they have received has
                   made them children of the heavenly King. He longs to make
                   them channels through which He can pour His boundless love
                   and mercy.
                      "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
                   Himself in His church. When the character of the Saviour shall
                   be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to
                   claim His own. It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to
                   look for, but to hasten, the coming of our Lord. Were all who
                   profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the
                    whole world would be sown with the seed of the gospel! Quickly
                    the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ would
                   come."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 324.

                     What charge did Christ give His followers? Mark 16:15.

                     "My brother, my sister, what are you doing for Christ? Are you
                   seeking to be a blessing to others? Are your lips uttering words
                   of kindness, sympathy, and love? Are you putting forth earnest
                   efforts to win others to the Saviour?"—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 39.

THINK IT THROUGH     What has my witnessing done today to help others to be
                   ready for the impending second advent? (Ponder again

           Part 3     What power provided for the apostolic preaching of the
      POWER FOR     gospel is still awaiting our demand today?
      WITNESSING
                      "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
                    upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
                    Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the
                    uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).
                      In a world marked by divisions, tensions, and seemingly
                    overwhelming problems in international affairs, the promise of
                    the Spirit's universal ministry brings courage to the believer.
                       "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to
                    any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit
                    was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day of
                    Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all
                    who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service.
                    To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy
                    Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness.
                    The more closely believers have walked with God, the more
                    clearly and powerfully have they testified of their Redeemer's
                    love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through
                    the long centuries of persecution and trial enjoyed a large
                    measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives, have stood as
                    signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and men they
                    have revealed the transforming power of redeeming love."—
                    The Acts of the Apostles, p. 49.
                      From the prophecies concerning God's "servant," what
                    may we gather regarding the extent of Christ's work of grace?
                    Isa. 42:4.
                      Although the apostles of Christ were to begin their witness in
                    Jerusalem, reaping the harvest of His preaching, that was only
                    the beginning of their work.
                      "But the work was not to stop here. It was to be extended to
                    the earth's remotest bounds. To His disciples Christ said, You
                    have been witnesses of My life of self-sacrifice in behalf of the
                    world. You have witnessed My labors for Israel. . . . You have
                    seen that all who come to Me, confessing their sins, I freely
                    receive. Him that cometh to Me I will in nowise cast out. All who
                    will, may be reconciled to God, and receive everlasting life. To
                    you, My disciples, I commit this message of mercy. It is to be
                    given to Israel first, and then to all nations, tongues, and
                    peoples. It is to be given to Jews and Gentiles. All who believe

                 heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
                 whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Rev.
                 22:17).

                      "Every follower of Jesus has a work to do as a missionary for
                   Christ in the family, in the neighborhood, in the town or city
                   where he lives. All who are consecrated to God are channels of

                   municate to others the light of truth."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p.
                   632.

                    As we go out or reach out with our varied witnessing
                   methods, what sort of reception may we expect? Luke 8:5-8.

                     Not many of us will have the success of Jonah at Nineveh.
                   Heartache often accompanies the work of the gospel worker.
                   Atheists, agnostics, and infidels will often sit in our pews. Add to
                   this the members who show little appreciation for the gospel of
                   the kingdom. There are, on the other hand, the eager, the hun-
                   gry, and the desperate, who welcome truth like a cool breeze on
                   a summer day.
                      "The world's Redeemer had many hearers, but few followers.
                   Noah preached one hundred and twenty years to the people
                   before the Flood, and yet there were few who appreciated this
                   precious, probationary time. Save Noah and his family, not one
                   was numbered with the believers and entered into the ark. Of all
                   the inhabitants of the earth, only eight souls received the mes-
                   sage; but the message condemned the world. The light was
                   given in order.that they might believe; their rejection of the light
                   proved their ruin. Our message to the world will be a savor of life
                   unto life to all who accept it, and of condemnation to all who
                   reject it."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 36.
                      As there is in the natural world a limit to what the human agent
                   can do to cause seed to grow and be fruitful, so in the spiritual
                   realm the human efforts to sow the seeds of gospel truth have
                   certain limitations. The farmer or gardener digs and rakes and
                   plants; he may even feed and water the seed. But God im-
                   planted, and He controls the spark of life dormant in the seed. It
                   is His sun that shines to stimulate germination. Only God can
                   "give the increase" to our witnessing.

                    hear, but who do not learn the lesson as diligent students. They
                    have a form of godliness, but are not believers. They know not
                    the truth by practice. They receive not the engrafted word."—
                    Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 460.
                      The Word of God tests the validity of a Christian experience.
                    Some cannot bear the straight testimony. Yet others have re-
                    ceived only a surface conversion. Many of these fall away. How-
                    ever, the church must go on making disciples. Apostasy must
                    not dampen our evangelistic ardor. Many fell away and walked
                    no more with Jesus. We can expect no more. "He that shall
                    endure unto the end .. . shall be saved" (Mark 13:13).

                     What inspired encouragement have we concerning many
                    who fall away from the church?

                       "When the storm of persecution really breaks upon us the
                    true sheep will hear the true Shepherd's voice. Self-denying
                    efforts will be put forth to save the lost, and many who have
                    strayed from the fold will come back to follow the great
                    Shepherd. The people of God will draw together and present to
                    the enemy a united front. . . .
                       "... The love of Christ, the love of our brethren, will testify to
                    the world that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him.
                    Then will the message of the third angel swell to a loud cry, and
                    the whole earth will be lightened with the glory of the Lord."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 401.
                       Should we not, in the light of the above statement, pursue
                    with all diligence the privilege of prayer and Bible study for the
                    stability of our souls? There is no substitute for this. This alone
                    breeds faith, without which it is impossible to please God. These
                    initiatives are immediately imperative.

THINK IT THROUGH      What degree of concern should I have that I will never look
                    back and fall away? (See Luke 9:62; 2 Tim. 1:12.)

Life's Real Meaning       LESSON 13                                     ❑ Friday
                                                                          June 26

          Part 6    Perhaps the church best demonstrates the real meaning of
       BUILDING  life when she reflects most fully the spirit predicted of her
            THE Master.
      BRETHREN
                    "A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall
                 he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory" (Matt.
                 12:20).

                      "In all our associations it should be remembered that in the
                   experience of others there are chapters sealed from mortal
                   sight. On the pages of memory are sad histories that are sa-
                   credly guarded from curious eyes. There stand registered long,
                   hard battles with trying circumstances, perhaps troubles in the
                   home life, that day by day weaken courage, confidence, and
                   faith. Those who are fighting the battle of life at great odds may
                   be strengthened and encouraged by little attentions that cost
                   only a loving effort. To such the strong, helpful grasp of the
                   hand by a true friend is worth more than gold or silver. Words of
                   kindness are as welcome as the smile of angels.
                      "There are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled to
                   labor hard for small wages, and able to secure but the barest
                   necessities of life. Toil and deprivation, with no hope of better
                   things, make their burden very heavy. When pain and sickness
                   are added, the burden is almost insuppurtable. Careworn and
                   oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief. Sympathize
                   with them in their trials, their heartaches, and disappointments.
                   This will open the way for you to help them."—The Ministry of
                   Healing, p. 158.

                     A parallel aspect of life's real meaning is seen in the unity of
                   all believers. John 17:11.

                     "Only as they were united with Christ could the disciples hope
                   to have the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit and the
                   co-operation of angels of heaven. With the help of these divine
                   agencies they would present before the world a united front and
                   would be victorious in the conflict they were compelled to wage
                   unceasingly against the powers of darkness. As they should
                   continue to labor unitedly, heavenly messengers would go be-
                   fore them, opening the way; hearts would be prepared for the
                   reception of truth, and many would be won to Christ."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, pp. 90, 91.

THINK IT THROUGH     Truth and God's church will triumph. Although it takit all, I
                   must triumph with them! Life has real meaning now. It will
                   have through eternity. Home at last, brethren! Home at last!

Understanding the Living Word of God by Gerhard F. Hasel, Ph.D. U.S. $7.95.
In this fascinating, scholarly work, easily read by the thoughtful church
member, Dr. Hasel leads us through subjects such as the eclipse of biblical
authority in modern times, and the reasons why; the biblical backgrounds
that aid in better understanding the Bible; and the principles by which the
Bible should be read and correctly understood.
How to Get the Most Out of Bible Study by Leo R. Van Dolson, Ph.D. U.S.
$3.95. In this volume the author helps the ordinary reader to understand what
the biblical writers are saying. The valuable aids to analyzing biblical pas-
sages will serve the reader about as well as college classes would—and some
even more.
Fully Alive by John L. Shuler U.S. $3.95.
His message fresh, yet tested by years of study and experience, Elder Shuler
sets forth in this book, with his usual directness and simplicity, how men and
women find acceptance with God, both now and in the judgment.
God Cares, Vol. 1 by C. Mervyn Maxwell U.S. $8.95.
Destined to be a best seller, this book contains the latest research on the
book of Daniel. Recognizing that Roman Catholic attitudes and evangelical
Protestant emphases have changed in the past century, the author speaks
sympathetically to these various adjustments of thought and feeling.
