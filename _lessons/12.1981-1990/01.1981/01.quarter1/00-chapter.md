 How much can
 a nine-yearaiold sla
 with one
Investment dollar I                        Nine-year-old Desiree
                                        Cameron had just one dollar
                                        to start an Investment
                                        project. The dollar was given
                                        to her by her Sabbath School
                                        Investment leader.
                                           "What can I do with only
                                        a dollar?" thought Desiree.
                                        "I'll just have faith that God
                                        can bless it!" Then she heard
                                        her mother talking about
                                        people at work who wanted a
                                        healthy lunchtime snack.
                                        Her Investment idea began
                                       forming.
    Desiree bought some fresh fruit with her dollar, carefully made
 a "For Sale" sign, put the fruit and sign into a basket, and placed
 it on her mother's desk. The people at work eagerly purchased the
 fruit, and Desiree used the profits to buy more fruit. Soon, a
 regular little Investment business had begun.
    After the first eight months of investing, Desiree took time to
 joyfully reflect on her success. In that short time she had already
 contributed $103.60 to the investment fund of her Rolling Hills,
 California church.
     Why not join Desiree in
 letting God multiply your
 investment? (Not to mention your
 faith.)                                       An Investment Firm

AFRO-MIDEAST DIVISION




Dear Sabbath School Members:

UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF EASTERN AFRICA

The East African Union with 150,000 members in Kenya and Uganda is the
second largest union conference in the world. With a further 70,000
members in the neighboring countries of Tanzania and Ethiopia, there
are almost 250,000 church members without a senior college for their
youth.

Because of this, urgent need for a senior educational institution, the
General Conference has approved plans for the development of the University
College of Eastern Africa on a 334-acre agricultural estate in the high-
lands of Kenya near Eldoret and has agreed that the Special Projects
Offering fOr this quarter may be used exclusively for this project.

In anticipation of what we hope will be the largest Sabbath School
offering ever received by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the College
Board moved forward in faith and commenced building. Dr Percy Paul, the
college president, and his corps of teachers and staff have worked
valiantly under difficult conditions to launch this new Adventist
educational institution. Students from several countries began classes
in January, 1980. Your offerings will help to complete the modest
buildings which are needed to provide the facilities to operate a college
effectively and help establish an institution which will accelerate the
preparation of national workers for important leadership positions for
the church in Africa.

The members, faculty and students, present and future, thank you for
your continuing interest, prayers and support.

Yours truly,




Charles D Watson
President
Afro-Mideast Division

TED eople. They make up the church and give it its personality.
.1L— Friendly. Aloof. Cynical. Sincere. Committed. Lukewarm. And
always far from perfect. Which means the critics will never run out
 of ammunition.
     But even for all its flaws, the church survives. It's more than a
social gathering of people with common interests. It represents
God's activity in the world and man's response.

 THE CHURCH-SERVANT TO THE WORLD
                                        Introduction

   Many books have been written about the church because, despite its faults, it
occupies an important place in society and in human lives. Yet the church remains a
"mystery" in the biblical sense, defying simple explanations. Since it partakes of the
nature of both the human and the divine, it is difficult to dissect it fully and lay bare all
its properties.
   The lessons this quarter look at the church, including your church and mine, from
the viewpoint of the biblical revelation concerning it. We believe without shadow of
doubt that the Bible is the Word of God and that in it we find a true representation of
God's character and purpose and of His dealings with His people through the
centuries.
   The view of the writer of these lessons is that the church can best be understood
and appreciated in the light of God's intelligence and love. God wanted a universe
that worshiped Him freely and with understanding. In order to have this He had to
allow even for freedom to choose the wrong. This involved a tremendous risk, which
was taken. Sin, in terms of misunderstanding God and misusing His entrusted
properties, did indeed arise. The church is a key part of God's great plan to vindicate
His character and to take away sin without detracting from the freedom which God's
love requires in the universe.
   The church exists wherever we find God's people, from the beginning of time to the
present and on into eternity. But in these lessons we are thinking of the church
primarily in terms of God's activity after the birth of Jesus.
   The first lesson emphasizes that God is in control in every situation. Sin, whether in
heaven or on earth, did not take, Him by surprise. He had a plan to meet it, one
consistent with His justice and replete with His mercy. The church is part of that plin,
being the arena and means of His activity.
   We see that the church is based on a firm foundation—Jesus Christ, the Son of the
Living God, recognized and made known by divine revelation. Jesus Christ has built
the church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. The agency for bringing the
benefits of the Father and the Son to the New Testament church is the Holy Spirit, as
 promised by Jesus to His disciples. (See John 14 through 17.)
   How can we recognize the church? What are its characteristics? We will seek
answers to these questions in Scripture. We will notice that the church is best
understood in terms of relationships. Yet no purely human relationship can encom-
 pass all that is involved.
   One aspect of the church is the tension between its call to holiness and its
involvement in sin. To emphasize the one without denying the other is important. Can
 we do that? How can a ChriStian be a saint and a sinner at the same time? Do we need
 to redefine our terms?
   No area of church life is more debated than that of its structure. Structure and
 organization it must have. But what should be its lines of authority? Unfortunately,
 history has not shown the church at its best, because emphasis on hierarchy has
 sometimes taken the place of service. Is there a way that we can have order and yet
 not reduce the spirit? Can we involve all members of the church, and not merely the
 clergy, in organization? These and other questions reveal the importance of our
 subject.
   May God grant that in the study of these lessons we will discover our role in the
 church and by our faithfulness cooperate more fully with God's plans.
God Still in Control          LESSON 1                                    ❑ Sunday
                                                                        December 28
              Part 1     How did sin enter the universe?
           FREEDOM
             TO SIN      "How you have fallen from heaven,
                         0 morning star, son of the dawn!
                         You have been cast down to the earth,
                         you who once laid low the nations!" (Isa. 14:12, NIV).

                         When we look at the universe of which we are a part, there is
                       much that can be characterized by sweetness and light. But
                       there is also much that is ugly and hateful. How has this come
                       about?

                         Many answers have been given, among them these:
                         1. The universe is evolving; it is progressing from the simple
                       to the complex. Many mistakes are made on the way, but in time
                       perfection will be reached.
                         2. The universe was created by an inferior god—a
                       demiurge—who, because of his imperfection, created an imper-
                       fect world.
                         3. The universe is composed of two conflicting principles—
                       good and evil—that will last throughout eternity. We shall al-
                       ways see them in conflict.

                         Are both creationism and evolutionism expressions of
                       faith?

                          The fact is that science cannot tell us how the world began.
                       Philosophy can present us with only theories. Only a revelation
                       by One who was present at the beginning—One who is above
                       and beyond the universe—can inform us about origins.
                          The Christian believes that such a revelation exists and that it
                       is to be found in the Bible. There he finds these truths:
                          1. God is perfect and all good (Ps. 89:5-18).
                          2. Everything He creates is very good (Gen. 1:31).
                          3. Sin entered the universe and has brought all our woe (Gen.
                       3:17-24).
                          How sin could enter a perfect being is hard to understand. No
                       reason can be given for sin. But one thing is clear: God has
                       given His created beings the freedom to choose sin. (See Gen.
                       2:17; 3:11.)
                         In only one way could God prevent sin from entering the
                       universe: He could limit freedom. But in doing so He would have
                       created beings who were no better than machines—
                       automatons who could not worship freely or love indepen-
                       dently.

THINK IT THROUGH          In what ways do you think personal freedom is worth all the
                       risks involved?

God Still in Control      LESSON 1                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                   December 29
           Part 2   How did our first parents exercise their choice in the Garden
        CHOOSING of Eden?
          TO SIN
                    "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good to
                  eat, and that it was pleasing to the eye and tempting to con-
                  template, she took some and ate it. She also gave her hus-
                  band some and he ate it" (Gen. 3:6, NEB).

                       With one exception, Adam and Eve were free to eat from any
                    tree in the garden. They were not to eat from the "tree of the
                    knowledge of good and evil" (Gen. 2:17).
                       The reason for this restriction was that they might continue to
                    live in peace and joy. Death would be the consequence of eating
                    of the forbidden tree. No real hardship was involved. But the
                    tree symbolized the exercise of their freedom; they could obey
                    God and live or disobey Him and die.
                       Do you think God could have prevented sin from entering the
                    world had He not placed the tree of the knowledge of good and
                    evil in the garden? To think so would be incorrect, because sin
                    had already entered the universe through Lucifer. Also, the
                    absence of the tree would have meant an absence of choice.
                       God decided that our first parents must have freedom of
                    choice. By exercising this freedom in the right way, a loving
                    relationship would exist between the Creator and man. Man's
                    dedication and worship would be meaningful.

                      How did our first parents fall into sin? 1 Tim. 2:14.

                      Eve admitted that she had been deceived by the serpent.
                    Adam placed the blame on the woman and, indirectly, on God.
                    (See Gen. 3:12, 13.)
                      Adam listened to his wife and placed his desire to be with her
                    above obedience to God. (See verse 17.) Thus he made a choice
                    which brought the consequences of sin.
                      All true freedom involves restriction. The law of love must
                    govern all of God's creation. Only then can His created beings
                    interact with mutual confidence. Only then can perfect harmony
                    prevail. But the moment one rejects the provisions of the God of
                    order, chaos must result. And since God cannot permit continu-
                    ing chaos, a decision to live out of harmony with God's laws
                    means final extinction.

THINK IT THROUGH      Give examples showing the connection between freedom
                    and careful observance of law.

God Still in Control         LESSON 1                                  ❑ Tuesday
                                                                      December 30
             Part 3     How did God respond to man's sinful condition?
       RESPONDING
            TO SIN      "And the Lord God said, 'The man has now become like one
                      of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach
                      out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live
                      forever' " (Gen. 3:22, NIV).

                        God cannot condone evil in any part of His universe. (See
                      Hab. 1:13.) The time must come when all evil will be eradicated.
                        Meanwhile God is considerate of His creatures. For Adam and
                      Eve He made garments of skin. (See Gen. 3:21.) These were far
                      more adequate than the aprons of fig leaves our first parents
                      hurriedly put together when they realized they were naked. The
                      whole world would be changed as a result of the curse of sin.
                      They would need something to shield them.

                        What words of God gave our first parents hope for One
                      who—even though it caused Him to suffer—would crush the
                      serpent's head? Gen. 3:15.

                        Our first parents now realized that they had been wholly
                      mistaken in supposing that God had withheld anything that
                      would contribute to their happiness and development. The ser-
                      pent had been wholly wrong in his accusations against God.
                      Now they could see God as He really was—a God of love, a
                      forgiving God, a God not taken by surprise by what had hap-
                      pened in the garden, a God prepared for the salvation of Adam
                      and Eve should it be necessary. (See 1 Peter 1:20).

                       How does Paul refer to God's grace in relation to man's sin?
                      Rom. 5:20.

                        We are always aware of the heinousness of sin, but are we
                      also aware that God's grace can bring victory over even the
                      greatest sins?
                        We all regret the havoc that sin has caused through the
                      centuries. We often wish that it had never reared its ugly head.
                      But since it did, God found it necessary to vindicate His charac-
                      ter. He had to show that sin was neither impossible to forgive
                      nor impossible to overcome. In His provision for man's salvation
                      He has gone to a limit of self-sacrifice that is totally beyond our
                      comprehension.

THINK IT THROUGH        Consider God's banishment of Adam and Eve from the gar-
                      den as an expression of God's love.

God Still in Control     LESSON 1                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 December 31
          Part 4   On what basis could God expect His people to keep His
        PEOPLE commandments?
           AND
      PROPHETS     "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out
                 of the land of slavery" (Ex. 20:2, NIV).

                     God was well aware of the misery of the children of Israel in
                   Egypt. (See Ex. 3:7.) He had chosen Moses to bring them out. He
                   had performed many miracles, and now they stood before Sinai.
                   Since He had done so much for them, could He expect them to
                   respond in obedience to His laws?

                     What are the characteristics of a covenant?

                     The making of a covenant involves two parties: one may be
                   the initiator, and the other the acceptor. At Mount Sinai God
                   made a covenant with His people. He said to them: These are My
                   requirements. The people responded: "We will do everything
                   the Lord has said; we will obey" (Ex. 24:7, NIV). The covenant
                   was ratified with blood so that it was binding (verse 8).
                     Unfortunately, the people did not keep their part of the cov-
                   enant. Even Aaron was involved in the making of a golden calf
                   for their worship. (See Ex. 32:1-8.) The promises man makes are
                   as weak as ropes of sand.
                     Hence it was necessary to draw attention to a "new"
                   covenant—an everlasting covenant based on the promises of
                   God. (See Jer. 31:31-34.) Only this kind of covenant could be
                   effective, because man had only to accept the provisions made
                   for him and God would do the rest. Once again we see God
                   adapting Himself to man's needs in order that man might be
                   saved.

                     In trying to keep His people doing the right things, what
                   instruments did God use? Hosea 6:5.

                     God's people did not live up to the light they had, in spite of
                   the instruction they received and the warnings that were sent to
                   them. God was anxious that His people would be blessed and be
                   a blessing to those who lived around them. But they failed so
                   often that God had to permit their captivity.
                     After their return from Babylon, the people for a time were
                   zealous to build the temple and obey God's laws. But soon even
                   this slacked off, and for 400 years God did not communicate
                   with His people through prophets.

THINK IT THROUGH     What alternatives were available to God when His people
                   did not respond to His overtures of love?

                                                                        January 1

             GOD
          WITH US      " 'The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and
                     they will call him Immanuel'—which means, 'God with us'"
                     (Matt. 1:23, NIV).

                        And when Immanuel came, how was He received? In the
                     parable of the tenants, Jesus told of the landowner who planted
                     a vineyard, and at the time appointed for the harvest he sent his
                     servants to collect the fruit from the tenants. But the tenants
                     killed the servants. They later killed the landowner's son, who
                     also had come to collect the fruit. (See Matt. 21:33-41.)

                       What was the meaning of the parable of the tenants? Mark
                     12:1-12.

                       In this parable Jesus "pointed to the rich blessings bestowed
                     upon Israel, and in these showed God's claim to their obedi-
                     ence. He set before them the glory of God's purpose, which
                     through obedience they might have fulfilled. Withdrawing the
                     veil from the future, He showed how, by failure to fulfill His pur-
                     pose, the whole nation was forfeiting His blessing, and bringing
                     ruin upon itself."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 284.
                       Jesus was the One now coming to the children of Israel
                     expecting faithful stewardship. But when He came to His own,
                     His own people rejected Him. (See John 1:11.) Jesus therefore
                     announced the solemn judgment that the kingdom of God
                     would be taken away from them and given to a people who
                     would produce the necessary fruit. (See Matt. 21:43.)

                       What caused the Old Testament prophets to fail in their
                     mission?

                        The prophets failed to accomplish God's purposes through
                     them, not through any fault of their own, but because the chil-
                     dren of Israel rejected the messages from God. Now Jesus, as
                     God's unique Son, came to give a message of God's love. Would
                     the children of Israel accept Him? The gospel story, told four
                     times over, indicates how tragically the Jewish people turned
                     against Him. (See Matt. 16:18.)
                        And thus the church is born and a new era sets in. An associa-
                     tion of men and women from every race rather than from one
                     people, it will be God's chosen agency to witness to His love and
                     favor and to the supreme sacrifice made for man's salvation.
                     Will the church fail to do its task?

THINK IT THROUGH      Will the church succeed where Israel failed in working out
                     God's purposes for the world?

God Still in Control     LESSON 1                                    ❑ Friday
                                                                     January 2
          Part 6     What did God seek to accomplish by sending His Son into
       INTO ALL    the world?
     THE WORLD
                    "God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
                   world, but to save the world through him" (John 3:17, NIV).

                     Jesus has made every provision for man's salvation. He is
                   anxious that every person have the opportunity of making a
                   choice leading to salvation. Therefore He set up an organization
                   that would proceed to evangelize the world. This organization
                   was first composed of a group of His disciples, whom He com-
                   missioned to go into all the world and preach the gospel. (See
                   Matt. 28:19, 20.)

                     What program of outreach was entrusted to the disciples?
                   Acts 1:8.

                     This group of disciples was to tarry in Jerusalem until they
                   should be endued with power—the power of the Holy Spirit.
                   Then they were to go to Jerusalem, Samaria, and to the "utter-
                   most part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).
                     Thus a new era began. God was to work through men and
                   women from among both Jews and Gentiles, representing every
                   nation, kindred, tongue, and people. This group was to have a
                   new foundation, Jesus Christ. It was to grow out of the Jewish
                   faith, as represented in the Old Testament, but it was to be
                   distinct from it. It was to be the era of the church.
                     The church is thus the means. God is using to reach men and
                   women in their need for a Saviour. He has promised it His
                   presence and has given to it His authority.

                     What figure of speech is used to indicate the care and
                   protection that Jesus gives to His church? Rev. 1:12-20.

                     The seven messages given to the seven churches indicate
                   Christ's concern for His people. He wants to be sure they do not
                   lose their first love. (See Rev. 2:4.) He commends them when
                   they are "faithful unto death" (verse 10). He desires that they
                   separate themselves from all heresy and all immorality (verse
                   14). He knows when they are dying, and He wants them to wake
                   up and strengthen what is about to die. (See Rev. 3:2.)
                     For Him the church is not only the object of His supreme
                   regard but also the agent of reconciliation and the means of
                   preparing a world for His second coming. The church can best
                   be understood in this context—the context of God's activity and
                   man's response.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the basis for the assurance that the church will yet
                   achieve God's purpose in the world?

                    (Matt. 16:14).
                        These statements came in answer to Christ's question to His
                     disciples. He was about to tell them of His coming sufferings.
                      "Before doing this, He gave them an opportunity of confessing
                     their faith in Him that they might be strengthened for the coming

                     risen from the dead (verse 2). But the people should have known
                     otherwise. For one thing, their genealogy was different, and
                     people knew Jesus' family connection. (See Matt. 13:55.) Fur-
                     thermore, John had pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God. (See
                     John 1:29.)
                        Elias: This is Elijah, a highly regarded prophet among the
                     Jews. To associate Jesus with Elijah was thought to be a com-
                     pliment. Elijah had been translated to heaven, and presumably
                     he had now returned to earth. Furthermore, Malachi had prom-
                     ised that Elijah would come before "the great and dreadful day
                     of the Lord" (Mal. 4:5). But Elijah was not the Messiah, although
                     it was thought that he would be the precursor. Calling Jesus
                     Elijah might be an honor, but it was not the real identification. In
                     fact, John the Baptist had fulfilled the role of Elijah.
                        Jeremias: This is an interesting answer, because it may indi-
                     cate an association of the message of Jesus with Jeremiah's
                     promise of a new covenant. (See Jer. 31:31-33.) What it does not
                     indicate is that Jesus is more than His message. He is the Maker
                     of the new covenant.
                        One of the prophets: The indefiniteness of this suggestion is
                     an apparent refusal to think any further. There is a willingness to
                     recognize in Jesus the authority of a prophet, but no more. On
                     the other hand, the suggestion may have reference to
                     Deuteronomy 18:15-19, in which case it would be more to the
                     point. Jesus would then be the prophet (John 7:40)—the one to
                     whom the people of Israel should listen.

                                                                      January 5
          Part 2     What response did Peter give to the question Jesus asked?
        A BASIC
    CONFESSION      "Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
                   Son of the living God" (Matt. 16:16).

                     Jesus now turned to the disciples and asked them to state
                   their understanding of Him and His ministry. Peter spoke up—
                   Peter, who was always sure of himself, always ready to commit
                   himself. He not only expressed a personal conviction, but he
                   also voiced the conviction of his fellow disciples.

                     Early in the ministry of Jesus, what was the witness of John
                   the Baptist to the Messiahship of Jesus? John 1:34.

                     Andrew was one of the two who followed Jesus afterJohn had
                   pointed out the Lamb of God (verses 37, 40); and it was Andrew
                   who told his brother Simon, "We have found the Messias"
                   (verse 41). When Peter first met Jesus, he was told, "Thou shalt
                   be called Cephas" (verse 42). Cephas is the Aramaic for
                   "stone," or in the Greek, Petros, from which we get the English
                   Peter.
                     As the Messiah, Jesus would have roots in the Old Testament
                   prophecies. He was the Son of David. He was to restore the
                   kingdom of Israel. His reign would usher in an everlasting king-
                   dom of peace that would not only rival the kingship of David and
                   Solomon, but would outshine it in glory and power.

                     What evidence is there of the limited understanding of the
                   disciples as to the nature and timing of Christ's kingdom? Acts
                   1:6.

                      Peter and his fellow disciples would doubtless have some of
                   these thoughts coursing through their minds. Did they have a
                   true concept of what Jesus was going to do? This is very doubt-
                   ful, because even after the resurrection they were still thinking
                   in terms of a kingdom on earth that might overthrow the hated
                   Roman Empire.
                      But the assertion that Jesus was the Christ was nevertheless
                   true, and that He was the "Son of the living God" was a recogni-
                   tion of His origin and authority that left no room for doubt. Here
                   is a basic understanding about Jesus of Nazareth. No other
                   concept is adequate. Because Jesus is the Son of God, He can
                   speak with authority and reach down to man. Because He is the
                   Son of man, He is able to draw men up to God.

                   what is the truth?

             Part 3   What did Jesus say was the basis of Peter's inspired state-
             TRUTH ment?
          REVEALED
                      "Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou,
                    Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto
                    thee, but my Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 16:17).

                       Peter had not arrived at his conclusions about Jesus merely
                     by human reasoning. No human being had persuaded him. He
                     did not have to acknowledge his indebtedness to any scholar or
                     religious leader. His insight came as a revelation from God.

                       In common with Peter, how dependent are all men upon
                     divine revelation for a saving knowledge of God? Heb. 1:1-3.

                       Jesus is telling Peter, his fellow disciples, and all those who
                     will follow His teaching that the Source of their insights and
                     understandings is God. Human reasoning can lead men astray,
                     even as it did the Jewish leaders of Christ's time. Reason and
                     scholarship both have their place in the search for truth; but,
                     when all is said and done, we can know about God and His
                     plans, about Jesus Christ and His part in man's salvation, only
                     through revelation.

                       What do the following texts tell of God's willingness to re-
                     veal Himself to us individually and personally? Deut. 30:11-14;
                     Ps. 85:9; 145:18; Deut. 29:29.

                        Peter's experience was not an isolated occurrence. God is
                     willing and ready to reveal Himself to all who will accept His
                     revelation. To know Him does not require a dream, a vision, or
                     any supernatural manifestation. The Word of God is near to
                     every one of us.
                        No greater joy exists than that of knowing the truth. Such
                     knowledge provides a sense of stability. By contrast, the one
                     who is not sure of where he came from or where he is going, of
                     whether the God of the universe is friendly or not, of how to
                     decide between right and wrong—such a man lives in a con-
                     stant state of fear and uncertainty. He may even be lonely and
                     frustrated. "Blessed art thou," said Jesus to Peter, because now
                     he knew what was right. And not only he, but all the disciples of
                     Jesus. (See Matt. 13:16.) Before certain knowledge there must
                     be a willingness to hear (2 Cor. 8:12) and a willingness to do
                     (John 7:17).

Built on the Rock       LESSON 2                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     January 7
          Part 4      In addressing Peter, what did Jesus say was His plan?
      THE ROCK
    FOUNDATION        "I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock
                   I will build my church" (Matt. 16:18).

                     This verse has been construed many different ways. We will
                   study it and try to understand it in its context.
                     First of all, Jesus refers to Peter's additional name. Peter had
                   been named Simon (Greek form), or Simeon (Hebrew form). He
                   was the son of Jona and so was known as Simon (Simeon)
                   Bar-Jona, or son of Jona.

                     In what setting did Peter receive the nameCephas (Aramaic
                   for "stone"), which in Greek would be Petros, a masculine
                   Greek form of Petra, meaning "rock"? John 1:42.

                      Why did Jesus do this? The Gospels do not give us a clue. The
                   context of the first meeting suggests that Jesus was establish-
                   ing a friendly rapport. Perhaps He was laying the foundation for
                   a future relationship. Jesus established a personal tie with every
                   individual. Does this tell us something about the relationship of
                   Jesus to every church member?
                      Perhaps Jesus saw in Simon the characteristics of a rolling
                   stone. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 413.) The name Peter would
                   then be a kind of nickname used in love and appreciation. If this
                   is the case, then we see how Jesus looks at us. He sees us, not so
                   much for what we are, but for what we might become by His
                   grace.

                     What is the connection between the name Peter and the
                   rock on which Jesus says He will build His church? Matt.
                   16:18-23; 1 Cor. 3:11.

                       Obviously Jesus would not build His church on an
                     individual—even one as good as Peter. Peter had some excel-
                   ' lent characteristics, perhaps suggested by the name Peter; but
                     he also had some outstanding weaknesses. (See Matt. 16:23;
                     26:34; Gal: 2:11-13.) Paul sees with masterful insight that Jesus
                     is Himself the foundation of the church.
                        Peter made a basic confession that Jesus was the Christ, the
                     Son of the Living God. This is the basic confession to be made
                     by every member of the church. Such an acknowledgment is a
                     rock that cannot be moved. It is the basis of every true doctrine
                     and of every proper relationship between disciple and Lord, as
                     Peter indicated in his epistle. (See 1 Peter 2:4-9.)

THINK IT THROUGH    In view of the description of the church as built on a rock,
                   what characteristics may we expect to find in the church?

            Part 5  What assurance is given that the church will be able to sur-
         POWER TO vive?
          SURVIVE
                    "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18).

                        The Greek word translated "hell" is hades and means the
                     same as the Hebrew sheol—the grave, the abode of the dead.
                     Modern versions bring this thought out: "the powers of death
                     shall not prevail against it" (RSV); "the powers of death shall
                     never conquer it" (NEB). What is indicated here is that the
                     church cannot be restricted or contained by death.
                        Furthermore, the resurrection of Jesus ensures the resurrec-
                     tion of every believer. Thus death is not a barrier to enjoying
                     fellowship with Christ throughout eternity.

                       How have true Christians looked at death? Rev. 14:13;
                     12:11.

                        Many have looked upon death as a release from the woes of
                     this present world. When threatened with death, they preferred
                     to die rather than to give up their faith. Thus the church grew as
                     persecution increased, and it was truly said that the "blood of
                     martyrs is the seed of the church."

                       What could be more frustrating to the enemies of the church
                     than that the strongest weapon available against man—
                     death—is useless? Dan. 3:16-18; 1 Cor. 15:54, 55.

                        No wonder that the devil is angry (Rev. 12:12) and the mem-
                     bers of the church are victorious. No wonder that all heaven
                     rejoices to see men and women faithful to their Lord and Master
                     even unto death.
                        Death is the wages of sin. The gift of God is eternal life.
                     Therefore all those who renounce sin and accept the provision
                     God has made for their salvation have no fear of death. In Christ
                     the church never ceases to exist. Men may come and men may
                     go, but the church goes on forever.
                        The spirit of the church is exemplified in the words of Latimer
                     to Ridley when both men were being tied to the stake for their
                     faith: "Be of good comfort, we shall this day light such a candle,
                     by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out."—
                     Works of Hugh Latimer, vol. 1, p. xiii; quoted in The Great
                     Controversy, p. 249.

                     you try other than threatening believers with death?

                                                                      January 9
          Part 6     What extraordinary powers did Jesus extend to His church?
     AUTHORITY
     CONFIRMED       "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
                   whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:
                   and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
                   heaven" (Matt. 16:19).

                     Since Jesus delegated this same authority to the disciples on
                   a later occasion (Matt. 18:18; John 20:23), no one should sup-
                   pose that it was limited to Peter.
                     Keys certainly imply authority—ability to open and close
                   doors. But when we consider that this authority is controlled by
                   Heaven, the likelihood of arbitrariness or injustice is lessened.

                     How might one view the claim that Peter alone opened the
                   doors of the kingdom to the crowds assembled at Pentecost
                   and to those at the home of Cornelius? Acts 2:14; 10:44.

                     Peter definitely took a leading role at Pentecost and later
                   opened doors of faith to Gentiles and Jews (Acts 2:14-47; 10;
                   11:1-18). He was not alone in leadership, however, and in some
                   areas other disciples carried the gospel "keys." When people
                   hear the gospel and accept it, their sins are forgiven; and thus
                   they are loosed from the condemnation of death. If, however,
                   the hearers reject the testimony given them, they are still bound
                   in their sins.

                     What is the relationship between knowledge of truth and
                   responsibility for truth? John 9:41.

                     Jesus made it clear to the Pharisees that a person who is blind
                   cannot be held responsible for what he does not see. But if a
                   person sees and says that he sees, then he is responsible for
                   responding properly to what he has seen.

                    Why did Jesus tell His disciples not to make it known that He
                   was the Messiah? (See Matt. 16:20.)

                     There are apparently times when truths held by the church
                   should not be openly discussed because of prejudice, unbelief,
                   and other hindrances. Timing can be a key factor in the prog-
                   ress of "present truth."

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is being brutally frank seldom, if ever, a Christian vir-
                   tue?

The Called of God            LESSON 3                                     ❑ Sunday
                                                                          January 11
              Part 1     In preparing Abraham to be a witness for Him, what did God
           TO LEAVE    ask him to do?
         THE WORLD
                         "By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
                       which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and
                       he went out, not knowing whither he went" (Heb. 11:8).

                         In the days of Abraham, God had to make a new beginning.
                       Although idolatry and rebellion in the building of the Tower of
                       Babel had been checked by the confusion of languages (Gen.
                       11:1-7), idolatry was once again becoming widespread; and
                       even the family of Abraham was being influenced by the hea-
                       thenism all around.
                         In order to preserve the true faith, God called Abraham out of
                       his home country to go to a land where he would be a stranger.
                       There he could witness to the true God and provide an example
                       of true worship. Abraham obeyed, although in doing so he did
                       not know where following the call would lead him. He exercised
                       an exemplary faith, which was to be the secret of success in all
                       his relations with God.
                         In this experience note the following:
                        1. God takes the initiative. It is God who calls; men and women
                       merely follow instructions.
                        2. God has a plan and a purpose. He wants to preserve a knowl-
                       edge of truth.
                        3. God uses the human instrument to achieve His objectives.
                        4. God does not always reveal the details of His plans. Man
                       must act in faith, trusting God all the way.
                        5. The result of trusting obedience is a life of blessing.

                         What promise does God make to those who hear His call
                       and obey it? Isa. 41:8-10.

                         The promise is made to Israel and the descendants of Abra-
                       ham in particular, but it applies to all who obey God. Unfortu-
                       nately the children of Israel did not live up to their privileges,
                       and they were rejected as a people (not as individuals). Now it is
                       those who truly accept Christ who are heirs of all the promises.
                       (See Rom. 10:9-13; Gal. 3:29.)

THINK IT THROUGH         Is it always necessary to leave home in order to witness for
                       God? What must a person be willing to leave in order to
                       receive a proper preparation for witnessing?

                         We must not allow the love of the world to come between us
                       and God.

The Called of God           LESSON 3                                       ❑ Monday
                                                                           January 12
               Part 2   What does God want us to be in relation to Him?
               TO BE
               GOD'S    "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
              PEOPLE then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people:
                      for all the earth is mine" (Ex. 19:5).

                         God wants a special people to whom and through whom He
                       can reveal truth and salvation. He is the owner of all the earth; so
                       in a sense all people are His. But He desires a special group
                       which will enjoy a special relationship with Him. This group of
                       people will be obedient to His commands and will accept the
                       terms of a mutual agreement whereby they and all mankind will
                       be benefited.

                         What does God say He will do for His people? Deut. 7:13-15.

                          God is in a position to give us more than we can ask or think.
                       (See Eph. 3:20.) There is only one condition—accept His author-
                       ity. When we recognize that God is God, it is foolish to go
                       contrary to His wishes. When we know that God is love, we have
                       no need to question His demands or wishes. It becomes a
                       privilege to accept His promises and serve Him.

                          What does God expect of His people? 1 Peter 2:9-12.

                         God's people cannot engage in anything that defiles their
                       characters. They are to be a holy people—that is, a people set
                       apart for and by God. They must reflect God's holiness. (See
                       1 Peter 1:16.)
                         "Satan is using every means to make crime and debasing vice
                       popular. We cannot walk the streets of our cities without en-
                       countering flaring notices of crime presented in some novel, or
                       to be acted at some theater. The mind is educated to familiarity
                       with sin. The course pursued by the base and vile is kept before
                       the people in the periodicals of the day, and everything that can
                       excite passion is brought before them in exciting stories. . . .
                          "Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even
                       with those who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as
                       did those of the heathen. There are indeed few among them that
                       Satan does not turn to account in destroying souls."—
                       Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 459.

THINK IT THROUGH          Why do some people consider it a hardship to be separate
                       from the world? What compensations come to the righteous?

                                                                        January 13
          Part 3   What contrast exists between those in the church and those
     FROM DARK- outside it?
           NESS
       TO LIGHT    "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
                 nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
                 praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
                 marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).

                      To be in darkness is to be in a state of ignorance. It is to live a
                   life in which one has inklings of right and wrong but no certain
                   knowledge—in which one may speculate as to his origin but can
                   never be sure. It is a life in which one's destiny is also in doubt—
                   in which pain and suffering have reality but no meaning. Since
                   man is a reasoning creature, he finds such a life frustrating. In
                   his efforts to know the truth about himself and the world in
                   which he lives, he finds confusion.
                      By contrast, God has called a people to come out of ignor-
                   ance, leaving behind all frustration and despair. These people
                   now live in an atmosphere of understanding which is likened to
                   wonderful light. God has revealed to them where they have
                   come from, why there is conflict, what is right and what is
                   wrong, how they can be freed from guilt and its burden, and the
                   glorious destiny He has in store for them and for all who will
                   believe. Life now has meaning and challenge.
                      Furthermore, they know what God is like, because they see
                   Him in Jesus Christ and feel constrained to love and worship
                   Him. They also know that in Christ they can have power to
                   overcome sin and enjoy lives of usefulness and dignity.

                    How does Peter contrast the Christian with the non-
                   Christian? 1 Peter 2:10.

                      To be among the people of God means to have a sense of
                   belonging—to be part of an organization. It means to have a
                   sense of identity—to be part of a recognizable group. One
                   knows to whom he may go for help, where he may be "at home."
                      By contrast, some people outside the church have no group
                   to which they can relate with confidence. They are indi-
                   vidualized to such an extent that they feel they have to depend
                   on themselves wholly for everything in life. It is a lonely feeling, a
                   frustrating feeling of utter helplessness.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the source of light for the Christian? How can he be
                   sure that he does not walk in darkness?

The Called of God       LESSON 3                                 ❑   Wednesday
                                                                     January 14
          Part 4    When Jesus met those who were honestly seeking to know
          TO BE    God and His will, what did He ask them to do?
      DISCIPLES
                      "The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and
                   findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me" (John 1:43).

                    When Jesus began His ministry, one of the first things He did
                   was to call, as followers, men who were seeking the kingdom.

                     Who were the first two to follow Jesus after John the Baptist
                   pointed out the "Lamb of God"? John 1:35-40.

                      The good news of finding the Messiah, Andrew brings to his
                   brother Peter. Philip brings the same to Nathanael, and thus is
                   formed a nucleus to which others are added.
                      The disciples were not learned men, but they were devout
                   men. They had been influenced by the teaching of John the
                   Baptist. They were students of the Old Testament and knew that
                   the Messiah should come. With this as a basis they were recep-
                   tive to the call. Their minds were open to light; and when they
                   saw the evidence that Jesus had to offer them, they left all and
                   followed Him. (See Matt. 4:18-22.)

                    Do we have an example of one who did not follow Jesus?
                   Mark 10:17-22.

                     To follow Jesus is to recognize Him for what He is. The early
                   disciples had no doubt that Jesus was the Messiah. They also
                   recognized His authority; and when they were invited to leave
                   their occupations and join Jesus in His ministry, they did not
                   hesitate but immediately conformed. They had many things yet
                   to learn of Jesus, but they placed themselves in the right envi-
                   ronment and listened to His teaching. They did not always
                   understand what Jesus had to say, but they asked questions.
                   Although they made mistakes, there was no question where
                   their loyalty lay. Thus they were able to fulfill God's purpose for
                   and through them.
                     By contrast, the young man who had great riches found it very
                   difficult to follow Jesus. His priority was on his possessions
                   rather than on doing the will of God. Jesus loved him (verse 21).
                   He was a young man anxious to do what was right. He appar-
                   ently had considerable self-control, keeping the command-
                   ments—outwardly, at least—all through his life. But he lacked
                   one thing; and, so far as we know, that one thing kept him out of
                   the kingdom.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can the dedication of Christ's true followers be mea-
                   sured? Why is it difficult to give up one's possessions?

The Called of God        LESSON 3                                    ❑   Thursday
                                                                       January 15
           Part 5     What power and task did Jesus assign to His disciples?
         CALLED
       TO SERVE       "When he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
                    them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
                    heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease" (Matt.
                    10:1).

                       The disciples were not merely to follow Jesus and rejoice in
                    His presence. This might have been a pleasant experience, but it
                    would have been a selfish one. They were given power to do the
                    work Jesus had been doing—healing the sick, casting out dev-
                    ils, and announcing the advent of the kingdom of heaven. Since
                    they had received these things freely, they were to offer them to
                    others freely. (See Matt. 10:8.)

                      What instructions from the Lord were to guide His disciples
                    in their missionary journeys? Matt. 10:1-20.

                       The disciples were not to impose themselves on others, al-
                    though if they were welcomed they were to accept the hospital-
                    ity. They were not to make elaborate provisions for themselves,
                    because they were entitled to support for the service they of-
                    fered. They were to maintain a certain dignity in their work and a
                    sense of its importance, because God was behind it and would
                    remember those who rejected their ministry.
                       They were to do their work circumspectly, because there
                    would be those who would try to bring dishonor to their cause;
                    but they were not to be afraid if brought before councils and
                    governors and shamefully treated. They were not to worry about
                    what to say on such occasions, because the Holy Spirit would
                    give them words to speak. In other words, they were ambas-
                    sadors for Christ, and their testimony would be the basis of
                    judgment to those who heard them.

                      What is likely to result from the service of Christ's follow-
                    ers? Matt. 10:34-36.

                       Perhaps the hardest opposition to take is the persecution that
                    comes from members of one's own family. But the lesson Jesus
                    is teaching His disciples is that no earthly tie should separate
                    one from a wholehearted dedication to the service of God.
                    When it comes to our relationship to Him, this must take priority
                    over everything else.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why does the coming of the Prince of Peace so often mean
                    the bringing of a sword into human relationships?

The Called of God       LESSON 3                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                       January 16
          Part 6     How did Paul exhort the Thessalonians to behave?
       TO WALK
      WORTHILY       "That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you
                   unto his kingdom and glory" (1 Thess. 2:12).

                     Since God has graciously called us to share His kingdom and
                   His glory, it is only fitting that we live to show we deserve such
                   an honor.
                     Paul has already indicated to the Thessalonians what he
                   means by living lives worthy of God's call. (Read 1 Thess. 2:2-
                   11.) He himself had set the example:
                     1. He had preached the gospel boldly, without error, with
                   perfectly pure motives, and without deceit (verse 3).
                     2. He was not out to please men or to win their favor; he aimed
                   to please God, who alone is our righteous Judge (verse 4).
                     3. He never used flattery; he did not pretend to be other than
                   he was. He did not work for personal gain or hide his motives
                   (verse 5).
                     4. He did not seek the gifts of men or even their praise. In fact,
                   though he had every right as an apostle to be supported by
                   them, he scrupulously avoided being a burden (verse 6).
                      5. He was solicitous of others' welfare and cared for them so
                   much that he was willing not only to share the good news with
                   them, but also to spend and be spent for their sake (verses 7, 8).
                     6. He worked day and night, living a holy, righteous, and
                   blameless life. He was like a father in his constant care for his
                   spiritual children (verses 9-12).

                     What other characteristics does Paul enumerate as part of
                   being true to our calling? Eph. 4:1-3.

                     1.Humility. Being called by God is a great privilege, but we
                   have done nothing to deserve it. It should never be a basis for
                   pride.
                      2. Gentleness. This comes from a strong desire not to hurt
                   anyone. We recognize how fragile some aspects of life can be;
                   so we touch gently and lovingly.
                      3. Patience. People do not always act as they ought; they do
                   not react as quickly as we would like. Hence we need to be
                   patient. If we are truly loving, we can bear many things.
                      4. Maintaining unity and peace. How easy it is to quarrel and
                   fight. Blessed are the peacemakers and those who know how to
                   bring about peace between contending parties.

THINK IT THROUGH    What enables anyone to walk worthy of the calling with
                   which he has been called? (See Gal. 5:22, 23.)

             Part 1     What was the message of the apostles after Pentecost?
        CONFESSING
             JESUS      "Daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
                      teach and preach Jesus Christ" (Acts 5:42).

                         By personal experience the apostles were convinced that
                      Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah foretold in the Old Testa-
                      ment. He was born in Bethlehem as Micah had foretold (Micah
                      5:2). He was born of a virgin as Isaiah had predicted (Isa. 7:14;
                      Matt. 1:23). He was Emmanuel—God with us—and His name,
                      Jesus, indicated that He was the One who would save His people
                      from their sins (Matt. 1:21-23). He had come "unto his own, and
                      his own received him not" (John 1:11), but all those who had
                      accepted His claims were given "power to become the sons of
                      God" (verse 12).

                        When this same Jesus had been crucified on the cross,
                      what act of God made Him "to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to
                      give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins"? (Acts.
                      5:31).

                        Not only were the apostles witnesses to Christ's sacrifice, but
                      the Holy Spirit also testified of it in and through those who
                      believed in what God had done (verse 32).
                        The gospel of Christ was an astounding message to the
                      Jewish people, but it was the truth, and the apostles could not
                      do anything but preach it. It was central to all their teaching.
                      When asked to desist from such teaching, they replied, "We
                      ought to obey God rather than men" (verse 29). When beaten for
                      their conduct, they rejoiced in their experiences and continued
                      to teach and preach every day (verses 41, 42).

                       What kind of preaching was done at Antioch, and what name
                      was given to the disciples there? Acts 11:20, 26.

                        "The name [Christian] was given them because Christ was the'
                      main theme of their preaching, their teaching, and their conver-

                      tumely and torture imposed upon Him by His enemies, and the
                      Godlike pity with which He had prayed for those who perse-
                      cuted Him. . . .

          Part 2     Why should members of the true church relate helpfully to
       LOYAL TO    one another?
         TRUTH
                     "Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with
                   his neighbour: for we are members one of another" (Eph.
                   4:25).

                      Those who belong to the true church are honest and
                   straightforward in all their dealings. The church considers it
                   important to uphold the truth and be loyal to it. (Note the injunc-
                   tion of Jesus in Matthew 5:37.)

                     What claim did Jesus make for Himself? John 14:6.

                     Many theories of truth are set forth, and some may feel there is
                   no adequate answer to the question, What is truth? (See John
                   18:38.) But the Christian is positive that there is an answer to the
                   question, and the answer is the Person—Jesus Christ.

                     What do we see when we see Jesus Christ? John 1:1, 14.

                      John testified that in Jesus we see God made flesh and dwell-
                   ing among us, full of grace and truth. He contrasts Moses and
                   Jesus and says that Moses brought the law, but "grace and truth
                   came by Jesus Christ" (verse 17).
                       Thus the true church presents the truth as seen in Christ
                   Jesus. We see the love of God for fallen humanity in the sacrifice
                   made on the cross. We learn of one who does not abide in the
                   truth, but is a liar and the father of lies (John 8:44). Thus only two
                   stands can be taken by anyone—for the truth, or against it—for
                   the revelation of God in the Bible and in Jesus Christ, or against
                   it.

                     What does the Christian discover to be God's key to free-
                   dom? John 8:32.

                     When he knows the truth about God and himself and acts
                   upon this truth, he can be free from the guilt and power of sin.
                   Through the truth he can be sanctified, according to the prayer
                   of Jesus (John 17:17).
                     By contrast, there are those who not only reject the truth but
                   who also suppress it. (See 1 Timothy 4.) Although they know
                   about God, they refuse to accept the revelation that has been
                   made about Him, and they refuse to be grateful for all that God
                   has done.

THINK IT THROUGH     On what basis can we say that in the Bible we have the truth,
                   the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

          Part 3     What is the relationship of Christian words and deeds ac-
       DOERS OF    cording to James?
      THE WORD
                     "Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
                   your own selves" (James 1:22).

                     The true church has practicing Christians!
                     James does not deny that a Christian has experienced birth.
                   He stresses the importance of this experience. He says that "of
                   his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be
                   a kind of firstfruits of his creatures" (verse 18). The Christian is
                   not a Christian merely because he is born into a Christian family.
                   He is not a Christian because he has learned Christian habits of
                   conduct and has kept the law insofar as anyone can judge. He is
                   not a Christian because he knows Christian doctrines. He is a
                   Christian only from the moment that he has been born into the
                   family of Christ.
                     The true church expects that its members will live up to the
                   principles taught in the Bible. This may limit the number of
                   members that a church accepts, and the church may be very
                   small in some areas. But the church that accepts and condones
                   members who live in open violation of the law of God is certainly
                   not living up to its calling. The church recognizes that member-
                   ship carries with it an obligation to do what is right and to right
                   any wrongs.

                     How does Paul compare the doers of the law with those who
                   are hearers only? Rom. 2:13.

                      Paul makes it clear that a person is judged according to what
                   he knows and how he relates to truth. He may not know much
                   about the law of God, but he does know instinctively the differ-
                   ence between right and wrong, and he has chosen to do what is
                   right. Therefore God can accept him; he has lived up to the light
                   that he has.

                     Jesus also contrasts words and deeds. Matt. 7:21-27.

                     The action referred to in the text is doing the will of God. A
                   form of piety that merely pays lip service to God will not avail
                   anything in the judgment. Living in harmony with God's will is
                   the criterion for entrance into the kingdom.

THINK IT THROUGH    What is the connection between doing God's will and the
                   Christian life?

                                                                  January 21
          Part 4     What did Jesus say would be a distinguishing characteristic
       REACTING    of His disciples?
        IN LOVE
                     "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
                   have love one to another" (John 13:35).

                     Human love is a characteristic implanted by God. But the love
                   Jesus is talking about is more than human love. It is human to
                   love the members of our family—to love those who love us. But
                   Jesus is talking about a love like the love of God—a love that
                   extends to enemies and to the unlovely.

                     What significant truth underlies the summary of Matthew
                   22:37-40.

                      To keep the commandments in a legalistic sense is compara-
                   tively easy. A young man who came to Jesus claimed to have
                   kept the law, and the claim was not denied. (See Matt. 19:20,21.)
                   But the young man had not learned to keep them out of love.

                     Think upon Paul's evaluation of the way of love. 1 Corinthi-
                   ans 13.

                     When we read this chapter, we begin to realize that talents,
                   self-sacrifice, and even faith in God are of no avail unless the
                   motivating principle of life is love. It is outgoing toward all,
                   regardless of the character of the person.

                     Consider the principle on which John shows the relation-
                   ship between love to God and love to man. 1 John 4:20, 21.

                      Some claim that they love God and are willing to do anything
                   for Him. But their relationships with their fellow Christians are
                   anything but pleasant. Full of criticism and anxious to see disci-
                   pline exercised on others, they are unable to put themselves in
                   the shoes of their failing friends. They lack even the milk of
                   human kindness. Such people have a distorted vision of their
                   relationship with God, because if they truly loved God they
                   would reflect His love in their relationships with others.
                      The true church is always a friendly church. It expresses
                   concern for its neighbors. It cares for its members. Such a
                   church exercises God's presence in the community and fulfills
                   one of its most important functions.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why cannot love condone iniquity or excuse sin?

                                                                       January 22
          Part 5     What important request does the psalmist make of God?
        SEEKING
        REVIVAL      "Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
                   thee? Shew us thy mercy, 0 Lord, and grant us thy salvation"
                   (Ps. 85:6, 7).

                      The psalmist is grateful that God has brought His people back
                   from captivity and has forgiven their sins (verses 1, 2). Now he
                   wants to feel the peace of God in his heart to be revived in spirit.
                   He recognizes that salvation is the most important thing for him
                   and that in order to enjoy this blessing he must trust implicitly in
                   the merits of Jesus. As the fruit of faith, he walks in the ways of
                   righteousness.
                      The danger always exists that we may take God for granted,
                   accept His blessings as a matter of course, keep His command-
                   ments out of force of habit, and follow a pattern of worship
                   because, it has been handed down by tradition. In fact, we may
                   be doing things that seem right to us but which are indeed
                   contrary to what He has declared.

                     What counsel does Paul give to those who are too sure of
                   themselves? 1 Cor. 10:12.

                     Arrogance is dangerous. A church may feel it is the true
                   church; but if it is not willing to accept valid criticism and to
                   make changes accordingly, it loses the presence of God.

                     Study the evidence that the church has always had to re-
                   form itself. Rev. 2:4, 14, 16, 20; 3:2, 16.

                      The church is wholly dependent on a relationship with God.
                   This relationship must be renewed all the time. It cannot afford
                   to be indifferent. Here are some questions to ask:
                     1. Are church leaders—called of God and endowed with
                   spiritual gifts—to lead, or are they mere professionals with
                   training and skill but no true charisma?
                      2. Are the members dedicated to God and His service
                   throughout the week, or are they merely churchgoers, having a
                   form of godliness but denying the real power of the gospel?
                   (See 2 Tim. 3:5.)
                     3. Is the church making useful changes to meet new chal-
                   lenges, or is it tied to ritual and tradition?
                     4. Is the local church a place where the Spirit of God is active,
                   or is it merely a social club attended for the prestige that it may
                   provide its members?

THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways is reformation more than change for the sake
                   of change?

          Part 6     What did Jesus show to be one purpose of His work?
          DOING
    GOD'S WORK      "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
                   which thou gayest me to do" (John 17:4).

                      Although Jesus was the Son of God, He did not attribute glory
                   to Himself; His whole life was dedicated to the glory of His
                   Father. He revealed the love of God, set forth the principles of
                   the kingdom, called sin by its right name, and bore our sins on
                   the cross.
                      The church on earth is to continue the work which Christ
                   began. It is to represent Christ to the world. Only as it does this
                   can it be recognized as the true church.
                      What are some important characteristics of the work of the
                   church?
                      1. The church owes its origin and life to God, who is active in
                   its midst. Its members are born from above and are Spirit-filled.
                      2. The church must be active in the ways Jesus would be were
                   He here on earth. It should be concerned about sheep without a
                   shepherd, about the lost, about releasing the captive from his
                   sins, about being the agent of reconciliation and the depository
                   of God's grace.
                      3. The church must manifest the spirit of Christ: His humility
                   (Phil. 2:5-8), His service (John 13:4, 5, 12-17), His acceptance of
                   the cross as the means of redemption.
                      4. The last part of God's church will proclaim the messages of
                   the three angels who present God's last call to mankind. (See
                   Rev. 14:6-12.)

                     Note Jesus' warning against seeking popularity. Luke 6:26.

                     Success is sometimes measured by size and popularity. But
                   this is not true of the church. The church that supposes it is
                   doing God's will because it has a large influx of members may
                   be mistaken. While the church is charged with the responsibility
                   of making disciples, its mission is basically that of bearing a
                   witness. Hopefully, many who hear will also accept the gospel
                   invitation. But we may be sure that there will be many who will
                   ignore it, because the way of righteousness is narrow, while the
                   way of destruction is broad.

          Part 1   Consider Jesus' pastoral picture of His relationship to His
      SHEEP AND people.
      SHEPHERD
                   "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
                 for the sheep" (John 10:11).

                     The relationship of Jesus to His people is that of a shepherd to
                   his sheep. This metaphor was well understood in Bible lands
                   because there were shepherds and sheep everywhere. It was
                   also well understood that there were bad shepherds and good
                   ones, sheep that were well cared for and sheep that were at the
                   mercy of wolves. The sheep usually knew their shepherd by his
                   voice and responded to his call. They could depend on him to
                   lead them to good pasture, to refreshing water, and to the fold at
                   night.

                     In what portrayal by the psalmist was the Lord presented as
                   his constant helper? Psalm 23.

                     The Shepherd provided the psalmist with his daily temporal
                   needs. But He went beyond this, because He also led him in the
                   paths of righteousness and restored his soul when he was
                   discouraged because of sin. The psalmist was not afraid of
                   death, nor did he feel any dread of evil coming upon him, for he
                   knew that the Shepherd was with him to guide and correct him.
                   Thus he felt unusually blessed, with a sense of victory over his
                   enemies and the assurance that he would dwell in the house of
                   the Lord forever.
                     What are some of the parallels between sheep and people?
                   The likeness of people to sheep is a very close one. Like sheep,
                   people are dependent on their leaders. Like sheep, they are
                   sometimes treated well and sometimes badly. Sometimes they
                   are lost and need to be found. They need to be treated gently
                   when they are with young. The lambs often need to be carried
                   over rough terrain.
                     Sheep have a tendency to go astray. They have no means of
                   self-protection except as the shepherd reaches out with his
                   crook and saves them.
                     Jesus said that He laid down His life for His sheep. This is the
                   supreme sacrifice. Many people herd sheep for the good they
                   can get out of them. When danger threatens their own lives, they
                   run away. They are more concerned about themselves than
                   about the sheep. It this respect Jesus is entirely different.

THINK IT THROUGH     How do you differentiate between the voice of the shepherd
                   and the voice of the hireling?

                                                                          January 26
             Part 2   What metaphor from plant life did Jesus use to illustrate the
         BRANCHES relation between Himself, His people, and God?
          AND VINE
                      "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman"
                    (John 15:1).

                       If the illustration of sheep and shepherd had been all-
                     sufficient, there would have been no need for another. But
                     Jesus wanted to bring out the closeness that must exist
                     between Himself and His people—a closeness like that of a
                     branch in the vine.

                       When the spies rejoined the children of Israel in the wilder-
                     ness after they had been to Canaan, what did the huge bunch
                     of grapes they carried indicate? Num. 13:23.

                       The vine is an abundant, well-known, carefully cultivated
                     plant in Palestine. It produces the grape which yields wine, and
                     this brings refreshment to many a thirsty soul.

                       In the metaphor, what gracious work is done by the Father?
                     John 15:2.

                       The object of the branch in being connected to the vine is to
                     produce fruit. If the branch does not abide in the vine, it be-
                     comes fruitless, dies, and is disposed of.
                       The life of the branch is in the sap that comes from the vine. It
                     cannot glory in itself because of the fruit it bears. It bears fruit
                     naturally. When there is plentiful fruit, the glory comes to the
                     husbandman.

                       What Old Testament illustration parallels that of the vine?
                     isa. 5:1-7.

                       The children of Israel were likened to a vine planted in a
                     choice vineyard. They should have brought forth good fruit, but
                     they did not. What a tragedy it is when that which God has
                     created fails to fulfill His plan and proves a failure!
                       The church is God's vineyard, in which Jesus is the vine and
                     the members of the church are branches. Only if the members
                     are in Christ as the branch is in the vine can they bring forth fruit
                     to God's glory. Will the church measure up to its privileges?

                                                                       January 27
          Part 3     What illustration does Peter employ to describe the church
     STONES AND    in its various relationships?
       BUILDING
                     "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
                   holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to
                   God by Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 2:5).

                      Stones and buildings suggest something more permanent
                   than sheep and shepherds or branches and vines. Hence we
                   find in this parallel used by Peter a suggestion of stability. The
                   church still involves a relationship, but it is one that can last
                   forever.

                     What purposes might Paul have in using the figure of a
                   building in connection with the church? 1 Cor. 3:9.

                      The apostle describes himself as a worker with God, engaged
                   in building. The first thing he does is to lay a foundation, and the
                   only foundation that can be laid for the church is Jesus Christ
                   (verse 11).
                      Jesus pointed out to His disciples the importance of a founda-
                   tion. (See Matt. 7:24-27.) The wise man built on a rock, but the
                   foolish man built on sand. The church is built on the Rock,
                   Christ Jesus.

                     To whom does Paul refer as the foundation of a holy temple
                   and as the Chief Cornerstone? Eph. 2:20-22.

                      A cornerstone was a key stone to hold the rest of the building
                   together. A temple is the dwelling place of God; so this stone is
                   vital to the whole building.
                     It is interesting to note that Jesus shares the foundation with
                   the apostles and prophets, a generosity typical of Him. (See
                   Rev. 3:21.)
                     Peter may have been dissatisfied with the idea of stones to
                   represent people; so he writes of "living" stones (1 Peter 2:4).
                   The building is therefore a living entity. But just as stones are
                   bound to one another and support one another, so the members
                   of the church are bound together by a unity that cannot be
                   broken without destroying the whole edifice.
                     The figure of stone lends itself to other concepts. The stone
                   can be precious (1 Peter 2:6). It may be rejected, as Jesus was by
                   His own people (verse 7). It can be a stone of stumbling, as Jesus
                   was to the Jewish people. (See Rom. 9:32, 33.) But the assur-
                   ance is that the one who believes in Jesus will never be put to
                   shame.

THINK IT THROUGH    What lessons do you draw from the inadequacy of any one
                   metaphor to describe the church?

                                                                    January 28
          Part 4   What gospel message did Jesus take to Galilee after the
       KINGDOM imprisonment of John?
       AND KING
                   "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:
                 repent ye, and believe the gospel" (Mark 1:15).

                     The kingdom of God is another metaphor to describe the
                   relationships that exist in the church. The kingdom is not of this
                   world, but it is nevertheless a real entity. Jesus acknowledged to
                   Pilate that He was a king. (See Mark 15:2.)

                     In what series of parables does Jesus describe what occurs
                   in the kingdom of heaven? Matt. 13:18-52.

                      The reception of the seed of truth varies with individuals:
                   some have hearts hardened like beaten paths, others cannot
                   withstand persecution, still others permit the cares of this world
                   to determine their destiny, but some accept the word of truth
                   and bring forth fruit in their lives.
                      Again, the kingdom of heaven will have in it both good seed
                   and weeds. Should the weeds be pulled up immediately? The
                   answer is No—because of the danger of hurting the good seed.
                   A time will come when this work of judgment can be done safely
                   and effectively.
                      The kingdom of heaven is likened to leaven that works quietly
                   and unseen, but powerfully. It is like treasure hidden in a field or
                   like a pearl that a merchant will make a huge sacrifice to obtain.
                   It may even be likened to a dragnet that takes in good and bad,
                   with only the good surviving.

                     How does Paul describe his heavenly citizenship? Phil.
                   3:20.

                     What did Daniel see, through Nebuchadnezzar's dream, as
                   the climax of all earthly kingdoms? Dan. 2:35, 44.

                     The God of heaven sets up this kingdom. To be a citizen of
                   God's kingdom is surely the greatest privilege that anyone can
                   enjoy.
                     The Christian finds no abiding city here in this world, but for
                   him the enlargement of the kingdom of God is the highest goal
                   for which he can strive.
                     Augustine saw the church as the City of God. His concept of
                   such a city on earth was mistaken. But to the Christian the
                   church is an earnest (a pledge) of the kingdom of heaven.

THINK IT THROUGH     By what means may a person who is an active citizen of
                   some country in this world also obtain citizenship in heaven?

         Part 5   While assuring the Epheslans that they were no longer
     HOUSEHOLD aliens, into what family did Paul include them?
        OF GOD
                  "Ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowciti-
                zens with the saints, and of the household of God" (Eph. 2:19).

                     The concept of the household brings the interrelationships of
                   the church members even closer. The church is not a group of
                   unrelated individuals; it is a family group, with alLthe closeness
                   that membership in a family implies.

                     What word from Jesus shocked Nicodemus regarding his
                   part in the kingdom of heaven? John 3:3.

                     Nicodemus, like so many other good people, thought that he
                   would get into the kingdom because of his righteousness—
                   because of his faithful keeping of the law.

                     Why may those who tell lies properly be called the children
                   of the evil one? John 8:44.

                      Children partake of the characteristics of their parents. That
                   is why we have all inherited the traits of fallen Adam. Those who
                   claim to be the children of Abraham should manifest Abraham's
                   characteristics (verse 39). When weare born into the household
                   of God, we must reflect the character of God.

                     What indication does Paul give. of the close relationship
                   binding together members of the household of God? Eph.
                   3:14, 15.

                     We are now brothers and sisters. This is a relationship that
                   involves responsibilities. We are privileged to treat one another
                   as members of the family—with love. If we see a brother who is
                   naked, we must clothe him. (See James 2:15, 16.) We must be
                   careful not to cause a weak brother to stumble. Paul states it
                   emphatically when he says that if we sin against a brother we sin
                   against Christ. (See 1 Cor. 8:12.) We must be willing to restrict
                   our own liberties for the sake of our fellow members (verse 13).
                   As brothers and sisters we should settle our own disputes and
                   not take them to courts where unbelievers are called upon to
                   judge. (See 1 Cor. 6:5-7.) The Christian should choose rather to
                   be defrauded and to suffer at the hands of his fellow Christians
                   than to go to court.

THINK IT THROUGH     What advantages or disadvantages do you see in calling
                   members of the church by the title of "brother" and "sister"
                   rather than by some secular title?

                                                                       January 30
          Part 6     What striking figure of speech did Paul use to describe the
       HEAD AND    true nature of the church?
          BODY
                     "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular"
                   (1 Cor. 12:27).

                      Paul elaborates on this figure of speech in his letter to the
                   Ephesians. He says that God "hath put all things under his feet,
                   and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which
                   is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all" (Eph. 1:22,
                   23).
                      The metaphor of a body is very apt as applied to the church.
                   Here are some principles worth noting:
                      1.Just as a body cannot operate without a head, so the church
                   cannot live without Christ.
                      2. Just as the body has many members, each unique in its
                   function, yet all contributing to the_ life of the whole, so in the
                   church there are different gifts, each ministering to the whole;
                   many nationalities, but one body. (See 1 Cor. 12:12, 13.)
                      3. No member can claim priority over any other member in the
                   body, nor should anyone want to be the only member. This
                   would be a negation of the body. (See verses 15-17, 21.)
                      4. All the members of a body are so related that if one member
                   suffers, the rest of the members suffer (verse 26).
                      5. There are three "gifts" that all must exercise: Faith, hope,
                   and love, and the greatest of these is love. (See 1 Corinthians
                   13.)

                     What ambassador role shows the close interrelation
                   between Jesus and His disciples? Matt. 10:40.

                     To be rejected of men is not easy. But when this happens, we
                   may find comfort in knowing that Jesus was also rejected. (See
                   the experience of Samuel in 1 Sam. 8:7.) It is good to know that
                   Jesus identifies with us so that He, as the Head, shares with the

                   grieving over its failures.
                     Although Jesus is in heaven, He is also present on the earth in
                   and through His church. And although He is the Head of the
                   church, He is not conditioned by the church. Independent of the
                   church, He nevertheless voluntarily associates with the church
                   in order to make it what it ought to be—His bride.


THINK IT THROUGH     In what particular ways do the figure of the head and the
                   body emphasize the truth that the church is more than a
                   human organization?

                                                                         February 1
             Part 1      Note Paul's greeting to the members of the church at Rome:
            CALLED
            SAINTS       "To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
                       Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
                       Jesus Christ" (Rom. 1:7).

                         In the days of Christ's ministry His followers were called
                      "disciples." Later on they called one another "brethren." Paul
                      calls them "saints," or "holy ones."       .
                         The term saint is not in common use in our day except in
                      reference to those reputedly devout persons who have been
                      canonized by ecclesiastical authority. Therefore several mod-
                      ern versions of the Bible in English use other words to translate
                      the Greek word which the KJV translates as "saints." The Good
                      News Bible (TEV): "called to be his own people." NEB: "called
                      to be his dedicated people." Phillips: "called to be Christ's men
                      and women."
                        We must never lose sight of the idea of sainthood as a charac-
                      teristic of the believers in the church, although we should un-
                      derstand what that sainthood means.

                        How does Paul say a believer becomes a saint? 1 Cor. 1:2.

                         "Sanctified in Christ Jesus": The Greek word for "sanctified"
                      comes from the same root as the word for saint. Because the
                      believer is in Jesus and Jesus is in him, he is a saint.
                         Jesus prayed that His disciples might be sanctified by the
                      truth—the Word of God. (See John 17:17.)

                        What does Paul tell the Thessalonians are key elements In
                      their salvation? 2 Thess. 2:13.

                        Peter confirms this in his letter. (See 1 Peter 1:2.) When Paul
                      was describing his commission to King Agrippa, he said that he
                      was sent to the Gentiles "that they may receive forgiveness of
                      sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
                      that is in me [Christ]" (Acts 26:18).
                        But sanctif ication is also an ongoing process. (See Eph. 5:26.)
                      Sainthood is not the attainment of instant perfection, but a daily
                      growth in grace. That is why members of the church need ever
                      to be reminded to put off "the old man" and "put on the new"
                      (Eph. 4:22-24).

THINK IT THROUGH       What is a member's responsibility to other members who
                      may be struggling against temptation?

      HOLINESS
                     "Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for
                   they were presented before the Lord and have become holy.
                   Let them be a sign to the Israelites" (Num. 16:38, NIV).

                      Read all the verses of Numbers 16 in order to get the
                   background of the story. Note the following points:
                      1. The leaders of the rebellion say that the whole congrega-
                   tion is holy because God is in their midst (verse 3).
                      2. God separated the Levites from the rest of the children of
                   Israel and brought them near to Himself. Apparently Korah did
                   not recognize or care to acknowledge that it is God who ap-
                   points men and women to certain offices. Men and women are
                   to accept from God any privileges or limitations imposed upon
                   them.
                      3. God vindicated His established order, and the leaders of the
                   rebels were destroyed.
                      4. The metal of the censers was considered holy because it
                   had been presented to the Lord.
                      What is your reaction to the story? Do you see how men
                   sometimes turn away from God's order? Do you see that to
                   oppose God is dangerous?

                    What are two examples showing that even the ground is
                   made holy by the presence of God? Ex. 3:5; Joshua 5:15.

                     Because God is holy, everything He touches is holy. The
                   temple was holy because He was in it. (See Matt. 21:13.) The
                   Sabbath is also holy because God is in it in a special sense—
                   meeting His people in this sanctuary in time.

                     What was God's purpose for the children of Israel? Deut.
                   28:9-14.

                     By setting apart the children of Israel as a holy people, God
                   intended to make them a blessing and an example. There was
                   just one condition—that they keep God's commandments.
                      Thus holiness involves God's action of hallowing; it means a
                   separation from other people in terms of blessing; it involves
                   being obedient to God's commands.

THINK IT THROUGH     How recently did you uphold the view that the church build-
                   ing is to be regarded differently from any secular building?

              Part 3     Why are God's people to be holy?
             DIVINE
         IMPERATIVE      "Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy" (1 Peter
                       1:16).

                         Peter tells the believers that they are to be holy in all they do
                       (verse 15). That is, holiness is not to be limited to certain acts of
                       worship or to certain times of the day or week. The Christian is
                       to be holy at all times, in every circumstance, in all his activities.
                       Just as God is holy and never loses His holiness—never sets it
                       aside—so the Christian is to be holy in following the divine
                       pattern.

                         What does Paul say is the will of God for us? 1 Thess. 4:3-8.

                          Paul makes it clear that there is to be a very great difference
                       between the Christian and the man of the world. The latter may
                       engage in unseemly practices, but the Christian cannot. The
                       Christian knows God, whereas the Gentile does not (verse 5).
                       The knowledge of God determines the way of life. When we
                       know that God is love and that He has done so much for us, we
                       respond by doing His will, and we know that His will is to save us
                       from our sins—to save us from the death that is the wages of sin.
                       He wants us to be reflectors of His goodness and holiness,
                       because we have been created in His image.

                         If we are slow to turn our backs on the wicked ways of the
                       world, what must be included in our view of the future? Eccl.
                       12:13, 14; Deut. 4:24.

                           Not that fear should be our primary motivating force, but it
                       can be a healthy reminder! God has certainly given ample warn-
                       ing of the consequences of sin, both to our first parents and to
                       the children of Israel. In 1 Thessalonians 4:6 Paul urges the
                       members in Thessalonica to refrain from defrauding one
                       another because God is an avenger! God has not called us to be
                       His people with the expectation that we shall remain the same
                       as we were before we were called. He calls us so that we may
                       have the privilege of a new creation, a new heart, a new life—a
                       life of doing what is right and pleasing to God. In fact, when we
                       show no regard for our bodies or our calling, we are despising
                       God. That is a careless attitude to take and will result in serious
                       consequences.

THINK IT THROUGH          Will we offend people if we carry holiness into our everyday
                       lives? (Read Rom. 12:14-21.)

A Chosen People       LESSON 6                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   February 4
          Part 4   When the Christian sees that the end is near, what does he
      BELIEVER'S seek to do?
      RESPONSE
                   "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
                 even as he is pure" (1 John 3:3).

                     The Greek word for "purifieth" is in the present tense, which
                   means that the Christian is always seeking to be pure in life,
                   especially as he looks forward to the blessed hope of Jesus'
                   soon return. He knows that he can do nothing to make himself
                   clean; but he also knows that if he comes humbly before the
                   throne of grace and pleads the merits of Christ, God will be
                   gracious, forgiving him and purifying his life.

                     What is God's goal for His children? Heb. 13:20, 21;1 Thess.
                   5:23.

                     "The sanctification of the church is God's object in all His
                   dealings with His people. He has chosen them from eternity,
                   that they might be holy. He gave His Son to die for them, that
                   they might be sanctified through obedience to the truth, di-
                   vested of all the littleness of self."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
                   559.
                     The Christian does not assume that purity is an impossibility.
                   Nor does he consider that he has already attained such a state.
                   He recognizes his weaknesses, but he also has faith in the
                   strength and grace of God while he trusts in Jesus' merits.

                    What are two other outstanding qualities of a Christian?
                   Heb. 12:14.

                      1.The member of the church is apeacemaker. (See Matt. 5:9.)
                   He knows that he lives in a world where tempers flare up quite
                   easily (even his own!). But he knows that nothing is gained and
                   much is lost when tempers take over. Therefore he pours oil on
                   troubled waters. He seeks to understand both sides of a con-
                   troversy, and then he tries to bring them together. This does not
                   mean that he compromises truth, but he knows when to stand
                   firm and when to give in. And he urges others to do the same,
                   using heavenly wisdom and tact. He also knows that the only
                   peace worth having is that which Jesus gives. (See John 14:27.)
                   He is a witness of this peace in his heart.
                      2. At the same time he strives for holiness. This is a personal
                   relationship with God in which he knows that, being right with
                   God, he can be right with his fellowmen.

                   merely being a "goody-goody"?

                                                                         February 5
             Part 5     What kind of conduct did Paul say was fitting for saints?
         PRACTICAL
          ASPECTS       "That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and
                      that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of
                      you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself
                      also" (Rom. 16:2).

                          A study of this verse in context reveals the following princi-
                       ples and relationships:
                         1.Phebe is "our sister." Members of the church are brothers
                       and sisters; they belong to one family. Therefore they relate to
                       one another closely as members of a family.
                         2.Phebe was a "servant of the church." Being a servant of the
                       church is not demeaning, but rather makes one worthy of re-
                       spect and high regard. She was a deaconess, contributing to
                       the needs of church members in both general and specific
                       ways, according to her talent.
                         3. She was to be welcomed "in the Lord." That is, she was to
                       be welcomed as a representative of the Lord. (See Matt. 10:40.)
                      If it is proper to entertain stranger( in case they should be
                      angels (Heb. 13:2), it is most certainly proper that members of
                      the church should be hospitable to one another.
                         4. If Phebe had helped many, it was right that she should be
                      helped whenever she was in need; and she should feel free to
                      find that help among church members. The church community
                      can be a mutual self-help society where everybody can contrib-
                      ute and receive help.
                         5.Phebe is an example of Paul's attitude to women. He did not
                      belittle them, and he recognized the contribution that women
                      can make to the church. In this chapter he mentions several:
                      Priscilla (Rom. 16:3), Mary (verse 6), Tryphena and Tryphosa
                      (were they twins?), and Persis (verse 12). Rufus's mother is
                      mentioned as being a mother to Paul (verse 13)—another of
                      these "mothers in Israel" who are so precious with their
                      thoughtfulness and love. Two others are mentioned: Julia, and
                      the sister of Nereus (verse 15). No wonder Paul could say: In
                      Christ "there is neither male nor female" (Gal. 3:28).
                         Holiness does not mean isolation. It may mean being dif-
                      ferent, but the difference is that a person who is holy is also very
                      devoted to the good of his fellowman.

THINK IT THROUGH        Is there a tendency to consider the contribution of a woman
                      to the church less Important than that of a man? If so, why?

                                                                      February 6
         Part 6      What is the pattern of life set before the church member?
     BLAMELESS
         LIVES       "That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God,
                   without rebuke, In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,
                   among whom ye shine as lights in the world" (Phil. 2:15).

                      In the previous verse Paul says that the Christian should do all
                   things "without murmurings and disputings." Is this possible?
                   Is it not more usual to hear grumblings and complaints—to hear
                   people arguing about this and that? But grumblers are a
                   headache! Nothing seems to please them. For example, con-
                   sider the children of Israel in the wilderness (Ex. 15:24; 16:2;
                   17:3). There is always the opportunity to find fault with some
                   one or some thing.

                     How does the follower of Jesus treat problem members of
                   the church and community? 1 Thess. 5:13-15.

                      The Christian lives a life of serenity, knowing that all things
                   are in the hands of God and that God does all things well. The
                   believer refrains from grumbling lest he dishonor God. He is not
                   interested in arguing until tempers are frayed, and he does not
                   enter into litigation. (See 1 Cor. 6:1-8.)
                      Blameless: The Christian must not only be pure, but others
                   must see that he is pure. He avoids all compromising situations.
                      Harmless: He is absolutely sincere in his relationships with
                   others. His motives are pure. (See James 5:12.)
                      Sons of God: The Christian will have God's attributes of
                   goodness and love. (See Matt. 5:48.)
                      Without rebuke: His life and character can stand the scrutiny
                   of the world and of God. He lives a life of purity and cannot be
                   condemned by any law.
                      This standard of conduct is not just something to be realized
                   in the afterlife. God's life-style must be lived each day—in the
                   midst of a crooked and depraved generation. Such living will
                   stand out like a light in the midst of darkness.

                     How does Peter show that such a life can have a saving
                   influence? 1 Peter 3:1, 2.

                      Holy women in the past set such an example (verse 5). Beauty
                   is not in the outward adorning, but in a gentle and quiet spirit
                   (verse 4).

THINK IT THROUGH     When we think of the high standard of holiness set before
                   the Christian, how can the gospel still be good news?

                                                                           February 8
            Part 1     How does John caution us against making claims that we
         WORDS OF    cannot substantiate?
          CAUTION
                       "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
                     the truth is not in us" (1 John 1:8).

                       The life of the Christian is a mysterious paradox. He is called a
                     saint—one set apart for the life and service of God—yet he must
                     not say he is without sin. (John talks of sin and sins [verses 8, 9].)
                     The closer he is to his Master, the more conscious he is of his
                     faults and shortcomings.

                       Why is the denial of sin the denial of what God has revealed
                     in the Scriptures? Ps. 14:3; Eccl. 7:20.

                       The fall of Adam has left a legacy that everyone inherits. "That
                     which is born of the flesh is flesh" (John 3:6), said Jesus to
                     Nicodemils, pointing out that even though he may have lived a
                     respectable life he could not be a candidate for heaven unless
                     he were born again.
                       The fact that we have a God "faithful and just" to forgive us
                     our sins is one of the basic truths of the gospel. But in order to
                     enjoy this privilege, one must confess his sins. (See 1 John 1:9.)

                       How does James describe our human situation? James 3:2.

                        James points out one area in which we all make mistakes—
                     our speech. Although the tongue is a small member of the body,
                     it can do a considerable amount of damage. (See verse 6.)

                       What basic difference is there between the sinner who is a
                     Christian and the sinner who has not made any commitment to
                     Christ? 1 John 3:9. Read this in the New International Version.

                       The one who is born again cannot habitually sin. He cannot be
                     a slave of sin, continually and helplessly repeating the same sin.
                     (See Rom. 6:14.) He is delivered from this body of death through
                     Christ, and he walks "not after the flesh, but after the Spirit"
                     (Rom. 8:1).

THINK IT THROUGH       When does the Christian reach that state when he is without
                     sin?

                                                                       February 9
          Part 2   How does the prophet Isaiah describe the righteousness of
         FILTHY man?
          RAGS
                   "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses
                 are as filthy rags" (Isa. 64:6).

                      When Adam and Eve recognized their nakedness, they made
                   coverings of fig leaves. But God made for them "coats of skins,
                   and clothed them" (Gen 3:21).
                      Man has always tried to do that which he thought was right.
                   Even Cain brought an offering at the same time as his brother
                   Abel. But his offering was not mixed with faith; it did not indi-
                   cate recognition that he was a sinner and that he needed a
                   Saviour. It merely represented an offering of his own works to
                   God. As such, it could not be accepted by God, because salva-
                   tion comes through faith in Christ, not faith in our works.

                     What in man makes him want to do something to atone for
                   his own wickedness? Rom. 10:3.

                     Some will give up their lives for God; they will give up comfort
                   and riches—even food. But such acts of self-denial can never
                   earn salvation.
                     The Christian is not immune to this human tendency. The
                   history of the church abounds with stories of men and women
                   who have suffered self-inflicted hardships for the gospel. But
                   Paul points out that all this, without love, is nothing. (See 1 Cor.
                   13:3.)

                     Follow the psalmist's expression of the joy of the one who
                   trusts wholly In God. Psalm 32.

                     Note the following points made in this psalm:
                     1. The blessedness of sins forgiven comes only from God
                   (verses 1, 2).
                     2. Confession of sin leads to forgiveness (verse 5).
                     3. The godly are in constant communion with God and thus
                   enjoy God's protection (verses 6, 7).
                     4. God promises to guide and instruct the one who wants to
                   know what he should do in life (verse 8).
                     5. God is abundantly merciful to those who trust fully in Him
                   (verse 10).
                     6. This relationship with God brings joy and happiness; so
                   the righteous should praise God for their privileges (verse 11).

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is the tendency to see merit in works such a dangerous
                   and self-defeating attitude in the church member?

             Part 5   What did Paul say resulted when the Jews broke the law
           TRAGEDY which God had given them?
            OF SIN
                      "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles
                    through you, as it is written" (Rom. 2:24).

                       Read the texts on each side of this verse. Clearly, the Jew had
                     many privileges. He knew the Ten Commandments. He knew
                     that God had chosen his race. He knew God's will because it had
                     been revealed in the Old Testament, and he adopted the high
                     ideals presented (verse 18). In fact, he considered himself able
                     to instruct the ignorant and throw light on topics that were
                     generally not understood (verses 19, 20). Yet—and this is the
                     tragedy of tragedies—he did not take advantage of his
                     privileges. He who knew the law did not keep it. He who knew
                     God's will did not live a life in conformity with it. Thus, instead of
                     being the channel of God's blessing to others, he was the cause
                     of turning people away from God.

                       What distinction did Paul make between those who were
                     Jews racially and those who were Jews spiritually? Rom. 2:29;
                     Gal. 3:29.

                       The parallel with the church is obvious. The church enjoys
                     many privileges. Does it live up to those privileges? Or does it
                     cause people to turn away from God by its faulty witness?

                       What did the children of Israel do that was considered blas-
                     phemy? Eze. 20:27, 28.

                       We blaspheme the name of God when we turn away from the
                     worship of the true God and worship idols instead. An idol need
                     not be wood or stone; it can be anything that we consider more
                     important in our lives than God. It may be position or the honor
                     we gain by letting down God's standards of behavior. When we
                     have such confidence in our own skills that we forget to ask for
                     wisdom or guidance; when we push ahead in projects without
                     waiting for God's leading; when we rationalize our actions in
                     the pursuit of our objectives (in order to excuse them)—these
                     are ways in which we dishonor God, because we put other
                     matters ahead of Him in our system of priorities. Our goals may
                     seem honorable; but unless we put God first, last, and best in
                     our lives we blaspheme His name; and others, seeing us, will
                     also question the ideals we profess.

                     cause of stumbling to others?

Called to Be Saints      LESSON 7                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                     February 13
          Part 6   After his great sin, David's words must have been those of a
        PRAYER true penitent.
     FOR MERCY
                   "Have mercy upon me, 0 God, according to thy lovingkind-
                 ness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot
                 out my transgressions" (Ps. 51:1). (Read the whole psalm.)

                     David offers this prayer after he has sinned in the case of
                   Bathsheba. He knows he is dependent upon the mercies of God.
                   He knows that he needs to be cleansed of sin (verse 2). He does
                   not try to find excuses for his sins. He is ever mindful of them,
                   and he knows that his sin has been primarily against God (verse
                   4). He recognizes his human weakness and presents it as a plea
                   for God to forgive him (verse 5).

                     What does David see as the only solution to his heart prob-
                   lem? Ps. 51:10.

                     "The heart must be renewed by divine grace, or it will be in
                   vain to seek for purity of life. He who attempts to build up a
                   noble, virtuous character independent of the grace of Christ is
                   building his house upon the shifting sand. In the fierce storms of
                   temptation it will surely be overthrown."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 460.
                     David realizes that because of sin he really has no claim on
                   God, that a holy God would normally turn away from him. But he
                   asks not to be forsaken. He wants to have the experience of
                   being restored to favor, and then he will tell other sinners of his
                   experience and thus win them back to God (verse 13).

                     What contrast does David draw between a repentant heart
                   and some sacrifice offered to God? Ps. 51:16, 17.

                      "Man must be emptied of self before he can be, in the fullest
                   sense, a believer in Jesus. When self is renounced, then the
                   Lord can make man a new creature. New bottles can contain the
                   new wine. The love of Christ will animate the believer with new
                   life. In him who looks unto the Author and Finisher of our faith
                   the character of Christ will be manifest."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 280.
                      The church member ever looks to God for mercy, because he
                   recognizes that he is not all that he ought to be, and he finds a
                   gracious God who is abundant in loving-kindness and mercy.
                   Here is the mystery and the paradox of the church: it is not so
                   much a private club for saints as a hospital for sinners.

THINK IT THROUGH    Why does the mercy of God toward him make the Christian
                   more careful not to sin against God or his fellowmen?

                                                                       February 15
            Part 1   How simple the words of Paul emphasizing that there is only
          ONLY ONE one church:

                       "One Lord, one faith, one baptism" (Eph. 4:5).

                        Paul argues that we as church members should maintain
                     peace and unity within our ranks (verse 3). It is so easy to divide
                     up in factions, to find fault with one another, to go off into
                     different directions. Church members should remember that we
                     have only one God who calls, only one Christ to offer hope, only
                     one Spirit who sanctifies, only one gospel to which we can
                     adhere, and only one Lord in whose name and one body into
                     which we are baptized. Since this is true, how can the church be
                     divided?

                       How did experience confirm prophecy as the council at
                     Jerusalem recognized that all people can belong to one
                     church? Acts 15:12-19.

                       The Jews had long considered themselves the people of God,
                     and they were. God had chosen them to be His representatives.
                     But they had excluded the Gentiles from the circle of salvation.
                     They set up barriers between themselves and all other people.
                       But Peter found, in the home of Cornelius, that it does not
                     matter to what race a person belongs. God is no respecter of
                     persons. He "accepts men from every nation who fear him and
                     do what is right" (Acts 10:35, NIV). Furthermore, Paul and Bar-
                     nabas told the council "how the Gentiles had been converted"
                     under their ministry (Acts 15:3, 4, NW). James finally clinched
                     the whole case by quoting from the Old Testament to show that
                     the Gentiles were very much in God's plan.

                       By what words concerning Jesus did Caiaphas speak better
                     than he knew? John 11:51, 52.

                       The psalmist says that the wrath of man praises God. (See Ps.
                     76:10.) (Balaam could not but bless Israel, though he was hired
                     to pronounce a curse.) So here the high priest makes a
                     prophecy that Jesus would die for the Jews. And not for the
                     Jews only, for He would "gather together into one the children
                     of God that were scattered abroad" (John 11:52). Jesus is in-
                     deed the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. (See
                     John 1:29.)
                       Jesus Himself told the disciples that He was concerned about
                     others beside the children of Israel. (See John 10:16.) Then he
                     added that there would be one fold and one Shepherd.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why would God be as interested in the Gentiles as In the
                     Jews?

           Part 2     When Jesus prayed for His disciples, what special request
          ONE IN    did He make?
          CHRIST
                      "I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete
                    unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved
                    them even as you have loved me" (John 17:23, NIV).

                      Unity is a divine characteristic. No closer unity can be found
                    than that in the Trinity. Jesus prays that His disciples may enjoy
                    that same unity to the end of time.
                      The unity in the church is a personal unity. It springs from
                    faith and an opening of the heart to Christ. (See Rev. 3:20.) It
                    results in open communication and divine direction in the life.

                      How close was the unity that Paul experienced with his
                    Lord? Acts 18:9-11.

                      Paul always knew what to do; and, when he did it, God
                    blessed him abundantly.
                      Such a unity means that the disciple will go into the world just
                    as Jesus was sent into the world. (See John 17:18.) Yet he will
                    always be different from it (verse 16). In the world he will witness
                    to truth—a truth which sets him apart as holy (verse 17). And his
                    testimony will be effective, because the world will see the effect
                    of God's presence in his life. He will testify to the goodness and
                    love of God (verses 18, 23).
                       Whatever the race or nationality of Christ's followers, they are
                    one in Him. (See Gal. 3:28.) When one considers how differ-
                    ences in culture and race can divide, this unity is remarkable.
                       "The unity of the church is the convincing evidence that God
                    has sent Jesus into the world as its Redeemer. This is an argu-
                    ment which worldlings cannot controvert. Therefore Satan is

                    unbelievers, by witnessing backsliding, dissension, and strife
                    among professed Christians, may become disgusted with reli-
                    gion and be confirmed in their impenitence. God is dishonored
                    by those who profess the truth while they are at variance and
                    enmity with one another. Satan is the great accuser of the
                    brethren, and all who engage in this work are enlisted in his
                    service."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 620.

                      What means does God provide for believers to become
                    partakers of the divine nature? 2 Peter 1:4.

                       We may escape the corruption that is in the world, because it
                    is Christ in us who is "the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27).

           Part 3   What trait did Paul want the members of the church at
         SECRET Philippi to have?
        OF UNITY
                    "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus"
                  (Phil. 2:5).

                      The NIV translates this verse: "Your attitude should be the
                   same as that of Christ Jesus." The NEB has it: "Let your bearing
                   towards one another arise out of your life in Christ Jesus." Our
                   attitudes determine our bearing, and our bearing springs from
                   an inner disposition. What we are inside determines what we are
                   outside, if we are truly sincere.
                      To the Christian, the example of Jesus is compelling. No other
                   example in history comes anywhere near it. Here is One who
                   was equal with God, yet He did not hang on to that equality
                   selfishly as many of us would have done! On the contrary, He
                   made Himself as nothing—for what is man, that God should be
                   mindful of him? And as a man He took on the humble duties of a
                   slave, serving those who turned their backs on Him. Finally, He
                   submitted to the indignities of death by crucifixion—the mind
                   reels to consider such commitment. (See verses 6-8.)

                     What contrasting spirit does Isaiah attribute to Lucifer? Isa.
                   14:13, 14.

                      The secret of unity for the Christian is to be imbued with the
                   Spirit of Christ. He does not compare himself with anyone else,
                   imagining that he is better. (See Phil. 2:3.) He does not desire to
                   be placed higher than another, becoming jealous if someone
                   seems to have an advantage over him. In fact, he is just as
                   interested in the welfare of others as he is in his own (verse 4).

                     How, according to Paul, is this kind of action and attitude
                   possible for the Christian? Phil. 2:13.

                     The honor and glory goes to God, who makes such a spirit
                   and such a life possible. He is the One who "energizes" (Gk.
                   energe6—translated "worketh" in KJV) in the verse above.
                     At the same time, there is a working out of one's own salvation
                   "with fear and trembling" (verse 12). Christians must set goals
                   and ever be mindful of their responsibilities as they go about
                   their various duties. Do they sometimes feel like complaining?
                   They must check their impulses. Do they feel like arguing about
                   what is said or done? They should remember that nothing is
                   gained by argument. (See verses 14, 15.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Why do so few believe that they are all that Christ would
                   have them to be?

United in Christ     LESSON 8                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   February 18
           Part 4   Think of the way that Jesus pointed out the importance of
            NEED unity, even outside the church.
        OF UNITY
                    "Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
                  kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
                  every city or house divided against itself shall not stand"
                  (Matt. 12:25).

                      It is remarkable to what lengths people will go in order to
                    refuse the lordship of Christ. The Pharisees were prepared to
                    accuse Jesus of casting out demons by the power of the prince
                    of demons. Jesus gave them an irrefutable answer. Even Satan
                    would recognize the importance of loyalty within his own ranks.
                      But the unity of the church is important not merely because it
                    bolsters the church or because without it the church would fall.
                    The unity of the church is based on the unity of God and the
                    consistency of His plans. What God sets out to do, He will
                    accomplish. The group not united is just not truly a part of God's
                    church; it is not the group through which God is working out His
                    plans and purposes.

                      In what words did Paul show the Corinthians that their divi-
                    sions were ridiculous? 1 Cor. 1:13.

                      The church is always in danger of being carried away by some
                    charismatic leader. Members are often attached to certain indi-
                    viduals. Leaders must be careful about this and turn the eyes of
                    their converts to the true leader of the church—Jesus Christ.

                      In whom alone can the Christian glory? 1 Cor. 1:30, 31.

                       Pauls says that every member is in Christ, and Christ is every-
                    thing we need. Therefore, if we glory in anyone, we should glory
                    in God. It is always dangerous to glorify people—both to the one
                    glorified and the one glorifying. The former is in danger of
                    thinking of himself more highly than he ought; the latter is in
                    danger of being led astray. Our safety as members and as a
                    church rests in recognizing the Source of all goodness—the
                    object of true worship—and in refusing to be turned aside by
                    any rival gods or influences.
                       Paul makes a strong appeal for unity in the church at Corinth.
                    (See 1 Cor. 1:10.) He wants members perfectly united in mind
                    and thought. We have to fit in with one another, making adjust-
                    ments as may be necessary. Church members vary in talents
                    and temperaments, and it takes conscious effort to adapt one-
                    self to varying people and circumstances.

                    Church after a pioneer or leader? If so, why?

United in Christ         LESSON 8                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                          February 19
              Part 5      What is Paul's prayer for every Christian?
            GROWTH
         INTO UNITY      "Speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all
                       things, which is the head, even Christ" (Eph. 4:15).

                          It is the God-given privilege of every living creature to grow
                       and reach maturity. So it must be with every Christian and the
                       church. Peter urges growth in grace and "the knowledge of ...
                       Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 3:18). He also indicates the means by
                       which we may grow. (See 1 Peter 2:2.) As we grow into Christ,
                       we grow into unity with one another.
                          "The unity that God requires must be cultivated day by day if
                       we would answer the prayer of Christ. The disunion that is
                       striving for existence among those who profess to believe the
                       last message of mercy to be given to the world, must find no
                       place; for it would be a fearful hindrance to the advancement of
                       God's work. His servants are to be one, as Christ is one with the
                       Father; their powers, illuminated, inspired, and sanctified, must
                       be united to make a complete whole. Those who love God and
                       keep His commandments are not to draw apart; they are to
                       press together."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 174, 175.

                        Note the graciousness of Paul's address to the church at
                       Corinth. 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1.

                           With all its faults, the church at Corinth was still the "church
                        of God." "Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church
                        is the one object upon which God bestows in a special sense His
                       supreme regard. It is the theater of His grace, in which He
                       delights to reveal His power to transform hearts."—The Acts of
                       the Apostles, p. 12.

                         Is Paul pleased to recognize that there may be blemishes in
                       the church? 1 Cor. 11:19.

                          The word "heresy" used in the KJV is a strong word. The
                       Greek is translated "differences" in the NIV and "dissensions"
                       in the NEB. Differences of opinion do arise in the church, and
                       sometimes factions develop as a result.
                         Unity is a goal to be achieved: "My brethren, allow nothing to
                       come in that will separate you from one another or from God."
                       —Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 12.

THINK IT THROUGH         What is the difference between unity and uniformity?

                         "Let us remember that Christian unity does not mean that the
                       identity of one person is to be submerged in that of another; nor
                       does it mean that the mind of one is to be led and controlled by
                       the mind of another."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 212.

          Part 6   As Paul describes the part that ministers play in the growth
       BARRIERS of the church, how does he describe the church?
       TO UNITY
                   "We are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's
                 building" (1 Cor. 3:9, NIV).

                       Paul says that he and others water and plant in the garden of
                    the Lord but that God gives the increase (verse 7). It is God who
                    takes the initiative and provides the power of spiritual growth.
                    The result must be attributed to Him and not to the human
                    agent.
                       When church members forget the supremacy of God in their
                    lives, they are apt to praise other persons who have been a
                    blessing to them. Every garden needs a "planter" and a "wa-
                    terer," but the church is God's garden, and to Him must go all
                    the praise and the glory. When we recognize God's ownership,
                    we will not be divided into parties and factions.

                      What serious condition exists among the members when
                    there are divisions? 1 Cor. 3:3.

                       "Carnal" in the KJV means "worldly" (NIV). The NEB trans-
                    lates this verse: "Can you not see that while there is jealousy
                    and strife among you, you are living on the purely human level of
                    your lower nature?"
                       "Paul had described four types of men. The first, the natural
                    man, is the man without the Spirit, who needs the new birth (cf.
                    John 3:1-8). The second is the carnal-weak man (1 Cor. 3:1), the
                    babe in Christ, who needs growth through reception of the milk
                    of the Word. The third type is the carnal-willful man, the older,
                    yet immature Christian, who needs restoration to fellowship, or
                    the healthy condition conducive to the taking of nourishment,
                    by confession of his willfulness, or sin (cf. 1 John 1:9). The
                    fourth is the spiritual or mature man, who has responded to the
                    milk and grown into spiritual adulthood, so that he has become
                    strong and able to take the meat of the Word (1 Cor. 2:15; 3:2).
                    This is the man God would have every Christian to be."—The

                       Of the early disciples Ellen White has said: "No longer were
                    they ignorant and uncultured. No longer were they a collection
                     of independent units or of discordant and conflicting elements.
                     No longer were their hopes set on worldly greatness. They were

              Part 1      What does God do to those whom He loves?
             DIVINE
         DISCIPLINE      "Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
                       son whom he receiveth" (Heb. 12:6).

                         The writer to the Hebrews quotes from Proverbs 3:11, 12 to
                       point out that a loving relationship between father and son
                       includes correction and discipline. It must be expected, there-
                       fore, that God will treat His children in the same way.
                         Discipline is never easy to take, but the results can be good.
                       (See Heb. 12:11.) The discipline given by an earthly parent can
                       be mistaken; not so that which comes from God.
                         Not all children accept the discipline of their parents. They
                       may refuse to be subject to their parents and go their own way.
                       Some people do that with God. So long as there is freedom of
                       choice on the part of an individual, discipline can fail in its
                       objectives.

                         What is the objective of divine discipline? Deut. 8:2-5.

                          Man does not always know what is best for him. But God does.
                       Therefore, in His love and mercy, He permits people to come
                       into various situations so they can learn from their experiences.
                       One thing they must learn is that they are wholly dependent
                       upon the Word of God for guidance and well-being.
                          Just as a child does not always understand why a parent
                       insists on certain forms of conduct, so we may fail to under-
                       stand why God has permitted us to pass through certain difficult
                       circumstances. In such cases we must depend on the love of
                       God, recognizing that His love and wisdom exceed those of a
                       parent. Our faith in God must not fail, and the experience borne
                       with patience will fit us to serve God and our fellowman better.

                         What is one of God's purposes for us? 2 Peter 3:9.

                         God has one basic purpose for all of us: that we may repent of
                       our sins and turn to Him for salvation. All that He does or permits
                       to happen has this one goal. We should therefore be willing to
                       accept all God's plans for us and be grateful for all His provi-
                       dences.
                         There can be serious consequences if we do not repent and
                       accept Christ as our salvation. (See Rev. 2:5.) It is always in our
                       best interest to listen to the Word of God and act accordingly.

                                                                      February 23
         Pad 2     As a Christian, why did Paul find it necessary to exercise
          SELF- self-control?
       CONTROL
                   "I keep under my body, and bring It into subjection: lest that
                 by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
                 should be a castaway" (1 Cor. 9:27).

                     Paul draws a parallel between the life of an athlete and the life
                   of a Christian. They both seek to win in a race, and they both
                   need to be "temperate in all things" (verse 25). This latter
                   phrase means to go "into strict training" (NIV).
                      "A noble character is not the result of accident; it is not due to
                   special favors or endowments of Providence. It is the result of
                   self-discipline, of subjection of the lower to the higher nature, of
                   the surrender of self to the service of God and man."—Prophets
                   and Kings, p. 488.

                     How strong are the influences of the body upon the mind
                   and soul?

                      "The body is a most important medium through which the
                   mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of charac-
                   ter. Hence it is that the adversary of souls directs his tempta-
                   tions to the enfeebling and degrading of the physical powers....
                   Intellectual power, physical stamina, and the length of life de-
                   pend upon immutable laws. Through obedience to these laws,
                   man may stand conqueror of himself, conqueror of his own
                   inclinations, conqueror of principalities and powers, of 'the
                   rulers of the darkness of this world,' and of 'spiritual wicked-
                   ness in high places.' Ephesians 6:12."—Prophets and Kings,
                   pp. 488, 489.

                     What is one area in which self-control needs to be exer-
                   cised? Dan. 1:8.

                     The Christian observes the laws of health in matters of diet.
                   He does not indulge merely in what he likes, but he makes sure
                   that he gets a well-rounded and balanced diet.
                      "Daniel and his associates had been trained by their parents
                   to habits of strict temperance. They had been taught that God
                   would hold them accountable for their capabilities, and that
                   they must never dwarf or enfeeble their powers. This education
                   was to Daniel and his companions the means of their preserva-
                   tion amidst the demoralizing influences of the court of
                   Babylon."—Prophets and Kings, p. 482.

THINK IT THROUGH     Give examples of the greater freedom to be found in a life of
                   self-control rather than in a life of self-indulgence.

                                                                         February 24

            Part 3   If a church member sees a fault in someone else, how
        CORRECTING should he deal with the situation?
           OTHERS
                     "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him
                   his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,
                   thou hast gained thy brother" (Matt. 18:15). (See also Matt.
                   5:23, 24.)

                         Members of the church need to be sure they are doing what is
                      right themselves. If everyone did what was right, there would be
                     no problem. But this ideal does not exist. Someone is always
                     trangressing the rights of another.
                         We are counseled to take these three steps:
                         1. Go to the one who has offended and speak to him person-
                     ally. In most cases this is the end of the matter. The trouble is
                     that most people express their grievances to everyone except
                     the one concerned, and thus the matter becomes aggravated.
                         2. If the matter is not resolved in the first step, then take one
                     or two witnesses so that there will be clear evidence of the
                     grievance involved (verse 16). Very often the presence of a third
                     and fourth party will lead to a better understanding of the situa-
                     tion; and, with a little "give and take," the matter can be re-
                     solved.
                        3. But sometimes even the second step does not resolve the
                     issue, because of the deep feelings of those concerned or
                     perhaps because of a strong dose of obstinacy. The third step is
                     to take the matter to the church. A larger group is now involved
                     in hearing and judging the case. Presumably the church mem-
                     bers will be understanding and fair and will act justly as well as
                     mercifully.

                       When the guilty party will not listen to the judgment of the
                     church and act accordingly, what is the church to do? Matt.
                     18:17.

                        By rejecting the authority of the church, the guilty one obvi-
                     ously puts himself outside the circle of the church.
                        "Our Lord teaches that matters of difficulty between Chris-
                     tians are to be settled within the church. They should not be
                     opened before those who do not fear God. If a Christian is
                     wronged by his brother, let him not appeal to unbelievers in a
                     court of justice."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 248, 249.
                        The church member is not only responsible for his own right-
                     doing, but he is his brother's keeper as well.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why should the Christian always be willing to forgive a
                     wrongdoer who asks for forgiveness?

Disciplined by Love       LESSON 9                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  February 25
           Part 4   Why is a certain amount of discipline necessary in the
       NEED FOR church?
      DISCIPLINE
                    "There are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
                  specially they of the circumcision" (Titus 1:10).

                     Some people are always "unruly," in the sense that they will
                   not accept any rule as applying to themselves. Rebellious under
                   any administration, they find fault with anything that is done.
                   They cannot lead themselves, but neither will they be led. They
                   are usually grumblers and complainers. At the same time they
                   are great talkers. They do not keep their thoughts to themselves,
                   but they must fill someone else's ears with their ideas. Usually
                   they do not say anything constructive; so their talk is a waste of
                   time.
                     Often people who are self-righteous are critical of the church.
                   They may have some favorite idea that they harp on. They may
                   be intelligent and well-read and may have researched their
                   projects. But instead of pulling with the church, they pull
                   against it. They pretend to want to reform the church, but in fact
                   what they seem to want is for everyone else to accept their
                   viewpoint.

                     What does Paul say ought to be done regarding such mem-
                   bers in the church? Titus 1:11

                      Some people must be plainly advised to stop promoting their
                   propaganda. Perhaps the church pastor should take the lead in
                   this. But the members also have a part to play; they can decline
                   to accept publications critical of God's truth. They must always
                   be gentle and Christian in these matters, neither prejudging nor
                   declining to recognize in themselves the possiblity of holding
                   an unsound position.

                    How should a person be rebuked when he causes dishar-
                   mony in the church? Titus 1:13.

                     The purpose of plainly rebuking those who cause division and
                   disharmony in the church is to bring them to a realization of the
                   seriousness of their situation and the importance of making a
                   change. Too many avoid taking disciplinary measures and
                   would rather let someone else do the work. But to face wrong-
                   doing squarely and call it by its right name has a strengthening
                   effect on faith. It safeguards the truth and purity of the church.

THINK IT THROUGH     Where can one find the courage to speak the truth in love
                   and even to rebuke if necessary?

                                                                        February 26
              Part 5    What did Paul expect the church at Corinth to do with a
            CHURCH member who lived in open sin?
         DISCIPLINE
                        "To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the
                     flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord
                     Jesus" (1 Cor. 5:5).
                         Paul is quite clear that open sin cannot be tolerated in the
                      church. Apparently there was a case of incest in the church at
                      Corinth, and the church members had done nothing about it.
                      (See verses 1, 2.) They were not even concerned that no disci-
                      plinary action had been taken.
                         Good reason exists for acting definitively in such matters. The
                      church must be pure, and no known, flagrant sin can be toler-
                      ated in it. Furthermore, the power of example is strong; and if
                      others see sin going unpunished, they may be encouraged to
                      indulge in the same.
                        Disciplinary action must be taken for the good of the
                      wrongdoer, who must know definitely that certain actions can-
                      not go uncondemned. But the wrongdoer should also be made
                      to understand clearly that while his actions may be condemned,
                      he as a person is not.
                        To deliver a person over to Satan is strong language to de-
                      scribe discipline. What does it mean? It means to say that if a
                      person has decided to follow in the way of Satan, then he had
                      better go out of the church and into the world to be in the
                      domain of Satan. (See 1 John 5:19.) The church cannot be a
                      center of wickedness.
                       What example do we have in which Paul exercised this form
                     of discipline toward two individuals? 1 Tim. 1:20.

                       His purpose was that "they may learn not to blaspheme."
                     Discipline, even of the severest kind, is to be therapeutic in
                     nature and intent.
                       In the case of incest, the purpose of discipline was that the
                     guilty party should come to realize the seriousness of the sin
                     and forsake it. Sometimes it takes a strict measure to impress
                     upon the mind the necessity for making a change.

                       Under what conditions should severe measures sometimes
                     be taken? Matt. 5:29, 30.

                       Surgery is sometimes necessary in order to save the whole
                     body. A little pain inflicted on a member is better than the loss of
                     the whole congregation.

THINK IT THROUGH       What reasons would you give for the exercise of great care
                     in the removal of anyone from membership in the church?

                                                                     February 27
          Part 6   Consider prayerfully how members of the church should
        JUSTICE relate to one another.
     AND MERCY
                   "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
                 bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
                 Iongsuffering" (Col. 3:12).

                     Mercy is not opposed to justice; it confirms it. Because mercy
                   has been shown, justice is elevated all the more.
                     The Christian must guard against a haughty spirit of
                   condemnation—a spirit of self-righteousness leading him to
                   judge the wrongdoer. If he adopts a holier-than-thou attitude,
                   he becomes as guilty before God as the one he presumes to
                   judge. There are many hidden factors in every situation that
                   make it difficult for any human being to judge fairly.

                     Why should the Christian be slow to judge another? 1 Cor.
                   4:5.
                     Whatever goodness we have comes from God; whatever vic-
                   tories we may have gained are because of His power. Therefore
                   we have no cause to boast about anything we have, and we must
                   relate to others in humility and meekness. This does not mean
                   that we do not deal seriously with open sin, but it does mean that
                   we do so with a sense of personal unworthiness. (See 2 Tim.
                   2:24-26.)
                     Notice how Jesus treated the woman taken in adultery. Did
                   He minimize the sinfulness of her acts by what He said? John
                   8:11.
                     The woman knew that Jesus was merciful and that He under-
                   stood her situation. Her heart went out in gratitude to God, and
                   she wanted never to sin again. Mercy does not deny sin but
                   makes the sinner stronger in his fight against sin.
                     On the other hand, human beings want to "maintain" disci-
                   pline. It is often felt that if sin goes unpunished then the "law is
                   slacked" (Flab. 1:4). But there is a danger in overemphasizing
                   stern punishment. Hence Paul indicates that the Christian must
                   be prepared to forgive. (See 2 Cor. 2:6, 7.)
                      Some want to maintain their authority and feel they are let
                   down if punishment is not exacted. They are like Jonah, who
                   wanted his word maintained and the people of Nineveh de-
                   stroyed. But God showed him how small he was. (See Jonah
                   4:1-11.)

THINK IT THROUGH     What are the sins in others that we find most difficult to
                   forgive?

             Part 1     What commission did Jesus give to the church?
        WITNESSING
        FOR CHRIST      "He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
                      gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15).

                         The objective of preaching the gospel is that men, women,
                       and children may be saved (verse 16). But not all will listen to the
                       gospel or accept it. Thus the preaching of the gospel gives
                      everyone an opportunity to decide his destiny, because the
                      alternatives are clear: salvation or damnation.
                         The preaching of the gospel has no limits. It must go to "every
                      nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (Rev. 14:6).
                      Wherever they are and wherever they go, church members are
                      to be witnesses of what Jesus has done for them. They call all to
                      repentance and promise them forgiveness in Christ's name.
                      (See Luke 24:47, 48.)
                         Not all are called to go as missionaries to foreign lands, but all
                      may have a part in the missionary enterprise by raising the
                      necessary funds to finance the undertaking. And all may be
                      witnesses in their homes and neighborhoods. Some will give up
                      the companionship of sons and daughters so that the interests
                      of missions may be served.

                        What does Christ enjoin all Christians to do? Matt. 5:16.

                         Jesus is the "true Light" (John 1:9), and He lights every man.
                      The Christian is to reflect that light. The light of God's love can
                      bring joy to people who live in the darkness of ignorance and
                      superstition. But it does not follow that people will accept the
                      light. Unfortunately, many people prefer darkness to light.

                        Why do people prefer darkness to light? John 3:19.

                         Some people do not want to change their ways. They delight
                      in doing evil. They feel that the light of the gospel may restrict
                      their freedom. They do not seem to realize that they are bound
                      by their sin and finally destined to lose their lives in bitter
                      self-condemnation. The truth makes you and me free—free to
                      enjoy an abundant life here in this world and eternal life in the
                      world to come. (See John 10:10.)
                         The preaching of the gospel is accompanied by the rite of
                      baptism for all who accept Jesus as their personal Saviour. This
                      rite symbolizes the fact that our old man of sin has been buried
                      and that a new man has risen out of the water, just as Christ was
                      raised from the dead. The Christian henceforth walks in "new-
                      ness of life" (Rom. 6:4).

THINK IT THROUGH        What provisions has God made for the church to carry out its
                      gospel commission?

       STUDYING those in Thessalonica?
      THE WORD
                   "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
                 they received the word with all readiness of mind, and
                 searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so"
                 (Acts 17:11).

                      "The minds of the Bereans were not narrowed by prejudice.
                    They were willing to investigate the truthfulness of the doctrines
                    preached by the apostles. They studied the Bible, not from
                    curiosity, but in order that they might learn what had been
                    written concerning the promised Messiah. Daily they searched
                    the inspired records, and as they compared scripture with scrip-
                    ture, heavenly angels were beside them, enlightening their
                    minds and impressing their hearts. . . .

                    testing truths are proclaimed would follow the example of the

                    1 Tim. 4:13.

                       Paul was an avid reader. Only by reading and study can we
                    test our beliefs. That which is written serves as a testimony that
                    is safer than the oral word. It was by quoting what was written
                    that Jesus overcame temptation in the wilderness. The Ten
                    Commandments were written on two tables of stone, and some-
                    times John the revelator was told to write down what he saw.
                    (See Rev. 1:19; 2:1; 14:13; 21:5.)

                      Why were God's messages written down? Rom. 15:4.

                      The Christian who earnestly studies the Bible is strong in
                    faith. As Jesus said, the Scriptures testify of Him. (See John
                    5:39.)
                      The church that makes the Bible the object of its study will
                    stand for truth though the heavens fall. (See 2 Tim. 2:15; Rom.
                    15:4.)

                                                                                 March 3

               Part 3      What attitude does the Christian have toward his body?
         CARING FOR
           THE BODY       "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
                        Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not
                        your own?" (1 Cor. 6:19).

                           Christians have a healthy respect for their bodies. They do not
                        consider that the flesh is inherently evil and must be abandoned
                        as soon as possible. They do not make an unscriptural distinc-
                        tion between soul and body. When God breathed the breath of
                        life into the nostrils of the man He had created from the dust of
                        the earth, man became a "living being" (Gen. 2:7, RSV).

                           What is Paul's testimony concerning the need for the Chris-
                        tian to keep his body under the control of the higher nature?
                        1 Cor. 9:27.

                           Because of man's fallen nature, the body wants to be pam-
                        pered; but the Christian does not let the body have its own way.
                        The body is to serve God, and the Christian dedicates his whole
                        being to God.
                          Since the body is the.temple of the Holy Spirit, and thus the
                        channel through which the Holy Spirit can be active in com-
                        municating and saving, it must be kept in a good condition. The
                        mind needs to be clear and the limbs supple and strong. Only in
                        this way can the Christian bring maximum glory to God.

                          What promise did God make to the children of Israel which
                        indicates His interest in health and freedom from disease? Ex.
                        15:26.

                           The Bible is full of good counsel regarding eating and drink-
                        ing habits. God at first provided a diet of fruits, grains, and nuts.
                        (See Gen. 1:29.) After sin, the herb of the field was added to the
                        diet (Gen. 3:18). As a result of the Flood, God permitted the use
                        of flesh food (Gen. 9:3); but this was restricted to clean meats.
                        (See Leviticus 11.) Blood was not to be eaten. (See Gen. 9:4.)
                          Common wine is intoxicating, and anything that leads to
                        drunkenness is an abomination. The drunkard is excluded from
                        the kingdom of God. (See 1 Cor. 6:9, 10.) Except as medication,
                        we are not to take anything into the body that dulls the judgment
                        or impairs our sense of right and wrong. (See Prov. 31:4, 5; Lev.
                        10:8-10.)

THINK IT THROUGH          Think of examples illustrating that a person who is sick is
                        not always so because he has disobeyed the rules of health.

                                                                      March 4

          Part 4   "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there
      LOYALTY TO is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
     AUTHORITIES God" (Rom. 13:1).

                       It is difficult to see how a government is ordained of God when
                    it engages in injustice and puts to death those who have a right
                    to life. (The God of justice bestows the gift of eternal life.) All
                    governments have their weaknesses because of the human
                    element, yet generally speaking they are set up to be respected
                    and supported except when they violate conscience.

                     What is the Christian's proper attitude toward govern-
                    ments? Rom. 13:1, 2.

                       The Christian pays his taxes and contributes to public ser-
                    vices. By obeying the laws of the land he avoids the arm of the
                    law, which Paul describes as "the minister of God" (verse 4). He
                    is not found among the lawbreakers, but is a positive influence
                    for good.
                       This does not mean that the Christian is uncritical of the
                    government that controls his political life. He will speak his
                    mind in favor of truth and righteousness. If he knows that he has
                    political or civil rights, he will ask that they be granted him, as
                    when Paul claimed his rights as a Roman citizen. (See Acts
                    22:25.)
                       Yet the Christian will follow the example of his Master and
                    submit to injustice when necessary in giving a testimony. The
                    early Christians were often placed under arrest and put in
                     prison, but such occasions brought glory to God. (See Acts
                     12:5-11; 16:25-31.)

                      Can the Christian expect that he will never be treated un-
                    justly? Matt. 24:9.

                      The Christian speaks the right word at the right time and
                    endures to the end (verse 13). He is promised that he will be
                    given the right words to speak on every occasion if his com-
                    munications are open with God. (See Matt. 10:19, 20.)

 THINK IT THROUGH     Should the Christian be pessimistic about the success of
                    programs designed to improve the world situation politically
                    and economically?

           Part 5     "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
      CARING FOR    this, To visit the fatherless and widows In their affliction, and
     WIDOWS AND     to keep himself unspotted from the world" (James 1:27).
        ORPHANS
                      To the one who thinks of religion in terms of keeping the
                    commandments, this definition must come as a shock! Is not
                    religion a relationship with God? Of course it is! But the closer
                    one is to God and Jesus Christ, the closer he is to anyone for
                    whom Christ died.

                      In what words does John bring out the close connection
                    between love for God and love for man? 1 John 4:20, 21.

                       With comparative ease we may say, I love God. We feel it is the
                    right thing to say, and we say it. The proof of whether we do love
                    God or not is seen in whether we love our fellowman. Once
                    again, it is comparatively easy to speak in generalities and say
                    that we love all men. The question is, Do we love those with
                    whom we come in contact every day? Are we concerned about
                    their welfare? Do we work for their good? Or are there some
                    who make us unhappy? Are there some we positively do not
                    like?

                      How does Paul describe the way the Christian ought to
                    relate to those around him? Rom. 12:13-16.

                      The Christian keeps himself unspotted from the world, but he
                    does not separate himself from it. He is in the world to bring a
                    knowledge of the love of God and His constant care to all those
                    he meets. This is to be the witness of the church in every locality.

                      How does the psalmist describe the blessings that come to
                    the one who Is considerate of the poor? Ps. 41:1-3.

                      Some people find it difficult to give, but this is only an evi-
                    dence that they do not have the spirit of Christ. (See Acts 20:35.)
                    The Bible speaks out against those who are inconsiderate of the
                    poor. (See Prov. 21:13.) Helping others should not be limited to
                    those who have money. Peter said he had no money, but he had
                    something infinitely more valuable to give. (See Acts 3:6.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Which is easier to do: to weep with those who weep or to
                    rejoice with those who rejoice?

           Part 6     What injunction is given parents regarding their children?
       TRAINING
      THE YOUTH       "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
                    he will not depart from it" (Prov. 22:6).

                      Children are "an heritage of the Lord" (Ps. 127:3). They are
                    not only a blessing to the parents, but a responsibility. Parents
                    who neglect their children or abuse them will someday have to
                    answer to God.

                      Notice the way Jesus expressed His concern for children
                    and emphasized the importance of caring for their spiritual
                    interests. Matt. 19:14.

                      The importance of children to the well-being of society and
                    their place in worship is not always realized. Their training is
                    often neglected while parents pursue other interests. But no
                    investment produces greater results than that of spending time
                    with children and answering their many questions. Mother
                    wants to talk with her neighbors and friends. Father wants to
                    read the newspaper or indulge in his hobbies. In such situations
                    children go off and play by themselves, and perhaps they will
                    learn many things it would be better they not know.

                     With what words has the psalmist indicated that children
                    may be a source of strength? Ps. 8:2.

                       Jesus quoted this text to the Jewish leaders when they were
                    displeased by the welcome the children gave Him as He rode
                    into Jerusalem. (See Matt. 21:16.) Often we think children are
                    not old enough to understand or to make decisions or to take a
                    leading part in church activities. But parents should know how
                    often children can be surprisingly wise and understanding.
                       The church that has many children in its midst is obviously a
                    growing church, because one day the boys and girls will be able
                    to make their decisions for Christ and join the family of God. But
                    the church must be sure that everything is done to keep the little
                    ones within the fold. In modern society it is not easy, nor is it
                    often practical, for parents to teach their own children. The
                     church must provide a school in which the principles of the
                    Bible are taught by precept and practice. This is the basis of a
                     church school system. Only that church which teaches the
                     importance of Christian education lives up to its fullest respon-
                     sibilities.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Suggest ways in which parents can show their children that
                    they are concerned about their religious education.

              Part 1     According to Paul, how should all the services of the church
             A GOD     be conducted?
          OF ORDER
                         "Let all things be done decently and in order" (1 Cor. 14:40).

                         The reason for this, says Paul, is that "God is not the author of
                       confusion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints"
                       (verse 33).
                         A study of these verses in context indicates that Paul was not
                       pleased with the worship services in Corinth. With no previous
                       planning, everyone felt free to get up and have his say in the
                       midst of the congregation. (See verse 26.)

                         What are some of the sound principles of church order laid
                       down by Paul?

                          1. Worship services must make sense so that visitors coming
                       in can understand what is being said and done (verse 23).
                          2. Whatever is said should be understandable to those who
                       listen and should bring home the truths of the Bible (verse 24).
                          3. Visitors should be impressed that God meets with His
                       people in the worship service.
                          4. The purpose of all worship is that the members may be
                       strengthened (verse 26), encouraged, and instructed (verse 27).
                          5. When anyone speaks, the rest must remain silent. There
                       must be order in the presentation of the message from God
                       (verses 29-31).

                         To what authorities is Paul prepared to appeal in support of
                       his own authority for the counsel he is giving the church?
                       1 Cor. 14:37.

                         Church services are not occasions when people are to come
                       and display their talents, ask their personal questions, or ignore
                       what anyone else says while they do their talking. The church
                       service must bring honor to God by being orderly, and it must
                       meet the needs of the people by being clear and understand-
                       able.
                         Paul's words regarding women and their part in the church
                       service must be understood in the context of the church in
                       Corinth. In some places today women ordinarily do not take the
                       lead in religious services. Their doing so could cause misun-
                       derstandings and negative response to the gospel.

                       worship services of your church?

                      "Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that

                    able to perform it thyself alone" (Ex. 18:18).

                      Jethro could see that the task of judging the people according
                    to the law of God was too much for one man. Moses and the
                    people were spending long days in careful deliberation of a
                    multitude of matters. Moses needed to get organized!

                      What sound counsel suggests that by the distribution of
                    responsibility more work could be done in less time? Ex.
                    18:19-26.

                      This did not mean that Moses shirked responsibility; he still
                    had to review important cases. But at least other matters could
                    be settled in lesser courts, and thus time and strength were
                    saved. It speaks well of Moses that he was willing to listen to
                    counsel from his father-in-law and to act accordingly.

                      What provision was made for order in the sanctuary ser-
                    vices? Lev. 1:1; 4:1; 6:1; 8:1; 11:1.

                       God gave Moses instructions asto how the various services of
                    the sanctuary were to be conducted. God was the real Leader in
                    the wilderness, and the children of Israel were to follow instruc-
                    tions carefully. God uses men as His instruments to carry out His
                    purposes, and in every phase of activity there is to be a well-
                    thought-out plan.
                       It is the same with the church. God is the true Leader, and
                    when the appointed human leaders in the church are in close
                    touch with God regarding their responsibilities, everything is
                    done efficiently and in order.

                       How closely did Jesus work with His Father in planning His
                    life and teaching? John 5:30; 8:28.

                       "Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He
                    accepted God's plans for Him, and day by day the Father un-
                    folded His plans. So should we depend upon God, that our lives
                    may be the simple outworking of His will. As we commit our
                    ways to Him, He will direct our steps."—The Ministry of Healing,

             Parl 3    What figure of speech does Paul use to describe his ideal
             GOD'S for what Timothy ought to be as a Christian?
             ARMY
                       "Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of
                    Jesus Christ" (2 Tim. 2:3).

                        A popular hymn sung in the church begins:
                          "Onward Christian soldiers! marching as to war,
                          With the cross of Jesus going on before."
                                              —The Church Hymnal, no. 360.
                        The metaphor is a striking one because it is so apt. The
                     following is also true:
                          "Crown and thrones have perished, kingdoms ruled and
                            waned,
                          But the church of Jesus constant has remained.
                          Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
                          We have Christ's own promise, that can never fail."
                        Everyone knows that an army is supposed to be well-
                     organized. There is to be order and discipline, planning and
                     strategy, one who leads and one who follows.

                       In what ways does Paul use this figure of speech to apply to
                     the church? 2 Tim. 2:4.

                         Paul points out two areas in which there are close similarities:
                         1. Every soldier has a commanding officer, and every
                     member of the church has Jesus Christ as his Head.
                         2. Just as a soldier concentrates on his soldiering because he
                     has been called to it, so the church member gives top priority to
                     his church responsibilities.
                         How is this warfare waged? Paul exemplified it in his own life.
                     At first he fought against the church, using political pressure
                     and violent measures. (See Gal. 1:13.) But on the way to Damas-
                     cus he was converted, and from then on he proved himself to be
                     the greatest missionary and the greatest theologian the world
                     has ever seen among men, apart from Christ. He dedicated his
                     life to one purpose—preaching the gospel. (See 1 Cor. 9:16.) He
                     endured hardness as a good soldier, being filled with and
                     guided by the Holy Spirit. No wonder he could say, "I have
                     fought a good fight" (2 Tim. 4:7).
                        Paul has been accompanied by a whole host of Christians
                     who have fought the battle for truth. Can you name some of
                     them?

THINK IT THROUGH       Is implicit obedience essential in the operations of an
                     army? Should Christians ever obey without knowing why?
                     (See Heb. 11:8.)

          Part 4   Think upon how Jesus felt as He sent forth His first disci-

      DISCIPLES
                   "He called unto him the twelve, and began to send them
                 forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
                 spirits" (Mark 6:7).
                       Why did Jesus choose just twelve to be closest to Him? Is the
                    number possibly related to the twelve tribes of Israel? We may
                    not know the answer, but we do know that the New Jerusalem
                    has twelve foundations and names of the apostles are written on
                    them. (See Rev. 21:14.) Jesus told the Twelve that they would
                    judge the twelve tribes. (See Matt: 19:28.)
                       We note that Jesus sent out His disciples two by two. Here is
                    order and organization. We do not know for sure which of the
                    disciples went together, but doubtless the combination was for
                    a purpose.
                       Furthermore, Jesus gave them the power they needed to do
                    their work. In succeeding verses in this chapter we learn of
                    detailed instructions given to the disciples. There is an or-
                    ganized group going out to do a specific task, a Leader, and
                    those who, do what He commands.
                       Here we" see in embryo how the church operates. It moves
                    forward in an orderly fashion. A congregation may be large or
                     small, but it always addresses itself to a task and then proceeds
                     to do its work with dispatch and efficiency.

                      What experience in the Old Testament illustrates how a
                    group under God's control can accomplish an important pur-
                    pose in spite of small numbers? Judges 7:2-15.

                      The success of the church is not dependent on large num-
                    bers. It is dependent on dedication and a faith that God can
                    work through few as well as through many. (See 1 Sam. 14:6.)
                      "Man needs a power outside of and beyond himself, to re-
                    store him to the likeness of God, and enable him to do the work
                    of God; but this does not make the human agency unessential.
                    Humanity lays hold upon divine power, Christ dwells in the heart
                    by faith; and through co-operation with the divine, the power of
                    man becomes efficient for good.
                       "He who called the fishermen of Galilee is still calling men to
                    His service. And He is just as willing to manifest His power
                    through us as through the first disciples. However imperfect
                    and sinful we may be, the Lord holds out to us the offer of
                    partnership with Himself, of apprenticeship to Christ."—The

             Part 5     When Paul left Titus on the island of Crete, what need was
         NEED FOR     he meeting?
        STRUCTURE
                        "The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten
                      out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town,
                      as I directed you" (Titus 1:5, NIV).

                         Paul recognized that it was not enough just to have groups of
                      Christians wherever he preached the gospel. These groups
                      needed to be organized into continuing communities, each with
                      its own elder. He had not had time to work out the details of
                      organization, but he left Titus to do this.
                         Is it obvious today that when a church is formed, there must
                      be recognized leadership? Someone must take the initiative,
                      calling the group together and arranging for the various needs
                      of the members. For instance, there needs to be a place to meet
                      for worship, and everyone needs to know where that place is.
                      Someone must arrange a time for each meeting—a time that
                      suits the majority. We are not referring now to the day of wor-
                      ship. But will the Sabbath worship services take place in the
                      morning or in the afternoon? What about times for prayer?
                      What about the communion service? Who will be responsible
                      for the offerings? What about prayer for the sick? (See James
                      5:14.) What about the widows and the poor in their midst?
                         Who will represent the group as delegates if there is a call for
                      a general council? How will the delegates be selected? These
                      will be some of the concerns of the local church, and doubtless
                      a new group would be interested in the experience of other
                      groups in order to organize themselves in the best possible way.
                      Titus was no doubt a resource person in this respect.

                        What other important matters must be cared for by the local
                      church? 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.

                          God made provision for the support of the Levites through the
                      tithes, and God has provided that the gospel ministry shall be
                      supported by the tithe today.
                          Some may be self-supporting missionaries or ministers, just
                      as Paul was able to support himself at certain times by tentmak-
                      ing or by personal means. But this is not the rule. Jesus
                      suggested that the disciples stay at the homes of those who
                      received them and thus enjoy their hospitality. No doubt Titus,
                      while on Crete, was often invited into different homes for board
                      and lodging. But the ministry is on a much sounder basis when
                      it is supported by the tithe according to God's plan.

THINK IT THROUGH       Does organization lessen the need for the presence of the
                      Holy Spirit in the life of the church?

          Part 6      What situation in the temple at Jerusalem led Jesus to
      ORGANIZED, strong action?
       BUT DEAD
                 "When he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
                 all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
                 out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables" (John
                 2:15).

                      The services at the temple in Jerusalem had ceased to be
                    worshipful. The place that was to be a house of prayer had
                    become a "house of merchandise" (verse 16).
                      The need for sacrifices to be"offered in the temple was un-
                    questioned. God had provided for these in the sanctuary ser-
                    vice. Those who came from long distances to worship at the
                    Passover would not be able to bring their animals with them.
                    Hence the need for the purchase of sheep and oxen in
                    Jerusalem.
                      Offerings for the temple were also a part of worship. But the
                    Jews decided that only the temple shekel would be accepted for
                    this purpose or for the purchase of sacrifices. People coming
                    from far away would have to change their currency in order to
                    have an appropriate offering. Thus a money changer was
                    necessary.

                      In what ways may organization and ritual detract from the
                    spirit of worship?

                      When organization hinders the prime purpose of the church,
                    then organization must be set aside. The sole purpose of or-'

             Part 1     What did Jesus say He had come to do?
         A SERVING
            MASTER      "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
                      to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many" (Matt.
                      20:28).

                        From beginning to end, the life of Jesus was one of service. He
                      told His disciples that they were to follow His example. They
                      would be very different from the world, because the world con-
                      fused greatness with authority, while the disciples were to rec-
                      ognize that true greatness consisted in service. (See verses
                      25-27.)

                        What powers go with position in worldly organization?

                         "In the kingdoms of the world, position meant self-
                      aggrandizement. The people were supposed to exist for the
                      benefit of the ruling classes. . . .
                        "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles.
                      He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear
                      the infirmities of the weak. Power, position, talent, education,
                      placed their possessor under the greater obligation to serve his
                      fellows. . . .
                        " . . . The principle on which Christ acted [practicing self-
                      denial] is to actuate the members of the church which is His
                      body."—The Desire of Ages, p. 550.

                        Note the principles on which Paul built his ministry. 1 Cor.
                      9:19; 10:33.

                         Paul recognized that he was free to do what he liked with his
                      life, and that is a freedom that exists for everyone. But he chose
                      to be a servant. He had only one objective—to bring salvation to
                      his fellowmen. So he did not consult his own interests, but
                      theirs. He adapted himself to all kinds of people so that he might
                      be a blessing to them. He knew that he could not compel anyone
                      to accept the truth of the gospel, but he also knew that he could
                      not go on living his life without considering the needs of those
                      around him. This meant a certain amount of self-discipline. (See
                      1 Cor. 9:27.) But it was a price he was prepared to pay because,
                      not only was he a servant of those in need, but he was a "servant
                      [also bondservant or slave] of Jesus Christ" (Rom. 1:1).
                         Here then is an important characteristic of the church. It
                      stands as a symbol of service to mankind, because it is a group
                      of people who are slaves of Jesus Christ—slaves by choice, in
                      gratitude.

                                                                         March 16
          Part 2   When the church grew so large that the original Twelve
         CHOSEN could not do all that needed to be done in the church, what
        TO SERVE plans were made to solve the problem?

                      "Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of
                    honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we
                    may appoint over this business" (Acts 6:3).

                       The church not only grew in size, but some cultural/racial
                    tensions troubled the administration (verse 1). The church
                    leadership had to be expanded to meet the situation. The apos-
                    tles wanted to devote themselves to the preaching of the Word
                    and caring for spiritual interests. Yet the divided groups of
                    widows in the church had to be cared for, and someone had to
                    make sure that in meeting their needs there was justice and fair
                    distribution.
                       This was a problem that had not existed before. The situation
                    required changes in administration. Could this be effected
                    quietly and efficiently? The results indicate that the right moves
                    were made. (See verse 7.) The church must always be prepared,
                    under the Spirit's leading, to make changes of policy as new
                    situations arise.
                       Note the following points to be drawn from this recorded
                    experience:
                       1. We must not be surprised if sometimes there are injustices
                     or inconsistencies in the church. After all, the church has a very
                     human element about it! (See verse 1.)
                       2. On this occasion it appears that the whole church was
                     called together to consider the problem. (See verse 2.)
                       3. Appeal was made to reason regarding responsibilities that
                     needed to be carried. Spiritual priorities must not be laid aside
                     for the sake of temporal needs (verse 2).
                       4. The whole church was asked to recommend seven men
                     who could be relied on to undertake the task of serving tables.
                     Such men would be called deacons or church administrators
                     today.
                       5. The church was willing to undertake this task, and certain
                     men were named for the office and were brought before the
                     apostles for their blessing and ordination.
                       6. The church continued to expand, and we know that two of
                     the seven later distinguished themselves—Stephen by being
                     the first Christian martyr, and Philip by evangelizing Samaria
                     and baptizing the Ethiopian eunuch.
                        Thus the church must always be ready to modify its structure
                     in order to fulfill its primary responsibilities.

           Part 3     What does Paul say is the reason that spiritual gifts are
       GIFTS FOR    given to members of the church?
         SERVICE
                      "To prepare God's people for works of service, so that the
                    body of Christ may be built up" (Eph. 4:12, NIV).

                       The NEB translates this verse: "To equip God's people for
                    work in his service, to the building up of the body of Christ."
                       These two versions combine two propositions that are ex-
                    pressed in the KJV as follows: (1) "for the perfecting of the
                    saints" and (2) "for the work of the ministry." Many scholars feel
                    that the two propositions should be combined so that one is
                    accomplished to make the other possible.
                       With this understanding it is clear that the gift of leadership
                    cited in the previous verse (verse 11) is for training members to
                    serve. But do the leaders in our churches do this?

                      Is it possible that in too many churches there has been a
                    division between the leaders (the "clergy") and the other
                    members (the "laity")?

                        At times, leaders have undertaken to do all the work, as the
                    members have chosen to sit as spectators. But this is not the
                    plan outlined in Scripture. Nor was it the practice of the early
                    church.
                        That church grows in which the minister leads and trains the
                    laity how to work. This may mean more effort on the part of the
                    minister, who may find it easier to do the work himself. But
                    God's plan is to give gifts to some who will teach others how to
                    engage in service for the building up of the body of Christ.
                        The root meaning of the Greek word for "equip" (NEB) or
                    "perfection" (KJV) has to do with resetting a broken limb or
                    mending a net. "The basic idea of the word is that of putting a
                    thing or a person into the condition in which he or it ought to be.
                    It is the function of the office-bearers of the Church to see that
                    the members of the Church are so educated, so helped, so
                    guided, so cared for, so sought out when they go astray, that
                    they become what they ought to be. The office-bearer of the
                    Church holds his office, not for his own honour, but for the help
                    he can give his fellow-members within the Church."—William
                    Barclay, Letters to the Galatians and Ephesians (Philadelphia:
                    The Westminster Press, 1958), p. 176.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my church a family in which every member contributes his
                    share of ministry for the upbuilding of the body of Christ? If
                    not, what is my responsibility?

Servant Leaders       LESSON .12                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     March 18
           Part 4     How does Paul describe some of the leaders in the church?
        LEADER-
     SHIP ROLES       "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
                    evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers" (Eph. 4:11).

                       Leaders in the church are not self-appointed; their calling is
                    from Christ. He has chosen and appointed them. They are then
                    available according to need.
                       Church office is very different from positions held in the
                    world. In the world a man may choose the type of work he wants
                    to do. He will train for it and then do it as opportunity comes his
                    way. But in the church, effective leadership comes only when
                    Christ is in control and His will is done.

                      What are the primary gifts of the Spirit in the life of the
                    church?
                       Apostles: "Their office was the most important to which
                    human beings had ever been called, second only to that of
                    Christ Himself. They were to be workers together with God for
                    the saving of men. As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs
                    stood as representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles stand
                    as representatives of the gospel church."—The Acts of the
                    Apostles, p. 19.
                       The New Testament tells us of others who were apostles
                    besides the Twelve. Paul was an apostle (1 Cor. 9:1). So were
                    Barnabas, Apollos, Timothy and others. Paul refers to James,
                    the Lord's brother, as one (Gal. 1:19). Most of the apostles were
                    those who had seen Jesus and were witnesses of His resurrec-
                    tion. (See Acts 1:21, 22.) Paul could claim to have seen Jesus
                    and to have been convinced of the resurrection. (See Phil. 3:10.)
                    The root meaning of the word apostle is "one who is sent"—a
                    messenger.
                       Prophets: A prophet is one who speaks for God. He does not
                    necessarily foretell the future, but he may do so as he delivers
                    God's messages. Jesus warned that there would be many false
                    prophets in the last days. (See Matt. 24:11.) But the remnant
                    church will be marked by the gift of prophecy.
                       Evangelists: An evangelist is a bearer of the good news of the
                     gospel. Philip was an evangelist in Samaria (Acts 8:5; 21:8). Paul
                     urged Timothy to do the work of an evangelist (2 Tim. 4:5). An
                    evangelist today is one who concentrates on taking the gospel
                     to those outside the church.
                       Pastors and teachers: It is interesting that these two offices
                     should be placed together. It suggests that the pastor needs to
                     be a teacher, and the teacher needs to be a pastor.

THINK IT THROUGH      How do I see the officers of my church serving the members
                    in the church?

                                                                          March 19

           Part 5     Note the care with which leaders were appointed in
      ELDERS AND    churches raised up by Paul.
       A COUNCIL
                      "When they had ordained them elders in every church, and
                    had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
                    whom they believed" (Acts 14:23).

                      The elders were not to constitute a hierarchy to dominate the
                    church. They were commended to the Lord, on whom they
                    believed and from whom they would receive direction and help.
                    The connection between member and Lord, officer and Lord, is
                    always open, always vital. The church finds its unity, not in
                    organization, but in a relationship to Christ. And it is the spirit of
                    Christ—the spirit of service—that prevails.

                      When the church was faced with a problem of doctrine and
                    practice, how did it proceed to find a solution? Acts 15:2.

                       Read Acts 15:1-35 for the whole story. Note the following
                    aspects:
                       1. The problem is not a simple one, because backgrounds
                    and biases come into play.
                       2. Lengthy arguments are used on both sides, but this does
                    not solve the problem.
                       3. The issue is ultimately the concern of the whole church.
                       4. Delegates are chosen, sent, and received. Apostles and
                    elders are present, and speeches are made.
                       5. James sums up the arguments and proposes a solution.
                       "The council moved in accordance with the dictates of en-
                    lightened judgment, and with the dignity of a church estab-

                    saw that God Himself had answered the question at issue by
                    bestowing upon the Gentiles the Holy Ghost; and they realized
                    that it was their part to follow the guidance of the Spirit.
                       "The entire body of Christians was not called upon to vote
                    upon the question. The 'apostles and elders,' men of influence

                                                                          March 20

           Part 6   What type of leader did Jesus say we should not follow in all
          FALSE respects?
        LEADERS
                    "All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that ob-
                  serve and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and
                  do not" (Matt. 23:3).

                       Read the whole of chapter 23. Notethe marks of a bad leader:
                       1. He is concerned about show and wants to be seen of men
                    in places of honor and to be called by honorific titles (verses
                    5-7).
                       2. He does not go into the kingdom himself, and he hinders
                    others from doing. so (verse 13).
                       3. He profits from the poor and needy, but he says long
                    prayers to suggest that he is pious (verse 14).
                       4. He is apparently zealous for the salvation of men and
                    exerts himself a good deal in this respect, but the result of his
                    work does not promote the work of God (verse 15).
                       5. His teaching does not stand up to reason (verses 16-22).
                       6. He is so legalistic in his interpretation of what is right and
                    wrong that in the end he insists on minute details but overlooks
                    gross breaches of the law (verses 23-26).
                       7. He rejects God's messages of truth and persecutes those
                    who want to do what is right (verses 34, 35).
                        Will leaders in the church have any of these characteristics?
                    Not if they have the grace of God in their hearts. But there is
                    always the danger that the church will become so in-
                     stitutionalized that it ceases to represent God and His activity.
                    Instead of being shepherds of the flock, the ministers will be
                     hirelings who run away in time of danger and fail to do the work
                     they have agreed to do.

                      By contrast, how are God's chosen leaders to act? 1 Peter
                    4:10, 11.

                       "It is as if Peter said, 'When you are engaged in Christian
                    service, you must not do it or give it as if you were conferring a
                    personal favour, or distributing bounty from your own store, but
                    in the consciousness that what you give, you first received from
                    God.' Such an attitude preserves the giver from all pride and the
                    gift from all humiliation."—William Barclay, The Letters of
                    James and Peter (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1960),
                    p. 304.
                       What a difference it would make to the church today if every-
                    thing done in it were done to the glory of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What alone can keep a leader from being pharisaical in his
                    leadership?

           Part 1     How fitting was the parable Jesus used to describe the
        WISE AND    church in the last days?
         FOOLISH
                      "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
                    virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the
                    bridegroom" (Matt. 25:1).

                       The previous chapter records Jesus' description of condi-
                    tions that will exist in the world just before His coming. It is at
                    just such a time that the principles in the parable of the ten
                    virgins are particularly applicable.

                      What fact regarding the time of Christ's coming makes it
                    important for God's people to be watching at all times? Matt.
                    25:13.

                       The virgins are to have their lamps ready. The Word of God is a
                    lamp that enables them to know how and where their feet are to
                    tread. (See Ps. 119:105.) The oil is the Holy Spirit. (Compare
                    Zech. 4:1-14.) God has supplied the lamp and the oil as well.
                       "Without the Spirit of God a knowledge of His word is of no
                    avail. The theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit,
                    cannot quicken the soul or sanctify the heart. One may be
                    familiar with the commands and promises of the Bible; but
                    unless the Spirit of God sets the truth home, the character will
                    not be transformed. Without the enlightenment of the Spirit,
                    men will not be able to distinguish truth from error, and they will
                    fall under the masterful deceptions of Satan.
                       "The class represented by the foolish virgins are not hypo-
                    crites. They have a regard for the truth, they have advocated the
                    truth, they are attracted to those who believe the truth; but they
                    have not yielded themselves to the Holy Spirit's working."—
                    Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 408, 411.

                      Contemplate Jesus' warning that those who seem nearest
                    to the kingdom are not always those who will enter it. Matt.
                    8:11, 12.

                       Read Matthew 8:5-10. The centurion had shown implicit faith
                    in the power of Jesus to heal, not by a magical touch or a
                    so-called charismatic presence, but merely by His word. (Con-
                    trast Naaman the leper; 2 Kings 5:11.) This kind of faith must
                    exist among God's people in the last days.

           Part 2     Note Peter's development of the new-birth concept taught
        A LIVING    by Jesus.
           HOPE
                      "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In
                    his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope
                    through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead"
                    (1 Peter 1:3, NIV).

                       When Jesus was crucified on Friday, the early disciples were
                    without hope. Only when they were convinced that He had risen
                    from the dead did new life surge through them. Only when they
                    could see that the whole Old Testament had pointed to a suffer-
                    ing Messiah did they begin to hope. (See Luke 24:25-27.)
                       The Christian hope centers in the second coming of Christ. It
                    matters not what life's experiences may be here on earth. They
                    may be pleasant or unpleasant. It is the future that counts. Peter
                    says that he can now look forward to "an inheritance that can
                    never perish" (1 Peter 1:4, NIV). It is safely kept in heaven, not
                    only for him, but for us. Furthermore, through faith we are
                    shielded by God's power "until the coming of the salvation that
                    is ready to be revealed in the last time" (verse 5, NIV). And
                    because of this we can all be happy, regardless of the cir-
                    cumstances through which we have to pass (verse 6).

                       In writing to Titus, Paul speaks of the Christian's hope and
                    its consequences. Titus 2:12, 13.

                      As a blessed hope it teaches us "to say 'No' to ungodliness
                    and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and
                    godly lives in this present age" (verse 12, NIV).
                      The church member dedicates himself wholly to the princi-*-
                    ples of God's righteousness. He wants nothing to do with the
                    ways of this world, because he belongs to another kingdom—
                    one that will never pass away.

                      Do you recognize the pilgrim nature of the Christian life as
                    expressed in Hebrews 13:14?

                      The church member is willing to wait for God's plans to work
                    out. They will always be for the best. Men of faith in the past did
                    not receive the fulfillment of the promises, and we today may
                    not either, but the time will come when God will make all things
                    perfect. (See Heb. 11:39, 40.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Is it true that the otherworldliness of the Christian does not
                    necessarily make him negligent of his duties on earth?

       DRAMATIC     earth?
        CHANGES
                      "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
                    which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
                    elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
                    works that are therein shall be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10).

                      This old world, sin-cursed as it is, cannot continue forever.
                    The time will come when God will destroy sin and all that has
                    been affected by it. By that time everyone will have had an
                    opportunity to decide his fate. God will have vindicated His
                    name and character of love, and sin will have been seen to be
                    the destructive and cruel element it certainly is. Those who have
                    chosen sin have by now become so involved in it that they
                    cannot be distinguished from it. As in the case of Satan, there is
                    no further room for mercy. It is a mercy that they are destroyed
                    and that the world is cleansed from the defilement of sin.

                     Until that time comes, how does Paul describe creation?
                    Rom. 8:19-23.

                      Paul is aware of the glories to come. He knows that we are
                    children of God and therefore "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
                    Christ" (verse 17). But meanwhile there is a groaning and a
                    longing for change. Not only do human beings want a change,
                    but the whole creation is involved.

                      Note the way the writer to the Hebrews describes the hope
                    that is set before the Christian. Heb. 6:19.

                       The symbol is that of an anchor which steadies the ship in the
                    time of storm and keeps it from running before the wind. Some
                    people are unsteady. They are moved by every wind of doctrine.
                    (See Eph. 4:14.) They are easily deceived, easily upset. One can
                    never be sure of the direction they are taking. They cannot be
                    depended on to steer a steady course in life. James likens such a
                    person to a wave of the sea. He has no strong faith as a steady-
                    ing influence. By contrast, the Christian has a hope that does
                    not waver. He knows that it is based on the promises of God, and
                    God cannot lie. (See Heb. 6:16-18.)
                      Thus the church of the last days has a faith in God that cannot
                    be shaken; and even when the last great dramatic changes take
                    place in nature, church members will not be afraid but will know
                    that God's Word is being fulfilled.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I best prepare to meet the calamities that will come
                    upon the world?

          Part 4   Of what did Paul say he did not want Christians to be ignor-
         SECOND ant?
         ADVENT
                   "I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
                 them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
                 which have no hope" (1 Thess. 4:13).

                       There is no sorrow greater than that which comes with the
                    passing away of a loved one. But the Christian has hope. The
                    loved one has not gone forever. Because Christ has risen from
                    the dead, the portals of death can be opened. In fact, says Paul,
                    the time is coming when there will be a resurrection of the
                    righteous. It will be at the time of the second coming.
                       This gives great comfort for the present. A time of reunion is
                    coming, when we will be caught up with all saints to meet the
                    Lord in the air and to be with Christ forevermore (verse 17).

                      How universal will be the knowledge of Christ's second
                    coming? Rev. 1:7.

                       The voice of the archangel and the sound of the trumpet will
                    be heard. Clouds of angels will be seen. The advent will be as
                    lightning that shines from the east to the west. (See Matt. 24:27.)
                    Graves will open, and the righteous dead will arise. What an
                    advent that will be! The human mind cannot grasp it, nor can the
                    imagination comprehend it. For some it will be a frightening
                    moment. For others it will be a moment of great joy. For the
                    church it will be the climax of the ages.

                      What other important change takes place at the second
                    advent? 1 Cor. 15:51-58.

                      Death is a great enemy now. But at the second advent, death
                    will be swallowed up in victory.
                       This corruptible flesh will be replaced by something incor-
                    ruptible. The present mortal state will be changed to that which
                    is immortal.
                       John has been cited on the wide impact of the advent. He also
                    says we shall be like our Lord, seeing Him as He is. Because of
                    this hope we now seek to be pure even as our Lord is pure. (See
                    1 John 3:2, 3.)
                       The church thus looks forward to the second coming and
                    meanwhile seeks to do God's will and to be covered by Jesus'
                    merits. By this means its members may indeed qualify to be
                    among the redeemed.

 THINK IT THROUGH    Why are some people afraid of the second coming of Jesus?
                    What may I do or say to ease their fear?

                                                                        March 26
           Part 5     Savor the great rejoicing among God's last-day servants.
      A WEDDING
         SUPPER       "Let us rejoice and be glad
                        and give him glory!
                      For the wedding of the Lamb has come,
                        and his bride has made herself ready" (Rev. 19:7, NIV).

                      John the revelator looks down to the end of time and sees the
                    saints rejoicing because there is to be a wedding involving the
                    Lamb and the New Jerusalem—the home of the saints. John
                    explains that the linen in verse 8 stands for the righteousness of
                    the saints. Then he adds: "Blessed are those who are invited to
                    the wedding supper of the Lamb!" (verse 9, MV).

                      What parable did Jesus relate which gives us further details
                    about the marriage supper of the Lamb? Matt. 22:1-14.

                      Three invitations are sent out to call people to the wedding:
                    The first was when Jesus and His disciples announced to the
                    Jewish people that the kingdom of heaven was at hand—that
                    people should repent and believe the gospel. Unfortunately, the
                    vast majority of the people and the Jewish leaders did not
                    respond With gratitude; they rejected the invitation.
                      The second went out in the power of the Holy Spirit after
                    Pentecost. But once again the invitation was rejected, and the
                    bearers of the message were persecuted and put to death.
                      The third invitation is addressed to the Gentiles; and the
                    gospel is preached to every nation, kindred, tongue, and
                    people.

                      What destiny-settling counsel is given to the church of
                    Laodicea? Rev. 3:18.

                        "This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one
                    thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out a
                    perfect character, and this character He offers to impart to
                    us."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 311.
                       To accept the wedding invitation is a great privilege. To reject
                    it is also a terrible disaster. (See Matt. 22:7.) Accepting the
                    invitation means also accepting God's standards for us in His
                    plan of salvation. This does not involve any hardship for us; but
                    if we do not take advantage of our opportunities, we may be like
                    the man without the wedding garment who was "speechless"
                    before the king.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do I understand why so many people reject the gospel
                    message?

       THE NEW     what was the nature of the city coming down out of heaven?
     JERUSALEM
                     "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
                   God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for tier hus-
                   band" (Rev. 21:2).

                      The New Jerusalem is described as "the bride, the Lamb's
                   wife" (verse 9). It is the capital of that kingdom which Jesus
                   receives from the "Ancient of days," as described in Daniel 7:13,
                   14. It is a kingdom that will never pass away, in which peace and
                   righteousness will prevail.

                    What are some of the conditions that will exist in the earth
                   made new? Rev. 21:3, 4.

                      "In the Bible the inheritance of the saved is called 'a country.'
                   Heb. 11:14-16. There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to
                   fountains of living waters. The tree of life yields its fruit every
                   month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the
                   nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and
                   beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths
                   prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spread-
                   ing plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God
                   rear their lofty summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those
                   living streams, God's people, so long pilgrims and wanderers,
                   shall find a home."—The Great Controversy, p. 675.

                     Savor the poetic words with which Isaiah contrasts what will
                   exist then with what exists today. Isa. 11:6-9.

                       "One reminder [of sin] alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever
                   bear the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head,
                   upon His side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel
                   work that sin has wrought."—The Great Controversy, p. 674.
                       "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more.
                   The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and glad-
                   ness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all,
