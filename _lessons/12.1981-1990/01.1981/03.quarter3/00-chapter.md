Dear Sabbath School Members,

The Lord is pouring out such rich and abundant blessings upon our South Ameri-
can Division that it is like the widow's cruse of oil, and we are discovering
that it is necessary to go to our neighbors to ask for more "containers" so
that these too can be filled with God's overflowing blessings--the blessings
of new members joining our church ranks in great numbers.

What the South American Division needs most at this time are chapels and
schools made necessary by the increase of membership. The recently organized
West-Amazon Mission in particular needs new chapels urgently. The city of
Fortaleza needs an evangelistic center. A great deal of help is needed for
the new Trans-Amazon Academy already under construction and for other academy
construction in Brazil. We are thankful for the evangelistic outreach of our
secondary schools and rejoice in their growth.

I would like to express our gratitude to all of you in the Sabbath Schools
throughout the world for your help in the past as well as for the assistance
you will be giving us this Thirteenth Sabbath, for we are sure that your
traditional generosity will be abundantly manifest. As a result of this
united effort by the people of God, we will see the fruition of these proj-
ects in the South American Division.

We extend to you our love, fully abiding in the glorious hope of our Lord's
soon return.

Yours in Christ,




Presided

Gifts are a sign of caring. We like to give gifts to those we
love. How about the best gift? Let's invite someone we
love to Sabbath School and church on the next Com-
munity Guest Day. Your friend may accept the best gift
of all, eternal life. Caring can mean eternal life. Yes,
caring is life.

                           THIS WE BELIEVE
                       Studies in Christian Doctrine—Part I
                                        Introduction

   There are several reasons for studying the Christian doctrines on which the beliefs
of Seventh-day Adventists are based. First, memories are weak, and we need to
refresh our knowledge. Second, we are expected to grow in knowledge, and so we
need to restudy our faith in order to enlarge our understanding of it. Third, biblical
truth is of so rich a nature that fresh glimpses of its wealth always await our discovery.
Fourth, while the substance of truth does not change, the form in which it is cast and
the appeal that it makes need study from time to time to keep them relevant to the time
and place where truth is taught. But jewels that are reset do not change their nature
though their value may be increased. So it is with truth. After all, God has adapted His
teachings to the constantly changing human scene—from the Garden of Eden to the
advent movement and modern times.
   On a much smaller scale, each generation of Adventists must take a fresh look at its
beliefs, applying them to local circumstances and expressing them to meet contem-
porary needs. Such study does not yield to unbelief; indeed it provides an opportunity
to strengthen faith in eternal truths.
   Let us consider one more reason for a fresh look at some of our major beliefs. When
we first accepted them, they probably came through another person. We need to
make them our own by means of mature study. By regular, thoughtful attention to
Scripture we can make each doctrine an expression of our own conviction on that
subject. We can thus gain a deeply personal faith that is founded on a rich under-
standing of the Bible and a closer fellowship with the Father; Son, and Holy Spirit.
And while we are studying, we should remember that our God expects us to serve Him
with all our mind as well as with our other abilities. It has been said that the duty to use
our intelligence is. a moral duty, especially in the area of religious knowledge.
Carrying out that duty may spell the difference between life and death!
   Two quarters' Sabbath School lessons (as we shall have) will not suffice for a
survey of all the doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church; so we have to choose
some and leave others. The very act of selection may help to underline those teach-
ings that we see as most necessary for the 1980s. Similarly with the choice of
supporting verses—it may stimulate us to find varied scriptural support for beliefs we
hold dear.
   Finally, and most important of all, there is the need to apply each article of faith to
our way of living. Unless this is done, we are merely collecting lifeless theological
declarations that become as dry as the proverbial hills of Gilboa. It is our act of
applying that gives the Holy Spirit the opportunity to breathe anew into each doctrine
the breath of life that brings a change in our lives. There is not one biblical teaching
that does not require personal application to make it come alive for each of us; and
there is not one, no matter how difficult or even theoretical it may appear, that will not
bring spiritual life to them that accept and apply it in daily living.
   Therefore, in the words of the most famous of all citizens of Tarsus: "Keep before
you an outline of the sound teaching which you heard from me, living by the faith and
love which are ours in Christ Jesus. Guard the treasure put into our charge, with the
help of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us" (2 Tim. 1:14, NEB). Then with confidence
we shall be able to proclaim, "This we believe!"
                                                                                          7

   "God, who at sundry times and in      persons of the prophets, then, in
divers manners spake in time past unto   early New Testament times, in the
the fathers by the prophets, hath in     Person of His Son. Through the same
these last days spoken unto us by his    Son, He had created the universe, of
Son, whom he hath appointed heir of      which the Son had already been
all things, by whom also he made the     appointed heir and therefore
worlds" (Heb. 1:1, 2).                   Sovereign Lord.
                                            Such a text provides a firm
   This text is our first memory verse   foundation for our first week's
for the quarter. It deserves to be       lesson, which teaches that He whom
memorized. It contains much vital        Christians worship is a God who
information in a few words. It covers    makes Himself known. If He had not
about 4000 years of God's dealings       chosen to reveal Himself to His
with His people, recording that          creatures, they would have no means
which He had spoken to them in the       of finding Him. God must take any
                                         first step, therefore; and our lesson
                                         touches briefly on the three principal
                                         ways in which He has given His
                                         self-revelation to men. This deals
                                         with a foundational doctrine.
                                         Without it, none of the others would
                                         have been formulated: from it, those
                                         others flow.
                                            This first lesson for the new
                                         quarter falls into four parts. First
                                         comes the revelation of God through
                                         His creation (parts 1 and 2); then
                                         comes the unfolding through
                                         inspired Scripture (parts 3 and 4);
                                         then the supreme revelation in the
                                         Person of Christ (part 5); and last, the
                                         application of this doctrine of
                                         revelation to our lives, or our
                                         response to what God has revealed.

                                                                                June 28
               Part 1     How may all men and women receive their introduction to
              IN HIS    the nature and works of Deity?
           CREATION
                          "All that may be known of God by men lies plain before their
                        eyes; indeed God himself has disclosed it to them. His invisi-
                        ble attributes, that is to say his everlasting power and deity,
                        have been visible, ever since the world began, to the eye of
                        reason, in the things he has made" (Rom. 1:19, 20, NEB).

                          This is a special statement, not a broad, general one. Paul has
                        earlier introduced "the gospel of Christ" (verse 16), and now he
                        turns to consider those who have not heard it. They have not
                        been left completely without a way to know God. All that men
                        are capable of learning about Him without special revelation
                        has been widely displayed in nature. Sufficient revelation of
                        "his everlasting power and deity" (verse 20, NEB) has been
                        given in His creation that all who will may know that God is.
                          While even the most careful study of nature cannot tell us
                        anything about the person of God, it can prepare us to accept
                        His presence in the universe. Nature is not found to be self-
                        creative or self-sustaining. "It is not by inherent power that year
                        by year the earth yields it bounties and continues its march
                        around the sun. The hand of the Infinite One is perpetually at
                        work guiding this planet. It is God's power continually exercised
                        that keeps the earth in position in its rotation."—The Ministry of
                        Healing, p. 416.

                          God invites skeptic and believer alike to examine the visual
                        evidence for His creative activity. Isa. 40:26.

                           A more literal translation of the second half of this verse and
                        adjustment of the punctuation brings out the prophet's mes-
                        sage more clearly: "that bringeth out their host by number, and
                        calleth them all by names: through the greatness of his might
                        and great power not one faileth," or "not one is missing."
                          Before man was made, the stars and planets in their brilliant
                        and orderly array silently spoke of the existence of a Creator.
                        The heavenly bodies continue to present that evidence, and all
                        men and women are invited to take time to lift up their eyes on
                        high and read it. Our survey of the heavens can open the eyes of
                        our minds to the greatness of Him who conceived, created, and
                        sustains the stars in their courses.

THINK IT THROUGH          What more can I yet learn about God from nature? What
                        effort am I making to acquire additional knowledge?

God the Revelator          LESSON 1                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                          June 29
             Part 2     What convictions did the psalmist receive as he gazed into
            IN THE    the heavens?
          HEAVENS
                        "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
                      sheweth his handywork" (Ps. 19:1).

                         The psalmist employs the same Hebrew words for "heavens"
                      and "firmament" as are used in Genesis 1:1 and 6. It is possible
                      to distinguish between the two by defining "heavens" as the
                      entire space in which all heavenly bodies are suspended, while
                      "firmament" is applied to the dome of the atmosphere into
                      which we look when we gaze at the space above us. The word
                      "declare" translates a Hebrew term that comes from a special
                      form of the verb "to write," and may be more richly rendered as
                      "tell with praise" or "celebrate." The word translated as
                      "sheweth" is still more vivid and suggests "proclaims" or
                      "celebrates with praise."
                         To him who thoughtfully looks at them both, the "heavens"
                      and the "firmament" reveal many aspects of their Creator's
                      nature—"the glory of God," His power, His majesty, His infinite
                      nature; "his handywork," His inventiveness, His skill, His su-
                      preme sense of order and beauty. To such an observer "day
                      unto day" will "pour out" or "gush forth" speech (as the origi-
                      nal word for "uttereth" implies), and "night unto night" will
                      "breathe out" or "declare" knowledge (verse 2). And this reve-
                      lation is worldwide, even universal (verse 3).

                        What questions concerning man did David's study of as-
                      tronomy provoke in him? Ps. 8:3, 4.

                         The psalmist was a keen observer of the heavens. What he
                      saw confirmed his belief in a Creator and led him to ask how
                      such an Almighty Being could bow low to care for so lowly, so
                      earthy and weak a creature as man. The answer revealed man as
                      the intended and still to be crown of creation, invested with
                      authority over animals, birds, and fish (verses 6-8). The revela-
                      tion increased the psalmist's admiration for the Maker of the
                      universe and Restorer of fallen man: "0 Lord our Lord, how
                      excellent is thy name in all the earth!" (verses 1,9). Modern man,
                      having gained a deeper knowledge of that universe, has still
                      more reason for believing in that Creator.

        WORD—I
                      "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" (2 Tim. 3:16).

                       The realm of nature speaks a wordless language that can say
                    very different things to different people. Mankind, therefore,
                    needs clearer instruction if he is to gain deeper insight into the
                    attributes and powers of the Creator. Christianity claims that
                    this is given in the Bible or Scripture, and that this has been
                    "given by inspiration of God."
                       There are two permissible ways of translating the Greek orig-
                    inal of the text quoted above. It can be rendered "Every God-
                    breathed writing is," or, "All scripture is God-breathed," that is,
                    "inspired." Some interpreters would wish to use the former to
                    suggest that some scriptures are inspired and some are not. As
                    we shall note, however, there is no compelling reason to decline
                    the second reading which harmonizes best with the total wit-
                    ness of the Bible about itself.
                       It is difficult and dangerous to build a doctrine on one text,
                    and here it is not necessary, for the whole Bible unites to sup-
                    port the claim that it is "given by inspiration of God." Re-
                    peatedly from beginning to end it claims to quote the speech of
                    the Most High in many of its passages (see examples in Gen. 1:3,
                    6, 26, 28, 29; and Rev. 22:13, 17, 20), without claiming a dicta-
                    tional inspiration, its writers repeatedly declare that they are
                    giving out "the word of the Lord" (2 Kings 17:13; Isa. 1:2, 10; 6:8;
                    42:5-8; Joel 1:1; Gal. 1:11, 12; Rev. 1:1, 2).

                      List some of the personal benefits that may be gained from
                    a personal knowledge of the Bible. 2 Tim. 3:15-17.

                       The Holy Scriptures are the only books that hold within their
                    pages a worthy original revelation of God and His plan for
                    recreating the creation that has been so brutally marred by sin.
                    Those Scriptures can make their students "wise unto salva-
                    tion," and convincingly teach, rebuke, correct, and train them in
                    righteousness or in right conduct. In so doing, they reveal their
                    more-than-human origin and establish their claim to inspiration
                    and to being a prime source of our knowledge of God.

THINK IT THROUGH      Of what value is the Bible's own testimony concerning its
                    divine origin?

God the Revelator       LESSON 1                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       July 1
          Part 4   What claim is made concerning the source of biblical
         IN HIS prophecy?
       WORD—II
                   "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
                 any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old
                 time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
                 were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:20, 21).

                      The primary application of Peter's words is to prophetic pas-
                   sages in the Old Testament; but since Scripture itself makes no
                   distinction between the inspiration that produced prophecy
                   and that which prompted the remainder of the Bible, the apos-
                   tle's declaration embraces all scriptures from Genesis to
                   Malachi. The same principle can be carried over to all New
                   Testament writings, for these clearly endorse the Old Testament
                   and similarly claim God as their Inspirer. Compare 2 Peter 3:15,
                   16, where Paul's epistles are classed with "the other scrip-
                   tures."
                      Although the Bible was written by men, its messages were not
                   created by them. They were mouthpieces or penmen for the
                   Holy Spirit, who "drove" or "impelled" them to convey for the
                   record the divine disclosures. Thus the two Testaments
                   preserve revelations from God about God and His plan to save
                   mankind. The Scriptures, then, speaking in human language,
                   present us with a fuller portrait of the Creator than we can ever
                   discover in nature. (See Ex. 34:5-7; Isa. 57:15; Micah 7:18; 1 Tim.
                   1:17.)

                     Evaluate the claim to authorship conveyed in the following
                   passages. Ex. 20:1 with Deut. 5:22; 2 Sam. 23:1-3; Jer. 1:1-10;
                   1 Cor. 2:12, 13; Heb. 1:1, 2.

                     On many occasions. Moses, David, Jeremiah, Paul, and other
                   Bible prophets claimed to be recording or proclaiming the di-
                   rect speech of the Lord, as distinct from passing on His mes-
                   sages in their own words. This gives impressive authority to
                   their communications and closely connects the attentive reader
                   with God's own thoughts on matters of eternal consequence.
                     "The Bible is God's voice speaking to us, just as surely as
                   though we could hear it with our ears. If we realized this, ... the
                   reading and contemplation of the Scriptures would be regarded
                   as an audience with the Infinite One."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p.
                   393.

THINK IT THROUGH     What does the Bible reveal about the nature of the Almighty
                   that cannot be clearly drawn from nature?

  FURTHER STUDY      Nine of the twelve minor prophets speak "the word of the
                   Lord" to their peoples. Trace this in the opening verses of all the
                   twelve save Amos, Nahum, and Habakkuk, then discover that
                   same "word of the Lord" in those three also.

                                                                                    13
God the Revelator        LESSON 1                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                           July 2

           Part 5     In spite of all that is declared in nature, and in spite of the
      IN HIS SON    abundant revelation in Scripture, men and women still sadly
                    misunderstand the character of God. If Deity had not decided to
                    reveal Himself more clearly, men would have formed poorer and
                    poorer ideas of His character and intentions and would have
                    lost all saving knowledge of their Creator. To save man from this
                    destructive ignorance, God planned a still clearer revelation of
                    Himself.

                      By what means has God worked to make up for man's
                    inability to see Him?

                      "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son,
                    which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him"
                    (John 1:18).

                       Some have had visions of God (Isa. 6:1; Eze. 1:1; Dan. 7:9,10),
                    but not even Moses (Ex. 33:18-23) or Elijah (1 Kings 19:9-13), or
                    Paul (2 Cor. 12:1-4) has been permitted to see God. God's glory
                    is so great and man's sin-weakened capacity is so small that no
                    human eye can bear to look upon the divine radiance (John
                    5:37; 6:46; 1 Tim. 6:16). A pitying, merciful God chose, there-
                    fore, to reveal Himself in the Person of His Son, who so lived on
                    earth that our text can state: "He [God the Son] hath declared
                    him," and the Son Himself could say: "He that hath seen me
                    hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).

                      Think upon the significance of each item in Paul's summary
                    of the incarnate revelation of God in Christ. 1 Tim. 3:16.

                       It is thought that this verse reflects an early Christian confes-
                    sion of faith, set in the form of a hymn. "Mystery" comes from
                    the Greek musterion, "a hidden thing" or "a secret." "Among
                    . . . pagans musterion . . . was used for secrets or secret doc-
                    trines, to be made known only to those who had been specially
                    initiated. . . .
                       "In the NT, musterion refers to something that God wills to
                    make known to those who are willing to receive His revelation,
                    rather than to something that He desires to keep secret."—
                    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 610.
                       "Godliness" is rendered by most modern translators as "our
                    religion"; while the best manuscripts favor "he who was man-
                    ifest in the flesh" rather than "God was manifest." The text
                    clearly refers to Jesus, who in His human form so appealingly
                    revealed the character of His Father. (See also John 1:14.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Which principal characteristics of the divine mind do you
                    see most clearly revealed by Jesus of Nazareth?

                                                                              July 3
          Part 6    Apart from its revelations concerning the Creator and His
           OUR     works, what does God's Word reveal about ourselves?
      RESPONSE
                     "The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
                   any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
                   soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner
                   of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Heb. 4:12).

                     The Word is very much "quick" or "alive" today. Age does not
                   lessen its powers to reach us. It still has a special ability to pierce
                   our self-protective armor, to get to the heart of our aspirations
                   and our temptations, our strengths and our weaknesses. The
                   Word lays bare our secret thoughts and exposes our motives. It
                   challenges us to accept its teachings and heed its biddings.

                     What other benefits accrue to those who allow themselves
                   to be guided by divine revelation? Ps. 119:1, 105.

                      Those who faithfully follow the Bible's counsel find it is reli-
                   able and rewarding. As a result, they become "blessed" or
                   "happy." They also receive guidance for daily living. Divine light
                   shines on their pathway. In this respect, the Word may be
                   likened to a map which, if followed, will direct its reader to his
                   desired destination. But note that its directives must be heeded;
                   the Word cannot help those who reject its counsels. To see God
                   in nature, to learn about Him from the Bible, to become ac-
                   quainted with His Son—beneficial as all these accomplish-
                   ments may be, they are deceptive, they are useless if we do not
                   yield to their messages and allow them to bring us in penitence
                   to our Maker. .

                     In the light of all that has been revealed to us, what should
                   be our response to God the Revelator? Ps. 95:6, 7.

                     This is the natural response from those who truly see God. It
                   might rightly be said that those who do not render Him such
                   homage have not really seen Him. They have caught a distorted
                   view which leads them to deny what their finer senses would
                   confess. And remember that there are none so blind as those
                   who will not see. May we be preserved from such blindness!
                   Rather, may we "see the king in his beauty," and say: "Thou art
                   worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and power" (Isa.
                   33:17; Rev. 4:11).

THINK IT THROUGH     To what extent has our personal knowledge of God as
                   Creator, King, Redeemer Increased during the past year?
                   Face whatever truth an honest answer brings.

                                          Sunday's lesson. Succeeding days
                                          consider His creatorship, His
                                          kingship, His holiness, His paternal
                                          love, and His redemptive act in
                                          giving His Son. Study of these
                                          features should bring us to our knees
                                          in humility and gratitude before Him
                                          in whom "we live, and move, and
                                          have our being" (Acts 17:28). We
                                          may be led to confess, "My God, Thy
                                          benefits demand more praise than I
                                          can give" (The Church Hymnal, no.
                                          71), but we should give Him the
                                          highest adoration of which we are
                                          capable.

                                                                                 July 5
              Part 1     Note Moses' telling contrast in his statement of belief in the
        THE ETERNAL    eternal nature of God.

                         "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou
                       hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
                       everlasting, thou art God" (Ps. 90:2).

                         In this, the only psalm that has come down to us from Moses,
                       the veteran leader records his unquestioning belief in God's
                       eternity. He who wrote Genesis, chapter 1, clearly sees that the
                       Creator Himself must have existed before His creative activities.
                       Moses sees no bounds to that existence. God is from everlast-
                       ing to everlasting, that is, from timeless eternity in the past,
                       continuing into timeless eternity in the future. But that is ex-
                       pressed in human terms. There can be no "time" with the
                       Eternal. He lives in an eternal present. Therefore Moses can say:
                       "A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
                       past" (verse 4).

                         Consider the mind-stretching character of God's definition
                       of Himself to Moses. Ex. 3:13-15; 6:2, 3.

                          The exiled Hebrew was being commissioned to lead his
                       people out of Egyptian slavery. He needed to know the identity
                       of Him who was sending him on that fearsome task. The reply
                       came, "I AM THAT I AM" (Ex. 3:14), which answer, it is now
                       generally agreed, may be better expressed in English as " I WILL
                       BE WHAT I WILL BE." To the Hebrews, this conveyed the con-
                       cept of the eternity and possibly the self-existence of God. The
                       proper name derived from that expression used to be rendered
                       "Yahweh," but this, for reasons of language into which we shall
                       not enter here, has been adjusted to "Jehovah." That name is
                       translated as "LORD" in Exodus 6:2 and is printed in capital
                       letters throughout the KJV. In Exodus 6:3, however, the old
                       anglicized form "JEHOVAH" is preserved. (See also Ps. 83:18;
                       Isa. 12:2; 26:4.) The most helpful rendering is probably that
                       given in the French: "L'Eternel." The English-speaking world
                       might well adopt the truly reverent title of "The Eternal," even as
                       James Moffatt has done in his translation.
                         It may be persuasively argued that the eternity of God is one of
                       His prime attributes and one of the weightiest incentives for us
                       to worship Him. He who always has been, ever is, and ever will
                       be (Rev. 1:4-6; 4:8) is the Creator and can have no rival (compare
                       Ex. 20:3; Isa. 40:25; 43:10; 1 Tim. 1:17).

THINK IT THROUGH         Here we have only touched the lowest thread on the hem of
                       the glorious garment of God. Ought we not to seek a higher
                       understanding of His greatness? Let us consecrate some
                       time to doing this during this week's study.

Everlasting Father       LESSON 2                                    ❑    Monday
                                                                           July 6
           Part 2     The Eternal must also be the Creator, for, so far as human
    THE CREATOR     reasoning can perceive, there must have been a time when the
                    Eternal was alone. If that aloneness was to change, creation had
                    to begin. Creation is shown solely as an act of the Godhead.
                    Although nature and man can do wonders in continuing the
                    productive processes on planet Earth, neither has the power to
                    start a creation. Creation demands a creative power outside that
                    which is created. The mystery of life remains in the mind and
                    hand of the Creator. The magnificent simplicity of Genesis 1:1
                    still stands: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the
                    earth." This is spelled out more fully in Isaiah 42:5.

                      In the light of the glory of Creation, what questions concern-
                    ing the Creator should men solemnly consider?

                      "Nast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the ever-
                    lasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth,
                    fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
                    understanding" (Isa. 40:28).

                       We hear, but we easily forget. We therefore need repeatedly to
                    face life's greatest questions and to remind ourselves of the
                    answers. Today's scripture enquires: "Hast thou not known:
                    hast thou not heard?" and we must admit that we have known,
                    we have heard—but alas, we are so apt to forget. We need to
                    reject the temptation to create Him in our own feeble image: He
                    is never weak, never tired; His resources are unlimited; His
                    knowledge is fathomless. He is able, then, to be "the Creator of
                    the ends of the earth" and all that lies beyond.

                      As Paul immersed himself in a study of God's ways, what
                    awe-inspiring conclusions did he reach? Rom. 11:33-36.

                      If we were to meditate on the person, the character, and the
                    works of God as deeply as did Paul, we, while not inspired,
                    would be led to express a level of wonder similar to his. In
                    particular we would recognize our God as the Originator, the
                    Sustainer, the Monarch of all created things, and to Him we
                    would render the highest adoration of which we would then be
                    capable (Rom. 11:36).

THINK IT THROUGH       "Great, 0 Lord, is Thy kingdom, Thy power, and Thy glory;
                    great are Thy works, Thy wonders, and Thy praises; great also
                    is Thy wisdom, Thy goodness, Thy justice, Thy mercy; and for
                    all these we do bless Thee, and will magnify Thy holy name for
                    ever and ever." Attributed to George Wither (1588-1667).

Everlasting Father         LESSON 2                                      ❑   Tuesday
                                                                               July 7

             Part 3     Examine the significance of the brief description of our God
        ROYAL LORD    given by one of the psalmists.

                        "The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods"
                      (Ps. 95:3).

                        The poet lived in a world of many gods. Only one small nation
                      had the vision and the courage to accept the revelation and to
                      choose to worship one God. Its spiritual leaders saw the "Lord
                      God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel" (1 Kings 18:36) as the only
                      deity worthy of worship; and in their better moments of faith the
                      ordinary citizens of Israel cried: "The Lord, he is the God; the
                      Lord, he is the God" (verse 39). When truly worshiping Him, they
                      turned from all other gods and saw their Lord as Sovereign
                      Ruler of the universe.
                        The psalms of David and other writers contain a wealth of rev-
                      elation concerning God's majesty, power, glory, justice, holi-
                      ness, and love. The Christian church has used the psalms for
                      some two thousand years and has thereby greatly enriched its
                      worship. We can enlarge our understanding of God by explor-
                      ing these same poems. We might begin with Psalms 11, 16, 18,
                      25, and 29 and continue till we reach the unparalleled insights in
                      Psalms 139, 145, and 147.

                       On the threshold of eternity, what charge is given to the
                      godly? What shout of praise will greet the ears of the Al-
                      mighty? Rev. 19:5,. 6.

                         This nineteenth chapter of Revelation opens with four "Al-
                      leluias" (verses 1, 3, 4, 6) that proclaim the triumph of "the Lord
                      our God" over all opponents. The godly acclaim the Supreme
                      Being as "the Lord God omnipotent," acknowledging that their
                      Master and God is the Almighty, the All-powerful. This is not a
                      fresh discovery. It was revealed in Creation and in the Exodus. It
                      was recognized by Job (the title "Almighty" is used in the book
                      of Job more than in any other section of the Bible), Abram (Gen.
                      17:1), Isaac (Gen. 28:3), Jacob (Gen. 49:25), the psalmists (Ps.
                      68:14; 91:1), and by the New Testament believers, whose theol-
                      ogy was drawn so largely from the Old Testament. But this final
                      "Alleluia" is different from all others that have sounded in
                      human history. It is based, not on faith, but on visible, conclu-
                      sive evidence. (See Rev. 11:15.)
                         "Those who in heaven join with the angelic choir in their
                      anthem of praise must learn on earth the sound of heaven, the
                      keynote of which is than ksgiving."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 244.

THINK IT THROUGH        What practical application does my belief in God's omnipo-
                      tence have to my daily life as a professed Christian?

Everlasting Father      LESSON 2                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        July 8
          Part 4      Christianity is a courageous religion. It dares to offer stan-
            THE    dards that are above and beyond the merely human. It calmly
       HOLY ONE    does this while knowing that none of its followers is humanly
                   capable of reaching those standards. Its calm is based on its
                   knowledge of the Christian's God. He is sinless. He is the Perfect
                   One. He wants His followers to be perfect as He is and has
                   provided the power for them to be remade in His image. The
                   Christian, then, can regard his Lord's holiness in peace, know-
                   ing that his own sin can be overcome and forgiven by grace
                   from the Holy One.

                    In Isaiah's vision of God (6:1-8), which of the divine qualities
                   was most prominent?

                     "One cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
                   Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory" (Isa. 6:3).

                     We should join the seraphim and Isaiah in contemplating the
                   Lord's perfect holiness. If we catch even a glimpse of what they
                   saw, we shall join Isaiah in crying, "Woe is me! for I am undone;
                   because I am a man of unclean lips" (verse 8). If we fail to reach
                   that conclusion, we probably have not drawn near enough to
                   behold the King, the Lord of hosts, in His "endless wisdom,
                   boundless power, and awful purity."—Frederick W. Faber, The
                   New Advent Hymnal (Watford, Herts.: Stanborough Press,
                   1952), no. 35.

                     What connection does Peter make between God's holiness
                   and the moral standard set for Christians? 1 Peter 1:15, 16.

                      This call to holiness is no new requirement. (See Lev. 11:44;
                   19:2; 20:7, 26.) It stems from the quality of the divine nature. The
                   Holy One originally created only holy beings, and when and
                   since they fell (as all humans have done), He will re-create them
                   only in holiness. But "sanctification is not the work of a mo-
                   ment, an hour, a day, but of a lifetime.... Wrongs cannot be
                   righted nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble,
                   intermittent efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort, sore

 Everlasting Father       LESSON 2                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                           July 9
             Part 5  When, in response to Moses' request, God unveiled all of
            LOVING Himself that the great leader could endure, what revelation
            FATHER was given to Moses?

                       "The Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord,
                     The Lord God, merciful and gracious, Iongsuffering, and
                     abundant in goodness and truth" (Ex. 34:6).

                        After the crisis at Sinai when Israel worshiped the golden calf,
                     Moses asked God: "Shew me thy glory" (Ex. 33:18). In response
                     the Lord replied, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee"
                     (verse 19), and He did this (34:5-7). Moses then saw, not man's
                     idea of God, but God's understanding of Himself. Since He is the
                     embodiment of truth, God's revelation of His character could
                     not be more accurate—though for man's sake it was only partial
                     in its coverage. But what a portrait it paints! Until the incarna-
                     tion, it remained the deepest and highest revelation ever
                     granted mankind outside of Eden. It merits our constant re-
                     membrance, that we might ever know our Maker's mercy, grace,
                     patience, goodness, and truthfulness. We must also perceive
                     the Judge in the picture, realizing He holds us accountable for
                     cherished iniquity, while forgiving what we confess (verse 7).

                       What description does the God-man who knows God best
                     frequently apply to Him? Matt. 6:9.

                        Although in Old Testament days the Creator was sometimes
                     perceived to be the Father (2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 89:26; 103:13; Isa.
                     9:6; Jer. 31:9), it was Jesus who most vividly taught God's
                     Fatherhood. From His Sermon on the Mount onward He intro-
                     duced His hearers to their "Father which art in heaven" and
                     made them aware of hitherto scarcely known divine attributes.
                     (See Matt. 5:16, 45, 48.) And the Son, in His own hours of
                     deepest need, addressed His divine Companion by the tender,
                     trustful title of "Father." (See Luke 22:42; 23:34, 46.)

 THINK IT THROUGH      "Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
                     passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
                     he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth In
                     mercy" (Micah 7:18).

                        "He [Christ] pointed His hearers to the Ruler of the universe,
                     under the new name, 'Our Father.' He would have them under-
                     stand how tenderly the heart of God yearned over them. He
                     teaches that God cares for every lost soul; that 'like as a father
                     pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.' ...
                     such a conception of God was never given to the world by any
                     religion but that of the Bible."—Thoughts From the Mount of

Everlasting Father      LESSON 2                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                            July 10
          Part 6     During the past five days our lesson has glanced—and no
    OUR SAVIOUR    more than glanced—at a few of Deity's most notable qualities.
                   We believe them to be essentials of God's nature: they are what
                   He is. Today's study invites us to see the fruitage borne by those
                   qualities in relation to our sinfulness.

                     "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
                   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                   everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                      Let us look at these words as if we had never seen or heard
                   them before. What a startling, humbling, hope-creating an-
                   nouncement they bring! The great God, "the high and lofty One
                   that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy" (Isa. 57:15), not
                   only made our world but loves it so wholeheartedly and everlast-
                   ingly that He has given Himself in His Son to save His creation
                   from its self-destructive sin. He need not have done this: He
                   could have left us to our fate. But that would have been contrary
                   to the highest of all His qualities—love!

                     Compare Paul's and John's expressions of the same re-
                   demptive news. Rom. 5:8; 1 John 5:11.

                       The Bible clearly places the initiative for our salvation with the
                   Father: it is God who "gave," who "commendeth," who "sent."
                   It is not He who belatedly responded to our despairing cry, but
                   we who respond to His loving act. He wants His erring children
                   to be saved from sin and to live forever. This glorious fact should
                   arouse in us an ever-deepening gratitude. Study Ephesians
                   2:4-7 and savor that love once again, and again!
                           "It is a thing most wonderful,
                              Almost too wonderful to be,
                           That God's own Son should come from heaven,
                              And die to save a child like me."
                                   —Bishop William W. How,
                                   The Church Hymnary, rev. ed. (London:
                                   Oxford University Press, 1942), no. 436.

                     What does Jesus see as the kernel of eternal life? John
                   17:3.

                      In verse 2 the Son has acknowledged His privilege of giving
                   eternal life to those whom the Father designates. In verse 3 He is
                   not defining "life eternal" but rather speaking of one of the
                   essential conditions for enjoying that life, namely, possession
                   of a personal, experiential knowledge of God and of His Son. It
                   is also true, however, that eternal life brings with it the blessing
                   of knowing God in a way that is impossible during a normal
                   life-span.

THINK IT THROUGH     How may I increase my personal knowledge of God's love?

       HIS INCAR-    their knowledge weakened and was increasingly distorted as
          NATION     time removed them far from the original revelation of their
                     Creator. This was foreseen by the Father. From times eternal He
                     planned to give a direct disclosure of Himself in the Person of
                     His Son. Christians see this foreshadowed in Old Testament
                     prophecies. (See Gen. 3:15; 49:10; Num. 24:17; Deut. 18:18; Isa.
                     9:6, 7; Micah 5:2.) "Like the stars in the vast circuit of their
                     appointed path, God's purposes know no haste and no
                     delay."—The Desire of Ages, p. 32. And 40 centuries passed
                     after the Fall before the Son left heaven and came to reveal
                     God's character in His own Person through the incarnation.

                      What momentous news did the angel Gabriel bring from
                     God to an engaged Jewish girl in Nazareth?

                       "The angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost
                     shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
                     overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be
                     born of thee shall be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35).

                       Here we are observers of a most holy moment in human
                     history. The Godhead was visiting a humble but dedicated
                     young woman to appoint her as the mother of her Lord. The
                     Holy Spirit was to be the Agent to bring about that motherhood;
                     the Most High was to "overshadow" her to the same end; and
                     the Second Person of the Godhead was Himself to be the
                     divine-human Babe, the Son of Mary as well as the Son of God.
                     Thus did God demonstrate His intention of saving man from the
                     folly of his sin.

                       Discover the Godhead's two principal objectives in the in-
                     carnation. Matt. 1:18-23.

                       To Luke's beautiful account of the incarnation, Matthew adds
                     further vital details that arise from Mary's conception of Jesus,
                     which has already taken place. It is without question a virgin
                     conception, "of [that is, by] the Holy Ghost" (verses 18, 20). That
                     miracle was for the saving of "his people from their sins" (verse
                     21) by giving them a Saviour who was sinless—"in all points
                     tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4:15), and there-
                     fore "able to succour them that are tempted" (Heb. 2:18). The
                     virgin birth also brought God among His people as "Em-
                     manuel" (Matt. 1:23). So eternity was linked with time in the
                     Person of the God-man Jesus.

THINK IT THROUGH        What effect does the virgin birth of Jesus have on my daily
                     life? To what extent is Jesus saving me from my sins?

Eternal Son       LESSON 3                                               ❑ Monday
                                                                           July 13
             Part 2     In a series of related declarations, the apostle John
         HIS DEITY    presents the subject of Christ's divine nature.

                        "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
                      and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with
                      God. All things were made by him; and without him was not
                      any thing made that was made" (John 1:1-3).

                        In these words that are the New Testament counterpart to
                      Genesis 1:1, the apostle introduces his Master as the Logos—
                      the "expression of God." He portrays Him as eternal and divine,
                      the co-Creator of all things with God the Father. "If Christ made
                      all things, He existed before all things. The words spoken in
                      regard to this are so decisive that no one need be left in doubt.
                      Christ was God essentially, and in the highest sense. He was

                        In speaking of Christ, how does Paul express similar exalt-
                      ing thoughts? Col. 1:15-17.

                        In verse 13 Paul speaks of God's "dear Son" and then
                      launches into one of his sublime passages concerning the Lord
                      (verses 14-18). He depicts Him not only as Redeemer (verse 14),
                      but as "the image" or similitude "of the invisible God" (verse
                      15), the Creator (verse 16), and the Eternal One who holds all
                      things together (verse 17). Note that the act of creation is set in
                      the past tense ("were created"), while the nature of Christ is
                      expressed in the present tense ("is the image," "is before all
                      things"), thus conveying the truth of the ever-continuing like-
                      ness of the Son to the Eternal Father.

                        In His self-knowledge, what striking claim did Jesus make
                      before the Jews of His day? John 10:30.

                        Stark in its simplicity, astounding in its significance, the an-
                      nouncement staggered His hearers. They knew the identity of
                      the Father, and had demanded of Jesus: "If thou be the Christ,
                      tell us plainly" (verse 24). When He told them the truth, they
                      recognized what it meant: "Thou, being a man, makest thyself
                      God" (verse 33). Jesus, of course, was referring here to a unity
                      of spirit, thought, purpose rather than person; each divine Per-
                      son had in His deity the same convictions as the Other.

                      enough to give me complete confidence in His power to save

           Part 3     Belief in the divine Sonship of Christ calls for belief in His
             HIS    eternity. Also, the incarnation could only be possible for a
        ETERNITY    preexistent one—a person who did not previously exist could
                    not appear in another form—he would be making his first ap-
                    pearance. The doctrine of Christ's preexistence, then, merits at
                    least a further day's study.

                      What specific prophecy pinpoints Messiah's birthplace and
                    ancestry?

                      "Thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
                    thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
                    me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
                    from of old, from everlasting" (Micah 5:2).

                       Micah, a younger contemporary of Isaiah, also had the Mes-
                    sianic hope. He looked forward to the restoration of "the first
                    dominion" (4:8). He saw Bethlehem as the birthplace of the
                    "ruler in Israel." (See also Matt. 2:1-6.) He speaks of Him "whose
                    goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." That
                    phrase is more than a reference to ancient ancestry; it pro-
                    claims Messiah's eternity. "Christ was God essentially, and in
                    the highest sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over
                    all, blessed forevermore.
                       "The Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from
                    eternity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father."—Selected

                       When Messiah appeared as Jesus of Nazareth, what star-
                    tling claim did He make? John 8:58.

                       "The Jews had committed the error of ascribing to Jesus a
                    merely temporal existence. They saw only the historical man-
                    ifestation, not the eternal Person; only the human, not the di-
                    vine. Jesus, therefore, reaffirms his eternal, timeless, absolute
                    essence."—William Hendriksen, A Commentary on the Gospel
                    of John, 3rd ed. (London: Banner of Truth Trust, 1964), vol. 2, p.
                    66.
                       Christ reveals that, even when clad in human garb, He had
                     come to be conscious of His eternity, aware of the divine glory,
                    responsibility, and knowledge of man's failures and triumphs.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways does your knowledge of Christ's eternity
                    strengthen you today?

                       As surely as a knowledge of His eternity sustained our Saviour
                    in the last dread hours of His earthly life (see John 17:5, 24), so
                    our belief in His eternal oneness with the Father will sustain us
                    until we are united with Him in eternal glory.

          Part 4    Note how the beloved disciple confirms his Master's hu-
            HIS    manity after asserting His divinity.
       HUMANITY
                     "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
                   beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
                   Father,) full of grace and truth" (John 1:14).

                     John 1:1-3 instructs us as to Christ's eternal divinity, while
                   John 1:14 teaches that He took humanity upon Himself. The
                   Word, God's thought made audible, became man and thereby
                   God's thought made visible. The inspired writer chooses his
                   words carefully, and we should do the same when speaking of
                   the union of two natures—divine and human—in one Person.
                   The more accurate translation of the Greek of verse 14 is "the
                   Word became flesh" rather than "was made flesh," for our Lord
                   was never "made" a man. He, already existing, "became" a
                   man.

                    Trace the steps recorded by Paul in Philippians 2:5-8 by
                   which the Son of God fully identified Himself with man.

                     He who is in every respect equal with God did not allow that
                   prized position to prevent Him from rescuing man from the
                   clutches of sin. He emptied Himself of divine glory, took the
                   form of a human servant or slave, and humbled Himself still
                   further by obediently submitting to all that God saw necessary
                   for man's redemption. This led Him to the shameful, agonizing
                   death on a cross where He bore our sins and was thereby
                   subjected to temporary but awful separation from His Father.
                   This gives us a minute glimpse of the demands that were made
                   upon our Lord when He was born in Bethlehem. "He voluntarily
                   assumed human nature. It was his own act, and by his own
                   consent. He clothed his divinity with humanity. He was all the
                   while as God, but he did not appear as God."—Ellen G. White,
                   Review and Herald, Sept. 4, 1900.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do today to avoid taking my Saviour's sacrifice
                   for granted?

                     " 'Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon
                   thou standest is holy ground.' We must come to the study of this
                   subject [Christ's humanity] with the humility of a learner, with a
                   contrite heart. And the study of the incarnation of Christ is a
                   fruitful field, and will repay the searcher who digs deep for
                   hidden truth."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-

          Part 5     In what ways can you understand the views that Christ's
     SON OF MAN    generation held concerning His origins?

                     "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
                   James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his
                   sisters here with us? And they were offended at him" (Mark
                   6:3).

                      The young Preacher and His family were well known in His
                   hometown of Nazareth and lower Galilee. His humanity loomed
                   large in their eyes, so large that they did not even guess at His
                   veiled divinity. Some went so far as to hint that He was an
                   illegitimate child (John 8:41; The Desire of Ages, pp. 387).
                   Matthew 13:55 records the townspeople's question, "Is not this
                   the carpenter's son?" which suggests that they believed Him to
                   be the son of Joseph. These reactions confirm the genuineness
                   of His humanity.

                     What reasons can you give for the choice of the term by
                   which Jesus most frequently referred to Himself? Matt. 8:20;
                   9:6; 12:8; Mark 13:26; Luke 19:10; John 3:14, etc.

                      The Gospels record more than 40 instances where Jesus
                   called Himself "the Son of man." The title had Old Testament
                   origins (Ps. 8:4; Eze. 2:1 and numerous times thereafter; Dan.
                   7:3) and had Messianic associations for some Jews. On the
                   Master's lips, the Messianic overtones were strong (Mark 2:28;
                   14:62; Luke 12:8; John 13:31, etc.). The title simultaneously
                   stressed His humanity and His divinity.
                      We need to meditate more on the dual nature of our Lord.
                      "We never think of Christ enough as God, never enough as
                   Man; the instinctive habit of our minds being always to miss of
                   the Divinity, and the reasoning and enforced habit to miss of the
                   Humanity. We are afraid to harbour in our own hearts, or to utter
                   in the hearing of others, any thought of our Lord, as hungering,
                   tired, sorrowful, having a human soul, a human will, and af-
                   fected by events of human life as a finite creature is; and yet one
                   half of the efficiency of His atonement, and the whole of the
                   efficiency of His example, depend on His having been this to the
                   full."—John Ruskin, Modern Painters, (New York: E. P. Dutton
                   and Company, n.d.), vol. 4, p. 372.

THINK IT THROUGH     How balanced are we in our understanding of our Lord's
                   twofold nature? What significance does this teaching have for
                   our everyday living?

          Part 6     What assurance do we have that Jesus truly understands
            OUR    the daily struggles that face us?
        SAVIOUR
                     "We have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
                   the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like
                   as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4:15).

                      Our great High Priest is "Jesus the Son of God" (verse 14)—
                   Jesus, forever retaining our human nature, and the Son of God
                   having divine strength. He therefore has the ability, the capacity
                   to sympathize (a literal translation); that is, to feel with our
                   frailties (both physical and spiritual weaknesses). For the sake
                   of emphasis, the writer expresses this first statement with a
                   double negative, then records the historical facts of Christ's
                   having been tempted just as we are while Himself remaining
                   free from all personal taint of sin in body and mind. At the same
                   time, His personal exposure to and victory over sin enables Him
                   to fortify us in our areas of individual need.
                      "By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity,
                   He lays hold upon the throne of God. As the Son of man, He gave
                   us an example of obedience; as the Son of God, He gives us
                   power to obey."—The Desire of Ages, p. 24.

                     Which aspect of the incarnation most deeply affects us?
                   1 Tim. 1:15.

                     This text is but one of several which may be used to answer
                   our question. (See also Matt. 1:21; 9:13; John 3:16; Luke 19:10;
                   Gal. 4:4, 5.) It states very plainly that Jesus came to save us from
                   our sins. If, by clinging to those sins, we do not permit Him to
                   wean us from them, then, so far as we are concerned, His
                   mission has failed—but the fault is ours alone. Are we willing to
                   face the responsiblity for our continued sinning, not just now,
                   but on judgment day? That is the disturbing question posed by
                   the Person of Jesus. But it is more than balanced by the assur-
                   ance that is proffered by His priesthood (Heb. 7:25).

THINK IT THROUGH     Have I proved the Saviour of the world to be MY Saviour too?

                     "In His promises and warnings, Jesus means me. God so
                   loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that / by
                   believing in Him, might not perish, but have everlasting life. The
                   experiences related in God's word are to be my experiences.

           Part 1     Who worked with Father and Son in the creation of heaven
     CREATOR AND    and earth?
        INSPIRER
                      "The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
                    upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
                    the face of the waters" (Gen. 1:2).

                      We usually speak of the Creator, using the singular form, but
                    the plural more accurately reflects biblical teaching. The Father
                    and Son worked so closely in Creation that John could write of
                    Jesus: "Without him was not any thing made that was made"
                    (John 1:3). (Compare with Gen. 1:1.) In addition, our text reveals
                    participation by "the Spirit of God." Thus, from the beginning, a
                    Third Member of the Godhead has been involved in our world's
                    history.

                      Through which divine agency has prophecy been given?
                    2 Peter 1:21.

                      This scripture also takes us back to the beginning, for the
                    book of Genesis contains not only history but prophecy. During
                    the thousand years in which the Old Testament was being writ-
                    ten, the Holy Spirit was at work, communicating God's thoughts
                    to its writers and guiding men in God's ways. Such work could
                    be done only by an Eternal One, a member of the Godhead.

                      What other evidence does the Bible provide for the deity of
                    the Holy Spirit?

                       Answer: Omnipotence: Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 12:11. Omnipres-
                    ence: Ps. 139:7-11. Omniscience: 1 Cor. 2:10, 11. Eternity: Heb.
                    9:14.
                       His divine personality is also deduced from the service He
                    performs (see John 14:26)—He has the name of Comforter,
                    Paraclete, or Advocate; He is sent by the Son and the Father; He
                    teaches believers; He recalls to the disciples all that Jesus said.
                    He witnesses to Christ (John 15:26); is another of the same kind
                    as Christ (John 14:26); He guides into all truth and forewarns of
                    future events (John 16:13).
                      In the Old Testament, God the Father is often called "the Holy
                    One of Israel," but after the Holy Spirit is more fully revealed in
                    the New Testament, the description "holy" is reserved almost
                    entirely for Him.

THINK IT THROUGH      In my devotional life, am I according the Holy Spirit His full
                    measure of divine personality, or is He still only a vague
                    "influence"?

Holy Spirit and Holy Trinity        LESSON 4                           ❑    Monday
                                                                            July 20
          Pad 2      How vital a role did the Holy Spirit play in the incarnation?
          SPIRIT
        AND SON      "The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
                   mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came
                   together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost" (Matt.
                   1:18).

                     Matthew, under the Spirit's guidance, shows great care in
                   recording the background to his Master's birth. He identifies
                   Mary as Christ's mother but refrains from calling Joseph His
                   father. The chosen pair were not yet married, yet Mary found
                   herself pregnant and knew that this arose from the Holy Spirit's
                   visitation (Luke 1:35). Joseph accepted the same explanation
                   and, braving public opinion, took Mary to wife and served as
                   human father to the Son of God (Matt 1:20-25). Here, then, is a
                   total divine involvement with humanity for the salvation of man-
                   kind. The Father sends His angel to the virgin Mary (Luke 1:26,
                   27), the Holy Ghost comes upon. Mary (verse 35), and Jesus
                   takes on human form (Luke 2:4-7). The Spirit might therefore be
                   called the central figure, linking heaven and earth in the drama
                   of our Saviour's birth.

                      What role did the Spirit continue to play in our Lord's earthly
                   life? Luke 2:25-29.

                     A careful reading of Luke's Gospel reveals that the author was
                   very sensitive to the Spirit's role in Christ's life and ministry. In
                   addition to His directing Simeon's recognition of the infant
                   Saviour, there was that of the prophetess Anna (Luke 2:36-38).
                   The Child's unusual growth (verses 40, 52; The Desire of Ages,
                   pp. 68-74) was only possible by His unusual submission to the
                   Spirit's guidance. This spiritual cooperation led Jesus to the
                   Jordan for baptism and the Spirit's visible descent upon Him
                   (Luke 3:21, 22), and to His "being full of the Holy Ghost" (Luke
                   4:1). Immediately the Spirit led Him into the wilderness (verse 1;
                   compare Mark 1:12), and afterward gave Him power for His
                   Galilean ministry (Luke 4:14).

THINK IT THROUGH     If the Spirit could so empower Jesus of Nazareth in His
                   amazing ministry, can not the same Spirit also give me daily
                   strength to live the Christian life?

                     "The Spirit furnishes the strength that sustains striving,
                   wrestling souls in every emergency, amidst the hatred of the
                   world, and the realization of their own failures and mistakes. In
                   sorrow and affliction, when the outlook seems dark and the
                   future perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone,—these are
                   the times when, in answer to the prayer of faith, the Holy Spirit
                   brings comfort to the heart."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

           Part 3      By what means may we arrive at that point in spiritual de-
      SPIRIT AND     velopment from which the Child Jesus started?
      OURSELVES
                      "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
                    thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
                    of God" (John 3:3).

                       In every true believer's heart there is the desire, a holy ambi-
                    tion to become like Christ. How can that dream be fulfilled? The
                    answer is simple and utterly uncompromising: We must be born
                    again. That transformation can come only by the ministry of the
                    Holy Spirit. "The fountain of the heart must be purified before
                    the streams can become pure. He who is trying to reach heaven
                    by his own works in keeping the law is attempting an impossibil-
                    ity. There is no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a
                    form of godliness. The Christian's life is not a modification or
                    improvement of the old, but a transformation of nature. There is
                    a death to self and sin, and a new life altogether. This change
                    can be brought about only by the effectual working of the Holy
                    Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 172.
                       How, then, can we "enter into the kingdom of God"? Jesus
                    says: "Of water and of the Spirit" (John 3:5)—and Paul states:
                    "By the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit"
                    (Titus 3:5). On the road to the kingdom, there is no way of
                    bypassing the Spirit!

                     When once we have been born again, how may we develop
                    Christian stature? John 16:7-14.

                       The Lord here speaks of the Spirit's service both to His disci-
                    ples and to the unbelieving world. We need to accept His
                    message—to welcome the Comforter, to be convicted of sin and
                    concerned about righteousness and judgment, to be guided
                    into all truth, to listen to what the Spirit says about Jesus and
                    future events, and to accept His revelation of Christ's glory.
                       "It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the
                    Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature.
                    Christ has given us His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all
                    hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His
                    own character upon His church."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are we growing as Jesus grew—"in wisdom and stature,
                    and in favour with God and man"? If not, why not? Are we
                    allowing the Holy Spirit to develop our full spiritual potential?

        AND THE
          SPIRIT  "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
                 Spirit of God dwelleth In you?" (1 Cor. 3:16).

                     You are the temple of God. This is a metaphor to convey a
                   profound spiritual truth, namely, that God, being spirit (John
                   4:24), will dwell in the hearts of His contrite and humble follow-
                   ers (Isa. 57:15). The Son will do the same (John 14:23; Rev. 3:20).
                   But, so far as our finite minds can comprehend, this is done in
                   the Person of the Holy Spirit, who would seem to have the
                   particular task of representing the Godhead to the conscious-
                   ness of the believer. Paul can therefore say: "Your body is the
                   temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you" (1 Cor. 6:19). What
                   higher honor can come to a sinful, not-yet-perfect human be-
                   ing?

                   Guest and worthy of being His temple? Gal. 5:22, 23.

                     There are some rare personalities who bring peace and order
                   into the homes they enter. The Spirit does more. He prepares
                   the heart to be His own shrine and residence. The gifts He brings
                   with Him will sweep out the sin and make each welcoming heart
                   so clean that it will begin to be an acceptable temple for His
                   most holy Self. We should therefore say to Him as to the Lord
                   Jesus:
                      "Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart
                      A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art."

                   ance of the divine Spirit, develop steadily and harmoniously.
                   Devotion and piety establish so close a relation between Jesus
                   and His disciples that the Christian becomes like Him. Through
                   the power of God, his weak, vacillating character becomes
                   changed to one of strength and steadfastness. He becomes a

                   preconceived opinions, become broader, his discernment more
                   penetrative and farseeing. The knowledge of God, the under-

                        disciples—and that fact must never be ignored. Second, He was
                        leaving an adequate legacy in the promised presence of His
                        Spirit. "Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days
                        hence" (Acts 1:5). (See also Luke 24:49.) And now, immediately
                        prior to His ascension, He states the fact: "Ye shall receive
                        power." History confirms that the power came at Pentecost
                        (Acts 2:4, 16-21). This explains how such a group could set the
                        church in motion throughout the then-known world. The exis-
                        tence of the Christian church became one of the greatest evi-
                        dences of the Holy Spirit's reality.

                          After the apostles had received power from on high, who
                        else shared in the heavenly gift? Acts 4:31; 5:32; 6:3.

                          If the Spirit had been restricted to the original apostles, His
                        ministry would have ceased with their deaths. But such was not
                        the divine plan. "The church throughout Judea, Galilee and
                        Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and
                        encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the
                        fear of the Lord" (Acts 9:31, NIV).

THINK IT THROUGH          How may the church today accomplish its worldwide mis-
                        sion?

                            Answer: By fulfilling similar conditions to those that brought
                        power to the early church, namely, prayerful, unselfish unity
                        (Acts 1:14; 2:1, 41-47; 4:31-35).
                            "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to
                        any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit
                        was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day of
                        Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all
                        who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service.
                        ... The more closely believers have walked with God, the more
                        clearly and powerfully have they testified of their Redeemer's
                        love and of His saving grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 49.

Holy Spirit and Holy Trinity        LESSON 4                              ❑ Friday
                                                                           July 24
         Part 6   In the beautiful benediction penned to the Corinthian
          HOLY church, which central Christian doctrine did Paul reveal?
        TRINITY
                  "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
                and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen"
                (2 Cor. 13:14).

                      This is not a doctrinal but a devotional statement, yet it reveals
                   one of the most fundamental of all Christian doctrines. It gives,
                   with inspired brevity, a firm basis for belief in the threefold
                   nature of the Godhead, the Trinity. (Compare Christ's own re-
                   ference to the divine Three in Matthew 28:19.) It does not at-
                   tempt to explain it. Rather, it is a distillation of thoughtful,
                   reverent Christian contemplation of what has been disclosed
                   concerning Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, especially in the light
                   of the Son's incarnation. As has been so rightly stated: "The
                   doctrine of the Trinity is not so much heard as overheard in the
                   statements of Scripture."—International Standard Bible Encyc-
                   lopedia (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing
                   Co., 1930), p. 3012.
                      Or, to express it another way: "What becomes patent in the
                   New Testament is latent in the Old."
                      Man's inability to explain the nature of the Trinity should
                    surprise no one—it should rather be expected. The object of
                   man's worship, while clear enough to command love and loy-
                   alty, should soar far beyond human understanding. Here, if
                    anywhere, the statement attributed to St. Anselm applies: "I do
                    not seek to understand in order to believe, but I believe in order
                    to understand."
                      In humble awareness of our inability to fathom the nature of
                    the God whom we worship, we should be very careful in our
                    thinking to safeguard the equality and unity of each living Per-
                    son of the Trinity with the other Two. To use the definition of
                    fourth-century Greek theologians, we should confess that "the
                    Godhead of the Father, of the Son, of the Holy Ghost, is all one:
                    the Glory Equal, the Majesty eternal."—J. S. Whale, Christian
                   Doctrine (Fontana Books, 1941), p. 111.
                      The difficulties we meet in thinking of the Trinity should not
                    lead us to reject the doctrine or refuse to meditate upon it. "If it
                    were possible for us to attain to a full understanding of God and
                    His word, there would be for us no further discovery of truth, no
                    greater knowledge, no further development. God would cease
                    to be supreme, and man would cease to advance."—Education,

                   ity, if thou be void of humility and art thereby displeasing the

           Part 1     The limitations of reason in perceiving the way in which our
       FAITH AND    universe was created are indicated by Scripture.
        CREATION
                      "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed
                    by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not
                    made of things which do appear" (Heb. 11:3).

                       The writer of Hebrews is not suggesting that we, in our
                    present state, can understand the process of creation, but
                    rather that faith enables our minds to perceive (a more accurate
                    translation) how our universe owes its origins to God. Under-
                    standing will come only in the hereafter. Until then, faith ena-
                    bles us to accept the mind-staggering concept that our physical
                    universe came into existence and continues to be knit together
                    by a word or saying of God. (See Ps. 33:6, 9.) This faith, estab-
                    lished in our own Christian experience, is based on meditation
                    and observation subjected to revelation. It recognizes that a
                    Mind or Power—God—must have designed all creation. The
                    word rendered as "worlds" is literally translated as "ages," but
                    mention of "things which are seen" in contrast to "things which
                    do appear" clearly refers to visible creation rather than to vague
                    periods of time.
                       Adventists understand the Bible to teach that "God was not
                    indebted to preexisting matter. By His mighty power God called
                    matter into being, and then by that same power imparted life to
                    creatures formed from it. Prior to the dawn of the so-called
                    Atomic Age, it was one of the prime tenets of science that matter
                    is eternal, that it can neither be created nor destroyed. But now
                    scientists declare that matter and energy are interchangeable.
                    Why, then, should it be thought strange that an almighty God
                    can create matter that did not previously exist?"—S.D.A. Bible
                    Commentary, vol. 7, p. 472.

                      With what particular language does Jeremiah summarize
                    the creative acts that formed our universe? Jer. 10:12.

                      In concise language the prophet spells out the initial creative
                    process: The living God (Jer. 10:10) made the earth by His
                    power, set up the habitable globe by His wisdom, and stretched
                    or unfolded the heavens by His skillfulness. Verses 12 through
                    16 appear again in chapter 51:15-19. They express a frequent
                    theme in the writings of the prophets—God's creative acts set
                    Him apart from all false gods. The New Testament makes an
                    even greater claim in Colossians 1:16, 17. These concepts can-
                    not fit into an evolutionary pattern!

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my faith strong enough to accept all that might be in-
                    cluded in God's creatorship? If not, how can I strengthen it?

             Part 2    On which acts that only God could perform is the lordship of
               THE    God based?
          CREATION
          PROCESS       "Thus says the Lord, the creator of the heavens, he who is
                      God, who made the earth and fashioned it and himself fixed it
                      fast, who created it no empty void, but made it for a place to
                      dwell in: I am the Lord, there is no other" (Isa. 45:18, NEB).

                         If any other than God were the creator of heaven and earth,
                      that being would be the lord of mankind, and to him would man
                      direct his worship. But the God revealed in the Bible is the only
                      One who can claim such an office. There is none other who can
                      lay claim to His creatorship. "The duty to worship God is based
                      upon the fact that He is the Creator and that to Him all other
                      beings owe their existence. And wherever, in the Bible, His
                      claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen,
                      is presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative
                      power."—The Great Controversy, pp. 436, 437.

                        Where does Scripture leave room, if at all, for an evolution-
                      ary theory of origins? Gen. 1:1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26, 29; Ex.
                      20:11.

                         The Bible offers no hospitality to evolutionary theories. It is
                      unashamedly creationist. Creationism is woven into the very
                      warp and woof of the Book. It offers only one explanation for the
                      origin of our earth and all that lives and grows upon it—God's
                      creative acts. Nevertheless, we must be careful not to harm the
                      Bible's reputation for truthfulness by making claims for it that
                      are not really in it. Sometimes it is suggested that the use of the
                      Hebrew verb bara' (to create) in Genesis 1:1 supports the teach-
                      ing that "in the beginning God created the heaven and the
                      earth" out of nothing. It has to be remembered, however, that
                      the same verb bara' is also used in Genesis 1:27: "God created
                      man in his own image ... ; male and female created he them."
                      We know from Genesis 2:7 that the Lord God used existing
                      material when He "formed man of the dust of the ground," and
                      from Genesis 2:22 we learn that Eve was then formed from the
                      already-existing Adam. We have not been called to proclaim as
                      biblical what may go beyond what the Bible teaches about this.
                      On the other hand, we do well to remember that any material the
                      Creator might have used in completing His work in Creation
                      week was itself created by Him.
                         If we insist that God needed six days for Creation, we would
                      be making Him the prisoner of time, somewhat as we are. It
                      would be more correct to think of His choosing to use six days to
                      give His creatures their placement in time, to provide the pattern
                      of the seven-day week for governing their relation to time, and
                      to give them the weekly blessing of the Sabbath.

                                                                             July 28
             Part 3      What lessons do you gather from the nature of God's
               THE    climactic work on the sixth day of Creation?
          CREATION
         OF MAN—I       "God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
                      and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
                      the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth,
                      and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"
                      (Gen. 1:26).

                         The scene was set (verses 1-25), but from our viewpoint, it
                      lacked an important element—those morally responsible be-
                      ings for whose primary benefit all the beauty had been pro-
                      duced by the Creator's word. The Creation story seems to
                      suggest this. Earlier creative acts had followed a simple "And
                      God said" (for example, verses 3, 6, 9), but prior to the creation
                      of man there is a suggestion of taking counsel within the
                      Godhead, as indicated by the phrase "Let us make" (verse 26).
                      In verse 27 the making of man and woman is recorded, and they
                      are then asked to care for the earth (verse 28). In this fuller
                      treatment, the crowning act of Creation is recognized. "In the
                      creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal God.
                      When God had made man in His image, the human form was
                      perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a
                      personal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath of
                      life, and man became a living, intelligent being."—The Ministry
                      of Healing, p. 415.

                        As we consider the miracle of how human beings are made,
                      how should it make us feel? Ps. 100:3, 4.

                        Every one of us carries around in his or her body a marvelous
                      laboratory in which to study the most wonderful of all our
                      Maker's creative works. We are free to conduct that study at any
                      hour of the day. The simple act of breathing, the spontaneous
                      movement of the eye, of hand, of foot—these are miracles be-
                      yond our understanding. They should lead us to glorify our
                      Creator. (See Ps. 139:14.)
                        "The mechanism of the human body cannot be fully under-
                      stood; it presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. It is
                      not as the result of a mechanism, which, once set in motion,
                      continues its work, that the pulse beats and breath follows
                      breath. In God we live and move and have our being. The
                      beating heart, the throbbing pulse, every nerve and muscle in
                      the living organism, is kept in order and activity by the power of
                      an ever-present God."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 417.

Creator and Sustainer        LESSON 5                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      July 29
          Part 4     What reason does the Lord Himself give for having created
            THE    human beings?
       CREATION
      OF MAN—II      "Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of
                   the earth; even every one that is called by my name: for I have
                   created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made
                   him" (Isa. 43:6, 7).

                     Those who are called by God's name, that is, those who are
                   members of His worldwide family, have been created to add to
                   His glory. At first thought, this might sound as though God were
                   pleasing Himself, as if He were a praise-hungry tycoon who has
                   made a world full of puppets to bring Him unending flattery.
                   Fortunately, our God is utterly unlike that. In one sense, He does
                   not need our praise. Unnumbered multitudes of sinless beings
                   are constantly worshiping Him out of grateful hearts, and our
                   tokens of praise can add but little to what He is already receiv-
                   ing.
                     Yet, our text clearly states that the Lord created (bare', again)
                   His sons and daughters for His glory. A little thought enables us
                   to accept that without question, for we see the divine purpose
                   shining above the sin that overshadows the human race. The
                   original plan would have filled our world with a perfect people
                   whose sinless lives would have added to the Creator's glory.
                   When sin shattered that prospect, unselfish love proved itself
                   strong enough to redeem the fallen, to re:create them in the
                   divine image, and to convince the watching universe that their
                   Sovereign does all things well.

                     Note how Paul enlarges on this overview of the outworking
                   of the plan of salvation. Eph. 1:5, 6. (See also verses 12, 14.)

                      Here the apostle refers to the glory that comes to God as
                   redeemed men and women are adopted into His family by virtue
                   of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. "As a result of the
                   revelation of God's grace in the adoption, the universe will gain
                   a true conception of the character and purposes of God and
                   respond with expressions of praise. One of the purposes of the
                   plan of salvation is the vindication of the character of God
                   before the universe (see PP 68; cf. DA 625, 626; Eph. 3:10,
                   11)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 999.
                      The Jerusalem Bible has a very attractive translation of Ephe-
                   sians 2:10: "We are God's work of art, created in Christ Jesus to
                   live the good life as from the beginning he had meant us to live
                   it."

             Part 5  In contrast to scientific theories, how does the Bible ac-
               THE count for the way all things keep on working in the natural
          SUSTAINER world?

                       "He is before all things, and by him all things consist" (Col.
                     1:17).

                       In verse 16 Paul has affirmed Christ's creatorship—all things
                     were created by Him or through Him—and now in verse 17 he
                     looks both before and after Creation. The Son, he declares,
                     existed before all things. Many commentators see in the phrase
                     "he is" a reference to the Eternal's self-explanation, the "I AM"
                     of Exodus 3:14 (see John 8:58), and to His creatorship. The
                     forward look depends on the word translated "consist" which
                     can also be rendered "cohere" or "hold together." (See also
                     Heb. 1:3, NEB: He "sustains the universe by His word of
                     power.") Nature is not a machine that keeps itself running and
                     tuned. "God is constantly employed in upholding and using as
                     His servants the things that He has made. He works through the
                     laws of nature, using them as His instruments. They are not
                     self-acting. Nature in her work testifies of the intelligent
                     presence and active agency of a Being who moves in all things
                     according to His will."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 416.

                      How does Paul apply the same truth to the upholding of
                     mankind? Acts 17:25, 28.

                        Man loves to do things his way. He likes to believe that he is
                     self-contained and self-sustaining, that he needs no external
                     power to keep him going. Yet, of himself, he has not solved the
                     mystery of his beginning or of his end. In spite of all that he has
                     done to prolong his life—and life expectancy for men in the
                     United States has risen from 47 years in 1905 to 69.3 years in
                     1977—he has not discovered how to live forever. Lack of breath
                     still spells death. Paul's thought, therefore, rings true: God
                     giveth to all men life, and breath, and all things needful for life
                     (Acts 17:25). It is still in God alone that we live, have power to
                     move, and continue to exist (verse 28). "It is not because the
                     mechanism that has once been set in motion continues to act by
                     its own inherent energy that the pulse beats and breath follows
                     breath; but every breath, every pulsation of the heart, is an
                     evidence of the all-pervading care of Him in whom 'we live, and
                     move, and have our being.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 115.

THINK IT THROUGH        Remind yourself of modern man's dependence on electric-
                     ity, and the chaos that comes when such power fails. Apply
                     such thoughts to man's careless but real dependence upon
                     God.

                                                                            July 31

             THE    decision has the Creator reached?
     RE-CREATOR
                      "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
                    former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind" (Isa.
                    65:17).

                      Do our minds hesitate before the prospect of a new creation?
                    They should not. Our religion is founded on miracles—
                    Creation, the virgin birth, the resurrection, the ascension, the
                    new birth. All are supernatural occurrences, above the control
                    and comprehension of man. The new creation, the making of
                    new heavens and a new earth, presents no difficulty to our
                    omnipotent God. The only problem lies with ourselves—shall
                    we permit Him to remake us?
                      Only the Father and His two Eternal Companions know the
                    measure of sorrow caused by the Fall. Only They can know the
                    joy with which They anticipate the restoration of all things by
                    re-creation. What unselfish pleasure will be Theirs as They
                    "make all things new" (Rev. 21:5). What satisfaction in knowing
                    that no sin will ever mar the perfection of the new creation!

                      What corresponding change must take place in us if we are
                    to enjoy the new heavens and new earth? 2 Cor. 5:17.

                       It would be a disaster if unregenerate men and women were
                    settled in the new earth. Their sin would soon ruin the sinless
                    beauty of the new creation. Those who are to inherit the new
                    Eden must be in harmony with their surroundings, and this
                    demands that they be sinless too. This requires that they be
                    born again (John 3:3, 5, 7), that they be new creatures. It re-
                    quires that they be remade by Christ, living their new lives in
                    Christ, and thus being fitted for sinless living throughout eter-
                    nity. It is not difficult to agree to this—for others. The harder part
                    is to accept it for ourselves. Hard though it may be, however,
                    that is the goal of Sabbath School lesson study!

             THE    describes the nature of God's kingdom?
        CREATOR
        AND LAW       "Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
                    kingdom is a right sceptre" (Ps. 45:6).

                       The fact that God is eternal has great meaning for the Chris-
                    tian. It gives God an everlasting kingdom and establishes the
                    eternal rightness of its laws. Its host of heavenly inhabitants
                    freely observe their Creator's commands, delighting to do His
                    all-wise will and willingly giving Him their service. This past
                    eternity provides a firm foundation for the creation of our world
                    and its inhabitants. If it had made the right choice, mankind
                    could have inherited the timeless experience of the heavenly
                    host and have joined other obedient worlds in serving their
                    Maker. Alas, the human race chose and still chooses to reject
                    that option, preferring to pit its preferences against the wisdom
                    of eternal ages.

                      What qualities are seen in the Lord's words and in His
                    commands? Ps. 111:7, 8.

                        The Jerusalem Bible's rendering of these verses is refreshing:
                    "All that he does is done in faithfulness and justice, in all his
                    ways his precepts are dependable, ordained to last for ever and
                    ever, framed in faithfulness and integrity." What a God! How
                    foolish to turn Him away! How reasonable to heed His com-
                    mands!
                        "When the heart yields to the influence of the Spirit of God,
                    the conscience will be quickened, and the sinner will discern
                    something of the depth and sacredness of God's holy law, the
                    foundation of His government in heaven and on earth. The
                    tight, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,'
                    illumines the secret chambers of the soul, and the hidden things
                    of darkness are made manifest.... Conviction takes hold upon
                    the mind and heart. The sinner has a sense of the righteousness
                    of Jehovah and feels the terror of appearing, in his own guilt and
                    uncleanness, before the Searcher of hearts. He sees the love of
                    God, the beauty of holiness, the joy of purity; he longs to be
                    cleansed and to be restored to communion with Heaven."—

                     Note how the psalmist stresses the everlasting nature of
                    God's righteousness and the reliability of His law. Ps. 119:142.

THINK IT THROUGH      What weight in our thinking do we give to the age-long
                    experience of the Godhead and the angels in knowing what is
                    best for human beings?

The Law of the Lord-I         LESSON 6                                 ❑ Monday
                                                                          August 3
          Part 2   What flawless qualities characterize the law of the Lord, and
        MAN AND what will the law accomplish for those who follow its guid-
       GOD'S LAW ance?

                      "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the
                    testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The
                    statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the com-
                    mandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes" (Ps.
                    19:7, 8).

                        In this passage, four different Hebrew words are used to
                    speak of the guidance given by the Lord to His children. The
                    first, torah, has the basic meaning of "direction," developing
                    into "teaching," "instruction," "doctrine." In the Old Testa-
                    ment it is translated "law" 216 times. It does not specifically
                    refer to the Decalogue; rather, it is a term signifying all the
                    revealed will of God or any part of it. The second word,'eduth, is
                    generally translated "testimony"; but it also has the sense of
                    "witness." The third, piqqudim, is only here translated "sta-
                    tutes." Throughout Psalm 119 it is uniformly rendered "pre-
                    cepts." The fourth, miswah, is the usual word for "command-
                    ment" and is so used 173 times in the Old Testament, mostly in
                    the plural form.
                        These four words, then, embrace the Lord's total instruction
                    to His children in Old Testament times. They include the Ten
                    Commandments but are not restricted to them. God's various
                    forms of instruction to His people are here said to be "perfect,"
                     "sure," "right" and "pure." In turn, they convert or revive the
                    soul, educate the simple believer, bring joy to the heart, and give
                     moral clear-sightedness. They have intensely spiritual func-
                     tions, helping their observers to live according to God's direc-
                     tives.

                      What is the larger spiritual setting or experience, of which
                    commandment keeping is a basic part? Deut. 10:12.

                      The Lord never intended that commandment keeping should
                    produce legalism or the error of salvation by works. He has
                    always urged that obedience to His precepts be the outcome of
                    godly fear or reverence and wholehearted love. (See Deut. 6:4,
                    5, 25; 11:1; Matt. 22:35-40.) Any other motivation is misleading,
                    unacceptable to God and useless to man.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What breadth and depth do we see in "the law of the Lord"?
                    Do we grasp that it can only be fulfilled by a love-based
                    obedience that goes deeper than a surface observance of its
                    teachings?

   FURTHER STUDY      Read all of Psalm 119. This can be done in about 25 minutes.
                    Note its broad portrayal of God's law, testimonies, statutes,
                    commandments, and precepts. How do our attitudes compare?

                                                                            August 4
              Part 3     Which is the first commandment?
           PRIMACY
            OF GOD       "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me" (Ex. 20:3).

                          This commandment was given against the background of
                       worldwide idolatry at the time of the Exodus—but it has always
                       been first in the heavenly statute book, and there has never been
                       a time when it was not valid. On the surface it may seem to do no
                       more than make the Lord first among all the other gods whose
                       worship flourished in the Middle East. But Israel came to know
                       that when the Lord is given first place in worship, the falsity, the
                       worthlessness of all other deities is revealed. This revelation
                       made Israel monotheistic—worshipers of one God—and the
                       nation recognized that "the Lord our God is one Lord" (Deut.
                       6:4).
                          God's insistence on His being above all is in no way self-
                       centered. Since the Lord is God, He can have no one above Him.
                       (See Isa. 44:6; Ps. 97:9.) He is first by nature and would be
                       denying that nature if He stepped aside for any competitor
                       whatsoever—and there is a rabble of competitors, though not
                       one can hold a candle to our God!
                         "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself
                       the Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme
                       reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other
                       object the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever
                       we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere
                       with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—
                       Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305.

                        Note how the One who knows God best quoted an enlarge-
                       ment on the first commandment. Luke 4:8.

                          In rejecting Satan's invitation to worship him, Jesus uses a
                       free rendering of Deuteronomy 6:13 based on the Greek ver-
                       sion. This expands the principle at the heart of the first com-
                       mandment and introduces the subjects of worship and service.
                       These flow naturally from the thought of God's uniqueness, His
                       supremacy—these qualities exalt Him above all other so-called
                       gods and make Him alone worthy of the highest adoration man
                       can offer.

THINK IT THROUGH         Consider the four faculties (listed in Luke 10:27) through
                       which we may express our love for God. Recall the formal
                       giving of the Decalogue—on release from Egyptian slavery
                       (Ex. 20:2)—and know that even then gratitude was to be the
                       main motivation behind commandment keeping. That
                       gratitude, which leads to love, provides the foundation on
                       which true worship is built.

The Law of the Lord-I         LESSON 6                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 5
          Part 4      What is at the heart of the second commandment?
      REVERENCE
        FOR GOD       "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.... Thou
                    shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them" (Ex. 20:,
                    4, 5).

                       After weary centuries of Egyptian slavery, Israel was well
                    versed in idolatry. Now its people were on their way to the
                    Promised Land, where heathen peoples were engaging in cruel
                    and licentious worship of deities that did not exist anyway. They
                    needed to keep themselves separate from all such idolatry. To
                    aid their detachment, there came this command, which also
                    prohibited their making even an image of the true God!
                       In prosperous lands, the most appealing idol is probably
                    Mammon, worshiped under many different forms, but always
                    placing material prosperity above self-forgetful dedication to
                    God. We may thus bow down to cars, TV and stereo sets,
                    houses, family demands, creature comforts—the list is endless.
                    In less favored lands, the daily struggle for existence may claim
                    first attention. Each Sabbath School member must search his
                    own life and say what we so often sing:
                                     "The dearest idol I have known,
                                     Whate'er that idol be,
                                     Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
                                     And worship only Thee."
                                           —William Cowper,
                                           The Church Hymnal, no. 383.

                     In what way may we show our reverence for the Lord our
                    God? Ex. 20:7.

                       This third commandment is expressed negatively, but its ob-
                    servance is best promoted by such a profound reverence for the
                    name and character of our Maker that we shall naturally honor
                    Him and have no urge to refer carelessly to Him or to blaspheme
                    His holy name.
                       "This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and
                    common swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a
                    light or careless manner, without regard to its awful signifi-
                    cance. By the thoughtless mention of God in common conver-
                    sation, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent
                    and thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him."—
                    Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 306, 307.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is there anything in my life that has priority over the Lord my
                    God? What honor or what shame does my life bring on the
                    Lord's name?

       THE SABBATH
                     "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Ex. 20:8).

                        Remember. It is not possible to remember that which one has
                     never known. Adam and Eve remembered their first Sabbath.
                     (See Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 48.) It was their first complete
                     24-hour day, the first Sabbath ever observed, and memories of
                     its hallowed significance were shared with their descendants.
                     The fourth commandment reveals that the Israelites knew of the
                     Sabbath before they reached Sinai (see Ex. 16:22-30), but it
                     must have been exceedingly difficult to remember it in Egypt.
                        Keep it holy. The same Hebrew verb, quadesh, is used at the
                     close of the commandment for the Lord's own act in hallowing
                     the Sabbath, even as it is in Genesis 2:3 where the English
                     translation speaks of sanctifying. Mankind, then, is given the
                     same privilege as God Himself exercised at the close of Crea-
                     tion.
                        The commandment places Sabbath observance on the same
                     level with the first three precepts, as part of man's acknowl-
                     edgement of God's lordship. The command has never been
                     revoked.

                       In what way is man to emulate his Creator in Sabbath ob-
                     servance? Ex. 20:9-11.

                        Six days shalt thou labour. Without adding an eleventh com-
                     mandment, there is a sense in which this places a moral obliga-
                     tion upon all God-fearers to work diligently during the week,
                     even as did the Lord during the six days of Creation. "God saw
                     that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise. He
                     needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of
                     the seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of
                     God and meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a
                     Sabbath to remind him more vividly of God and to awaken
                     gratitude because all that he enjoyed and possessed came from
                     the beneficent hand of the Creator."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     p. 48.
                        In it thou shalt not do any work. This prohibits performance of
                     secular work on Sabbath—Saturday, the seventh day—and
                     should alert us to guard the holy hours so that secular occupa-
                     tions and interests do not break into the Sabbath. We are also
                     morally obligated to avoid causing others to work unnecessarily
                     on the sacred day. (See Deut. 5:14.)

THINK IT THROUGH       Am I faithful in observing the spirit as well as the letter
                     concerning Sabbath observance? In what areas do I need to
                     raise my standards?

                                                                        August 7

         Part 6  "If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
       SABBATH pleasure on my holy day; ... then shalt thou delight thyself in
     OBSERVANCE the Lord" (Isa. 58:13, 14).

                       These verses reveal that standards of Sabbath keeping had
                    fallen to very low levels in Isaiah's day (see ch. 56:2), and the
                    prophet was calling for reform. We can rightly apply his mes-
                    sage to our own Seventh-day Adventist situation and make a
                    similar two-edged approach—negative and positive—to grap-
                    ple with the problem. We must turn away from Sabbath desecra-
                    tion, must refrain from doing our own pleasure on God's holy
                    day, not "clutching at business" (Variorum), "not speaking idle
                    words" (NIV). On the contrary, we should "call the sabbath
                    'Delightful' " (Jerusalem Bible), "a day of joy," "a day to be
                    honoured"—"then you shall find your joy in the Lord" (verse 14,
                    NEB). Do not these phrases arouse in us a longing for the deeply
                    spiritual delights that should be ours every Sabbath?
                       "When the Sabbath commences, we should place a'guard
                    upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God
                    by appropriating to our own use that time which is strictly the
                     Lord's. We should not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to
                    do, any manner of our own work for a livelihood, or anything
                     which could have been done on the six working days. Friday is
                     the day of preparation. Time can then be devoted to making the
                     necessary preparation for the Sabbath and to thinking and
                     conversing about it. Nothing which will in the sight of Heaven be
                     regarded as a violation of the holy Sabbath should be left unsaid
                     or undone, to be said or done upon the Sabbath. God requires
                     not only that we refrain from physical labor upon the Sabbath,
                     but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred
                     themes."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 702, 703.

                     Define Christ's attitude toward the Sabbath. Luke 4:16;
                    Mark 2:23-28; 3:1-5.

                    comed the weekly day of rest and of worship. The Sabbath
                    found Him in the synagogue, joining His neighbors in prayer,
                    praise, and Scripture study. In addition, He widened contempo-
                    rary ideas on rightful Sabbath observance, leading His disciples
                    to see that "it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days." If the
                    Master were physically present with us today, He would un-

          HONOR TO long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" (Ex.
           PARENTS 20:12).

                        This and the fourth commandment are the only two that are
                     stated positively; the others are cast in a negative mold. The fifth
                     heads the second table of law, and is the only commandment
                     that specifically promises a blessing through its fulfillment,
                     though the second implies its observers will receive mercy (Ex.
                     20:6).
                        The injunction in this fifth precept is addressed to children
                     regardless of age. "It is binding upon childhood and youth,
                     upon the middle-aged and the aged. There is no period in life
                     when children are excused from honoring their parents. This
                     solemn obligation is binding upon every son and daughter, and
                     is one of the conditions to their prolonging their lives upon the

                     p. 80.
                        To honor one's parents involves more than formal respect. It
                     includes expressing appreciation for all that our parents have
                     done for us through earlier years, for warm love shown in prac-
                     tical care. It calls for showing concern for their welfare and
                     gratitude for the ideals they have upheld.
                        In Deuteronomy 5:16 Moses enlarged on the promise, adding:
                     "That it may go well with thee, in the land which the Lord thy
                     God giveth thee." The primary reference was to life in Palestine,
                     but the assurance can also apply to life in our own day and in the
                     world to come.

                       What was Paul's emphasis regarding the claims of the fifth
                     commandment? Eph. 6:1-3.

                       The apostle followed the divine lead in Exodus 20:12 and
                     addressed the children concerning attitudes to parents. He did
                     not neglect the parents' responsibilities (see Eph. 6:4), but first
                     stressed the children's duty both to obey and to honor their
                     father and mother. He did so in awareness that filial respect
                     would weaken as time flowed on. He recognized the rebellious
                     tendencies in his own day (Rom. 1:30), but he foresaw a worsen-
                     ing family situation "in the last days" (2 Tim. 3:1, 2). The com-
                     mandment therefore has particular relevance for our time.
                       The initial responsibility for children's attitudes rests with
                     their parents. To them has been given the duty and privilege of
                     raising their sons and daughters "in the nurture and admonition
                     of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4), that is, with Christian discipline and
                     instruction.

THINK IT THROUGH       In today's social system, what application do we make of
                     the call to honor our fathers and mothers?

The Law of the Lord-II         LESSON 7                                ❑ Monday
                                                                       August 10

         RESPECT ness of human life.
         FOR LIFE
                   "Thou shalt not kill" (Ex. 20:13).

                       There are at least eleven distinct words in the Hebrew Bible
                    that deal with different aspects of the English verb "to kill." The
                    word used in Exodus 20:13 is rasah, which has the basic mean-
                    ing "to break or to dash in pieces," hence "to kill." Apart from
                    its use in the commandment (Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17), it is used in
                    this sense only twice. But in 12 other places it conveys the
                    thought of "to murder," that is, "to commit manslaughter," and
                    would be better so rendered in this instance. The translations of
                    Moffatt, the NEB, and the NIV use the word "murder."
                       Murder is a shocking sin because its results can never be
                    called back. No human power can restore the life that is
                    ruthlessly ended. He who murders usurps a power that belongs
                    to God alone or to the community that administers justice on His
                    behalf.

                      What deeper appreciation of the sixth commandment does
                    Jesus make in His exposition of the law? Matt. 5:21-26. (See
                    also 1 John 3:14, 15.)

                       It is entirely appropriate that He who gave Israel its laws from
                    Mount Sinai should explain the deeper meaning embedded in
                    the four words, "Thou shalt not kill." In so doing, Jesus shows
                    His concern over the inner urges that produce the act of murder
                    and that reveal the sinfulness of hatred and anger. Assassina-
                    tion of a brother's character may call for judgment as much as
                    the sudden taking of his life. As always, the Lord probes beneath
                    the surface and lays bare the thoughts and intents of the heart,
                    and in this case He offers love as the correction for anger and
                    murder. He revokes the old rule of "an eye for an eye, and a
                    tooth for a tooth," and He bids us replace hatred for an enemy
                    with an all-forgiving love (Matt. 5:38, 39, 43-48).
                        "All acts of injustice that tend to shorten life; the spirit of
                    hatred and revenge, or the indulgence of any passion that leads
                    to injurious acts toward others, or causes us even to wish them
                     harm (for 'whoso hateth his brother is a murderer'); a selfish
                    neglect of caring for the needy or suffering; all self-indulgence

        SACREDNESS
        OF MARRIAGE      "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Ex. 20:14).

                          This command arises from God's ideal set forth in Eden. He
                       intended one man and one woman, moved by mutual love, to
                       marry, to beget children, and establish an ideal home which
                       would be copied by following generations. Marriage was de-
                       signed to satisfy the legitimate, God-implanted desires of both
                       men and women. The commandment was given from the be-
                       ginning to safeguard the sacredness of marriage, a sanctity that
                       is destroyed by adultery—which is defined as the voluntary
                       sexual intercourse of two persons, one or both of whom are
                       married, though not to each other. (Sexual activity outside mar-
                       riage was not thereby countenanced.) Disregard of this com-
                       mand has ruined countless marriages, brought sorrow into
                       innumerable lives, bewildered innocent children, and weak-
                       ened the spiritual life and influence of the church.

                         What light does Jesus throw on the broader meaning of this
                       forbidding of adultery? Matt. 5:27-32.

                          The Master's teaching was directed first to men because in
                       Jewish life only the man had power to initiate divorce; therefore
                       he bore the principal responsibility in marriage. In the current
                       trends toward equality of the sexes, however, the Saviour's
                       instruction is of concern to both sexes. Today both marriage
                       partners carry the responsibility of preventing adultery by a
                       love-filled giving of self in satisfying each other's need for love.
                          Christ's interpretation of the seventh commandment is not
                       limited to husbands and wives. He sets standards of sexual
                       conduct for all, married and unmarried, young and old. Resis-
                       tance to the first sign of temptation, a turning from enticement,
                       refusal to be drawn into sin—these can prevent the fall into any
                       form of adultery.
                         In the sixth beatitude, our Lord reveals the key to sexual
                       purity: "Blessed are the pure in heart" (Matt. 5:8). They are
                       spared the griefs created by responding to unlawful desire.
                       They, like the lily, can be pure in a muddy world. Unspotted, they
                       can walk in white with Christ, their sinless Saviour. But such a
                       state is not easily attained. "Those who would not fall a prey to
                       Satan's devices, must guard well the avenues of the soul; they
                       must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which will suggest
                       impure thoughts.... The heart must be faithfully sentineled, or
                       evils without will awaken evils within, and the soul will wander in
                       darkness."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 518.

                                                                     August 12
         Part 4  With what words did the Lord set before His people ideals of
         TOTAL honesty and respect for others' property?
       HONESTY
                 "Thou shalt not steal" (Ex. 20:15).

                      This is a necessary clause in the legal code of every human
                   society. The need arises from the universal tendency to break
                   the tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet," and the resul-
                   tant breaking of the eighth which forbids stealing. And here, as
                   in the question of adultery, the secret of victory lies in rejecting
                   the first urge to sin. Refusal to desire another's property will
                   prevent the taking of that property; while a harboring of desire,
                   if unchecked, may lead to the act of stealing.
                      Each society produces its own inducements to dishonesty.
                   The temptations in Israel during the Exodus must have been
                   starkly simple, for a wandering people's possessions were
                   necessarily few. But in Egypt, where lavish wealth was paraded
                   before deep poverty, and in the more settled conditions that
                   awaited the twelve tribes in Canaan, enticements to sin were
                   and would be multiplied and intensified. We can apply the
                   lesson to the situation that confronts ourselves.

                    What was Paul's plan for upholding the eighth command-
                   ment? Phil. 4:11. (Compare 1 Tim. 6:6-11.)

                     Those who cultivate a contented spirit spare themselves the
                   shame of taking another's goods.
                     There are, however, many other forms of stealing, apart from
                   the direct theft of money or materials. Consider our attitudes
                   and actions in relation to payment or evasion of taxes and of
                   customs duties. How faithful are we in giving to God a complete
                   tenth of our income and offerings "as God hath prospered us"?
                   Do we steal from the worthy poor by not assisting them when we
                   have the means to do so? Do we limit our "charity" to the
                   narrow circle of church-related needs, or do we show a gener-
                   ous spirit toward genuine need wherever we meet it? Do we, by
                   working less than the agreed time, steal from our employer? Do
                   we steal another's good name? The number and variety of
                   questions relating to theft are embarrassingly rich!
                     The cure for any tendency to steal lies in unswerving honesty,
                   prompted and upheld by God's Spirit. "When a man is indeed
                   connected with God, and is keeping His law in truth, his life will
                   reveal the fact; for all his actions will be in harmony with the
                   teachings of Christ. He will not sell his honor for gain."—

The Law of the Lord-II             LESSON 7                                ❑ Thursday
                                                                            August 13
              Part 5     Consider God's plan for teaching truthfulness to His people.
             TRUTH
           TELLERS       "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour"
                       (Ex. 20:16).

                           Although this ninth commandment was not formally given to
                       Israel until Sinai, its principle, as with the other nine, had been in
                       force since Creation. Its instruction will continue to be needed
                       as long as there are faulty human beings like ourselves.
                           False witness is a specific form of dishonesty. It states a lie as
                       if it were truth in order to injure another, and is often done for
                       personal gain. It may rob the victim of his goods, of his good
                       name, or even of his life. It is therefore a form of stealing and
                       illustrates the close connection of one commandment with
                       another. Its central message bids us "Tell the truth, and nothing
                       but the truth in respect of others—or keep quiet."
                           "This commandment is not only applicable to the lawcourts.
                       It does include perjury, but it also includes all forms of scandal
                       and slander, all idle talk and tittle-tattle, all lies and deliberate
                       exaggerations or distortions of the truth. We can bear false
                       witness by listening to unkind rumours as well as by passing
                       them on, by telling jokes at somebody else's expense by creat-
                       ing false impressions, by not correcting untrue statements, and
                       by our silence as well as by our speech."—J. R. W. Stott, Basic
                       Christianity (London: Inter-Varsity Fellowship, 1958), p. 69.
                          It will be seen that fulfillment of this command cannot be a
                       mechanical process. The secret of keeping it lies in the state of
                       one's mind, whether one has become prone to leave the path of
                       uprightness or whether one has cultivated the mind of Christ in
                       whom there is no kind of falsehood.

                         Where must truth reside for it to govern our lives? Ps. 15:1,
                       2; 51:6.

                          Truth is a resident quality that should dwell in every Chris-
                       tian's heart. When that is so, he will be incapable of bearing
                       false witness or of telling a lie, for he will instinctively tell the
                       truth. He is then the kind of person whom God wants to dwell in
                       His holy hill, in Paradise.
                          The presence of truth in the heart will draw us to Him who is
                       truth, prepare us to be like Him who is the True Witness (Rev.
                       3:14), and enable us to be eternally at ease in His presence.

The Law of the Lord-II         LESSON 7                                  ❑ Friday
                                                                         August 14

           TRUE of mind?
    CONTENTMENT
                    "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
                  covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maid-
                  servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy
                  neighbour's" (Ex. 20:17).

                      This commandment might well have appeared as number
                    eight to introduce the command against stealing, for the two
                    belong together. He who covets takes the first step on the road
                    to theft. A refusal to covet, a firm rejection of the desire to
                    possess what another has, will turn us aside from reaching out
                    to take a brother's or sister's property—of any kind. In some
                    countries the principle of the command may be made more
                    clear by changing "ox" and "ass" to "car" or "plane" or "bicy-
                    cle," but the spiritual intent remains the same. We may admire
                    what others have, but when we grow envious and allow the acid
                    of covetousness to eat into our souls, then we are injuring
                    ourselves and preparing the way for injury to our neighbor.
                      The question of covetousness is a deeply spiritual matter,
                    beyond the reach of human law. It transcends legal formalities
                    and digs into "the thoughts and intents of the heart" (Heb. 4:12).
                    Are we more interested in acquiring possessions, in keeping up
                    with "the Joneses," in appearing affluent before our neighbors,
                    than in possessing true godliness?

                      With what words does Paul introduce the basic cure for
                    covetousness? 1 Tim. 6:6.

                       This quality does not come naturally to most people, but if
                    there is the core of godliness in our hearts, we shall, by the aid of
                    our Lord Jesus Christ, be able to cultivate the grace of content-
                    ment.
                       The positive form of this commandment is "Enjoy your own
                    possessions." Let us be thankful for what the Lord has already
                    given us. This attitude will spare us much heartache and make
                    us better neighbors.

                                                                          August 16
           Part 1     Think upon the Lord's assessment of the human race as
     SINNERS ALL    recorded by David.

                       "The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of
                    men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek
                    God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become
                    filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one" (Ps. 14:2, 3).

                       This is not looking for the worst, it is looking for reality. Even
                    in Eden sin had reared its ugly head, and thereafter tainted all
                    who were born of Adam and Eve. Within 10 generations men
                    and women had sunk so low that the Creator sent the Flood, and
                    through Noah and his family gave humanity a new start. (See
                    Gen. 6:5-8; 8:20 to 9:1.) But mankind showed itself unwilling to
                    be changed and clung to its sin. In David's day the psalmist
                    could state on the Lord's behalf: "There is none that doeth
                    good, no, not one." The compilers of the book of Psalms were
                    sufficiently impressed by the theme to include an almost identi-
                    cal psalm (53); while Paul (Rom. 3:10-18) uses selections from
                    the book of Psalms (most from the Greek translation of the Old
                    Testament) to establish the depravity of man and his lost estate:
                    "There is none righteous, no, not one" (Rom. 3:10).

                      With what conclusive declaration does Paul convey the
                    Bible's verdict on man's sinfulness? Rom. 3:23.

                       In the Greek original of the phrase "all have sinned," Paul
                    conveys the idea that this sinning was done once and for all in
                    the past, specifically in Adam's sin. This should be compared
                    with Romans 5:12, where the apostle teaches that Adam's
                    transgression affected all of his descendants. "By their trans-
                    gression, sin was introduced as an infectious power in human
                    nature antagonistic to God, and this infection has continued
                    ever since. It is because of this infection of nature, traceable to
                    Adam's sin, that men must be born again."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
                    mentary, vol. 6, p. 531. This is not an arbitrary act on God's part,
                    for the second part of Romans 3:23 says—by the use of the
                    present tense—"continue to fall short" or "keep on falling
                    short" of the glory of God. No individual since Adam has com-
                    pletely disassociated himself or herself from Adam's fall by
                    living free from sin. By their own sins all have shared in Adam's
                    original guilt. There has only been One who lived on earth
                    without sin; all others have fallen short of God's character and
                    are therefore in need of redemption.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my realization of my sinfulness as vivid now as when I first
                    felt my need of a Saviour? Is a deepening repentance a sign of
                    progress toward holiness?

                                                                         August 17

           Part 2   After recognition of universal sinfulness, what great step
       JUSTIFIED toward salvation does Paul next take for his readers?
        SINNERS
                    "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
                  that is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3:24).

                       When confronted by his sinfulness, the sincere man's instinct
                    is to reform and demonstrate that he is better than others sup-
                    pose him to be. He attempts to conform to God's standard, the
                    law, but discovers that he cannot live according to its precepts.
                    He then learns that "by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh
                    be justified in his [God's] sight" (verse 20), and is prepared for
                    the almost incredible plan outlined in today's scripture. In His
                    unfathomable mercy, God makes provision for a sinner to be
                    treated as a righteous person. All sins can be pardoned and a
                    new start in Christian living begun.
                       Being justified. The present tense is used, indicating that we
                    can be justified, or declared righteous, at any time that we
                    choose to cast ourselves on God's mercy and claim His assur-
                    ance of forgiveness.
                       Freely. The Greek word means "as a gift" or "without pay-
                     ment," and is correctly rendered "freely" or "gratis." It is hard
                     for human minds to grasp that no payment is demanded, it
                     seems too good to be true—yet true it is!
                        By His grace. This expresses in another form, from a different
                     angle, the same thought given by the word "freely." The phrase
                     identifies the divine quality that makes our justification possi-
                     ble, namely, "grace." The usual definition, "unmerited favor," is
                     not adequate in this context. "Grace" here refers to one of our
                     Creator's intrinsic qualities. It arises out of His inexhaustible
                     love for His creatures, leading Him to do all that is necessary to
                     save them from the results of their own folly. Its operation plays
                     a central role in salvation. (See Eph. 2:8.)
                        Through the redemption. God'sgrace is the motivating power
                     in His plan for our salvation; redemption is the method He
                     employs to effect our deliverance from sin's bondage. The En-
                     glish word "redemption" and its Greek equivalent are both
                     connected with the thought of "buying back" or "ransom,"
                     hence, "deliverance."
                        In Christ Jesus. The Father chose to channel redemption
                     through the Son. (See 1 John 5:11, 12.) It is in the total ministry
                      of Jesus that our ransom from sin is effected at the cost of His
                      own life. (See Rom. 3:25; 5:8.) This follows God's consistent
                      practice of working through Christ in all things that pertain to
                      our world and its inhabitants.

 THINK IT THROUGH      We know the theory of redemption. Are we experiencing its
                    liberating power in our daily lives?

                                                                           August 18
             Part 3   What simple but essential truth regarding salvation did
          BORN OF Jesus teach in His talk with Nicodemus? How does it affect us
         THE SPIRIT today?

                       "Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
                     thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
                     of God.. . . Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born
                     again" (John 3:3-7).

                        Our studying this lesson and our presence in Sabbath School
                     suggest that we do wish to enter the kingdom of heaven. To-
                     day's message, then, must be heeded by us. Unless we have
                     been or shall be born again, we cannot even see the kingdom,
                     much less enter that holy realm.
                        Let us earnestly ask ourselves, "Have we been born again, or
                     have we just whitewashed our old lives, making them look
                     respectable while they remain unchanged within?" This is a
                     question we need to ask and answer. Jesus said to Nicodemus:
                     "It is not theoretical knowledge you need so much as spiritual
                     regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity satisfied, but
                     to have a new heart. You must receive new life from above
                     before you can appreciate heavenly things. Until this change
                     takes place, making all things new, it will result in no saving
                     good for you to discuss with Me My authority or My
                     mission."—The Desire of Ages, p. 171.

                       What additional explanation did Jesus offer concerning our
                     new birth? John 3:5, 6.

                        The Saviour here offers two enlightenments. The first asserts
                     the need for burial of the old life in the waters of baptism,
                     followed by a resurrection that initiates the new life. The second
                     affirms the need to be born of the Holy Spirit, to have a life that is
                     conceived, sustained, and directed by that Spirit.
                        "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of
                     the old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self
                     and sin, and a new life altogether. This change can be brought
                     about only by the effectual working of the Holy Spirit. . . .
                        "When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it
                     transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are
                     renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger,
                     envy, and strife.... The blessing comes when by faith the soul
                     surrenders itself to God. Then that power which no human eye
                     can see creates a new being in the image of God."—The Desire
                     of Ages, pp. 172, 173.

New Lives for Old      LESSON 8                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 19
         Part 4      Having recognized our need for a new birth, how may we
      DEAD AND     signify that this has taken place?
   RESURRECTED
                     "Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into
                   Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are
                   buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
                   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
                   also should walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:3, 4).

                     In these verses Paul clearly identifies the Christian experi-
                   ence at baptism with the death and resurrection of the Lord
                   Jesus. This immeasurably increases the significance of baptism
                   by immersion, making it not only a cleansing act (see John 3:5;
                   Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5), but, more meaningfully still, the death of
                   the old nature and its burial beneath the baptismal waters. This
                   enables a resurrection to take place, but not of the old nature,
                   for it is reckoned dead; it must be a new creature who rises from
                   the water to "walk in newness of life."

                     Note the way in which death and resurrection are further
                   symbolized in baptism. Rom. 6:5-7.

                      The comparison between the convert's spiritual death and
                   resurrection in baptism is sharpened here. The death is likened
                   to crucifixion, with the old self being rendered "powerless"
                   rather than "destroyed." This is a dramatic comparison that
                   should emphasize the need for a complete change of life-style
                   for all believers. The way is then prepared for a resurrection that
                   marks the beginning of the new life, even as Christ came from
                   the tomb with His human form glorified.
                      Most of us will confess that our spiritual troubles arise from
                   those parts of the old self that constantly seek to rise again.
                   Hence the need for clearer and clearer glimpses of the cross
                   that produce ever-deepening repentance, more complete trust
                   in the merits of Jesus, and more complete submission to His
                   indwelling Spirit.
                      "This passage [Rom. 6:6] emphasizes the fact that conversion
                   and rebirth mean more than a mere change of profession and
                   habits of life. They involve a radical change in the inner man,
                   which can be wrought only by the regenerating Spirit of God.
                   The plan for man's salvation brings not only deliverance from
                    condemnation through acceptance of the benefits of Christ's
                   sacrifice, it brings also the birth or creation of a new self free
                    from the slavery of sin."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.

              Part 5      What black but truthful picture does Paul paint of the past
        FROM DEATH     lives of many believers?
          TO GLORY
                         "You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
                       sins; wherein in time past ye walked according to the course
                       of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air,
                       the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
                       among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in
                       the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of
                       the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
                       others" (Eph. 2:1-3).

                         In the original language of the Bible, the picture presented in
                       these three verses looks blacker still, for the verb translated
                       "quickened" does not appear until verse 5 and is inserted early
                       in our version only to clarify Paul's meaning. As we who have
                       been called out of the world's sin look at ourselves, we are
                       probably tempted to think the colors are too dark; but as God in
                       His purity looks upon our past, the picture may appear too light.
                       We should not forget the depths from which even the best of us
                       have been lifted!

                         In what sublime language does Paul depict the Christian's
                       present prospect of future glory? Eph. 2:4-7.

                          After his gloomy but accurate portrayal of the past (verses
                       1-3), the apostle looks up and sees what God has already done
                       for us in Christ. The revelation is almost beyond belief. It shows
                       us a God whose wealth is reckoned not in silver, gold, or jewels
                       but in the inexhaustible mercy which flows to us because of the
                       magnitude of His love toward us. This love has led Him to
                       include us among the recipients of the benefits arising from
                       Christ's resurrection. Even though we were then, according to
                       God's foreknowledge, still "dead in trespasses" (verse 1), He
                       guaranteed our being brought to life by virtue of His Son's
                       victory over death on that resurrection morning. So sure is God
                       of saving us from our sin and its fatal result that, in His own mind
                       and in the Person of Christ, He has already raised us up and
                       seated us at His own right hand. And, as if that assurance is not
                       breath-taking enough, He reveals His further plans. He has
                       saved us for an astounding purpose, namely, "that in the ages to
                       come he might shew" (verse 7) through us the extraordinary,
                       indescribable, immeasurable wealth of His grace or kindness.

THINK IT THROUGH         0 Father of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, we thank
                       Thee now for Thy great kindness, which needs all eternity in
                       which to express itself toward us!

New Lives for Old       LESSON 8                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                        August 21

           Part 6      There are many, many facets to God's plan for saving us from
       MADE NEW     our sins, and we need to keep their principal features in mind in
       IN CHRIST    order to form a balanced view of that plan. Overemphasis on
                    one aspect to the neglect of others gives us a distorted view of
                    redemption and may lead us astray. In our study this week we
                    have caught a glimpse of the hopelessness of natural man and
                    his inability to save himself from his sin. We have seen God enter
                    human history in the Person of His Son to rescue man and give a
                    new life through a new birth, which is signalized by baptism.
                    There is always the danger, however, that we shall be satisfied
                    with the symbol and miss the reality of experience it is meant to
                    illustrate. Study and acceptance of today's texts will help to
                    guard us from these mistakes.

                      How does Paul contrast the difference in quality of life be-
                    fore and after conversion?

                      "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are
                    passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor.
                    5:17).

                      Conversion is expressed as the state of being "in Christ,"
                    which is Paul's concise definition of what it means to be a
                    Christian. In other places he speaks of "them that are sanctified
                    in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:2), "the faithful in Christ Jesus" (Eph.
                    1:1), "the saints in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:2), and of
                    being "created in ChristJesus".(Eph. 2:10). Here (2 Cor. 5:17) he
                    can state: If anyone is in Christ, or hidden in Christ, being
                    completely identified with Him, then he becomes a different
                    creature.

                      What contrasting parts are played by life and death in Paul's
                    conception of the Christian life? Gal. 2:20.

                      In 2 Corinthians 5:17 the Christian was shown to be "in
                    Christ." Here Christ is said to be in the Christian: Both concepts
                    are true, and we need to experience them both in order to enjoy
                    a fully balanced Christian life. But how can Christ live in us? One
                    answer is found in Ephesians 3:17, where the apostle prays
                    "that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." A free rendering
                    of this reads: "that Christ may make His home in your hearts by
                    faith," and that reveals the simple secret of Christian living. Our
                    Lord must be our Guest, not just for a day or two, but as a
                    permanent resident in our hearts, serving there as Mentor,
                    Guide, and Saviour—the Conqueror of our sin.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Which room does Jesus occupy in our hearts—the attic, the
                     basement, or the best room?

                   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
                 Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
                 have everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                      With good reason we usually give highest importance to the
                   part taken by God the Father in this best-known of all Bible
                   verses. But the text also pinpoints our part in redemption's plan:
                   "Whosoever believeth in him [shall] ... have everlasting life." He
                   who would be saved must believe, must have faith in God's
                   ability and desire to save him from sin and its results. This
                   insures that only he who wishes to be saved will be rescued from
                   the devil's clutches. None will be given eternal life against his
                   own will. He must desire and choose to live eternally in the
                   sinless company of Father, Son, Holy Spirit, angels, and mul-
                   titudes of other redeemed human beings.

                     Under emergency conditions, how did two apostolic prison-
                   ers summarize the requirements for salvation? Acts 16:25-32.

                      Against the background of prison brutality and the alarm of "a
                   great earthquake," there came the cry, "Sirs, what must I do to
                   be saved?" In response there came the simple reply, "Believe
                   on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
                   house" (verse 31). There was no time for more. No Bible study,
                   no sermon, no doctrinal instruction, just the absolute essential
                   for the sinner to be saved:Believe. This, of course, was just the
                   beginning of the new life for the jailer and his family. Growth
                   undoubtedly followed as they were more fully instructed in the
                   Christian way. But belief had to continue. There never came a
                   time when they could dispense with belief in the Lord Jesus.
                      "To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul
                   hunger and living faith, avails nothing. A nominal faith in Christ,
                   which accepts Him merely as the Saviour of the world, can never
                   bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto salvation is not a
                   mere intellectual assent to the truth. . . . It is not enough to
                   believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The only faith that
                   will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal
                   Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves."—The De-

Trust and Obey        LESSON 9                                          ❑   Monday
                                                                          August 24

            Part 2      Is it a matter of opinion as to how one is reckoned
  SAVED BY GRACE     righteous—by faith or by works?
   THROUGH FAITH
                       "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
                     but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in
                     Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ,
                     and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law
                     shall no flesh be justified" (Gal. 2:16).

                       Paul teaches that we are justified, or declared righteous, by
                     faith in Jesus Christ (rather than of) and not by observance of
                     law. It is generally agreed that "law" here refers to the moral,
                     civil, and ceremonial guidance given to Israel at Sinai and that
                     this includes the Decalogue but is not limited to it. An attempt to
                     be justified "by works of law" (there are no definite articles here
                     in the original) is an attempt to obtain salvation by works, which
                     is doomed to failure. All have sinned, and so none is able to
                     claim righteousness. We are entirely dependent on the only
                     known Righteous One who has ever lived—the Man Christ
                     Jesus. If we are to be declared righteous, it is by faith in His
                     sinless life and substitutionary death and not through any law-
                     keeping efforts of our own.

                       From the exercise of which divine quality does our salvation
                     spring? Eph. 2:8, 9.

                        The sinner's natural urge is to do something to save himself
                     from the results of his own sin. The apostle rings the death knell
                     over all such attempts. There is no act which we can perform to
                     effect our own deliverance from sin and its penalty. We can only
                     accept the salvation that God's grace offers as a free gift. And
                     since there is no visible evidence of that gift, it must be accepted
                     by faith.
                        "Some seem to feel that they must be on probation, and must
                     prove to the Lord that they are reformed, before they can claim
                     His blessing. But they may claim the blessing of God even now.
                     They must have His grace, the Spirit of Christ, to help their
                     infirmities, or they cannot resist evil. Jesus loves to have us
                     come to Him just as we are, sinful, helpless, dependent. We may
                     come with all our weakness, our folly, our sinfulness, and fall at
                     His feet in penitence. It is His glory to encircle us in the arms of
                     His love and to bind up our wounds, to cleanse us from all
                     impurity."—Steps to Christ, p. 52.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Is my trust completely in God's saving grace? Have I sur-
                     rendered to it, or am I still struggling to supplement it by my
                     own good works?

                himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
                committed unto us the word of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:18,19).

                      We cannot reach across the chasm that sin has fixed between
                   ourselves and God. But our Father's love for His wayward chil-
                   dren has devised a way whereby we can be reconciled to Him—
                   counted and treated as righteous because of our Saviour's
                   righteousness. He presents Himself to us in the winsome life,
                   death, resurrection, and priestly ministry of His Son. These
                   loving manifestations are designed to draw us back to God, to
                   make us His friends instead of His enemies. And God does more.
                   By the revelation of His own self-humiliation and by the Spirit's
                   indwelling, He makes us fit to be brought into His holy presence.
                   By virtue of Christ's sacrificial ministry, He forgives our sins, not
                   holding them against us, so that we can stand before Him as
                   though we had never sinned. Indeed, in the Person of Christ, He
                   makes us as righteous as He Himself is. (See verse 21.) Thus, by
                   allowing Jesus to reconcile us to the Father, we open the way for
                   our own justification. And all this operates through faith—our
                   faith, God-given, directed to the Lamb of God that taketh away
                   the sin of the world.

                     Apart from pardon through justification, what additional
                   blessing does exercise of faith bring to those who believe?
                   Rom. 5:1.

                      In Romans, chapter 4, Paul has dealt very thoroughly with
                   Abraham's exercise of faith which was "counted unto him for
                   righteousness" (verse 3). (Compare also verses 5, 9, 22.) In
                   verses 23-25 the apostle declares that we can enjoy similar
                   justification through faith in God and in all that He has done in
                   Jesus our Lord. In chapter 5, verse 1, indicating a further stage
                   in his reasoning by use of the opening word "Therefore," he
                   concludes that justification also brings us "peace with God
                   through our Lord Jesus Christ." Without justification a Chris-
                   tian could not enjoy peace, for his sinful past would haunt his
                   every step and preclude all possibility of his being at peace with
                   His Maker. With justification he is not only assured of pardon,
                   but of restoration and of the peace of being set right with God.

THINK IT THROUGH     Are reconciliation and justification just printed doctrines, or
                   are they vibrant experiences that we are continuing to enjoy
                   since baptism?

                                                                     August 26

          Part 4       Many Christians, having been justified by faith, fail to follow
     WHY CHRIST     the divine program further. They act as if justification were the
          CAME      end rather than the beginning of the believer's journey and
                    something to be retained. Some have begun well by exercising
                    trust; but, becoming self-dependent again, they fail to render
                    obedience (the fruit of faith) and therefore make little progress
                    on the heavenward pathway. We need both to trust and to obey.
                    The remainder of this week's lesson emphasizes New Testa-
                    ment teaching that inseparably links faith to obedience.

                      What was Heaven's basic objective in the incarnation?

                      "She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
                    JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins" (Matt.
                    1:21).

                        When the angel reassured Joseph concerning the Child that
                    his betrothed would bear, the reason for the miracle of the virgin
                    birth was disclosed in the simplest possible language: "He shall
                    save his people from their sins." (Compare Titus 2:14.) If, then,
                    His people are not saved from their sins, the purpose in the
                    giving of God's Son is not achieved and the greatest sacrifice of
                    all time has been in vain.
                        Nevertheless, observation of our neighbor's and our own
                    daily experience demonstrates that Jesus cannot separate us
                    from our sins if we choose to cling to them.
                        From the beginning of the gospel story, God has made it clear
                    that salvation is a cooperative project. Responding to God's
                    offers, we must wish to be saved from sin; we must accept the
                    invitation "Come unto me"; we must choose to follow Christ.
                    This is our initial part in the transaction; we simply make it
                    possible for the Lord to redeem us from iniquity. The desire and
                    the power to be free from sin come from above, not from within.
                    "I am carnal, sold under sin [or, into the power of sin].... For I
                    know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing"
                    (Rom. 7:14-18). But when the Spirit pleads, we must respond.
                    We, then, cooperate with the Spirit by yielding to His invitation
                    and turning to God.
                        "God has given us the power of choice; it is ours to exercise.
                    We cannot change our hearts, we cannot control our thougths,
                     our impulses, our affections. We cannot make ourselves pure,
                     fit for God's service. But we can choose to serve God, we can
                     give Him our will; then He will work in us to will and to do
                     according to His good pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be
                     brought under the control of Christ."—The Ministry of Healing,
                     p. 176.

              Part 5   On the strength of Christ's liberating sacrifice, how may we
              CLEAN obtain forgiveness and cleansing from our sins?
         AND ACTIVE
                       "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
                     our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John
                     1:9).

                         This well-known and well-loved verse may still refresh our
                       understanding of the science of salvation. Repentant confes-
                       sion of sin on our part will enable a faithful and righteous Lord
                       to forgive us our sins. "Sins" refers to violation of God-given
                      moral law. These will not only be forgiven us, but, if our confes-
                      sion includes a desire to forsake sin, then our Saviour will also
                      "cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The word "cleanse" is
                      used in the Gospels for the healing of lepers (Mark 1:40; Matt.
                      10:8; Luke 17:14) and here refers to cleansing from the leprosy
                      of sin. "Un righteousness" translatesadikia (injustice, wrongdo-
                      ing, as well as unrighteousness), and emphasizes the work
                      done by Him who is righteous or just (dikaios) in not only
                      forgiving but in completely cleansing us from all adikia.
                         How can any Christian entertain the expectation that Christ
                      will pardon and purify us from wickedness and then sanction
                      our continuance in sinning? This would be contrary to the
                      whole genius of our religion. Forgiveness and cleansing are to
                      result in deliverance from evil in all its forms and not in con-
                      tinuance in its practice. The redeemed Christian will strive,
                      therefore, to exhibit the ideal character, that of his Master, who
                      went about doing good. The convert is not to live a sinless life in
                      a sealed, antiseptic plastic bubble, insulated from the rest of
                      humanity. (See Matt. 5:16; Acts 9:36; 1 Tim. 2:10; Titus 3:8;
                      1 Peter 2:12.)

                        What further definition of Christ's ambition for His people is
                      provided in Titus 2:13, 14?

                         In addition to His principal purpose of redeeming us from all
                      iniquity and preparing His own pure people, the Saviour plans
                      that we shall be "zealous of good works." This sanctifies the
                      association of faith and works and agrees with James's teach-
                      ing that we show our faith by our works and that faith without
                      good works is dead. (See James 2:18, 20.)

THINK IT THROUGH         As Jesus looks at my life, does He find satisfaction or disap-
                      pointment in what He sees? Does He find a dead faith or a
                      living, productive religion?

         OF FRUIT    through faith?

                       "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are
                     above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your
                     affection on things above, not on things on the earth" (Col. 3:
                     1, 2).

                        Our old self has died; we are reckoned dead, and our life is hid
                     with Christ in God (verse 3). A spiritual resurrection has taken
                     place; we are "risen with Christ." We have been baptized; we
                     are Christians. Yet, says the apostle, we must "seek those things
                     which are above"; we must set our affections on heavenly and
                     not on earthly things. This seeking and this setting of our minds
                     on spiritual matters show that after conversion we still have our
                     part to play. Salvation by faith does not give us an undisturbed
                     ride into the kingdom of heaven. We have to continue to "mor-
                     tify" our "members which are upon the earth" (Col. 3:5); we
                     have to subdue our carnal desires and reject the sinful traits of
                     unregenerate natures (verses 8, 9). By a continuing act of our
                     own wills, encouraged and sustained by the Holy Spirit's influ-
                     ence and the continuing assurance of our acceptance in Christ,
                     we must retain the new life in Christ, putting on His attributes
                     (verses 10, 12-14).

                       Note how Christ Himself illustrates that true faith will be
                     shown by our works? Matt. 7:16-20.

                       The so-called Christian life that does not produce a harvest of
                     Christian qualities is an empty profession, of no value to its
                     professor and a stumbling block to his neighbors.
                       "The good tree will produce good fruit. If the fruit is unpalata-
                     ble and worthless, the tree is evil. So the fruit borne in the life
                     testifies as to the condition of the heart and the excellence of
                     the character. Good works can never purchase salvation, but
                     they are an evidence of the faith that acts by love and purifies the
                     soul. And though the eternal reward is not bestowed because of
                     our merit, yet it will be in proportion to the work that has been
                     done through the grace of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p.314.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Our study this week can teach us that "there's no other way
                     to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey." Trust or faith is
                     but an empty vaunt when it produces no obedience. Obedi-
                     ence that is not the fruit of faith degenerates into legalism. In
                     salvation, there is trust in Christ's redeeming love that results
                     in obedience to all His biddings.

                                                                            August 30
             Part 1     What process did the Creator employ in the making of man?
        THE MAKING
            OF MAN       "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
                      breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
                      living soul" (Gen. 2:7).

                         In chapter 1:26, 27 the fact of God's creation of man is stated
                       but not described. In chapter 2:7 graphic details are given con-
                       cerning that creation. The Lord takes matter that has already
                       been created (dust of the ground) and from it formed the man.
                       This is the first biblical use of the verb "to form" and indicates a
                      different action from the verbs "to create" and "to make," both
                      of which figure prominently in Genesis 1. The noun form of
                      yaqar, "to form," is variously used for "potter," "artist,"
                       "creator." The use of yasar here suggests the action of molding
                      the dust of the ground into the form of the first man, Adam,
                       whose name is related to the Hebrew word for "ground"
                      ('adamah). At that stage the form was lifeless. Not until God
                      breathed the breath into the form's nostrils did that form be-
                      come Adam, a living soul (nephesh, used also for "life," "living
                      creature," "heart," "mind," "person"). From the beginning his
                      life was dependent on the breath that the Lord gave him.

                        How is the reversal of the life-giving process described?
                      Eccl. 12:7.

                         Man had already been warned about the results of disobedi-
                      ence: "In the day that thou eatest thereof [the tree of the knowl-
                      edge of good and evil] thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17). When
                      Adam and Eve sinned, the decree began to operate—they
                      began to die. The Lord reminded them that they were taken from
                      the dust of the ground and would eventually return to it (3:19).
                      And that dust returns to the earth whence the Creator had first
                      taken it for the formation of man. At the same time the spirit
                      (ruach, used also for "breath" and "wind") returns to the God
                      who had first breathed it into man's nostrils to make the lifeless
                      clay form into a living creature (nephesh, used also for
                      "breath"). The act of breathing had made man come alive;
                      cessation of that action brought death, and that death brought
                      decay—a return to the dust from which the first man was
                      molded. There was no immortal soul in man. When his "breath"
                      or "spirit" was taken from him, all of him was dead until God
                      would once more breathe into his nostrils the breath of life.

THINK IT THROUGH        Consider the accuracy of the Genesis picture of the creation
                      and nature of man. Reflect on the mystery of human life and its
                      dependence on breath and the act of breathing.

Life, Death, and Resurrection LESSON 10                                ❑ Monday
                                                                       August 31
           Part 2    Upon the entrance of sin, what steps did God take to save
   SIN'S HARVEST    man and woman from eternal misery?

                      "He drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
                    garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
                    every way, to keep the way of the tree of life" (Gen. 3:24).

                       By eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, the first human
                    pair became acquainted with evil and became sinners. If they
                    had been allowed to eat of the tree of life, they would have
                    become immortal sinners (verse 22). To spare them from such
                    misery, God barred the way to the tree of life and allowed sin to
                    bring about eventual death, while, through Christ, the Father
                    made it possible for man and woman to enjoy sinless eternal
                    life.
                       The episode reveals that humankind were originally depen-
                    dent upon the tree of life for the privilege of enjoying eternity.
                    They were not inherently immortal. They possessed only condi-
                    tional immortality; and when by sinning they failed to fulfill the
                    condition, they lost the intended possibility of living forever and
                    became subject to death. They could afterward enjoy eternal life
                    only as a gift from God through Christ. In the meantime the
                     wages of sin would be death.

                      After Eden, how does history confirm the basic sentence
                    upon sin—"thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:17)?

                      Sin soon produced death. After the murder of Abel, there
                    came the mournful refrain over the line of patriarchs—"and he
                    died" (Gen. 5:5, 8, etc.). Through the gloom of human mortality
                    there shine only occasional gleams of eternity. Enoch "was not;
                    for God took him" (verse 24). Moses, after death and burial, was
                    resurrected. Elijah was translated. The Shunamite's son was
                    raised to life, but must later have died at a normal age.
                       Great spiritual leaders such as Abraham, Joseph, and Samuel
                    died normal deaths and were buried. In the case of David there
                    is additional light from Peter's pentecostai sermon; "he is both
                    dead and buried," and "David is not ascended into the
                    heavens" (Acts 2:29, 34). The testimony from four thousand
                    years of history is that "the dead know not any thing" (Eccl. 9:5).
                    This lack of any inborn claims on immortality comes not from
                    ignorance, nor from skepticism, but from knowledge—
                    knowledge of the wages of sin and of the need to wait for the
                    end of human history, the end of mortality.

THINK IT THROUGH     Try to understand what sorrow the ruin brought by death
                    must bring to the life-giving Creator.

Life, Death, and Resurrection LESSON 10                                 ❑ Tuesday
                                                                       September 1
            Part 3   What is one of the earliest recorded questions concerning
        WHAT ABOUT death?
           DEATH?
                     "If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my ap-
                   pointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call,
                   and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of
                   thine hands" (Job 14:14, 15).

                       It is hardly surprising that Job, in the midst of his sore trou-
                     bles, gave much thought to the death that might bring them to
                     an end (ch. 14:10-13). But his faith in God led him to look beyond
                     the grave to the possibility of living again. He believed the Lord
                     would call him from the tomb, unwilling to lose His creation;
                     and Job will gladly respond to the life-giving call.

                       According to a psalmist, what was the chosen people's
                     understanding of man's condition in death? Ps. 146:4.

                         The writer is thinking of the son of man in whom there is no
                      help or salvation (verse 3). His breath (ruach) goes out, that is,
                      he expires, and he returns to the dust. Immediately his thoughts
                      or plans perish. (See Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10.) There is no hint here of a
                      soul that leaves the body at death and continues its own exis-
                      tence in a more blessed state. The fact that an individual's
                      thoughts perish on the day of his death denies any possibility of
                      conscious life after death prior to a resurrection.
                         But such an outlook is not comfortless. The writer goes out to
                      find joy and hope in the God of Jacob, in the Lord his God (Ps.
                      146:5). The informed Christian will share in a similar optimism.
                         "The Bible clearly teaches that the dead do not go im-
                      mediately to heaven. They are represented as sleeping until the
                      resurrection.... In the very day when the silver cord is loosed
                      and the golden bowl broken ... , man's thoughts perish. They
                      that go down to the grave are in silence. They know no more of
                     anything that is done under the sun. . . . Blessed rest for the
                      weary righteous! Time, be it long or short, is but a moment to
                     them. They sleep; they are awakened by the trump of God to a
                      glorious immortality. . . . The last sensation was the pang of
                     death; the last thought, that they were falling beneath the power
                     of the grave. When they arise from the tomb, their first glad
                     thought will be echoed in the triumphal shout: '0 death, where
                     is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?' "—The Great Con-

                     differ from our neighbors'?

Life, Death, and Resurrection LESSON 10                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September 2
           Part 4     What life-giving power did the Son of God share with His
             THE    Father during His earthly ministry?
      LIFE-GIVER
                      "As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
                    even so the Son quickeneth whom he             For as the Father
                    hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in
                    himself" (John 5:21-26).

                      Well into His public ministry, our Lord performed His first
                    direct miracle of healing by restoring the man who had been
                    paralyzed for 38 years. This merciful act brought Christ into
                    conflict with the Jewish authorities, who accused Him of Sab-
                    bath breaking and claiming equality with God. (See John 5:18.)
                    Jesus ignored the accusation of Sabbath desecration, but He
                    vigorously upheld His own equality with the Father. In so doing
                    He concentrated on Their possessing the same life-giving
                    powers. He passed far beyond the healing of the paralytic and
                    boldly dealt with His ability to raise the dead—"the Son quick-
                    eneth [makes alive] whom he will' (verse 21). This power, He
                    explained, had been given Him by the Father. But it was not a
                    temporarily assumed ability; it was intrinsic; He had "life in
                    himself" (verse 26): "In him was life" (John 1:4). He developed
                    this claim still more clearly in John 5:28, 29 and boldly applied it
                    to the final resurrection. In the raising of Lazarus (John 11)
                    Jesus went beyond words and demonstrated beyond doubt that
                    He could bring the dead up from the grave.

                      Only hours before Calvary, how did the Master describe
                    Himself to His disciples? John 14:6.

                       In the upper room the Son of God gives His eleven disciples a
                    brief but comprehensive definition of His threefold function: He
                    is the way (to God); He is the truth (about God); He is the life
                    (from God). The revelation that concerns us here is seeing Him
                    as the manifestation of life, the source and channel of life. There
                    is no life apart from Him. The Godhead agreed that all life should
                    flow through the Person of the Son. (See John 5:26; Col. 2:9.)
                    This function of the Son first touched our world at Creation
                    when He gave life not only to vegetation, but to all animate
                    creatures, and supremely to man. From that first week He who is
                    the Life has been sustaining life upon our world. (See Acts
                    17:25, 28; Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3.)

THINK IT THROUGH      It is pleasant to contemplate Christ exercising His divine
                    powers In healing and resurrecting others, but do we also see
                    Him as our way, our truth, and our life? Is He currently, this
                    very day, giving us power to live His kind of life? Are we using
                    that power?

Life, Death, and Resurrection LESSON 10                              ❑ Thursday
                                                                     September 3
           Part 5   In His recorded ministry, what events reveal Jesus as hay-
     RESURRECTION ing life in Himself?

                        Answer: The Gospels recount three miracles of resurrection.
                     In order of occurrence they are:
                        1. Widow's Son at Nain—Luke 7:11-17. There was nothing
                     noticeably premeditated here. Christ met the funeral proces-
                     sion and learned that a widow had lost her only son, the family
                     bread winner. Jesus "had compassion on her, and said unto
                     her, Weep not" (verse 13). He then addressed the young man,
                     who had been dead long enough to be ready for burial, and said:
                     "Arise." The authoritative voice penetrates the ears that would
                     normally be deaf, and the dead one comes to life immediately.
                     The revived youth sits up and speaks. There is no recall from a
                    disembodied, conscious state.
                       2. Jairus's Daughter—Mark 5:22-24, 35-43. The 12-year-old
                     girl was seriously ill. Jesus was delayed in reaching her and was
                    then informed of her death. The mourning ceremonies had
                    already begun. But He called to her and said, "Damsel, I say
                    unto thee, arise. And straightway the damsel arose" (verses 41,
                    42). Again, there was no doubt about the death, nor of the
                    resurrection.
                       3. Lazarus of Bethany—John 11:1-46. This is the most deci-
                    sive of all the Saviour's miracles. It marks the watershed in His
                    ministry and caused the Sanhedrin to plot His death. Lazarus
                    was a beloved personal friend of the Master, yet Jesus so de-
                    layed His response to the sisters' plea for help that Lazarus had
                    been dead four days by the time Christ reached his tomb. There
                    was, then, no doubt about his being truly dead. But Jesus gave
                    the life-giving call: "Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead
                    came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes" (verses 43,
                    44).
                       John's narrative does more than record the raising of a dead
                    man to life. It centers on Christ and His resurrecting power in
                    relation to Lazarus and, on a wider scale, to all who die "in the
                    Lord." Martha voiced her belief in a final resurrection (verse 24);
                    but in response to Christ's own momentous declaration-1 am
                    the resurrection, and the life" (verse 25)—she made her own
                    amazing confession of faith: "I believe that thou art the Christ,
                    the Son of God, which should come into the world" (verse 27).
                    She thus focused attention on the central significance of the
                    miracle—it identifies Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God.
                    When that is recognized, all resurrections become possible.

THINK IT THROUGH     Do we realize clearly that our hopes for everlasting life rest
                   upon the reality of the resurrections about which we have
                   studied in this lesson? The raising of Lazarus is a pledge of
                   the raising of all believers who die before Christ's return.

Life, Death, and Resurrection LESSON 10                              ❑ Friday
                                                                  September 4
          Part 6    In addition to giving life to the dead, how was Jesus still
       HIS OWN     more personally involved in the question of resurrection?
  RESURRECTION
                     "From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disci-
                   ples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
                   things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
                   killed, and be raised again the third day" (Matt. 16:21).

                      Hethrough whom all things were made, He who had originally
                   given life to all things that live, He knew, from an eternity of
                   experience, that He had "life in himself" (John 5:26). This calm
                   knowledge enabled Him to speak life to the dead. But would that
                   power function when He allowed Himself to die? The Gospels
                   show that Christ knew it would. He not only foresaw His arrest,
                   trial, crucifixion, and death; He foresaw His own resurrection.
                   This foreknowledge enabled Him to forecast on at least five
                   occasions that He would rise again (John 2:19; Matt. 12:40;
                   16:21; 17:9, 22, 23; 20:17-19).

                     What faultless witnesses to Christ's resurrection brought
                   conviction to His closest followers? Luke 24:1-9 with Matt.
                   28:1-8.

                     Two angels tell the two Marys (Matt. 28:1) that their crucified
                   Master is risen. The angelic informants remind the women that
                   Jesus had forewarned His disciples about His betrayal and had
                   foretold His own resurrection (Luke 24:5-7). The women re-
                   membered and in turn reminded the "eleven" and "all the rest"
                   (verses 8, 9).
                     It is possible that there were 15 post-resurrection appear-
                   ances (S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 558-560) which
                   were distributed among different individuals and groups of the
                   Resurrected One's followers. Those who at first were skeptical
                   were convinced by seeing the risen Lord with their own eyes
                   and became potent witnesses to the resurrection. The infant
                   church was built on the fact of its Founder's conquest of death
                   and drew its vitality from a knowledge of His being enthroned at
                   the right hand of God, possessing all power and able to uphold
                   and direct His people on earth. These were the central themes of
                   apostolic preaching (Acts 2:22-36; 3:12-15, 26; 4:1-4, 8-12, 33;
                   5:29-32; 10:34-43; 13:30-37; 17:18, 29-32; 26:22, 23) and help to
                   explain the rapid spread of the new religion throughout the
                   Roman world.

THINK IT THROUGH     What are some of the benefits that come to us because
                   Christ rose from the dead? Remember one of the most impor-
                   tant: "God, having raised his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you,
                   in turning away every one of you from his iniquities" (Acts
                   3:26).

                                                                  September 6
          Part 1  As the Source of life, how did Jesus make it clear that He
      THE SLEEP would do something about the fatal illness that had stricken
       OF DEATH Lazarus?

                    "These things said he: and after that he saith to them, Our
                 friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
                 sleep" (John 11:11).

                     Christ's proposal to visit Bethany—less than two miles from
                 Jerusalem—alarmed the disciples, who feared that Jews from
                 the capital would stone their Master. The Lord calmed their
                 fears (verses 7-10) and turned their minds to the condition of
                 Lazarus. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may
                 awake him out of sleep" (verse 11).
                     Death is often spoken of as a sleep, even by those who believe
                 in an immortal soul that leaves the body at death. But Christ's
                 later actions and words leave no room for such belief. Neither
                 does the disciples' reaction: "Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well
                 [lit. "shall be saved," that is, "recover"]. AsJohn explains, "they
                 thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep" (verse 12,
                 13). To remove all doubt, the Lord says plainly, "Lazarus is dead
                       ; nevertheless let us go unto him" (verses 14, 15). And they
                 went.
                    It can only be long-held ideas that try to interpret John's
                 account of the miracle in terms of survival of an immortal soul
                 after death. There is no hint of such views in the story. If a soul
                 had left the body, the Saviour would have spoken differently. As
                 it was, He clearly called to the whole being and brought his
                 complete person out of the rocky grave.

                   In what ways did the burial and resurrection of Lazarus
                 parallel the similar experience of our Lord?

                    Five similarities may be noted:
                   1. Lazarus had been dead and in the tomb four days. Jesus,
                 according to Scripture reckoning, spent three days.
                    2. As Lazarus slept the unconscious sleep of death, so did his
                 Master rest quietly in the grave. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 769.)
                    3. As the Life-giver's voice aroused Lazarus from his sleep, so
                 "the angel of the Lord" aroused Christ. (See The Desire of Ages,
                 pp. 779, 780.)
                   4. As the raising of Lazarus was the "crowning miracle" of
                 Christ's earthly ministry (The Desire of Ages, p. 529), so our
                 Lord's own resurrection was the crowning act in His total re-
                 demptive deed. (See Rom. 1:4.)
                   5. In both cases the dead Lazarus and the dead Son of God
                 slept in their tombs and knew no life until an animating Voice
                 bade them rise. Lazarus had clearly been only in the grave, and
                 Jesus Himself declared after His resurrection, "I am not yet
                 ascended to my Father" (John 20:17).

Sleepers, Awake!       LESSON 11                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                    September 7
           Part 2     Why will both doers of good and doers of evil hear the voice
    REST BEFORE     of the Son of God?
   RESURRECTION
                       "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
                    that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
                    forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
                    and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damna-
                    tion" (John 5:28, 29).

                      The setting of these verses is Christ's discussion with the
                    Jews following His healing of the paralytic (verses 1-16, 26, 27).
                    In verse 18 those same Jews challenge the Lord's claims to
                    divinity, and this leads Him into discussion of resurrecting
                    power and judgment (verse 21, 22). The climax to His reasoning
                    comes in verses 28 and 29, which teach that all who have died
                    will be subject to one of the Judge's two resurrecting calls—the
                    good to life; the evil to condemnation or judgment. But such
                    calls would not be necessary if at death the righteous im-
                    mediately enter on eternal life while the wicked are cast into an
                    ever-burning hell. Judgment would already have been pro-
                    nounced and rewards bestowed for good or ill.

                      In harmony with Christ's own teaching of death as sleep,
                    what is a frequent New Testament way of referring to the
                    dead? Matt. 27:52. (See also Acts 7:60; 1 Cor. 11:30; 1 Cor.
                    15:6, 18, 20, 21, 51; Eph. 5:14; 1 Thess. 4:14; 5:10.)

                       Although only New Testament references are listed, the softer
                    word, "sleep" for "death," is also an Old Testament term. In the
                    New Testament examples cited, the references are uniformly to
                    dead saints. It is surely not thinkable that the Inspired Word
                    would use a false description for so important a matter as the
                    condition of Christians who die before Christ returns—
                    especially since, if the dead are not asleep, they must in some
                    sense be awake and presumably living in the divine Presence.
                    Our next two lessons will study portions of the key New Testa-
                    ment chapter that is devoted to the relation of Christ to resurrec-
                    tion.
                       "In consequence of Adam's sin, death passed upon the whole
                    human race. All alike go down into the grave. And through the
                    provisions of the plan of salvation, all are to be brought forth
                    from their graves.... They who have been 'accounted worthy' of
                    the resurrection of life are 'blessed and holy.' On such the
                    second death hath no power.' . . . But those who have not,
                    through repentance and faith, secured pardon, must receive the
                    penalty of transgression—'the wages of sin.' "—The Great Con-

    SIGNIFICANCE tion for the truth of Christianity's message?
OF RESURRECTION
                    "If there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
                 risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
                 your faith is also vain" (1 Cor. 15:13, 14).

                       It is clear from verse 12 that some Christians in Corinth were
                   denying the truth of the resurrection of the dead, and this denial
                   was undermining the faith of many. The situation was serious
                   enough for Paul to devote more space (the entire chapter 15) to
                   correcting the heresy than he gave to any other single topic.
                       He begins by summarizing the Gospel (verses 3, 4) and by
                   firmly establishing the scriptural and historical truth of the lit-
                   eral resurrection of Christ (verses 5-8). He then presents a
                   closely reasoned argument which links the reliability of Christ's
                   resurrection to the certainty of Christians' being raised. A rejec-
                   tion of the believers' hope denies the historicity of our Lord's
                   conquest of death (verse 13). This is strong but necessary lan-
                   guage, for the denial of either resurrection leaves a gaping hole
                   in the fabric of Christian doctrine. Without the resurrection of
                   Christ, the doctrine has no foundation; while without the hope
                   of the saints' restoration, the Christian message has no point,
                   and preaching it is not only useless but deceptive, and believing
                   it is foolish.

                    What will be the practical result of denying the truth of
                   Christ's resurrection? 1 Cor. 15:17, 18.

                      Belief or disbelief in the resurrection of Jesus is not a merely
                   academic matter—it has eternal consequences. If there is no
                   truth in the resurrection accounts, then we have based our faith
                   on a fable and have no grounds for believing that Christ has
                   power to grant eternal life to pardoned sinners. It also means
                   that Christians who have died in the faith were trusting in a
                   falsehood. There is no hope of their being raised—they have
                   perished.
                     But, thanks be to God, there is no need to doubt. Paul was
                   only pointing out the grim results that would have followed if he
                   and his converts had been deluded. There is a further by-
                   product from his reasoning. The dead saints were still dead;
                   they were not in glory. Their redemption, no less than ours,
                   depends not only on the truth of the resurrection narratives, but
                   on Christ's triumphal return and His calling the sleepers from
                   their graves.

THINK IT THROUGH      Carefully read 1 Corinthians 15:1-19, following the writer's
                   line of reasoning and relating his argument to the topic of life
                   after death. Consult also S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp.
                   798-804.

                                                                      September 9
        Part 4   After considering the losses that would accompany a denial
     CERTAINTY of the resurrection, how does Paul assert the certainty and
OF RESURRECTION gain that follow the acceptance of the doctrine?

                     "Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-
                   fruits of them that slept" (1 Cor. 15:20).

                     "Certainly, Paul implies, none of the Corinthian believers
                   would deny that an integral part of the gospel message is the
                   resurrection of Christ (15:1-4). Therefore, they must now accept
                   the sequel—Christ guarantees the resurrection of the Christian
                   dead, as the word 'firstfruits' teaches. By 'firstfruits' Paul brings
                   to bear the rich imagery of the OT. The 'firstfruits'—the first
                   sheaf of the harvest offered to the Lord (Lev. 23:10-11, 17,
                   20)—was not only prior to the main harvest but was also an
                   assurance that the rest of the harvest was coming. So with
                   Christ. He preceded his people in his bodily resurrection and he
                   is also the guarantee of their resurrection at his second
                   coming."—The Expositor's Bible Commentary (Grand Rapids,
                   Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1976), vol. 10, p. 285.
                     Then comes the bold and logical affirmation in verse 22: "As
                   in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
                   Christ's virtue brings life, as Adam's son brought death. The
                   believer's faith is not in vain (verse 14). Christ is the firstfruits of
                   them that slept; the saints will rise "at his coming" (verse 23).
                   This implies that the saints remain dead until the Lord's appear-
                   ing.

                     In what confident language does the apostle portray the
                   climax of Christian hope for immortality? 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.

                     Here are two classes of Christians—those who "sleep" (in
                   death), and those who are alive at Christ's coming. Both classes
                   will be changed "at the last trump." If the righteous dead had
                   already been enjoying immortality, even if only as nebulous
                   spirits, they would not be needing transformation, neither
                   would they need to be reunited with resurrected bodies.
                     The apostle also declares: "We shall all be changed" (verse
                   51). This includes the righteous dead and the righteous living.
                   "The dead shall be raised incorruptible" (verse 52)—but if those
                   same dead have already been enjoying the incorruption of im-
                   mortality, they need no change. The truth is, however, that they
                   have succumbed to corruption in the grave and will need
                   Christ's transforming ministry no less than do their living breth-
                   ren and sisters.

THINK IT THROUGH     Meditate upon Paul's conclusion (1 Cor. 15:58) to his long
                   discourse on the resurrection.

                                                                    September 10
           Part 5     What comfort is there in the Bible's description of the righ-
         ALIVE IN   teous dead?
          CHRIST
                      "If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
                    also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him" (1 Thess.
                    4:14).

                       We have already read (part 3) of those "which are fallen
                    asleep in Christ" (1 Cor. 15:18). Here in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16
                    we learn of "them which are alseep," of those who "sleep in
                    Jesus," and of "the dead in Christ." The common denominator
                    for all descriptions is Jesus or Christ. The dead whom we de-
                    scribe as righteous have no merit of their own that will guaran-
                    tee their resurrection. They have recognized that in Christ is
                    their only hope of salvation and have surrendered themselves
                    into His keeping, believing He "is able to save them to the
                    uttermost that come unto God by him." They have committed
                    themselves into strong hands. "I give unto them eternal life; and
                    they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of
                    my hand," says the Saviour (John 10:28).

                      When will mortals put on immortality? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

                       There is an assured harmony (concerning the first resurrec-
                    tion) between these verses and those we studied in yesterday's
                    lesson (1 Cor. 15:51, 52). It is "the last trump" that wakes the
                    righteous dead, who are said to be asleep, and that alerts the
                    living saints to the nearness of their Lord's return. The dead are
                    raised "incorruptible," and the righteous living are changed,
                    both transformations taking place "in a moment, in the twin-
                    kling of an eye." While it is the sleeping saints who receive first
                    attention—that they may join their living fellow Christians and
                    be ready with them to meet the Lord—neither group takes
                    priority in translation. "We which are alive and remain shall be
                    caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
                    the air."
                       "The time when this glorious transformation will take place is
                    next indicated. It will be at the second coming of Christ, for it is
                    then that the 'trump of God' will sound, and faithful believers
                    who have died will be raised in bodies that are entirely free from
                    all effects of sin.... Then Christians who are alive and looking
                    eagerly for the coming of their Lord will undergo a marvelous
                    change, whereby all traces of corruption and imperfection will
                    be removed from their bodies, which will be made like unto
                    Christ's glorious body.... They will have the wondrous experi-
                    ence of being taken from earth to heaven without dying."—

                    are we going to be "in Christ"?

Sleepers, Awake!      LESSON 11                                       ❑ Friday
                                                                  September 11

          Part 6  In contrast to the prospect of death, in whom has our
    LIFE ETERNAL heavenly Father made eternal life available to us?

                     "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
                   and this life is in his Son" (1 John 5:11).

                      This statement is so simple that it can hardly be reduced to
                   simpler terms. Yet, within its simplicity it holds the deepest
                   spiritual insights that were granted to the beloved disciple,
                   John. Within it he distills the essence of the gospel—eternal life
                   is a gift from God, who has channeled that life through His Son.
                   This follows the pattern adopted by God in dealing with our
                   fallen world and its inhabitants. (See John 3:16; 5:22; 17:2; Matt.
                   11:27.) He does all through Christ, the Mediator between God
                   and man.
                      "But this great sacrifice was not made in order to create in the
                   Father's heart a love for man, not to make Him willing to save.
                   No, no! 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
                   Son.' John 3:16. The Father loves us, not because of the great
                   propitiation, but He provided the propitiation because He loves
                   us."—Steps to Christ, p. 13.

                     From the fact that eternal life is in God's Son, what further
                   truths does the apostle draw? 1 John 5:12.

                      1. "He that hath the Son hath life." This teaching is not
                   original with John; he received it from Jesus and from observing
                   His influence on men and women. He records the Master's own
                   words on the subject in his Gospel (John 5:24; 6:40, 47; 11:26)
                   and includes his own conclusions (1:4, 12).
                      2. "He that hath not the Son of God hath not life." This is an
                   inevitable consequence of rejecting the Source of Life. "Belief
                   or disbelief in the Son of God is a matter of life or death; for,
                   while to the believer His coming is the supreme revelation of
                   God's love bringing the assurance of eternal life, to the unbe-
                   liever it is the sign that he remains the object of God's displea-
                   sure."— R. V. G. Tasker, ed., Tyndale New Testament Commen-
                   taries, The Gospel According to St. John (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
                   William B. Eerdmans, 1973), p. 73.
                      Our possession or loss of eternal life depends on our attitude
                   to Jesus. There is no way of bypassing this requirement. It
                   makes possession of that life sound easy, deceptively so, and
                   makes its loss sound arbitrary but inescapable. This is the gos-
                    pel. Each one of us must decide to accept or reject it. Our
                    decision will determine our future, whether it will be everlasting
                    or tragically brief.

THINK IT THROUGH     What think ye of Christ? This is a large part of life's most
                   important question. The remaining part is: What are you doing
                   about Christ? How strong is His influence in your daily living?

                                                                      September 13
           Part 1    With what assurance does Jesus convey His expectations
         ETERNAL of resurrection and everlasting life for His followers?
     LIFE—WHEN?
                     "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
                  believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
                  not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto
                  life" (John 5:24).

                       Here we have only a small sample of our Lord's teaching on
                    this aspect of Christian belief. In many ways and at many times
                    He taught the long-term nature of His redemptive program. He
                    who knew all things was not expecting an immediate rescue of
                    mankind from death's clutches. He knew that untold numbers
                    of His followers would go to the grave and remain there until
                    "the last day" (see the second part of today's lesson). This did
                    not prevent Him, however, from foreseeing triumph over death
                    by resurrection and the beginning of everlasting life for those
                    who "believe on him that sent" Him.

                      What is God's design for those who see His Son and believe
                    on Him? John 6:40.

                       While speaking with skeptical and materialistic Jews in the
                    Capernaum synagogue (verse 59), Jesus boldly declared His
                    Father's plan for all who would accept His Son. First, "every one
                     which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlast-
                    ing life." The linking of seeing and believing shows that more
                    than physical sight is required. This is implied in the word used
                    for "seeing," which is better translated "beholding" or "looking
                    upon"—that is, perceiving in Jesus of Nazareth the Son of God
                    and consequently believing that He is the One through whom
                    salvation comes. There is nothing arbitrary in God's will for His
                    people: He is only making their redemption possible. "Those
                    who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into the
                    heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ
                    dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by
                    faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages,
                    p. 388.
                       Second, faith is needed not only for the initial act of belief, but
                    also for holding on to the promise of eternal life, for this will not
                    be fully realized until "the last day." This points to a resurrec-
                    tion, without which a great proportion of the divine promises
                    would remain unfulfilled. As we continue our study, we should
                    gain a deeper understanding of the crucial importance of resur-
                    rection in the divine design.

THINK IT THROUGH      The Lord has made it possible for us to be raised at the last
                    day. Are we making it possible for Him to fulfill His intention?

Into Eternity      LESSON 12                                           ❑ Monday
                                                                     September 14
           Part 2   In contrast to His ascension, how public will Christ's return
 REDEMPTION FOR be, and what will be its immediate result for believers?
  THE RIGHTEOUS
                    "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
                  with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and
                  the dead in Christ shall rise first" (1 Thess. 4:16).

                      These words that are so familiar to Adventists merit careful
                    thought because, with verse 17, they unveil so many facets of
                    our Lord's glorious return. After the resurrection of the sleeping
                    saints, we are assured that "we who are still alive and are left will
                    be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
                    And so will we be with the Lord forever" (verse 17, NIV).
                      Thus it is that the promises recorded in John 14:1-3 will be at
                    last fulfilled. Christ had gone to prepare a place for His own, and
                    that place is ready. He promised to come again and to take His
                    disciples to Himself, and now they will be forever where He is. At
                    that time the many assurances of being granted eternal life will
                    be fulfilled to the resurrected and to the living believers.

                      In Scripture how is this resurrection designated? Rev.
                    20:4-6.

                       These verses may cause confused thinking unless they are
                    read carefully. Let us summarize them here. John sees the
                    faithful living and reigning with Christ 1000 years (verse 4). To
                    account for the unfaithful dead, he inserts a phrase (verse 5,
                    which is accepted by most as being parenthetical) to explain
                    that they would not rise until the end of those thousand years.
                    He then returns to his main theme begun in verse 4 and continu-
                    ing in the closing sentence of verse 5 and into verse 6. There we
                    meet the only two scriptural references to "the first resurrec-
                    tion," but they are enough to identify and define it for us—it is
                    the resurrection of the righteous redeemed. In John 5:29 Jesus
                    describes it as "the resurrection of life," and in Luke 14:14 it is
                    called "the resurrection of the just."

            Part 3   What will be a vital part of the work of the redeemed during
      PRIVILEGED the millennium?
       EMPLOY-
      1000 YEARS     "I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
                   given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were be-
                   headed for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and
                   which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
                   neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their
                   hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
                   years" (Rev. 20:4).

                       The revelator sees a vivid tableau in heaven. There are
                    thrones, symbols of kingly and judicial power. "They" who sat
                    upon them are quickly shown to be the saints who have re-
                    mained faithful to Christ, many of them even unto death. To
                    them was granted the responsibility of judgment—that is why
                    they are enthroned. This appears to be the occasion foreseen by
                    Daniel—"judgment was given to the saints of the most High"
                    (Dan. 7:22), though it should be noted that many modern trans-
                    lations render the same phrase, "judgment was given in favour
                    of the saints of the Most High" (NEB). Paul asks the Corinthians
                    if they do not know that "the saints shall judge the world" and
                    that "we shall judge angels" (1 Cor. 6:2, 3). "The world" must
                    refer to unrepentan,t sinners, since the glorified saints will not
                    come under any judicial review at that time and would, in any
                    case, not be judging themselves. "Angels" must be those who
                    followed Lucifer, since those who are loyal to God will need no
                    judgment. It therefore appears that it is the resurrected saints of
                    all ages who will participate with Christ in judging those who
                    have spurned the love of God as revealed in Christ's saving
                    ministry. "In union with Christ they judge the wicked, compar-
                    ing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding
                    every case according to the deeds done in the body."—The
                    Great Controversy, p. 661.

                      What other activities will occupy the saints during the
                    thousand years? Rev. 20:6.

                      The ransomed ones, united with Christ at the time of the first
                    resurrection, will render priestly service in the presence of God,
                    will be corulers with Christ during the millennium. This is not
                    surprising. Angels have been ministering before the Most High
                    God from time immemorial and have been assisting the Son in
                    His kingly tasks through past eternity. It is surely appropriate
                    that those who have become sons of God should also partici-
                    pate in heaven's government while in their Father's house.

THINK IT THROUGH      What preparation can we make today to be among the
                    saints during the millennium?

Into Eternity      LESSON 12                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September 16
           Part 4   How can the resurrection of "the rest of the dead" be iden-
    DESTRUCTION tified, and when will it take place?
    FOR SINNERS
                    "The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
                  years were finished" (Rev. 20:5).

                      If the resurrection of the just is called "the first," the one that
                    follows becomes "the second," though it is not so called in
                    Scripture. We do read, however, of "the second death," which
                    presupposes a second resurrection (verse 14). There is no room
                    for doubt on the timing of this second event. It occurs at the end
                    of the thousand years. At that time "they that have done evil"
                    shall hear Christ's voice "and shall come forth . . . unto the
                    resurrection of damnation," that is, judgment (John 5:28, 29).
                      "At the first resurrection all come forth in immortal bloom, but
                    at the second, the marks of the curse are visible upon all. All
                    come up as they went down into their graves. Those who lived
                    before the flood, come forth with their giant-like stature, more
                    than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth, and well
                    proportioned. The generations after the flood were less in
                    stature."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 84.

                      What notable event signals the close of the thousand
                    years? Rev. 20:7.

                       The devil, that is, Satan, has been bound for a thousand years
                    (Rev. 20:1, 2). But the Lord of hosts cannot consider keeping the
                    producer of sin in endless captivity, for that would perpetuate
                    sin and keep the universe ever hostage to its evil possibilities.
                    Neither can the Just One arbitrarily destroy the prime sinner and
                    his dupes. Those who oppose God must be permitted to reveal
                    their true natures, and that opportunity comes at the close of the
                    millennium (verse 3). All who have chosen sin and rejected
                    divine mercy, from Cain to the unrepentant who have been slain
                    by the glory of the second advent (Rev. 6:15-17), now being
                    raised, will make their final, desperate attempt to overthrow the
                    government of God (Rev. 20:8, 9). Here is the supreme illustra-
                    tion of the inescapable truth concerning persistent, unrepented
                    sin: "Sin, when it is f inished, bringeth forth death" (James 1:15).

THINK IT THROUGH      What are our daily lives doing to save God's rebellious
                    children from the horrors of the second death (Rev. 20:10-15)?

Into Eternity       LESSON 12                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                     September 17
           Part 5     Which of the divine characteristics is responsible for our
  GOD'S MERCIFUL     own continued existence?
         JUSTICE
                       "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, be-
                     cause his compassions fail not. They are new every morning:
                     great is thy faithfulness" (Lam. 3:22, 23).

                        This beautiful, factual declaration of the Lord's mercy should
                     give us a spiritual equilibrium in face of the havoc wrought by
                     sin. Sin produces death—both that common to the human race
                     and the eternal death of the lost. If it were not for the Lord's
                     mercies, our ancestors would have been consumed long ago,
                     and we might not even have existed. That we continue to live is
                     due entirely to God's mercy and compassion—qualities derived
                     from His being the embodiment of love. This revelation of God's
                     mercy is woven into the warp and woof of both Testaments. In the
                     Old, the pattern is superbly displayed in Exodus 34:5, 6, in Jer-
                     emiah 31:3, and in Micah 7:18. In the New, it is depicted in John
                     3:16, in Matthew 23:34-38, and in Titus 3:5. How grateful we
                     should be for the depth and continuity of God's mercy!

                        When the Lord's mercy is rejected, what only can be the
                     final outcome of sin? James 1:15.

                       Sin has always been destructive. It blights everything it
                     touches and, if uninterrupted, causes death. A hint of the man-
                     ner in which sin itself is finally destroyed may be seen in the fate
                     that is prophetically forecast for Lucifer, the author of sin. The
                     judgment of the fallen cherub comes not from a vengeful Deity,
                     but, as Ezekiel foretells, "a fire from the midst of thee, it shall
                     devour thee." (Eze. 28:18.) When God's protecting hand is
                     withdrawn from Lucifer, the sin he has so long cherished and
                     which he has shared with his deluded hosts, will be as a fire
                     within him, and will bring him "to ashes upon the earth." This
                     may be one aspect of the terrible fate depicted in Revelation
                     20:10. It is undoubtedly the ultimate fulfillment of Romans 6:23:
                     "The wages of sin is death."
                       "Satan deceives many with the plausible theory that God's
                     love for His people is so great that He will excuse sin in them....
                     But in all His dealings with His creatures God has maintained
                     the principles of righteousness by revealing sin in its true
                     character—by demonstrating that its sure result is misery and
                     death. The unconditional pardon of sin never has been, and
                     never will be. Such pardon would show the abandonment of the
                     principles of righteousness, which are the very foundation of
                     the government of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 522.

Into Eternity      LESSON 12                                              ❑ Friday
                                                                      September 18
         Part 6    To which questions regarding resurrection, occuring natur-
     NEW BODIES ally to an inquiring mind, does Paul give his inspired atten-
                tion?

                     "Some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
                    what body do they come?" (1 Cor. 15:35).

                       Those few who were raised from the dead and given a further
                    lease on life during biblical times returned to their normal,
                    earth-bound environments. Apart from being healed of fatal
                    weakness and disease, their bodies remained as they had been
                    before death. They were returned to life but were still subject to
                    death. This cannot be so for those who participate in the first
                    resurrection, or the living who are translated with them. Paul
                    enlarged on this theme: "It fthe body.' is sown in corruption; it is
                    raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory:
                    it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power" (1 Cor. 15:42, 43).
                    "Sin defaced and almost obliterated the divine image; but
                    Christ came to restore that which had been lost. He will change
                    our vile bodies, and fashion them like unto His glorious body.
                    The mortal, corruptible form, devoid of comeliness, once pol-
                    luted with sin, becomes perfect, beautiful, and immortal. All
                    blemishes and deformities are left in the grave."—The Great
                    Controversy, p. 645.

                      For what reason might the apostle bluntly turn our attention
                    from the earthly to the eternal? 1 Cor. 15:49.

                       It is so easy to be obsessed with "the earthy," and to give less
                    than second place to "the heavenly." But Paul reminds us that
                    our present natural body has a limited life, while our future is
                    linked to a heavenly or spiritual form. This is said in still more
                    memorable language in 2 Corinthians 4:18: "The things which
                    are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are
                    eternal." This piece of religious philosophy is closely tied to the
                    question of resurrection and the firmness of our belief in it. We
                    need, then, to "look not at the things which are seen, but at the
                    things which are not seen" (verse 18). In other words, we need
                    to cultivate the eternal outlook. "If we are indeed journeying
                    thither, the spirit of heaven will dwell in our hearts here. But if
                    we find no pleasure now in the contemplation of heavenly
                    things; if we have no interest in seeking the knowledge of God,
                    no delight in beholding the character of Christ; if holiness has
                    no attractions for us—then we may be sure that our hope of
                    heaven is vain."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 745.

THINK IT THROUGH      What does our life-style proclaim regarding our belief in the
                    reality and the nearness of the first resurrection?

13:20, 21).                                 expresses truth for each one of us:

Hebrews, asks that the book's               have done." A fresh confrontation
message might lead its readers to           with our own inconsistencies may
perfection. This week's lesson has a        help us to utter with new earnestness
somewhat similar purpose. For               the prayer from Dryden's translation
twelve weeks we have had fellowship         of a ninth-century hymn: "Make us
with the Father, the Son, and the           eternal truth receive, and practise all
Holy Spirit, studying Their creativity      that we believe." And that, after all, is
in nature and in our own lives. Now,        the core and the touchstone of our
at the close of the quarter, we are         religion: "Not every one that saith
taking time for a backward glance           unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into

          Part 1  How effective is it for David to use the example of human
       FATHER OF parentage to reveal our heavenly Father's compassion for
        MERCIES us?

                     "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
                   that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that
                   we are dust" (Ps. 103:13, 14).

                     The psalmist uses the created to introduce the Creator, but he
                   realizes the poverty of the comparison. The purest of human
                   affections, however, do reflect their source—the vast compas-
                   sion of God. This is yoked to His qualities of mercy and grace
                   (verse 8)—infinite in extent and eternal in duration (verse 17).
                   Our response to them should be not only gratitude, but, with
                   divine aid, imitation.
                     "The one thing essential for us in order that we may receive
                   and impart the forgiving love of God is to know and believe the
                   love that He has to us. Satan is working by every deception he
                   can command, in order that we may not discern that love. .. But
                   we may tell the enemy that 'the blood of Jesus Christ His Son
                   cleanseth us from all sin.' When we feel that we have sinned,
                   and cannot pray, it is then time to pray."—Thoughts From the
                   Mount of Blessing, p. 115.

                     What should be our response to God's goodness toward
                   us? Ps. 103:1, 2.

                      David was well acquainted with "the mercy of the Lord." He
                   knew that his daily life depended on it, and much of his spirit of
                   praise in psalms sprang from gratitude for benefits that flowed
                   from the Lord's unfailing kindness toward him. That is why he
                   cried, "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul." In saying this, he is not
                   bestowing a blessing on the Almighty but is bidding himself—
                   his soul—praise the Lord for all mercies received. It is we who
                   are doubly blessed, first by divine benevolence, then by the act
                   of praising the Giver. "It is for our own benefit to keep every gift
                   of God fresh in our memory. Thus faith is strengthened to claim
                   and to receive more and more. There is greater encouragement
                   for us in the least blessing we ourselves receive from God than
                   in all the accounts we can read of the faith and experience of
                   others. The soul that responds to the grace of God shall be like a
                   watered garden."—The Desire of Ages, p. 348.

                                                                     September 21
           Part 2  For what purpose above all others did the Son of God come
         SAVIOUR into our world?
        FROM SIN
                   "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
                  Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I
                  am chief" (1 Tim. 1:15).

                      This has always been Christ's mission from Eden onward, but
                   humanity has ever been willing to ignore the divine purpose and
                   to substitute lesser objectives which fall short of salvation from
                   sin. The Son certainly came to set us an example (1 Peter 2:21),
                   but that alone would have done no permanent good, for we have
                   no power in ourselves to copy that example (Rom. 7:18). Thank
                   God that His sights were set higher. In Peter's words, He sent
                   Jesus "to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
                   iniquities" (Acts 3:26). That is why the Son was given the name
                   Jesus ("Jehovah is salvation"), "for he shall save his people
                   from their sins" (Matt. 1:21). "Jesus died, not to save man in his
                   sins, but from his sins. Man is to leave the error of his ways, to
                   follow the example of Christ, to take up his cross and follow
                   Him, denying self, and obeying God at any cost."—
                   Testimonies,vol. 4, p. 251.

                      At what personal cost did the Lord of glory make our salva-
                   tion possible? Isa. 53:5.

                      This is only a very small part of the picture, but it lifts a corner
                   of the veil to give a glimpse of the divine Sufferer. In moving
                   language it shows His being wounded (or tormented), bruised
                   (or crushed), punished, scourged because of our transgres-
                   sions and iniquities, that we might find peace and healing. We
                   need to read the whole of this chapter at frequent intervals to
                   deepen our realization that "the Lord hath laid on him the
                   iniquity of us all." Such reading would also help us fulfill the
                   counsel given in The Desire of Ages, page 83: "It would be well
                   for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in contemplation of
                   the life of Christ. We should take it point by point, and let the
                   imagination grasp each scene, especially the closing ones. As
                   we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice for us, our confidence in
                   Him will be more constant, our love will be quickened, and we
                   shall be more deeply imbued with His spirit. If we would be
                   saved at last, we must learn the lesson of penitence and humilia-
                   tion at the foot of the cross."

THINK IT THROUGH      When did I last behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the
                    sin of the world? Am I allowing Him to free me from my sins?

           Part 3   What Power made it possible for the apostles to fulfill their
        PROMISE Christ-given commission?
       OF POWER
                    "When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they
                  were assembled together; and they were all filled with the
                  Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness"
                  (Acts 4:31).

                      One of the most striking of all the miracles that accompanied
                   the founding and development of the early church was the
                   transformation of timid disciples into powerful apostles. This
                   change was brought about in large part by the ministry of the
                   Holy Spirit. In accordance with Christ's promise, they had ini-
                   tially received power by the Spirit's coming upon them at
                   Pentecost (Acts 1:8; 2:4). But this was not a one-time event. It
                   was repeated in response to prayer and need, even as recorded
                   in the above verse and in Acts 2:33. Their experience, which was
                   shared by the central group of Christians in Jerusalem, may be
                   ours, too, when we follow a similar Spirit-centered program.
                   "Since this is the means by which we are to receive power, why
                   do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we
                   not talk of it, pray for it, and preach concerning it? The Lord is
                   more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him than
                   parents are to give good gifts to their children."—The Acts of
                   the Apostles, p. 50.

                      What effect did the coming of the Spirit have on "the mul-
                   titude of them that believed"? Acts 4:32.

                     Unless He is restricted by us in His ministry, the Spirit does not
                   make selections that exclude rank-and-file church members
                   from receiving power from on high. The new believers had
                   witnessed Pentecost, had been baptized, and had been prom-
                   ised "the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts 2:38, 39). That promise
                   had been fulfilled (Acts 4:31). As a result they "were of one heart
                   and of one soul" (verse 32). This Spirit-inspired unity not only
                   gave power to themselves, but laid a strong foundation on
                   which the apostles were able to build a still mightier ministry
                   (verse 33). "Thus it was in the early church; and when in the
                   church of today it is seen that by the power of the Spirit the mem-
                   bers have taken their affections from the things of the world,
                   and that they are willing to make sacrifices in order that their fel-
                   low men may hear the gospel, the truths proclaimed will have a
                   powerful influence upon the hearers."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   p. 71.

THINK IT THROUGH     We talk much about the gift of the Spirit. What are we per-
                   sonally doing, how are we personally living, to encourage the
                   Spirit to come into our daily lives?

Fruits of Belief    LESSON 13                                     ❑  Wednesday
                                                                   September 23
           Part 4     What is the ideal response to the law of the Lord?
     LAW LOVERS
                      "0 how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day" (Ps.
                    119:97).

                        The Hebrew word torah is translated in this text as "law." As
                    we have observed in lesson 6, part 2, reference to law embraces
                    more than the Decalogue. Torah denotes the total body of in-
                    struction given to God's people. It is appropriate, then, that the
                    loyal follower love the Lord's instruction. He recognizes it is
                    sound counsel, intended for his protection and guidance. He
                    does not find it wearying. As he grows in religious experience,
                    he can even echo his Lord's words: "I delight to do thy will, 0 my
                    God: yea, thy law is within my heart" (Ps. 40:8).
                        When the same loyalist says, "It is my meditation all the day,"
                    it is unlikely that he spends all his waking hours pondering on
                    the Torah; but rather, he constantly—consciously or otherwise
                    —seeks God's guidance for each day's situations and finds the
                    law of the Lord adequate for all eventualities.

                      What is the most important issue in commandment keep-
                    ing? Matt. 22:36-40.

                       This exposition of the essence of the law was already known
                    in Judaism, having been clearly stated by Moses (Deut. 6:5;
                    10:12, 13; 30:6). But its truth had long been clouded by legalism,
                    and the Lawgiver was needed to remind men that acceptable
                    law keeping issued from love—love for God and man.
                       "It is not possible for the heart in which Christ abides to be
                    destitute of love. If we love God because He first loved us, we
                    shall love all for whom Christ died. We cannot come in touch
                    with divinity without coming in touch with humanity; for in Him
                    who sits upon the throne of the universe, divinity and humanity
                    are combined. Connected with Christ, we are connected with
                    our fellow men by the golden links of the chain of love. Then the
                    pity and compassion of Christ will be manifest in our life. We
                    shall not wait to have the needy and unfortunate brought to us.
                    We shall not need to be entreated to feel for the woes of others.
                    It will be as natural for us to minister to the needy and suffering
                    as it was for Christ to go about doing good."—Christ's Object
                    Lessons, pp. 384, 385.

THINK IT THROUGH       What hinders us from holding a right attitude to God's
                    commandments—is it shallow thinking, unrecognized at-
                    tachment to sinful thought and habit, or failure to love Him who
                    first loved us?

Fruits of Belief   LESSON 13                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                  September 24
          Part 5     What counsel does Paul give to Christians which, if fol-
      LOVERS OF    lowed, will enable them to do God's will?
       NEW LIFE
                     "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
                   the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
                   good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God" (Rom. 12:2).

                      This message is for all believers. The apostle exhorts us to
                   resist pressures that would turn us into world! ings. Instead, we
                   are urged to permit ourselves to be completely changed. (The
                   Greek word translated "transformed" is that from which our
                   word metamorphosis is derived, and it is in Matthew 17:2 for the
                   transfiguration of Christ.) When we are born again, we are given
                   new minds as well as new hearts, but we must not stand still in
                   mind or spirit. We must continually develop, striving to fulfill
                   God's perfect will. (Compare Eph. 4:13.)
                      "Man, fallen man, may be transformed by the renewing of the
                   mind, so that he can 'prove what is that good, and acceptable,
                   and perfect, will of God.' How does he prove this? By the Holy
                   Spirit taking possession of his mind, spirit, heart, and character.
                   Where does the proving come in? 'We are made a spectacle
                   unto the world, and to angels, and to men.' A real work is
                   wrought by the Holy Spirit upon the human character, and its
                   fruits are seen."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1080.

                    How can we further assist the divine Power in the transfor-
                   mation of our characters? Col. 3:12.

                      While we are saved by God's grace and not by any merit of our
                   own, it is not intended that we should be spiritual robots. We are
                   meant to cooperate with the Lord in His redemptive work. It is in
                   this spirit that we are urged to "put on" or "clothe ourselves
                   with" a compassionate heart, kindness, humility—not merely of
                   manner but of thought, meekness, or courtesy—and patience.
                   Not everyone who possesses one or more of these qualities is a
                   Christian, but a Christian should possess these spiritual, social
                   gifts. "If you live upon the plan of addition, adding grace to
                   grace, God will multiply unto you His grace. While you add, God
                   multiplies. If you cherish a habitual impression that God sees
                   and hears all that you do and say, and keeps a faithful record of
                   all your words and actions, and that you must meet it all, then in
                   all you do and say you will seek to follow the dictates of an
                   enlightened and wakeful conscience."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p.
                   244.

THINK IT THROUGH     How much have I grown since baptism? What spiritual and
                   intellectual growth has come during the past year?

Fruits of Belief     LESSON 13                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                     September 25
            Part 6      In Christian doctrine there is a close connection between
           RAISED    baptism and resurrection. The first is preparation for the sec-
      LIKE CHRIST    ond. He who refuses baptism has no right to expect resurrec-
                     tion. But baptism is more than immersion in water, and resur-
                     rection is more than rising from a grave. As genuine baptismal
                     experience brings "newness of life," so the first resurrection
                     will bring a new and eternal life (John 11:25, 26). In this closing
                     lesson of the quarter, then, let us explore the deep spiritual
                     significance of both experiences.

                       "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
                     him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised
                     him from the dead" (Col. 2:12).

                       Here the apostle clearly links baptism and resurrection, but
                     only as both are associated with Christ. We must be "buried
                     with him in baptism." Jesus Himself was baptized as an example
                     for us to follow, and baptism is beneficial only as we con-
                     sciously follow the Example. When that condition is fulfilled,
                     then what God did for Christ in raising Him from the dead will
                     operate similarly on our behalf.

                       What eternal assurance can we gain from our baptismal
                     experience? Rom. 6:5.

                        The little word "if" has great significance here. It requires that
                     in passing through baptismal waters we actually die to sin as
                     surely as Jesus died and was buried after crucifixion. When this
                     death takes place in our lives, then we have the promise of
                     sharing in Christ's eternal life by His grace through the first
                     resurrection. In this way our present choice of action decides
                     our eternal future—for life or for death.
                        "The vows which we take upon ourselves in baptism embrace
                     much. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit we
                     are buried in the likeness of Christ's death and raised in the
                     likeness of His resurrection, and we are to live a new life. Our life
                     is to be bound up with the life of Christ. Henceforth the believer
                     is to bear in mind that he is dedicated to God, to Christ, and to
                     the Holy Spirit.... Publicly he has declared that he will no longer
                     live in pride and self-indulgence. He is no longer to live a care-
                     less, indifferent life. He has made a covenant with God. He has
                     died to the world. He is to live to the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 6,
                      pp. 98, 99.

THINK IT THROUGH       Most of us remember our birthdays. Would it help our
                     spiritual growth if we annually commemorated the day of our
                     baptism? Is our Christian life "newer" now than then?
