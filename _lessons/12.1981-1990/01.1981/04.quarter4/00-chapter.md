[y Brothers and Sisters:

 ank you for the record offering you gave. The projects in Sweden and Africa
Ire completed and the one in Britain, nearly so. Without your help we could
Lot have advanced the way we have.

'his quarter we have three new Special Projects for which we ask your support.
'hey are:

  1. An evangelistic centre in Skoczow, Poland. Our church in Poland
     has many needs and opportunities. A climate of liberty and good-
     will has enabled us to establish strong local churches. This
     centre will provide a place where the message we share can be
     presented to large audiences.

  2. Rebuilding of Toivonlinnan Junior College, Finland. Two old
     buildings desperately needing replacement, and the threat of
     closure because of safety requirements makes a new dormitory
     and dining block an urgent priority.

  3. A child evangelism centre in Tromso, North Norway. With its
     nightless summers and dayless winters, North Norway provokes
     unique challenges in child evangelism. We hope to meet them in
     the largest city in North Norway with a centre which will pro-
     vide for Vacation Bible Schools, Bible Story Hours, Pathfinder
     clubs and a day school. These will be missionary projects for
     the children of the city and will give us access to large num-
     bers of non-Adventist families.

 or Northern Europe we plead for your prayers that God's Spirit will be poured
 n the 45,000 members in these countries. The challenges are great; the
 pportunities are many. Your intercession will lift us toward a finished work.

                THE COVENANT SERIES
   Since the first quarter of 1975 the Sabbath Schools of the world
have been studying the Daybreak Series of lessons built around, and
growing out of the three angels' messages of Revelation 14. Begin-
ning with the first quarter, 1982, and for the next five years or so, the
Sabbath Schools will be studying various aspects of God's cove-
nants with humankind.
   We are not deeply concerned if our Sabbath School members are
not conscious from week to week or from quarter to quarter that the
lessons are following a particular theme. It is primarily a satisfaction
to the writers and editors of the lessons to know that a degree of
balance and proportion may be better obtained within a curriculum
than by haphazard selection of topics for study.
   It goes without saying that when the work of 20 different writers is
projected over a five-year period, there may be some unavoidable
changes—or switches at least—in the order of the lessons, and
some may not actually appear at all. Sickness, accident, or other
hindrances can come to all, even to writers and editors!
   But the lessons have been planned under four main areas of study
that cover the benefits of God's covenants of grace:
      1. The Inward Law
      2. The Revelation of God and His People
      3. The Knowledge of God
      4. The Forgiveness of Sin
   It is not planned that we should study all of one area before
moving to the next. Rather, there will be cycles of studies running
across the four main areas. And, as we said above, sometimes we
have to break the ideal order of subjects because we cannot keep
the world field without any lessons while we wrestle with the de-
mands of deadlines, reading committees, translating and printing
schedules. Even the wonderful mail services of the world are faced
with growing difficulties. Manuscripts get delayed beyond dead-
lines, and even lost.

serve as consulting editors.

                            THIS WE BELIEVE
                    Studies in Christian Doctrine: Part II
                                         Introduction

   Although this quarter sees us continuing our study of Bible doctrines as taught by
Seventh-day Adventists, we must not rest content with the previous quarter's ap-
proach or any blessing received from it. "Time, like an ever-rolling stream," has
borne some details of those studies away, and we now need a fresh approach and
brand-new blessings for the thirteen studies that lie ahead.
   A glance at the topics that await our attention reveals that Christ our Saviour
broods over them all as High Priest, Judge, Returning Lord, Master Physician, Head
of the Church, Servant and Sacrifice, Chief Witness, and Great Exemplar. This is as it
should be, for without Him in the central position our doctrines cannot be Christian.
With Him at their center, their reliability and efficacy are assured.
   Each lesson is firmly based on Scripture, the source of all true doctrine. Many of
those scriptures are well known; others may have received relatively little use. But
they will all beir intensive study, especially when seen from a slightly different angle
than that used in the past. Teachers and class members are therefore urged to study
the Word as deeply as possible. The Word "is quick [or, living], and powerful, and
sharper than any twoedged sword, ... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
the heart" (Heb. 4:12). Let us, then, daily study that Word, that God may reveal to us
the purpose He had in.mind in having those particular passages included in the Bible.
Classes where the Word is intensively studied will find sound religious instruction,
spiritual life, and inspiration for daily living.
   The Word is the mine from which doctrines are dug. The doctrines have ever been
in the Word, embedded in it as gems and minerals are contained in rocks and soil. No
true doctrine is of human devising; it is inherent in Holy Writ, there to be quarried by
those who search the Scriptures to discover revelations of God's character and His
ways. These, when found, are formed into shapes more readily understood and
retained by His children. We should therefore not see doctrines as ready-made
declarations of belief that spare us further mental and spiritual exercise. We need
them in portable form for convenience and as a means of expressing our beliefs to
others that they may know the substance of our faith. But each belief is infinitely
richer than its summary form. Indeed, to change the figure, the formal doctrine may
be little more than a label to list the contents of the treasure chest of truth. It is for us to
lift the lid and discover the wealth of revelation that lies within.
   These illustrations explain why a series of Sabbath School lessons on Christian
doctrine does not attempt to formulate those doctrines. That duty is done in the
Church Manual presentation of the "Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Advent-
ists." (Much time, before and at the General Conference Session in Dallas, was
devoted to their careful revision.) At home and in Sabbath School we need to explore
beyond the formal statements and to discover both the principles that underlie the
doctrines and those that grow out of our beliefs.
    At one stage in church history it was said that Christians were divided into two
classes—those who did not think at all, and those who did nothing but think. Let us
 form a third class—those who think sensibly about their religion, who know the
scriptural foundations on which faith rests, who are able to give a thoughtful answer
 to every man that asks a reason of the hope that is within us, and who can bring the
 doctrines of the church into practical application in the daily life, declaring with
 confidence, "This We Believe."

             Part 1  As the Lord prepared Israel for entrance into the Promised
        TABERNACLE Land, how did He meet the nation's need for a center to its
        AND TEMPLE religious life?

                       "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
                     them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
                     tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
                     even so shall ye make it" (Ex. 25:8,9).

                        God knew that His wandering people needed a focal point for
                     worship. In the desert a permanent building was neither desir-
                     able nor practicable. A traveling people needed a portable shrine
                     that could be constructed from available materials and be made
                     the center of every campsite. The need was met by the tent, or
                     tabernacle, or sanctuary.
                        We do not here intend to conduct an historical study of the
                     erection of either the temporary or permanent buildings. We
                     would rather note the divine intention in planning their con-
                     struction. This is clearly stated in today's text: "Let them make
                     me a sanctuary; that / may dwell among them." God, as a loving
                     Father as well as an awe-inspiring Deity, ever wants to be per-
                     sonally in the midst of His people. This presents no problem for
                     the Omnipresent One but calls for a localized sense of God for
                     the benefit of His children, who need a specific center where
                     they can meet their Lord, offer their adoration and gifts, obtain
                     pardon and spiritual renewal, and receive His guidance for all
                     aspects of their group and personal lives. The sanctuary, or
                     temple, fills that multiple need and gives them the assurance of
                     God's willingness to dwell in their midst. (See Lev. 26:11, 12.)

                      What did the tabernacle and temples faintly represent?
                     Heb. 9:11, 12, 14. (Compare Heb. 8:1, 2.)

                         "The heavenly temple, the abiding place of the King of kings,
                     where 'thousand thousands minister unto Him, and ten
                     thousand times ten thousand stood before Him,' ... that temple
                     filled with the glory of the eternal throne, where seraphim, its
                     shining guardians, veil their faces in adoration—no earthly
                     structure could represent its vastness and its glory. Yet impor-
                     tant truths concerning the heavenly sanctuary and the great
                     work there carried forward for man's redemption were to be
                     taught by the earthly sanctuary and its services."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, p. 357.

THINK IT THROUGH       When I go to church, do I lift up my spiritual eyes to the true
                     tabernacle and see there my Lord in glory?

    THE PRIEST'S    the tabernacle? For what reasons?

                      "Take unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him,
                    from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto
                    me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
                    Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons" (Ex. 28:1).

                       "By divine direction the tribe of Levi was set apart for the
                    service of the sanctuary. In the earliest times every man was the
                    priest of his own household. In the days of Abraham the priest-
                    hood was regarded as the birthright of the eldest son. Now,
                    instead of the first-born of all Israel, the Lord accepted the tribe
                    of Levi for the work of the sanctuary. By this signal honor He
                    manifested His approval of their fidelity, both in adhering to His
                    service and in executing His judgments when Israel apostatized
                    in the worship of the golden calf. The priesthood, however, was
                    restricted to the family of Aaron. Aaron and his sons alone were
                    permitted to minister before the Lord."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 350.

                      How were Aaron and his sons consecrated to their holy
                    office? Ex. 40:13-15; 29:4-9.

                       Although, as stated above, "in the earliest times every man
                    was the priest of his own household," the spiritual needs of a
                    whole people—whose worship was based upon a sanctuary
                    graced by the presence of the most high God—called for a
                    centralized system. For such service a consecrated priesthood
                    was required. Its members ministered on their people's behalf
                    "in the priest's office." Because of this "everything connected
                    with the apparel and deportment of the priests was to be such as
                    to impress the beholder with a sense of the holiness of God, the
                    sacredness of His worship, and the purity required of those who
                    came into His presence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 351.
                       From its inauguration to its closure, however, the tabernacle
                    system of worship was handicapped by the frailty of its priests.
                    They were as human as the people whom they represented and
                    reflected their apostasy. In the divine economy, therefore, their
                    ministry was an interim measure designed to care for Israel's
                    needs until the sinless, perfect High Priest would appear.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways does the ministry of the Christian church fill
                    the roll that was given to the Levitical priesthood?

Our Great High Priest           LESSON 1                                ❑ Tuesday
                                                                      September 29
             Part 3     What superior alternatives to the wilderness tabernacle
       THE PERFECT    and the Levitical priesthood has God provided for His people?
            PRIEST
                        "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of
                      the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the
                      sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,
                      and not man" (Heb. 8:1, 2).

                         In its earlier chapters the Epistle to the Hebrews has been
                      depicting Christ as "the Apostle and High Priest" of the Chris-
                      tian religion (ch. 3:1). In chapter 8 the writer sums up one aspect
                      of his reasoning by asserting the divine nature of that priest-
                      hood, seeing our Lord seated at God's right hand—a position
                      no human priest could ever occupy. The Saviour is also re-
                      vealed as ministering in "the true tabernacle," that is, thereal or
                      genuine one, the heavenly original after which the earthly one
                      was patterned. (Compare Heb. 8:5 with Ex. 25:40.)

                        For what principal purpose were human high priests or-
                      dained or appointed, and what did this require of Christ? Heb.
                      8:3. (Compare Heb. 5:1-3.)

                          The Levitical priesthood was instituted because of man's sin
                      and was largely occupied with the offering of sacrifices for sin.
                      Christ's priesthood is of a wider nature; for His office is eternal,
                      and He will still be our High Priest even after sin has been
                       destroyed. Yet His redemptive role will never be forgotten, and
                      man's chief reason for gratitude will always be remembrance of
                      the Saviour's double service in sacrificing Himself and in
                      mediating that offering by His priestly ministry.
                          "The Christian world in general is acquainted with Christ as
                      'the Lamb of God' that 'taketh away the sin of the world' (John
                      1:29). It is acquainted with Christ as the crucified One, who gave
                      Himself for us that we might be saved. But not all Christians are
                      acquainted with Christ as the high priest who ministers His
                      blood in the sanctuary above. Yet without that ministry the plan
                      of salvation would be ineffective. In the institution of the Pass-
                      over in Egypt God commanded the Israelites not simply to slay
                      the lamb, but to put its blood on the doorposts. . . . So in the
                      antitype the blood of Christ, our Passover... , is not simply shed,
                      it is ministered for us in heaven above by our great High Priest,
                      as a vital part of God's plan to save us."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                      tary, vol. 7, p. 430.

THINK IT THROUGH        How can I in my daily life show my gratitude for the wonder
                      of God's planning my salvation through the priestly ministry of
                      His Son?

Our Great High Priest       LESSON 1                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                September 30
          Part 4   What was the purpose of the great humiliation that God's
     "LIKE UNTO Son voluntarily accepted in His incarnation? What has it done
            HIS  for you?
     BRETHREN"
                   "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
                 his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
                 priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
                 the sins of the people" (Heb. 2:17).

                     In order to be "a merciful and faithful high priest" and "make
                   reconciliation for the sins of the people," the Eternal One had to
                   be "made in the likeness of men" (Phil. 2:7). We cannot realize
                   what this meant to Him who inhabited eternity, but we should'
                   understand that this was part of the cost of His high priesthood.
                   His humanity, however, will also enable Him to "destroy him
                   that had the power of death, that is, the devil" (Heb. 2:14).
                     Jesus "made known to the angelic host that a way of escape
                   had been made for lost man. He told them that He had been
                   pleading with His Father, and had offered to give His life a
                   ransom, to take the sentence of death upon Himself, that
                   through Him man might find pardon; that through the merits of
                   His blood, and obedience to the law of God, they could have the
                   favor of God, and be brought into the beautiful garden, and eat
                   of the fruit of the tree of life."—Early Writings, p. 149.

                     Which of the High Priest's divine-human qualities bring Him
                   into the most sympathetic touch with His people's daily
                   needs? Heb. 4:15.

                     We cannot measure the comfort that comes from knowing
                   that our High Priest understands all about the temptations that
                   beset us! Still greater is the assurance of knowing that His
                   temptation-conquering power may be ours too!
                     "Those who claim that it was not possible for Christ to sin,
                   cannot believe that He really took upon Himself human nature.
                   But was not Christ actually tempted, not only by Satan in the
                   wilderness, but all through His life, from childhood to man-
                   hood? In all points He was tempted as we are, and because He
                   successfully resisted temptation under every form, He gave man
                   the perfect example, and through the ample provision Christ
                   has made, we may become partakers of the divine nature, hav-
                   ing escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."—

                   929.

THINK IT THROUGH     How different the Christian life would be if the Trinity had not
                   planned for Jesus to take on human form and be subject to
                   such trials as trouble us!

Our Great High Priest          LESSON 1                                0 Thursday
                                                                          October 1

             Part 5   Where has our ascended High Priest gone, and for what
              OUR purpose?
      INTERCESSOR
                      "Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
                    which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to
                    appear in the presence of God for us" (Heb. 9:24).

                        Every thoughtful Christian asks, "What is my Master now
                     doing in heaven?" Our text provides a partial answer to that vital
                     question. He appears, or presents Himself, "in the presence of"
                     (literally, "in the face of") God for us, on our behalf, as our
                     Representative, our Advocate.
                        "Jesus stands in the holy of holies, now to appear in the
                     presence of God for us. There He ceases not to present His
                     people moment by moment, complete in Himself. But because
                     we are thus represented before the Father, we are not to imag-
                     ine that we are to presume upon His mercy, and become care-
                     less, indifferent, and self-indulgent. Christ is not the minister of
                     sin. We are complete in Him, accepted in the Beloved, only as
                     we abide in Him by faith."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                     Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 933.

                        What ministry has engaged the Son since His return to
                      heaven? Heb. 7:25. (Compare Acts 7:55.)

                         This verse reveals the continuing nature of Christ's redemp-
                      tive work. While the cross is at the center of our salvation, our
                      Saviour's priestly ministry as Intercessor is the means by which
                      we benefit from the reconciliation provided between ourselves
                      and God. This does not mean that the Son can do nothing else
                      but present our repentance and pleas for pardon before the
                      Father (that would seem to place limitations on the illimitable)
                      but that our eternal High Priest is ever willing and able to
                      represent us before God. How precious, then, is this part of our
                      Redeemer's work!
                         "The final object of His entrance as high priest and sacrifice
                      into the eternal heaven is there to appear before God for us,
                      presenting on our behalf no exhausted sacrifice, nor one of
                      transient efficacy or needing repetition, but Himself in his own
                      person, as an ever-present, ever-living victim and atonement.
                      And this object is attained at once, and attained for ever."—

                      2, p. 129. (Quoted by M. L. Andreasen, The Book of Hebrews, p.

Our Great High Priest        LESSON 1                                   ❑ Friday
                                                                        October 2
          Part 6    In view of our having the Son of God as our great High Priest,
            THE    what are we exhorted to do?
     BELIEVER'S
      RESPONSE       "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
                   we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need"
                   (Heb. 4:16).

                     The word here rendered "boldly" may also be translated
                   "with confidence." "The throne of grace" refers to the throne
                   where grace is dispensed, that is, God's throne, since He is "the
                   God of all grace" (1 Peter 5:10). There we shall find mercy that
                   pardons our transgressions and grace to help us overcome sin.
                   "As an earthly parent encourages his child to come to hitn at all
                   times, so the Lord encourages us to lay before Him our wants
                   and perplexities, our gratitude and love. Every promise is sure.
                   Jesus is our Surety and Mediator, and has placed at our com-
                   mand every resource, that we may have a perfect character. The
                   blood of Christ in ever-abiding efficacy is our only hope; for
                   through His merits alone we have pardon and peace."—Ellen G.
                   White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1116.

                     How may we realize the spiritual benefits provided by
                   Christ's intercession in the heavenly sanctuary? Heb. 10:19-
                   25.

                      These verses introduce the closing practical counsels in the
                   Epistle to the Hebrews. Unless these are heeded and practiced,
                   our study of Christ's priesthood brings only a mental satisfac-
                   tion which may be lifeless and even deceptive. Four prerequi-
                   sites prepare us for entering "into the holiest": (1) a true or
                   sincere heart; (2) a full faith in Christ's atoning sacrifice; (3) a
                   penitent's clear conscience; (4) a symbolic cleansing from sin in
                   baptism (verse 22). These in turn enable us to (1) hold fast our
                   hope (rather than "faith"); (2) stimulate our fellows in Christian
                   service; (3) be faithful in communal worship; (4) encourage
                   fellow members to steadfastness, in view of the second coming
                   (verses 23-25).
                      Here we have a divinely endorsed recipe for healthy church
                   life. We suggest that we consider each suggestion in our per-
                   sonal study of this lesson at horne and then discuss each point
                   of apostolic counsel in our Sabbath School class. Such an
                   exercise may well improve the spiritual health of the church
                   where we worship. The strength of the church lies in its attend-
                   ing membership.

      SUBJECT TO    human beings? What blessings were they designed to bring?
       JUDGMENT
                      "God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
                    multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
                    dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
                    and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth" (Gen.
                    1:28).

                       When God created our first parents, He also blessed them
                    with everything they would need to enjoy the world that lay
                    before them. At the same time He required certain things of
                    them. In fact, the duties grew out of God's gifts. They were to
                    populate the earth; they were to govern it and its creatures. They
                    were thus called to give account of their stewardship of the
                    unmarred creation. They were answerable to the Creator for the
                    fulfillment of what He asked. In other words, they were subject
                    to judgment from the beginning.
                       "God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition of
                    his very existence.... God might have created man without the
                    power to transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand of
                    Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case he
                    would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere automaton.
                    . . There could have been no development of character"—
                    Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 49.

                       When Eve and then Adam disregarded the Creator's direc-
                    tives, what judgments came upon them? Gen. 3:16-19.

                       "It was not the will of God that the sinless pair should know
                    aught of evil. He had freely given them the good, and had
                    withheld the evil. But, contrary to His command, they had eaten
                    of the forbidden tree, and now they would continue to eat of
                    it—they would have the knowledge of evil—all the days of their
                    life. From that time the race would be afflicted by Satan's
                    temptations."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 59.
                       We should not suppose that all the promised wages of sin
                    were received immediately. They were paid gradually as the
                    human frame weakened as a result of wrongdoing and as nature
                    herself was affected by man's and woman's departure from the
                    Creator's perfect standard. But the most grievious result of
                    sin—being sent out of Paradise—followed fast upon the heels
                    of transgression. Sin, when it is finished, always brings death
                    (James 1:15).

Judgment and the Judge           LESSON 2                             ❑ Monday
                                                                      October 5
          Part 2    As the preacher concludes his sayings (in Ecclesiastes),
        GOD AND    what emphatic counsel does he give his readers?
      JUDGMENT
                     "Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the
                   whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judg-
                   ment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it
                   be evil" (Eccl. 12:13, 14).

                      Because God brings everything we do into judgment, the
                   writer urges us to "fear God, and keep his commandments."
                   This well summarizes Old Testament theology on conduct in
                   relation to judgment, not that we shall survive judgment on the
                   strength of our commandment keeping (this would be salvation
                   by works), but only through the merits of Jesus. On the other
                   hand, our reward in the judgment will be related to the delight
                   we have shown in doing God's will and upholding His stan-
                   dards. This teaching is related to Christ's own words, "If ye love
                   me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).
                      "God discerns the purposes of man and all his works. Every
                   man will be rewarded according as his works have been,
                   whether good or evil."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 300, 301.

                     With what attitude does the God-fearer look toward the
                   Lord's coming in judgment? Ps. 98:9.

                     The Lord "cometh to judge the earth." This prospect can
                   bring fear or joy, depending on the spiritual condition of the
                   beholder. The born-again Christian can warmly welcome the
                   appearance of the Judge, crying, "This is the Lord; we have
                   waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (Isa.
                   25:9). At the other end of the scale, he who has rejected Christ
                   will have rejected his Advocate and will face the prospect of
                   judgment with shame and fear, knowing his own guilt and
                   defenselessness.
                                    "Thou Judge of quick and dead,
                                    Before whose bar severe,
                                    With holy joy or guilty dread,
                                    We all shall soon appear—
                                    Our erring souls prepare
                                    For that tremendous day,
                                    And fill us now with watchful care,
                                    And stir us up to pray."

      JUDGMENT      under the Mosaic law?
       ON EARTH
                      "If a soul sin, ... he shall bring his trespass offering unto the
                    Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock.... And the priest
                    shall make an atonement for him before the Lord" (Lev. 6:2-7).

                       "The most important part of the daily ministration was the
                    service performed in behalf of individuals. The repentant sinner
                    brought his offering to the door of the tabernacle, and, placing
                    his hand upon the victim's head, confessed his sins, thus in
                    figure transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice.
                    By his own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was
                    carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the
                    veil, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner
                    had transgressed. . . .
                       "The sins of Israel being thus transferred to the sanctuary, the
                    holy places were defiled, and a special work became necessary
                    for the removal of the sins."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 354,
                    355.

                      What annual purification was then ordained for the
                    sanctuary and for Israel? Lev. 16:16.

                      On the tenth day of the seventh month (September-October)
                    each year, the high priest fulfilled the rituals for the cleansing of
                    the sanctuary which represented full atonement for the con-
                    fessed sins of Israel on that annual Day of Atonement.

                      What wider significance do these Levitical ceremonies
                    have in the plan of salvation? Heb. 9:22-26.

                      Few, if any, have difficulty in seeing the offering of animals as
                    a type of "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                    world." Sound biblical study invites us to take the further step of
                    accepting that the typical Day of Atonement must also have its
                    antitype. This would be in an event that will once and for all not
                    only pardon sin but remove all condemnatory records from
                    against the names of those who have chosen Christ as their
                    Substitute and Advocate. This calls for an act of examination or
                    judgment of those who have engaged Christ as their Advocate.
                    "As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the
                    close of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of
                    men is completed there is a work of atonement for the removal
                    of sin from the sanctuary."—The Great Controversy, p. 421.

THINK IT THROUGH      How thoroughly have we learned that without the shedding
                    of blood there is no remission of sins—our sins?

Judgment and the Judge           LESSON 2                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       October 7
          Part 4  Which Old Testament prophecy, related to the antitypical
      JUDGMENT day of atonement, deals with prophetic time? Is there any
      IN HEAVEN other prophecy like it?

                     "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
                   sanctuary be cleansed" (Dan. 8:14).

                      This verse, in isolation, does not provide its own interpreta-
                   tion. It needs to be considered in the context of Daniel's other
                   prophecies, especially those in chapters 7 through 9. These
                   take us through the remaining Old Testament years into the
                   Christian era and into God's eternal kingdom. The earthly
                   sanctuary was destroyed in A.D. 70; its services had been re-
                   placed by Christ's heavenly ministry in "the true tabernacle,
                   which the Lord pitched, and not man" (Heb. 8:2). Since the
                   cleansing of the sanctuary takes place at the end of the 2300
                   prophetic days or literal years, the event can only refer to the
                   cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven.

                    In what sense can the heavenly sanctuary be cleansed?
                   Heb. 9:23. (Note the translation in the New English Bible.)

                      "As anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon
                   the sin offering and through its blood transferred, in figure, to
                   the earthly sanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the
                   repentant are by faith placed upon Christ and transferred, in
                   fact, to the heavenly sanctuary. And as the typical cleansing of
                   the earthly was accomplished by the removal of the sins by
                   which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing of the
                   heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out,
                   of the sins which are there recorded. But before this can be
                   accomplished, there must be an examination of the books of
                   record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in
                   Christ, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleans-
                   ing of the sanctuary therefore involves a work of investigation—
                   a work of judgment."—The Great Controversy, pp. 421, 422.
                   (Emphasis supplied.)
                      A detailed study of the chronological aspects of Daniel 7
                   through 9 points to 457 B.C. as the beginning date for the
                   measurement of the 2300 days, or years, with A.D. 1844 as the
                   time when our Lord entered on the cleansing, or judicial, phase
                   of His high-priestly ministry. The present-day significance of
                   that date will appear more fully in next week's lesson. For now,
                   we should realize that the ever-nearer arrival of the second
                   advent brings nearer our own personal appearance before the
                   judgment seat of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why does Christ's daily intercession for repentant sinners
                   need a judgment-type ministry for its completion?

Judgment and the Judge           LESSON 2                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                       October 8
          Part 5     In God's plans, how prominent a place has been assigned to
 NEW TESTAMENT     a time for judgment?
  AND JUDGMENT
                     "God ... now commandeth all men every where to repent:
                   because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge
                   the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath or-
                   dained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that
                   he hath raised him from the dead" (Acts 17:30, 31).

                      In his address to the Athenians, Paul urged his listeners to
                   repent because of the certainty of judgment. He knew that God,
                   in His infallible foreknowledge, had already fixed a day when His
                   Son would judge all men. This, says Paul, was called for by
                   Christ's resurrection. Room must therefore be found in the
                   prophetic calendar for the Saviour's judging both the living and
                   the dead. (Compare Christ's own declaration in John 5:22 and
                   Peter's teaching in Acts 10:42.)

                    When, in the human life-span, does the judgment occur?
                   Heb. 9:27, 28.

                      Generally, judgment cannot be pronounced until a man's
                   earthly life is completed, which is normally at death. After this,
                   his record can be justly weighed, as it will be in the investigative
                   judgment. For those who are alive at Christ's coming, death will
                   not be necessary, for all who claim pardon by faith in Christ's
                   sacrifice will already have been judged by having their sins
                   forgiven and their lives cleansed (1 John 1:9). When the Saviour
                   appears the second time, then it will be "without sin," or, in a
                   better translation, "apart from sin." When He first came, it was
                   to "save his people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21); at the second
                   coming, His objective will be to receive the redeemed unto
                   Himself (John 14:3).
                     "The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out
                   of sins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the
                   Lord. Since the dead are to be judged out of the things written in
                   the books, it is impossible that the sins of men should be blotted
                   out until after the judgment at which their cases are to be
                   investigated.... When the investigative judgment closes, Christ
                   will come, and His reward will be with Him to give to every man
                   as his work shall be."—The Great Controversy, p. 485.

THINK IT THROUGH     Now is the time to ensure a satisfactory verdict when our
                   cases come before the Righteous Judge.

                     "This is a time when every man in a responsible position, and
                   every member of the church, should bring every feature of his
                   work into close accord with the teachings of the word of
                   God."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 185.

Judgment and the Judge           LESSON 2                               ❑ Friday
                                                                        October 9
         .Part 6   What plan does God have to ensure our freedom from con-
    PREPARATION demnation at the time of judgment?
  FOR JUDGMENT
                   "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
                 not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
                 Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1).

                      The apostle provides two phases of the answer to our ques-
                   tion. (1) Refrain from sinning. This is the ideal, the objective of
                   the plan of salvation. However, since all'of us have sinned (and
                   have inherently sinful natures that taint our obedience—see
                   Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 344), that advice gives us excellent
                   counsel but does not save us from condemnation. (2) We must
                   engage the services of our Mediator—He who longs to plead
                   our cause. We all need Jesus Christ the Righteous to speak on
                   our behalf, but we must retain Him as our defense lawyer now,
                   for it will be too late when the final judgment is set and the books
                   are opened.
                      "Our crucified Lord is pleading for us in the presence of the
                   Father at thethrone of grace. His atoning sacrifice we may plead
                   for our pardon, our justification, and our sanctification. The
                   Lamb slain is our only hope. Our faith looks up to Him, grasps
                   Him as the One who can save to the uttermost, and the fra-
                   grance of the all-sufficient offering is accepted of the Father....
                   He is our sympathizing Saviour."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 948.

                    On what basis may we face with confidence the prospect of
                   Christ's coming and the thought of judgment? 1 John 2:28.

                      Only those who "abide in him" here below will be ready to
                   abide with Christ above when He returns to gather His elect
                   from one end of heaven to the other. "Abiding in Christ means a
                   constant receiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender to
                   His service.... As the vine branch constantly draws sap from the
                   living vine, so are we to cling to Jesus, and receive from Him by
                   faith the strength and perfection of His own character."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 676. Thus we shall have confidence—not a
                   brazen presumption, but a conviction of Christ's faithful, effec-
                   tive advocacy on our behalf, a knowledge that He is able "to
                   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him" (Heb.
                   7:25). Then we shall not be ashamed before Him.

THINK IT THROUGH      "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
                   law of liberty" (James 2:12). How shall we apply this admoni-
                   tion to our own lives?

        AND THE
         GOSPEL    "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
                 everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
                 earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
                 people" (Rev. 14:6).

                       Study of the book of Revelation quickly reveals that its survey
                    of history does not follow a straight line in time, but moves
                    forward and backward as the shifting scenes pass beforeJohn's
                    eyes. An illustration of this occurs in chapters 13 and 14, where
                    the prophet records a normal historical sequence in chapter 13,
                    then gives a glimpse into a later scene in chapter 14:1-5, and in
                    14:6 resumes the chronological recital from chapter 13:18.
                    Recognition of the interruption enables us to see the connec-
                    tion between 13:18 and 14:6 and the three messengers of 14:6-
                   12 fulfilling their duties in the last days prior to the Lord's return
                   (14:14-20).
                       John sees an angel fly in the midst of heaven (ensuring prom-
                    inence), to preach eternally good news to all peoples. Since
                   angels are not given the task of preaching, the angel must
                   symbolize the Christians who bear that responsibility. Their
                   message is given them—an everlasting gospel. The only au-
                   thentic and efficacious gospel ever published, this good news
                   born in times eternal in the heart of our loving God was pro-
                   claimed first in Eden (Gen. 3:15), typified in the sacrificial ser-
                   vices in the tabernacle, and realized in the ministry of our Lord.
                   This is the news that fallen man has always needed—and needs
                   even more urgently today. Those who have received it are here
                   commissioned in the last days to share it with their fellow
                   human beings of all races in all nations.
                       "The first angel's message of Revelation 14, announcing the
                   hour of God's judgment and calling upon men to fear and
                   worship Him, was designed to separate the professed people of
                   God from the corrupting influences of the world and to arouse
                   them to see their true condition of worldliness and backsliding.
                   In this message, God had sent to the church a warning, which,
                   had it been accepted, would have corrected the evils that were
                   shutting them away from Him. Had they received the message
                   from heaven, humbling their hearts before the Lord and seeking
                   in sincerity a preparation to stand in His presence, the Spirit and
                   power of God would have been manifested among them."—The

           Part 2     "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;
         CALL TO    for the hour of his judgment is come" (Rev. 14:7).
        WORSHIP
                        This proclamation was not given in a corner but "in the midst
                    of heaven," to all peoples, and "with a loud voice." The Lord
                    intended the message to make a powerful impact on the entire
                    human race.
                        The core of the message is the same as has ever been at the
                    heart of the gospel: "Fear God, and give glory to him." (Com-
                    pare Ex. 20:3-6; Deut. 6:4, 5; Eccl. 12:13; Micah 6:8; Matt. 4:10;
                    22:36-38; John 14:15; 17:3.) The world's ills stem from man's
                    slowness and refusal to fear or reverence God, from man's
                    continual self-centeredness that leads him to cry, "Glory to Man
                    in the Highest! for Man is the master of things."—A. C. Swin-
                    burne, "Hymn of Man," quoted in Oxford Book of Quotations.
                    The first angel calls on mankind to repudiate such egotism and
                     to give the Lord God His rightful place in every department of
                    life.
                        The unique urgency of the message resides in an historical
                    fact—"the hour of his judgment is come." From Eden onward,
                    God's judgment has always operated (see last week's lesson),
                    but it has hitherto been of an interim nature, awaiting a final
                    reckoning. Now history has caught up with the divine time-
                    table—the hour of God's judgment has come; it has arrived.
                        The authority in the first message grows out of the fulfillment
                     of prophecy concerning judgment, specifically Daniel 8:14,
                    which pinpoints A.D. 1844 as "the hour" or the time when the
                     investigative judgment began in the heavenly sanctuary. This
                     places a great spiritual responsibility on that body of
                    Christians—Seventh-day Adventists—who understand and
                     proclaim this message.
                        "In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in
                     the world as watchmen and light bearers.... They have been
                     given a work of the most solemn import—the proclamation of
                     the first, second, and third angels' messages.. ..
                        "It is not only by preaching the truth, not only by distributing

                                                                         October 13

           Part 3     What is the distinctive attribute of the God, whom the first
     WORSHIP THE    angel's message calls upon men to worship?
        CREATOR
                      "Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
                    and the fountains of waters" (Rev. 14:7).

                       It is singularly fitting that the first angel's call to worship
                    should define God as He who created all things. The proclama-
                    tion, "the hour of his judgment is come," began to be preached
                    about 1840, which was a little before the time when creationism
                    and evolution would begin to be examined more intensively
                    than ever before. Interest quickened within the next two de-
                    cades and received a dramatic stimulus in 1859 from the publi-
                    cation of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species. Any Christian
                    movement, therefore, that stressed creationism and called men
                    to worship God as Creator of the world in six literal days and to
                    observe the seventh-day Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of
                    that fiat Creation—any such movement was peculiarly "on
                    target" for the mid-nineteenth century.
                       Let us not forget, however, that the call is for worship. This
                    requires that we fear God and give glory to Him, acknowledging
                    His primacy, giving Him our adoration, our respect, our obedi-
                    ence, our service, our trust, our love. In this way we bring glory
                    to Him in the eyes of the watching universe. Only then are we
                    fulfilling the third angel's message.
                       "To give glory to God is to reveal His character in our own,
                    and thus make Him known. And in whatever way we make
                    known the Father or the Son, we glorify God."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 979.
                       "The worship of God is in contrast with the worship of the
                    beast (ch. 13:8, 12) and that of its image (v. 15). In the crisis soon
                    to come, the inhabitants of the earth will be called upon to make
                    their choice. . . . The message of the first angel is designed to
                    prepare men to make the proper choice and to stand firm in the
                    time of crisis."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 828.
                       From these observations we get a glimpse of the comprehen-
                    siveness of this first message. It is universal; it rings the age-old,
                    ever-needed call to the worship of our Creator God. It does this
                    in the urgent setting of the judgment, against which there can
                    be no appeal; and—very significant to each student of this
                    lesson—it is sounded by men and women who themselves must
                    practice what they preach to every nation, kindred, tongue, and
                    people.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can our manner of worship, and particularly of Sabbath
                    observance, bring glory to God?

                                                                   October 14
           Part 4
      COME OUT        "There followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
     OF BABYLON     fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of
                    the wine of the wrath of her fornication" (Rev. 14:8).

                        Manuscript evidence favors the inclusion of "a second" after
                    "another angel," thus completing the numbering of the angelic
                    trio. But while the angels are shown as following one another,
                    there is nothing to suggest that the second and third displace
                    the first, or the third the second. When the third appears, the
                    other two messages continue to be preached simultaneously.
                        "The term 'Babylon' is derived from 'Babel,' and signifies
                    confusion. It is employed in Scripture to designate various
                    forms of false or apostate religion. In Revelation 17 Babylon is
                    represented as a woman—a figure which is used in the Bible as
                    the symbol of a church, a virtuous woman representing a pure
                    church, a vile woman an apostate church.
                        "In the Bible the sacred and enduring character of the rela-
                    tion that exists between Christ and His church is represented by
                    the union of marriage. . . .
                        "The unfaithfulness of the church to Christ in permitting her
                    confidence and affection to be turned from Him, and allowing
                    the love of worldly things to occupy the soul, is likened to the
                    violation of the marriage vow... .
                        "The message of Revelation 14, announcing the fall of Baby-
                    lon must apply to religious bodies that were once pure and have
                    become corrupt. Since this message follows the warning of
                    judgment, it must be given in the last days; therefore it cannot
                    refer to the'Roman Church alone, for that church has been in a
                    fallen condition for many centuries. Furthermore, in the
                    eighteenth chapter of the Revelation the people of God are
                    called upon to come out of Babylon. According to this scripture,
                    many of God's people must still be in Babylon. And in what
                    religious bodies are the greater part of the followers of Christ
                    now to be found? Without doubt, in the various churches pro-
                    fessing the Protestant faith. At the time of their rise these
                     churches took a noble stand •for God and the truth, and His
                     blessing was with them. . . . But they fell by the same desire
                     which was the curse and ruin of Israel—the desire of imitating
                     the practices and courting the friendship of the ungodly."—The
                    Great Controversy, pp. 381, 383.
                        While proclaiming the message, let us never forget Revela-
                     tion 18:4—God sees His people in Babylon! Find them!

                                                                     October 15

          Part 5     What is the terrible burden published by the third heaven-
      BEWARE OF    sent messenger?
       APOSTASY
                     "The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
                   any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
                   mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the
                   wine of the wrath of God" (Rev. 14:9, 10). (See also verse 11.)

                      The content of these three verses is concentrated, calling for
                   our close attention.
                      1. "The third angel followed [or accompanied] them." This
                   mention of the third may suggest the unity of the three, may
                    confirm the numbering of the first and second angels, and may
                   gather the three in a group distinct from the many other mes-
                   sengers seen by the revelator. This may also suggest that the
                   proclamation of the first two messages continues while the
                   third is preached.
                      2. The opening words of the message—worship, beast, im-
                   age, mark—firmly link it with the events foretold in chapter
                   13:11-18. Indeed, the third message cannot be understood
                   apart from chapter 13.
                      3. Note the sin against which the message warns: it is trans-
                   gression against the first commandment (Ex. 20:3)—God alone
                   is to be worshiped.
                      4. "His mark." "To receive this mark means to come to the
                   same decision as the beast has done, and to advocate the same
                   ideas, in direct opposition to the Word of God.
                      "If the light of the truth has been presented to you, ... and yet
                   you still cling to the false sabbath, refusing to keep holy the
                   Sabbath which God calls 'My holy day,' you receive the mark of
                   the beast."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                   tary, vol. 7, pp. 979, 980.
                      5. Babylon has made all nations drink of her wine. Those who
                   deliberately choose false worship will drink God's wine, His
                   judgment.
                      6. The judgment. This does not involve eternal torment. The
                   reference might be to the plagues which bring death (chapters
                   15, 16) and to the second death (chapter 20:12-15).
                      7. Study of the fearful nature of divine judgment on false
                   worship should call out compassion and missionary action on
                   the part of God's people. Let us not be self-satisfied, for that
                   would be unpardonably pharisaical and make us eligible for the
                   same torment that comes to those who worship the beast and
                   his image.

THINK IT THROUGH     Amid the power and the glory that shine throughout the
                   Revelation, there is also the horror of the wages of sin. How
                   real to us are these extreme opposites? In which direction are
                   we moving—toward God or His enemies?

ReC.all to Worship     LESSON 3                                           ❑ Friday •
                                                                       October 16
         Part 6   What fruitage comes from the proclamation of the three
          TRUE angels' messages?
    WORSHIPERS
                  "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
                the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev.
                14:12).

                      Verses 6 to 12 are a unit of prophecy and require unified
                   interpretation. Since no results are recorded from the giving of
                   the first and second messages, the declaration in verse 12
                   summarizes the fruitage borne of the threefold witness. That
                   summary deserves close study.
                      Saints. Three verses (9-11) have just been devoted to the
                   judgment that falls on those who worship the beast and his
                   image. The reference to "saints" shows that while such apos-
                   tasy is worldwide, it will not be total.
                      Patience. Faithful Christians will need all the patience, for-
                   titude, and steadfastness that heaven can furnish them as they
                   resist apostate forces and false teachings. The phrase "here is"
                   shows that there will be a body of patient, faithful believers, who
                   are identified in chapter 12:17 as "the remnant."
                      Keep the commandments of God. This is a further clue to the
                   identity of the faithful—they are obedient, and they heed God's
                   law, in contrast to those who obey the beast and his image. This
                   faithfulness to the law of the Lord, especially in respect to
                   Sabbath observance, will distinguish the faithful from those
                   who transgress that law.
                      The faith of Jesus. Or, faith in Jesus. If the first rendering is
                   preferred, then the saints are to hold the same faith that sus-
                   tained Jesus; if the second translation is taken, then the refer-
                   ence is to the saints' faith in Jesus and His merits. (NIV has
                   "faithful to Jesus.")
                      "In Revelation 14 John beholds another scene. He sees a
                   people whose fidelity and loyalty to the laws of. God's kingdom
                   grow with the emergency. The contempt placed upon the law of
                   God only makes them reveal more decidedly their love for that
                   law."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 7, p. 981.
                      These messages are addressed not only to those who have
                   not yet made their decisions, but to us who claim to be com-
                   mandment keepers. They should provide us with the standard
                   by which to assess our fitness for inclusion among "the saints."

THINK IT THROUGH     How may we know if God includes us among the faithful
                   remnant?

              Part 1    In addition to announcing Christ's birth, what assurance did
       THE KINGDOM     Gabriel give Mary concerning her Son?
         IS COMING
                         "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the High-
                       est: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his
                       father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for
                       ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:32,
                       33).

                          With what joy did Gabriel make that announcement! He and
                       his myriads of winged companions had mourned the loss of our
                       world's loyalty for 4000 years. Now their Commander was about
                       to take human form that He might regain "the first dominion"
                       (Micah 4:8), might reign from the throne of David, and might
                       rule over an everlasting kingdom. The first step in fulfilling this
                       bold program was about to be taken—the Eternal would tie
                       Himself to time as a babe, who would live to overthrow the
                       enemy and reestablish God's rule over the whole earth. The
                       beneficent ministry, the death, burial, resurrection, and ascen-
                       sion were further vital steps in the fulfillment of the proclaimed
                       plan, but not yet has David's greatest Son regained "the throne
                       of his father David." While Christ has ever remained a King
                       (witness the Magi's gifts in Bethlehem), He still has to return to
                       rule as King over our world. Therein lies the need for His second
                       advent—to complete the work begun here as a man.

                         What simple but encouraging promise did the Lord give His
                       true followers? Matt. 5:5.

                         This promise, too, calls for our Lord's return. At present "the
                       meek" are the last to inherit even a minute portion of the earth;
                       their little is taken from them—even life itself—by the proud.
                       This state of society will get worse and worse until halted by the
                       dramatic change in world government that Christ's return will
                       bring. This is why He will come again.
                         "The meek 'shall inherit the earth.' It was through the desire
                       of self-exaltation that sin entered into the world, and our first
                       parents lost the dominion over this fair earth, their kingdom. It is
                       through self-abnegation [putting self aside] that Christ redeems
                       what was lost. And He says we are to overcome as He did."—

                       revolution that will accompany its Founder's return?

The King Is Coming        LESSON 4                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                       October 19
          Part 2     "He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
   SATISFACTION    by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for
       ASSURED     he shall bear their iniquities" (Isa. 53:11).

                      After recounting the suffering that would come to the Man of
                   Sorrows as He bore the sins of the world, the prophet foretells
                   that the Suffering Servant "will be satisfied." By bearing "their
                   iniquities," the Redeemer will "justify man," or "make the many
                   righteous." This is an assurance that the Son of man will not
                   have suffered in vain. "The travail of his soul" will give birth to a
                   multitude of redeemed ones that no man can number, and these
                   will be the subjects of His kingdom.
                      It is enlightening to note that this verse contains one of the
                   few phrases where the Dead Sea Scrolls' version of Isaiah gives
                   a different reading from the traditional Hebrew text. As a result,
                   we may literally read, "After the labour of his soul he shall see
                   the light of life; he shall be satisfied." (See also NIV.)
                      Our Lord cannot be completely satisfied, however, until those
                   He has saved from sin are able to enjoy eternal life. This is only
                   possible at the last day, at His own coming in glory. (See John
                   5:25, 29; 6:40.)

                     What royal scene did the Spirit of Christ, operating in Daniel,
                   reveal to the prophet? Dan. 7:13, 14, 27.

                     This foreview, based on divine foreknowledge and well
                   known to our Lord through His own study of the Scriptures,
                   called for more than His earthly life could ever provide. When He
                   ascended to His Father's court, He expected to return in regal
                   majesty to complete all that had been foretold concerning His
                   kingdom. This calls for His judgment ministry (that would clear
                   His government), for His acceptance of the everlasting domin-
                   ion, and, ultimately, for His triumphant royal return. (Compare
                   The Great Controversy, pp. 479, 480.) Already, then, it may be
                   truly said, He has seen the travail of His soul, and He is satisfied
                   (see lsa. 53:11)—the investigative judgment declaring that the
                   cross was not in vain. He who had appeared to Daniel must
                   Himself have been sustained during His days on earth by His
                   study of Daniel's book. How deep must be His interest as its
                   prophecies approach their complete fulfillment.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can I ensure that my life's records, reviewed during the
                   judgment, will bring Christ the satisfaction He has long
                   awaited?

             Part 3   With what expectation did Jesus face separation from His
        PROMISE OF disciples?
           RETURN
                      "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
                    also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were
                    not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
                    And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
                    receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
                    also" (John 14:1-3).

                        Although Christ's concern for His followers held first place in
                     His thoughts, His own heart must have been heavy at the
                     thought of leaving those with whom He had shared three years
                     that turned the tide of human history. Yet He faced the parting in
                     the knowledge of reunion, and He wanted the eleven to share
                     that same expectation. He therefore reminded them of the basic
                     position of their faith and appealed to their personal knowledge
                     of Himself. You are believers in God; believe similarly in Me. I am
                     only going away from you that I might come back and be with
                     you, and you with Me, forever.
                       "The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of what the
                     disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation.... While He
                     was building mansions for them, they were to build characters
                     after the divine similitude."—The Desire of Ages, p. 663.

                       Under what circumstances did angels confirm the assur-
                     ance of their Master's return? Acts 1:9-11.

                       "The same Jesus who had walked and talked and prayed with
                     them; who had broken bread with them; who had been with
                     them in their boats on the lake; and who had that very day toiled
                     with them up the ascent of Olivet,—the same Jesus had now
                     gone to share His Father's throne. And the angels had assured
                     them that the very One whom they had seen go up into heaven,
                     would come again even as He had ascended."—The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 832.
                       While the angels did not specifically promise the disciples
                     that they would see their Lord return in the clouds during their
                     own lifetime, the announcement held out that eventual pros-
                     pect to the group of early Christians who had just seen their
                     beloved Jesus carried away from their straining eyes.

                                                                      October 21
          Part 4     What questions concerning the future did the Master's
       SIGNS OF    teaching arouse in the minds of His disciples?
      RETURN—I
                     "As he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
                   unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
                   be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
                   the world?" (Matt. 24:3).

                      The last crowded week of our Lord's peculiarly human minis-
                   try had already begun. It would be followed by 40 days of ap-
                   pearances after his resurrection. Sunday morning, on His way
                   up the steep road from Jericho, He had ridden, humbly but
                   triumphantly, into the capital, then withdrawn down the same
                   road to the peace of Bethany. On Monday He cleared the temple
                   of its blasphemous commerce and entered on an intensive
                   threefold teaching program—addressed to the general
                   populace, to the rulers, and lastly to the disciples (Matt. 20:29 to
                   23:39). His sorrow over the destruction about to strike
                   Jerusalem (Matt. 24:1, 2) prompted the Twelve to pose the
                   threefold question, "When will these events occur? What sign
                   will forewarn us of Your coming? How shall we know when to
                   expect the end of the world?"

                     What was the Master's immediate response to His follow-
                   ers' inquiries? Matt. 24:4-8.

                      Jesus does not avoid the questions posed by His disciples.
                   But because they could not grasp what would occur even in the
                   week that lay ahead, because they could not understand the
                   centuries that would pass before their Lord would return, and
                   because, had they known, they would not have been able to
                   bear the revelations—for such reasons Jesus mercifully min-
                   gled the immediate with the distant. (See The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 25.) He referred to some signs that would be true of
                   both times. Warnings concerning the destruction of the temple
                   and the city, of political chaos, devastating wars, and natural
                   disasters, merged with signs that particularly applied to His own
                   return, or parousia. However, the primary application of the
                   phrase "the end is not yet" (Matt. 24:6) is seen as a warning to
                   the disciples in A.D. 31 not to expect an immediate destruction
                   of Jerusalem. That catastrophe did not occur until A.D. 70,
                   nearly 40 years later, by which time some of His listeners were
                    dead!

THINK IT THROUGH     Compared with the Twelve, how perceptive are we concern-
                   ing the signs of our times?

                                                                       October 22
           Part 5     To which prominent milestones on the road to His return did
        SIGNS OF    the Saviour draw the believers' attention?
      RETURN—II
                      "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
                    sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and
                    the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the
                    heavens shall be shaken" (Matt. 24:29).

                       Some sections of our Lord's prophecy (Matthew 24 and paral-
                    lels) may be applied to first-century conditions and events and
                    also to the time just before His second advent—as we have
                    already observed in Matthew 24:6 (Mark 13:7)—"the end is not
                    yet." The same may be said of Matthew 24:21 (Mark 13:19)—"for
                    then shall be great tribulation."
                       No double interpretation is possible, however, for today's
                    text, though prophecy drastically foreshortens its time ele-
                    ments. The physical signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars,
                    occurring in 1780 and 1833, are clearly linked to the coming of
                    the Son of man (Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:24-26). But they were
                    guideposts; and no sensible traveler spends much time looking
                    backward—he forges ahead. Furthermore, the lapse of one and
                    a half centuries since 1833 should warn us not to measure
                    prophecy's view of time by human reckoning.

                      What other signs of Christ's approaching return does Luke
                    record, in addition to those in the heavens? Luke 21:25, 26.

                      If Christians had given more heed to the earlier physical signs,
                    they might feel less fear in face of "the distress of nations, with

                      "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
                    the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives,
                    they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered

                    (Luke 17:26, 27). (Read also verses 28-30.)

                    ing; . . . Their sin consisted in taking these gifts without
                    gratitude to the Giver. . . . It was lawful for them to marry.
                    Marriage was in God's order; ... but ... marriage was perverted
                    and made to minister to passion.
                       "A similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful
                    in itself is carried to excess."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 101.

                    last-day generation? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

                       This is a fearful list of moral breakdown. It has applied to most
                    generations throughout history, but it is applicable to our gen-
                    eration more than to any other. Worse still, it applies to those
                    who have "a form of godliness," that is, to professing Chris-
                    tians, to church members, and, in some degree at least, to
                    ourselves. We can be a sign of the last days, either by being
                    justly included in Paul's sad list or by rising out of that class and
                    being numbered among them "that keep the commandments of
                    God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12).

                      What is the key to passing safely through the moral perils of
                    the last days? Luke 21:34-36.

                      We have responsibilities for our own spiritual survival. We
                    must "take heed" unto ourselves. We must reject customs that
                    debauch millions of our fellow human beings. Christian re-
                    straint in eating and drinking and a trustful, watchful way of
                    meeting life's demands will enable us to escape the snares that
                    entrap so many in our time.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Which of the sins listed by Paul beset me the most? Am I
                    seeking daily grace from Christ to overcome them?

            Part 1  How did Jesus reveal His recognition of the human desire to
          WHEN?—I know the time when His prophecies will be fulfilled?

                       "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
                     tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
                     So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it
                     is near, even at the doors" (Matt. 24:32, 33).

                        The disciples' question, "When shall these things be?" (Matt.
                     24:3) led to Christ's prophecies concerning the destruction of
                     Jerusalem and the end of the world. He first wanted to prepare
                     the Twelve for the national tragedy that loomed ahead (A.D. 70).
                     He then wanted to prepare the church for the griefs and joys that
                     would be associated with His second coming. He therefore told
                     of the signs recorded in Matthew 24:29 and described some of
                     the events that would accompany the return (verses 30, 31).
                     Infinite wisdom limited Christ in knowing or giving a date for the
                     advent. It well knew also-what human nature would do if a day
                     were fixed for His appearing. But Christ did reveal enough to
                     alert the believer to the nearness of that glad event. (See Matt.
                     24:36.)
                       The double thread of meaning that runs throughout Matthew
                     24 and its parallels (Mark 13 and Luke 21) appears also in our
                     text for today. The Greek of Matthew 24:33 permits translation
                     either as "it is near" or as "he is near." The first could refer to
                     A.D. 70 or to the advent, while the second would be a distinct
                     reference to Christ's own return. The general context, many
                     modern translations, and The Desire of Ages, page 632, favor
                     the second translation.

                       What solemn assurance of fulfillment did Jesus give con-
                     cerning the signs? Matt. 24:34, 35.

                        Verse 34 has given rise to many time forecasts concerning the
                     end. Yet it is clear from Christ's subsequent words in verse 36
                     that He never intended His followers to assume that He was
                     suggesting a date for His return. Some take the phrase "this
                     generation shall not pass" to mean that all the Lord's predic-
                     tions will have been fulfilled when the life cycle of the last
                     generation is interrupted by the advent itself. This application is
                     seen to be confirmed by the emphatic declaration in verse 35.

THINK IT THROUGH       How clear is our conviction that Christ's coming is near,
                     even at the doors? How do we proclaim that conviction?

      WHEN?—II knowing either the day or the hour—that is the date—of
               Christ's second coming?

                     "Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
                   heaven, but my Father only" (Matt. 24:36).

                      Speaking in A.D. 31, the Lord could only deal in general terms
                   with the time of His second advent. Neither the Twelve nor the
                   multitudes who would come into the church after them were
                   capable of facing with spiritual calmness the passage of two
                   millenniums. Therefore the wise and merciful Father withheld
                   time knowledge from them. Yet disciples of all ages have longed
                   to have a date for their Master's return. To all of them, the Lord's
                   answer is final, "Of that day and hour knoweth no man." The
                   parallel passage in Mark contains the phrase "neither the Son"
                   (Mark 13:32). How, then, can mere mortals have the boldness to
                   claim to foretell the date of the Son's return? All dated forecasts
                   are doomed to failure. Worse still, the very attempts are mis-
                   placed, being an endeavor to discover what the Father in His
                   wisdom has decided to keep secret. (See Acts 1:7.)
                      "Time after time has been set for Christ to come, but repeated
                   failures have been the result.... Because the times repeatedly
                   set have passed, the world is in a more decided state of unbelief
                   than before in regard to the near advent of Christ. They look
                   upon the failures of the time setters with disgust; and because
                   men have been so deceived, they turn from the truth substan-
                   tiated by the word of God that the end of all things is at
                   hand."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 307.
                      Nevertheless, we must guard against the opposite extreme—
                   that of ignoring or denying the Lord's coming. Those negative
                   attitudes are often fatal, leading to a complete loss of faith. It is
                   the evil servant who says in his heart, "My lord delayeth his
                   coming," while the faithful and wise servant is ever ready for his
                   Master's return.

THINK IT THROUGH      Have we ever declared, after some earthshaking event,
                   "We are sure Christ will come within the next one or two (or
                   five or ten ) years now!" Is it not better, with Christ, to leave
                   such times and seasons to our omniscient Father?

                      "Those who think they must preach definite time in order to
                   make an impression upon the people do not work from the right
                   standpoint. . . . An excitement is created; but when the time
                   passes, as it has done repeatedly, those who moved out upon
                   time fall back into coldness, darkness, and sin, and it is almost
                   impossible to arouse their consciences without some great
                   excitement."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 308.

           Part 3  What did Jesus present to the Twelve as a key factor in the
           WHY? time of His return?

                     "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                   world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
                   come" (Matt. 24:14).

                     This gospel of the kingdom. There is only one gospel (com-
                   pare Gal. 1:8). It proclaims the coming of the kingdom of which
                   Christ is King. It prepares men and women to be His sinless
                   subjects.
                     Shall be preached. This is both a commission to preach that
                   gospel and an assurance that it will be done.
                     In all the world. This calls for and promises global coverage.
                     For a witness unto all nations. This requires that the good
                   news of God's plan of salvation be shared with all nationalities.
                     Then shall the end come. This is a reference to "the end of
                   the world" (Matt. 24:3) and a pledge that it will come.

                     Upon whom does the burden for the proclamation of the
                   gospel rest? Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 16:15.

                      The task was originally given to the apostles, but it was soon
                   shared with the church and accepted by the early Christians,
                   who "went every where preaching the word" (Acts 8:4). These
                   took the command literally and spoke to all whom they met,
                   sharing with them the wonderful news that "God, having raised
                   up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every
                   one of you from his iniquities" (Acts 3:26). The royal command
                   in Mark 16:15 shows that a token witness to a nation does not
                   fulfill the church's missionary duty. The divine intent is the
                   giving of the gospel "to every creature," or "to all creation"—a
                   colossal task still to be accomplished before the end can come.
                   But what else could we expect? "The Lord is ... not willing that
                   any should perish, but that all should come to repentance"
                   (2 Peter 3:9), and there are more than 4,000,000,000 "creatures"
                   alive in our world today. How many of them have heard and
                   accepted or rejected the gospel? How many still remain to be
                   reached? What are we doing to reach them? Are we doing it so
                   effectively that the end will soon come?
                      "The church of Christ is God's appointed agency for the
                   salvation of men. . . . Everyone, to the extent of his talent and
                   opportunity, is to fulfill the Saviour's commission."—Steps to

THINK IT THROUGH     What am I doing that will contribute to the preaching of the
                   gospel in all the world to help the end to come? If the answer is
                   negative, let this day's study change it.

"Thy Kingdom Come"           LESSON 5                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 28
          Part 4 What simple, angelic assurance defines the manner in
        HOW?—1 which Jesus will return?

                     "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven
                   shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
                   heaven" (Acts 1:11).

                     "In like manner. By this promise, His return must be (1)
                   personal—`this same Jesus' (see DA 832); (2) visible—`ye have
                   seen him go'; (3) with clouds—'a cloud received him'; (4)
                   certain—'shall so come.' This quiet but solemn pledge of the
                   angelic counselors brings to the doctrine of the second coming
                   of Christ an utter certainty, assured by the reality of the ascen-
                   sion. It is all true, event and promise, or none of it is true.
                   Without the second advent, all the preceding work in the plan of
                   salvation would be as vain as the sowing and cultivation of
                   crops without a harvest."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp.
                   125, 126.

                     With what magnificent words does Paul confirm the angels'
                   announcement? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

                      Here is the ascension in reverse. The same Jesus, possessing
                   the same dual divine-human nature, though glorified beyond
                   our utmost imaginings, descends from the heaven to which He
                   had ascended centuries ago. The eleven apostles who had seen
                   Him caught up will have been resurrected to see their Lord
                   returning, as the angels had promised. With them will also be
                   raised a multitude of the dead in Christ. (See Dan. 12:2; Early
                   Writings, p.285.) This host, together with all living believers who
                   had accepted the Saviour by faith, will "meet the Lord in the air:
                   and so shall we [Paul, the faithful Thessalonigns, and all the
                   redeemed] ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:17). This descrip-
                   tion adds to what Jesus told the people in His time. (See Matt.
                   16:27; 24:30, 31; 26:64.)
                      "Christ will come in His own glory, in the glory of His Father,
                   and the glory of the holy angels. Ten thousand times ten
                   thousand, and thousands of thousands of angels, the beautiful
                   and triumphant sons of God, possessing surpassing loveliness
                   and glory, will escort Him on His way."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                   739.

THINK IT THROUGH     When "this same Jesus" calls to the dead and the living,
                   shall I be numbered among those who respond and meet
                   Him?

                     This is no merely academic question. We need to give most
                   earnest attention to our answer now.

                                                                        October 29
          Part 5    While still in Palestine, what was our Lord able to tell of His
        HOW?-1I triumphant return?

                      "For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
                    his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
                    his works" (Matt. 16:27).

                     Peter had recognized the divinity of his Lord (Matt. 16:16).
                   Jesus had forewarned His companions of His approaching pas-
                   sion and had expounded His philosophy of sacrificial living
                   (verses 21-26). Then comes the revelation—already shared with
                   Nathaniel at the time of his call (John 1:51) but apparently
                   forgotten or not understood—"the Son of man shall come in the
                   glory of his Father" (Matt. 16:27). We memorize such words. Do
                   we have any true idea of what they mean? Moses pleaded,
                   "Shew me thy glory" (Ex. 33:18); and he was told, "There shall
                   no man see me, and live" (verse 20). In vision Daniel saw the
                   Ancient of Days and tried to describe what he saw (Dan. 7:9, 10;
                   compare Matt. 24:30, 31).

                     With what words does one of the psalmists describe Christ's
                   coming? Ps. 50:3, 4.

                       Those who knew their God as did the psalmists had a
                    sanctified respect for His glory. When they thought of His ap-
                    pearing, they visualized the awe-inspiring splendor, the purity
                    that could only be expressed in terms of fire, and the turmoil in
                    the elements as the shining hosts precede, surround, and follow
                    the King in His beauty. Habakkuk records an even more blazing
                    vision in chapter 3:3-6. Yet his reaction is not one of craven fear.
                    Instead, he exclaims, "I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the
                    God of my salvation" (verse 18). Isaiah's response was similar
                    when he saw the Lord will "swallow up death in victory; and the
                    Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; . . . it shall be
                    said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and
                    he will save us" (Isa. 25:8, 9).
                      "No language can describe the glory of the scene. The living
                    cloud of majesty and unsurpassed glory came still nearer, and
                    we could clearly behold the lovely person of Jesus. . . . His
                    countenance was as bright as the noonday sun, His eyes were
                   as a flame of fire, and His feet had the appearance of fine brass.
                   His voice sounded like many musical instruments."—EarlyWrit-
                   ings, p. 286.

THINK IT THROUGH     When we see Jesus, shall we be surprised at His appear-
                   ance, or shall we have so digested the biblical description of
                   His advent that we shall be humbly ready for His glory?

                                                                      October 30
         Part 6      What reality shapes the counsel the Lord Himself gives to
     HOW TO BE     those who await His return?
        READY
                     "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
                   come" (Matt. 24:42).

                     Watch, or keep on the alert. Ye know not. Thanks to the
                   Saviour's Instruction, we can know much about His coming, but
                   not one of us knows the day (rather than hour) of that coming
                   (compare verse 36). This makes it necessary for us to read the
                   signs of the times rightly and to be always on the alert, espe-
                   cially as we see the day approaching (Heb. 10:25). The Master
                   placed great emphasis on this watchful state, telling six para-
                   bles to drive the counsel home (Mark 13:34-37; Matt. 24:43, 44,
                   45-51; 25:1-13, 14-30, 31-46).
                      "The desire of our Lord is that we should be watching, so that
                   when He cometh and knocketh we may open to Him immedi-
                   ately. A blessing is pronounced upon those servants whom He
                   finds watching. . . . Are we prepared without delay to open to
                   Him immediately and welcome Him in? Watch, watch, watch."—
                   Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 195.

                    What can we do for ourselves that will better prepare us to
                   meet our Master in peace? 2 Peter 3:14.

                      This verse is for all who love their Lord's appearing—those
                   who look for or wait for or expect "the coming of the day of
                   God" and "new heavens and a new earth" (verses 12, 13). It is,
                   then, a peculiarly Adventist verse and should be given earnest,
                   receptive attention by those who await the Saviour. Peter bids
                   us, "be diligent" or take pains, making every effort for a specific
                   purpose—namely, to be found by the Lord in a state of peace,
                   spiritually spotless and therefore blameless. This is an ex-
                   tremely high standard. It has only been fully met byJesus Christ,
                   and yet it can be credited to us. We then choote to be like Him
                   through His transforming power. Here, then, is a recipe for
                   readiness to meet the Redeemer in the last great day—daily
                   justified and daily being sanctified.
                      "My brother, my sister, I urge you to prepare for the coming of
                   Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast the love of the
                   world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what it
                   means to have fellowship with Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
                   285.

           ASSURED reach the goal He had in creating our planet.
        INHERITANCE
                         "For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God
                      himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established
                      it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am
                      the Lord; and there is none else" (Isa. 45:18).

                          There is no boasting here. The Creator is calmly reminding
                      mankind and all other inhabitants of the universe that the ful-
                      fillment of His plan in the creation of our earth has been post-
                      poned, but not defeated, by the disease of sin. When human
                      history closes and the redeemed move over into the eternity that
                      we can now see only as the future—but which to the Eternal
                      is the ever-continuing present—we shall perceive that the Al-
                      mighty's original purposes for the earth have been fulfilled.

                      the land." This must be so. An all-wise all-powerful God could
                      not determine otherwise. In the beginning He made man free to
                      choose good or evil in order to settle the conflict between right
                      and wrong. When the war against wrong shall have ended in
                      favor of right, it would be foolish and fatal to allow those who
                      prefer sin to introduce its destructive conceits into a new and
                      perfect creation. Those who are going to inhabit the renewed
                      earth must, therefore, be in complete harmony with the Creator's
                      ideals. The Son of God confirmed this in His teaching on the
                      mount (Matt. 5:5). To the poor in spirit, to the meek, to the pure
                      in heart, to the persecuted, to the reviled, the Son of man will
                      say, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre-
                      pared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matt. 25:34).

 THINK IT THROUGH      How clearly do we accept that our present responses to
                      God's standards determine our fitness for eternity?

All Things New      LESSON 6                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                    November 2
          Part 2     As Jesus began His ministry, what news did. He bring to the
    NEWS OF THE     world? What was the meaning of it?
       KINGDOM
                      "Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
                    Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God" (Mark
                    1:14).

                      Behold the irony of history! After John the Baptist had been
                    imprisoned while preaching "the kingdom of heaven is at hand"
                    (Matt. 3:1, 2), Jesus of Nazareth opened His ministry with the
                    very same message (Matt. 4:17). He who had set Adam and Eve
                    in Eden—there to establish a branch of the kingdom on planet
                    earth—and had seen that kingdom usurped by Satan, had come
                    in human guise to regain that realm for God. He was recruiting
                    subjects for the kingdom—those who agreed with its principles,
                    served Him as King, and were loyal to God the Father. The
                    kingdom would be first established in His followers' hearts and
                    then be realized in Eden restored, when the kingdoms of this
                    world become the kingdom of our Lord.

                      Why did the Lord often give instruction about the kingdom
                    by an indirect method? Matt. 13:10, 11.

                       The King had much to tell about the kingdom, but He had to
                    convey His news gently, for even the Jewish people were unpre-
                    pared to accept His revelations. He therefore taught in parables.
                    Thirteen of those, recorded by Matthew, dealt with the kingdom
                    of heaven or of God (Matt. 13:3 with 19, 24, 31, 33, etc.). Later,
                    just prior to ascension, He spent 40 days with the eleven apos-
                    tles, "speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God"
                    (Acts 1:3). He educated them to prepare others to be subjects of
                    that kingdom.
                       There can be no doubt, however, that Christ's far-seeing mind
                    looked beyond the building of the kingdom of God on a limited
                    basis among willing members of the human race. He was living
                    and working for the establishment of that kingdom as the su-
                    preme ruling power for all the universe, with the New Jerusalem
                    —set upon this earth—as the seat of divine government. Given
                    His eternal background and His knowledge of God's eternal
                     purpose, He could foresee no less than what is so briefly por-
                     trayed in the two final chapters of the Bible—Revelation, chap-
                     ters 21 and 22. We need to share His vision, while safeguarding
                     our own understanding of it from the blurrings that arise from
                     our own limitations.

 THINK IT THROUGH      As I think of the kingdom of heaven, am I more concerned
                     with its physical glories than with my spiritual preparedness
                     to be one of its citizens?

                                                                        November 3
              Part 3      What was the vision that inspired holy men of old in their
          THEY SEEK    pilgrimage? How does this vision help us?
         A COUNTRY
                         "For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
                       builder and maker is God" (Heb. 11:10).

                          In this, Abraham was typical of all saints who endured trou-
                       bled earthly lives on the strength of a heavenly vision. Through
                       eyes of faith they looked toward the well-founded city of which
                       God is both designer and builder. They looked ahead, seeking a
                       better, heavenly fatherland, and believing that God had pre-
                       pared such a country especially for them (verses 14, 16). Those
                       who have lived nearest to God have most clearly seen "the
                       things which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Cor.
                       2:9), even though they have been numbered among those who
                       "died in faith, not having received the promises" (Heb. 11:13).

                         How did New Testament saints share the patriarchal vi-
                       sion? 2 Peter 3:13.

                          Earlier in this chapter, Peter has been writing of the scoffers
                       and earthly-minded ones who have ever been doubtful of bibli-
                       cal promises of the Lord's return and of His re-creative acts
                       (2 Peter 3:1-7). He has stated the Lord's patience (verse 9), that
                       "the day of the Lord will come" (verse 10), that the old creation
                       will be destroyed (verse 12), and that those who trust the divine
                       promise (see verses 4, 9) will look for "new heavens and a new
                       earth" (verse 13). The word here translated "new" does not call
                       for a completely different kind of heaven and earth, but rather
                       renewed heavens and a renewed earth from which all that is evil
                       has been purged and in which all that is right has made its
                       permanent home.

THINK IT THROUGH         Seeing that we look for such things, what kind of people
                       should we now be?

                          "In heaven there is perfect order, perfect obedience, perfect
                       peace and harmony. Those who have had no respect for order
                       or discipline in this life would have no respect for the order
                       which is observed in heaven. They can never be admitted into
                       heaven, for all worthy of an entrance there will love order and
                       respect discipline. The characters formed in this life will deter-
                       mine the future destiny. When Christ shall come, He will not
                       change the character of any individual. Precious, probationary
                       time is given to be improved in washing our robes of character
                       and making them white in the blood of the Lamb. To remove the
                       stains of sin requires the work of a lifetime."—Testimonies, vol.

All Things New      LESSON 6                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   November 4

          Part 4   What final and pleasing vision was granted to the revelator?
    NEW HEAVEN, What does it mean to us today?
     NEW EARTH
                   "I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
                 and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
                 sea" (Rev. 21:1).

                      The heavenly guides have led the apostle from the days of the
                    early church to the threshold of eternity, and now they give him
                    a glimpse into the timeless future, when all that God originally
                    planned will come to pass. What Peter and others looked for,
                    John is permitted to see—a renewed heaven and a remade earth
                    to replace those that have been destroyed by the shattering
                    events attendant to the end of the age. The greater part of the
                    remaining apocalyptic visions (Rev. 21:2 to 22:5) describes
                    conditions on the new earth and the glories of its capital city.

                      What impression of the Holy City is given .by the simile
                    applied to it by John? Rev. 21:2, 9, 10.

                      The New Jerusalem has been the heavenly city, but it is now to
                    be the seat of divine government. It is therefore seen to be
                    "descending out of heaven from God," gleaming because of the
                    glory of the Father radiating from it. The physical and spiritual
                    glories of that city are spelled out more fully in verses 11 to 27;
                    but we should remember that John is there trying to describe
                    the indescribable, using earthly language to convey eternal
                    realities that are beyond the mental reach of human beings.
                      "Workers for God should not spend time speculating as to
                    what conditions will prevail in the new earth.... He has made
                    every provision for our happiness in the future life, and we are
                    not to speculate regarding His plans for us. Neither are we to
                    measure the conditions of the future life by the conditions of
                    this life."—Gospel Workers, p. 314.
                      When all that the Lord has seen fit to reveal to us concerning
                    the nature of eternal life and the occupations that will engage us
                    during the eternal years has been faithfully studied, we are
                    scarcely carried beyond the pearly gates. The limitation need
                    cause us no dismay. We shall have eternity itself in which to
                    explore unimagined wonders where there will be no limits of
                    time to press us into peace-destroying haste!

 THINK IT THROUGH     What do we foresee as our chief pleasure when we at last
                    behold the new heaven and when we dwell in the new earth?

All Things New         LESSON 6                                        ❑ Thursday
                                                                       November 5
             Part 5     When the Holy City descends, what long-cherished divine
       GOD WITH US    plan will have been carried out?

                        "I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
                      tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
                      they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,
                      and be their God" (Rev. 21:3).

                         While the Lord God had walked in Eden, there is no scriptural
                      suggestion that He had then intended to make our earth the
                      center of His government. But the disaster of disobedience not
                      only called out redemptive love, but revealed the plan that God
                      Himself would live among the redeemed. This is beautifully
                      confirmed by the revelator's choice of words in this verse: "The
                      tabernacle of God is with men."
                         The earthly sanctuary was made so that the Lord might dwell
                      among His people (Ex. 25:8; 29:45); the temples built by Sol-
                      omon and Zerubbabel were to be similarly honored (1 Kings
                      6:13; Hag. 2:6-9); and when the Word, who was God, was made
                      flesh, God came to "dwell"—or to "tabernacle"—among men
                      (John 1:14). And now, with every form of evil destroyed (Rev.
                      20:7-15), God comes to make His everlasting home among the
                      ransomed race.
                         In considering this, we should ever bear in mind the limita-
                      tions of human thought and language and realize that the Om-
                      nipresent will not be localized, though He will dwell among His
                      people, even as their God. That surprising honor will suffice.

                       Over which territory and for how long a time will the Lord
                      God reign? Rev. 11:15; 19:6, 16.

                        "Then cometh the end, when he [Christ] shall have delivered
                      up the kingdom to God, even the Father.... And when all things
                      shall be subdued unto him [Christ], then shall the Son also
                      himself be subject unto him [the Father] that put all things under
                      him [Christ], that God [the Father] may be all in all" (1 Cor.
                      15:24-28).
                        Since heaven itself and all other worlds already delight in
                      loyalty to the Lord God, the submission of our wayward world
                      proclaims the Godhead as King of kings and Lord of lords over
                      the whole universe. Then will be fulfilled the declaration
                      prophesied by John: "and every creature which is in heaven,
                      and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea,
                      and all that are in them" say, "Blessing, and honour, and glory,
                      and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto
                      the Lamb for ever and ever" (Rev. 5:13). Alleluia!

                                                                      November 6
           Part 6  What fitness for citizenship in the new world does its King
     CITIZENS OF demand?
    THE KINGDOM
                   "He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
                  God, and he shall be my son" (Rev. 21:7).

                       This is but one of many ways of describing the qualities that
                    must be possessed by all who would be citizens of the kingdom
                    of God. They must, by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, have
                    overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil. This is the refrain in
                    the messages to the seven churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12,
                    21). Other biblical writers mention other facets of the character
                    of him who would live with the Eternal—law lover, upright, pure
                    hearted, guileless (Ps. 1:1-3; 15; 24:3-5; 34:12-14), humble (Isa.
                    57:15), Spirit controlled (Rom. 8:1-4)—while Jesus declares
                    simply but with authority that the new birth is the prime essen-
                    tial (John 3:3). From another point of view it might be truly said
                    that the whole Bible is given that we might learn the secret of
                    how to become citizens of the kingdom of heaven.

                      After reviewing the many Instructions given for finding eter-
                    nal life, what basic requirement must we ever keep in mind?
                    Matt. 18:3.

                       "To be great in God's kingdom is to be a little child in humility,
                    in simplicity of faith, and in the purity of love. All pride must
                    perish, all jealousy be overcome, all ambition for supremacy be
                    given up, and the meekness and trust of the child be encour-
                    aged. . . .
                       "Are we willing to renounce our own wisdom and to receive
                    the kingdom of heaven as a little child? Are we willing to part
                    with self-righteousness? Are we willing to give up our chosen
                    worldly associates? Are we willing to sacrifice the approbation
                    of men? The prize of eternal life is of infinite value. Will we put
                    forth efforts and make sacrifices proportionate to the worth of
                    the object to be attained? . . .
                       "'He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to
                     walk, even as He walked.' Now if any man have not the spirit of
                     Christ, he is none of His.' This conformity to Jesus will not be
                     unobserved by the world. It is a subject of notice and comment.
                     The Christian may not be conscious of the great change; for the
                     more closely he resembles Christ in character the more humble
                     will be the opinion of himself; but it will be seen and felt by all
                     around him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 130, 222, 223.

             Part 1   On what basis may we be assured of the physical perfection
       GOD'S IDEALS of the newly created Adam and Eve?
          FOR HIS
         CHILDREN     "God created man in his own image, in the image of God
                    created he him; male and female created he them" (Gen.
                    1:27).

                        In His creation of the first man and woman the Creator ex-
                     pressed His intention toward the human race. By making "man
                     in his own image" He cast him in a perfect mold, for, by defini-
                     tion, Deity is perfect. Consequently, Adam and Eve were without
                     blemish, literally in perfect health, and not subject to disease.
                     Furthermore, they were models for all mankind. If sin had not
                     burst into Eden, all human beings would have possessed a
                     perfect physique and would have enjoyed perfect health and
                     self-control. Such was God's ideal for His earthly children.

                       In spite of sin's ruin, what assurance has God given to show
                     His continuing desire to give health to His children and the
                     assurance of a return to self-control? Deut. 7:12-15; Ex. 15:26;
                     23:25. (See also Ps. 103:2-5.)

                        "Christ had been the guide and teacher of ancient Israel, and
                     He taught them that health is the reward of obedience to the
                     laws of God. The Great Physician who healed the sick in Pales-
                     tine had spoken to His people from the pillar of cloud, telling
                     them what they must do, and what God would do for them....
                     Christ gave to Israel definite instruction in regard to their habits
                     of life, and he assured them, 'The Lord will take away from thee
                     all sickness.' ... When they fulfilled the conditions, the promise
                     was verified to them. 'There was not one feeble person among
                     their tribes.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 824.
                        Our very salvation depends on the truth of the psalmist's
                     declaration that the Lord is He "who forgiveth all thine in-
                     iquities" (Ps. 103:3); and we believe and know that this pardon
                     is ours in Christ Jesus (1 John 1:9). The full benefit of such
                     forgiveness, however, will not be enjoyed until we enter into
                     eternity. May it not be similar, though to a lesser degree, with
                     our health? As we follow Christ's guidance, we shall enjoy
                     better health and also the prospect of full restoration when "this
                     mortal shall have put on immortality" (1 Cor. 15:54).

                                                                       November 9

          Part 2   What is the spiritual concern that prompts the Lord's inter-
       GUIDANCE est in our physical well-being?
        ON DIET
                   "For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the
                 Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
                 above all the nations that are upon the earth" (Deut. 14:2).

                      It was no thoughtless act that led our Maker to define clean
                    and unclean meats. (See Gen. 7:2; Deut. 14:3-21; Lev. 11:1-47.)
                    The Lord had chosen Israel to be "a special people" above all
                    the nations (Deut. 7:6). They were to be "his treasured posses-
                    sion" (NIV), and with this high calling, they were to see them-
                    selves as "an holy people." To this high end, they were to be
                    careful in their diet and in other matters, for the sake of spiritual
                    as well as physical health.
                       The difference between clean and unclean meats is still to be
                    observed; and vegetarianism stands on its own merits; but the
                    prevalence of disease among animals used for food offers a
                    sound and additional reason why a lacto-ovo-vegetarian
                    diet—where we can find and pay for it—offers an excellent
                    solution to the dietary question.
                       "In teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great
                    object of reform—that its purpose is to secure the highest de-
                    velopment of body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of
                     nature, being the laws of God, are designed for our good; that
                     obedience to them promotes happiness in this life, and aids in
                     preparation for the life to come."—The Ministry of Healing, p.
                     146.

                      What lessons can we learn and apply from the drinking and
                    eating practices of certain Old Testament characters? Num.
                    6:2-4; Judges 13:2-5; Jer. 35:1-10; Dan. 1:3-20.

                      Manoah's wife and son, the Rechabites, the captive royal
                    Jewish children in Babylon, and the Nazarites—more accu-
                    rately Nazirites—were willing to deny their appetites and ob-
                    serve strict temperance principles amid widely differing cir-
                    cumstances. "True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely
                    with everything hurtful and to use judiciously that which is
                    healthful. There are few who realize as they should how much
                    their habits of diet have to do with their health, their character,
                    their usefulness in this world, and their eternal destiny."—

             Part 3      During His first Galilean tour, how did Jesus demonstrate
         JESUS AND     His deep concern for mankind's health?
            HEALTH
                         "Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
                       and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all
                       manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the
                       people" (Matt. 4:23).

                          There is no room for any doubt concerning the Godhead's
                       attitude to disease. The beneficent medical ministry of the Son
                       proclaims to the world that Father, Son, and Spirit are against it.
                       They want to abolish it. As we saw in part 1 of this week's lesson,
                       one of the Lord's own self-descriptions is, "I am the Lord that
                       healeth thee" (Ex. 15:26). And now, the Lord Incarnate demon-
                       strates His desire to overcome human suffering and to make.His
                       creatures whole.
                          "The burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to
                       remove. It was His mission to bring to men complete restora-
                       tion; He came to give them health and peace and perfection of
                       character."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 17.
                         As Christ prepared His church to meet the last days, how did
                       He speak of the indulged craving of appetite in relation to
                       readiness for His return? Luke 21:34. (Compare Rom. 13:11-
                       14.)

                          Our Lord, in His omniscience, knows our need for self-
                       examination and self-control in matters of appetite. He also
                       knows that need will increase as pressures grow greater prior to
                       the end. He therefore urges us, "Do not let your minds be dulled
                       by dissipation and drunkenness and worldly cares so that the
                       great Day closes upon you suddenly like a trap" (Luke 21:34,
                       NEB). There is real spiritual peril in our appetites for food, drink,
                       and all kinds of pleasure; and the Saviour here underlines our
                       personal responsibility for curbing those desires that they not
                       swamp our spiritual faculties.
                          "In all ages, temptations appealing to the physical nature
                       have been most effectual in corrupting and degrading mankind.
                       Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and
                       moral powers that God gave to man as a priceless endowment.
                       Through sensual indulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the soul
                       every trace of likeness to God.
                          "The uncontrolled indulgence and consequent disease and
                       degradation that existed at Christ's first advent will again exist,
                       with intensity of evil, before His second coming."—The Desire

                      Those who accept this solution take a great stride in the
                    conquest of many temptations. The offering, to be effective, has
                    to be on a continuing basis so that the body always remains
                    under God's ownership and control. "The body is the only
                    medium through which the mind and the soul are developed for
                    the upbuilding of character. Hence it is that the adversary of
                    souls directs his temptations to the enfeebling and degrading of
                    the physical powers....
                       "The body is to be brought into subjection. The higher
                    powers of the being are to rule. The passions are to be control-
                    led by the will, which is itself to be under the control of God. The
                    kingly power of reason, sanctified by divine grace, is to bear
                    sway in our lives."—The. Ministry of Healing, p. 130.

                      In what picturesque and enlightening way does Paul extend
                    his teaching concerning our bodies? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

                       For the Christian, this is not a matter of choice, but of fact. By
                    baptism he has offered back his body to God, who makes of it a
                    shrine wherein dwells the Holy Spirit. The Christian's body,
                    then, does not belong to himself. He will choose to use it so that
                    God is glorified.
                       The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual has long ex-
                    pressed concern that the followers of Christ should be a godly
                    people, not adopting the unholy maxims or conforming to the
                    unrighteous ways of the world, not loving its sinful pleasures or
                    countenancing its follies. It has indicated that believers should
                    recognize their bodies as the temple of the Holy Spirit and that
                    therefore they should clothe themselves in neat, modest, dig-
                    nified apparel. Further, in eating and drinking and in their entire
                    course of conduct, they have been instructed to shape their
                    lives as followers of the meek and lowly Master. Adventist fol-
                     lowers of Christ have been led to abstain from all intoxicating
                     drinks, tobacco, and other narcotics and to avoid every body-
                     and soul-defiling habit and practice.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What are we doing with our bodies? Does our life-style
                     encourage the Holy Spirit to live in us?

Christianity and Health           LESSON 7                                ❑ Thursday
                                                                         November 12
              Part 5   What are some of the qualities produced in a Spirit-
     SPIRIT-INSPIRED controlled character?
       TEMPERANCE
                       "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
                     gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against
                     such there is no law" (Gal. 5:22, 23).

                          Here we encounter one of Paul's deep insights—the contrast
                      and conflict between "the works of the flesh" (verses 19-21),
                      translated byJ. B. Phillips as "the activities of the lower nature,"
                      and "the fruit" (verse 22), or "the harvest" (NEB), of the Spirit.
                      The last item of "fruit" noted is "temperance" (verse 23), which
                      comes from a word that is better translated as "self-control."
                      Temperance therefore has a broader meaning than abstinence.
                      It includes Spirit-controlled living in every activity—drinking,
                      eating, sleeping, dressing, working, or pleasure. This is also
                      God's answer to every false craving and desire.
                         But there are nine "fruits" in Paul's list. While emphasizing
                      the ninth, must we not also give similar attention to the other
                      eight? It is of little use to stress temperance if we fall lamentably
                      short on the other qualities.

                        What is God's plan by which we may reach and continue in
                      the scriptural ideals for personal conduct? 1 Thess. 5:23.

                         Every human being can, if he will, testify to his inability to live
                      according to Christian ideals. He needs a power outside of
                      himself that will provide strength to overcome the downward
                      pull of his lower nature. That power is available; the god of
                      peace, who is almighty, is well able to make and keep us per-
                      fectly holy, that we might be spotless at Christ's appearing.
                          "Apart from divine power, no genuine reform can be effected.
                      ... Not until the life of Christ becomes a vitalizing power in our
                      lives can we resist the temptations that assail us from within and
                      from without. . . .
                         "When one surrenders to Christ, the mind is brought under
                      the control of the law; but it is the royal law, which proclaims
                      liberty to every captive."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 130, 131.

THINK IT THROUGH        While keeping free from the grosser indulgences of drunk-
                      enness, smoking, gluttony, and sensuality, how do we mea-
                      sure in the finer qualities listed In Galatians 5:22, 23?

                                                                     November 13
          Part 6   What is the final goal to which the Christan doctrine of
         HEALTH temperance directs its believers?
   FOREVERMORE
                   "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
                 heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness"
                 (2 Peter 3:13).

                      While temperance or the consistent practice of self-control
                    yields high dividends in this life, its principal fruitage is fitness
                    for living in the Holy City and for eternity in the re-created
                    heavens and earth. Paul emphasizes this in 1 Corinthians 9:24-
                    27, declaring that he disciplined himself on earth in order to
                    gain a fadeless trophy in the life to come. "Those who enter into
                    a contest of physical strength for a corruptible prize realize the
                    necessity of rigid abstinence from every indulgence that would
                    weaken the spiritual powers. . . .
                      "How much more should those who enter for the gospel race,
                    restrain themselves from the unlawful indulgence of appetite
                    and 'abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.' They
                    must be temperate at all times. The same restraint that gives
                    them the power to obtain the victory at one time will, if practiced
                   'constantly, give them a great advantage in the race for the
                    crown of life."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-
                    mentary, vol. 6, p. 1089.

                     What unique blessings does the heavenly herald promise to
                   citizens of the earth made new? Rev. 21:3, 4; 22:1-3.

                     At long, long last! The separation caused by sin has ended.
                   God and His people are united; they live together forevermore,
                   and in the Divine presence sin and its sorry results cannot exist.
                   God Himself permanently removes all need for tears. Death is
                   abolished because sin and its causes are conquered. There is
                   no reason for sorrow or crying; there is no more pain. The
                   redeemed will be forever in perfect physical, mental, and
                   spiritual fitness. As Isaiah so picturesquely records on God's
                   behalf: "as the days of a tree are the days of my people" (Isa.
                   65:22), which may suggest they shall live forever, temperately,
                   and in undiluted, unmarred health and happiness.
                     And the relief will not only be ours. Spend time to realize what
                   the complete removal of sin from the universe will mean to the
                   Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH      Does our present way of life prepare us or unfit us for an
                    eternity in the sinlessness of the new heavens and the new
                    earth?

  FURTHER STUDY       Read the ten verses of Isaiah 35 and give special thought to
                    those phrases that concern health in this life and the life to
                    come.

             Part 1     As Jesus faced separation from His beloved disciples, what
            DIVINE    provisions did He make for their spiritual welfare?
       PARTNERSHIP
                        "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Com-
                      forter, that he may abide with you for ever" (John 14:16).

                        As we have already noted in the introduction to this week's
                      study, the Holy Spirit shared in Christ's mission. He had also
                      worked with and for humanity from the very beginning, though
                      the Old Testament stress on one God may have veiled man's
                      grasp of that ministry. But the incarnation, with its divine part-
                      nership between the Three Persons of the Godhead, enabled
                      the disciples more clearly to sense the reality of the Spirit. As
                      Christ had revealed the Father, so, in His life and teachings, He
                      was revealing the personality of the Spirit. As He neared the
                      hour when He would "depart out of this world unto the Father,"
                      He sought to assure the Twelve that the Spirit would continue
                      the work He Himself had begun.

                        In what specific ways was the Comforter to work with the
                      church after Christ's departure? John 14:16, 17, 27; 15:26;
                      16:7-14.

                        1. The Comforter, or Paraclete, or Advocate would console,
                      stand beside, and plead with and for those who would be left
                      without the Saviour's own dynamic, sustaining presence.
                        2. He would abide with them "for ever." His would be no
                      temporary presence; there would be no separation unless the
                      disciples themselves took the step.
                        3. He would teach them "all things," reminding them of all
                      that Christ had revealed and they had only dimly understood.
                        4. The Spirit of truth would work not only with believers, but
                      also with "the world" to convince its peoples of their need of
                      redemption.
                        5. He would guide "into all truth," reveal "things to come,"
                      and develop what Christ had already taught them.
                        "Jesus saw that they did not lay hold of the real meaning of
                      His words..He compassionately promised that the Holy Spirit
                      should recall these sayings to their minds. And He had left
                      unsaid many things that could not be comprehended by the
                      disciples. These also would be opened to them by the

          Part 2  What do the opening verses of Acts reveal concerning the
    PROMISE AND central position of the Spirit in Christ's care for the infant
    FULFILLMENT church?

                     "Being assembled together with them, commanded them
                   that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the
                   promise of the Father, which, said he, ye have heard of me"
                   (Acts 1:4).

                     The Master had clearly told His disciples to expect the coming
                   of the Comforter after His own departure (John 16:7), and that
                   departure was now near. It is clear, however, that this coming of
                   the Spirit was of a special nature, additional to the fact that He
                   had been working with Jesus throughout His life and ministry.
                   The Third Person was now serving with the resurrected Christ to
                   prepare the eleven for their great responsibilities (Acts 1:2); and
                   as the weight of their tasks began to be felt, they all the more
                   readily recalled the promises of the Spirit's help (outlined in our
                   previous lesson). They were thus very open to the final promise,
                   just prior to the ascension, that they would receive supernatural
                   power from the Spirit's coming upon them (verse 8). After see-
                   ing their Master taken up into heaven, they returned to
                   Jerusalem and "continued with one accord in prayer and sup-
                   plication" (verse 14), awaiting the promise of the Father.

                      In what matchless manner and with what remarkable re-
                   sults did the Spirit come upon the waiting believers? Acts 2:1,
                   2, 38-41.

                      These early Christians must have spent about 10 days in
                   soul-searching prayer and witnessing, for Pentecost came 50
                   days after the beginning of Passover. During 40 of those days
                   their Lord had appeared to them on several occasions (Acts
                   1:3); then 10 days remained after the ascension. They were 10
                   days well spent, for they led to the descent of the Spirit.
                      "They were filled with an intense longing to carry forward the
                   work He had begun. They realized the greatness of their debt to
                   heaven and the responsibility of their work. Strengthened by the
                   endowment of the Holy Spirit, they went forth filled with zeal to
                   extend the triumphs of the cross.... They had consecrated their
                   lives to Him for service, and their very features bore evidence of
                   the surrender they had made."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 46.

             Part 3    What evidence shows that the Spirit's pentecostal descent
         THE SPIRIT- was not a one-time or temporary event?
            GUIDED
           CHURCH      "When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they
                     were assembled together; and they were all filled with the
                     Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness"
                     (Acts 4:31).

                       The young church had learned its lesson well. Its following of
                     divine instruction had brought the first, spectacular blessing at
                     Pentecost, and its leaders and membership were willing to
                     follow that example in order to enjoy a continuance of that
                     experience. They reaped a rich reward—deep fellowship with
                     unity, community of possessions, and great apostolic power
                     (Acts 4:32, 33).

                       What further proofs came of God's readiness to give the
                     Holy Spirit to them that were truly ready to receive Him? Acts
                     8:14-17, 26-40.

                        Ellen G. White describes these events as a picture of the work
                      that we are to do. They show that the Spirit is ever willing to work
                     with those who are willing to be guided by Him, and for those
                      who are willing to be instructed by Him. Like Peter, John, and
                      Philip in these illustrations, we need consciously to cooperate
                      with the Spirit; then He will use us for the salvation of others.
                        The recipients of this combined evangelistic attention may be
                      unaware of the power that is moving on their behalf, but they do
                      feel a spiritual hunger which, while not fully recognized and not
                      always understood, longs to be satisfied.
                        "There are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot
                      understand their true import. All over the world men and women
                     are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries
                     go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy Spirit.
                     Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be
                     gathered in.
                        "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light
                     and who was ready to receive the gospel, and today angels will
                     guide the footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy
                     Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and ennoble their
                     hearts. The angel sent to Philip could himself have done the
                     work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's way of working. It is
                     His plan that men are to work for their fellow men."—TheActs of
                     the Apostles, p. 109.

THINK IT THROUGH       When did I last keep the Spirit waiting—while I engaged in
                     unprofitable use of my time—when He was ready to use me in
                     bringing others to the Saviour?

Spiritual Gifts     LESSON 8                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     November 18
           Part 4     In guiding the Corinthians, how does Paul list the variety of
         GIFTS IN   spiritual gifts provided by God for the church?
     THE CHURCH
                       "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondar-
                    ily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
                    healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" (1 Cor.
                    12:28).

                       The fact that a whole chapter is devoted to the subject of
                    spiritual gifts reveals their importance in the life of the church.
                    In his summing up (1 Cor. 12:28), the apostle refers to eight
                    different gifts borne by different church members. The number-
                    ing of the gifts suggests an order of importance, with apostle-
                    ship ranking first and the use of tongues standing last. That this
                    list does not cover all the gifts is clear from verses 4 to 11, where
                    others are mentioned—namely, wisdom, knowledge, faith,
                    speaking in and interpretation of tongues.
                       A large, mature church might reasonably expect to find all of
                    the gifts distributed among its membership. Christians are
                    urged to "covet earnestly the best [or greater, or higher] gifts"
                    (verse 31), suggesting that it is fitting to ask the Spirit for be-
                    stowal of suitable gifts—ever remembering that these are even
                    then distributed according to divine wisdom (verse 11).

                      Compare the above listing with that given by Paul in Ephe-
                    sians 4:8-11.

                      Paul does not here enter on as full a survey of gifts as he had
                    done earlier in 1 Corinthians 12, for his purpose is different. He
                    is here concerned with unity; hence he refers to the gifts—
                    several forms of church ministry—that will promote this highly
                    desirable state. However, there is harmony between 1 Corinthi-
                    ans 12:28 and Ephesians 4:11, for the purpose is the same in
                    each chapter—the furtherance of unity (1 Cor. 12:11, 12; Eph.
                    4:2-6).
                       This purpose is further outlined in Ephesians 4:12, 13, where
                    the apostle's wealth of meaning can be better savored by the
                    free rendering that follows: The gifts are given for equipping the
                    saints for a work of service or ministry that will build up Christ's
                    body (that is, the church), until we all attain to the oneness or
                    unity of the faith and the personal, experiential knowledge of
                    God's Son, which will lead us to perfect or mature manhood
                    measured against the stature of Christ or of Christ in His full-
                    ness.

THINK IT THROUGH      Study the passage just above, phrase by phrase, and ask
                    the question, Are the Spirit's gifts gaining their stated pur-
                    poses in my life as a member of Christ's church, especially in
                    respect to unity?

Spiritual Gifts        LESSON 8                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                       November 19
              Part 5     What high place does the apostle give to the spiritual gift of
        THE GIFT OF    prophecy in contrast to that of speaking with tongues?
         PROPHECY
                         "He that prophesieth speaketh unto men unto edification,
                       and exhortation, and comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown
                       tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the
                       church" (1 Cor. 14:3, 4).

                         The biblical understanding of prophecy is not limited to a
                       foretelling of the future, but also includes the ministry of coun-
                       seling, of communicating God's will to the church and its indi-
                       vidual members. Paul, therefore, exalts the office of prophet in
                       preference to that of a speaker of tongues—known or unknown.
                       Prophecy is given second place in his lists of spiritual gifts
                       (1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11), and its operation played an important
                       part in the development of the early church (Acts 2:17, 18; 11:27,
                       28; 13:1; 15:32; 21:8-10). To a more limited extent, each age of
                       the church has been served by those who possessed one or
                       more aspects of the gift of prophecy. But Scripture shows that
                       in the last days, prior to Christ's triumphant return, the pro-
                       phetic gift will function no less prominently than it did in the
                       founding of the church.

                         To which prophecy did Peter appeal in his historic sermon at
                       Pentecost? Acts 2:16-18.

                          Under the Spirit's guidance the apostle applied Joel's
                       prophecy (Joel 2:28, 29) to the last days of the Jewish nation,
                       which were the first days of the Christian church. But Joel's
                       words primarily apply to "the great and terrible day of the Lord"
                       (Joel 2:31), which is the last day—the day when Christ will come
                       in glory. The gift of prophecy is to prepare men and women who
                       live in that day to meet their Lord in peace and with joy.
                          Seventh-day Adventists believe that the prophetic gift has
                       been bestowed on the church in the last days in the work and
                       writings of Ellen G. White. They believe that her prophetic minis-
                       try serves as one of the identifying features of the remnant
                       church. The foretelling of that gift in the church is seen in
                       Revelation 12:17, with an explanation in chapter 19:10.
                          The function of Ellen G. White's prophetic gift has not only
                       unveiled the future, but has guided the church in its develop-
                       ment, fortified it in the fulfillment of its mission, and given its
                       membership a wealth of Bible-based, Christ-centered counsel
                       that is unsurpassed in spiritual quality.

THINK IT THROUGH         In what special ways can the prophetic gift help the remnant
                       church fulfill its last-day mission?

Spiritual Gifts    LESSON 8                                                ❑ Friday
                                                                     November 20
         Part 6   Which of all the Spirit's gifts stands highest with the Holy
   THE GREATEST Spirit?
          GIFT
                  "Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a
                more excellent way."
                  "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
                greatest of these is charity" (1 Cor. 12:31; 13:13).

                      No one could accuse Paul of not having dealt thoroughly,
                   within the limits of one long letter, with the topic of spiritual
                   gifts; yet, as he meditated on the subject, he realized he had not
                   yet even mentioned the greatest gift of all. He had been saving
                   that till last, and then he writes one of the greatest pieces of
                   religious literature ever penned, which we identify as 1 Corin-
                   thians 13 (there were no chapter or verse divisions in the origi-
                   nal letter).
                      The theme is charity a seventeenth-century translation of the
                   Greek agape, which has long since been more meaningfully
                   rendered as love, and that of the loftiest kind. Without posses-
                   sion of this gift, says Paul, we are nothing. We might have the
                   gift of tongues or prophecy, the ability to understand all mys-
                   teries and specialized knowledge, mountain-moving faith, un-
                   selfish willingness to face martyrdom by burning, yet if spiritual
                   love does not inspire and permeate the exercise of those gifts,
                   their use is profitless. The all-surpassing greatness of love need
                   not surprise us, for the highest definition of God is the so-well-
                   known, but still so-little-understood declaration—"God is
                   love." Small wonder, then, that we can only possess that
                   greatest of all qualities as His supreme gift.

                     What position does love occupy in Paul's list of Spirit-given
                   fruits? Gal. 5:22, 23.

                      The priority given to love (agape) in this listing of finest Chris-
                   tian qualities and the unequivocal exaltation of love in the
                   Corinthian letter convince us of the necessity of having love as
                   the spiritual essence that gives special flavor to all other noble
                   gifts.
                      "Supreme love for God and unselfish love for one another—
                   this is the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This
                   love is not an impulse, but a divine principle, a permanent
                   power. The unconsecrated heart cannot originate or produce it.
                   Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found. 'We love Him,
                   because He first loved us.' In the heart renewed by divine grace,
                   love is the ruling principle of action."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                   p. 551.
THINK IT THROUGH    How earnestly do we desire the Holy Spirit to,give us, in full
                   measure, the greatest of His many gifts?

        AND OWNER
                      "The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of
                    Eden to dress it and to keep it" (Gen. 2:15).

                        Nothing could have been more natural to Adam than to ac-
                     cept the God-given work of gardening. He was occupier of the
                     largest country estate ever owned by man, and with undimmed
                     mind and unsapped strength he must have delighted in the duty
                     of caring for the natural glories that surrounded him. When Eve
                     stood by his side, they had the joy of planning a leisurely,
                     unrestricted development of the endless resources that were
                     theirs, with no sin-born handicaps to turn pleasure into a bur-
                     den. Yet even in their innocence they were but tenants, placed
                     in newly created perfection "to dress it and to keep it."
                        "So long as they remained loyal to the divine law, their capac-
                     ity to know, to enjoy, and to love would continually increase.
                     They would be constantly gaining new treasures of knowledge,
                     discovering fresh springs of happiness, and obtaining clearer
                     and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing love
                     of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 51.

                       To whom has the earth always belonged? Deut. 10:14; Ps.
                     24:1.

                       Since God is the Most High, He does not answer to any higher
                     power, but to Himself alone. All He sees—and He sees all—
                     belongs to Him. As Creator, He is also the Owner. But being free
                     of any taint of egotism or selfishness, He does not hug His
                     boundless wealth to Himself; rather, He finds satisfaction in
                     sharing responsibility for its use with those whom He has
                     created. Even after sin had spoiled their paradise, our first
                     parents continued as stewards of their Lord's property, though
                     under much less pleasant circumstances. But God did not re-
                     place them, and men and women have ever since been His
                     agents, whether they knew it or not, answerable to the divine
                     Landlord, even though most of them do not acknowledge His
                     ownership.
                       "The earth is the Lord's, and all the treasures it contains. The
                     cattle upon a thousand hills are His. All the gold and silver
                     belongs to Him. He has entrusted His treasures to stewards, that
                     with them they may advance His cause and glorify His

           Part 2     Under God's government, what was the plan for Israel's
    RELIGION AND    support of its priesthood? How might it fail?
      ARITHMETIC
                      "Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
                    Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve,
                    even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation" (Num.
                    18:21).

                       The Levites were set apart for full-time sacred service on
                    behalf of Israel and had no time in which to earn their own living.
                    The Lord therefore ordained that they should be supported by
                    one tenth, or a tithe, from the income of the members of the
                    other eleven tribes. "But the tithing system did not originate
                    with the Hebrews. From the earliest times the Lord claimed a
                    tithe as His, and this claim was recognized and honored. Abra-
                    ham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God.
                    ... Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and a wanderer, promised the
                    Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth
                    unto Thee.' ... As the Israelites were about to be established as a
                    nation, the law of tithing was reaffirmed as one of the divinely
                    ordained statutes upon obedience to which their prosperity
                    depended."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 525.

                      Note the Bible's record that the custom of tithing continued
                    among God's chosen people over a span of eight to nine
                    hundred years. 2 Chron. 31:5, 6; Neh. 10:37, 38.

                       If we accept the fifteenth century B.C. as the time of the
                    Exodus, about 700 years elapsed before Hezekiah came to
                    Judah's throne, some 5 years before Samaria fell to the Assyr-
                    ians in 721 B.C. Hezekiah brought his people back to the Lord.
                    Among other reforms, he encouraged them to renewed faith-
                    fulness in tithing and in offerings for support of the temple
                    services. About 120 years later (about 605 B.C.) Judah fell to
                    Nebuchadnezzar, and the Jews were deported to Babylon,
                    where they eventually established a Jewish way of life. When a
                    large body returned to Judah in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah
                    (457 and 445 B.C.), we find them ready to pay tithes to the
                    Levites and resolving not to "forsake the house of our God"
                    (Neh. 10:39). Some 40 years afterward, however, religious fervor
                    had cooled; and Malachi had to exhort both priests and people
                    to renewed faithfulness in worship and in support of their relig-
                     ion. It is thus clear that not only did tithing precede God's rule
                     over Israel, but that it continued and survived it; and, as New
                    Testament readers know, it was practiced in Christ's own day
                     (Matt. 23:23).

 THINK IT THROUGH      Consider tithing, not as an imposed requirement, but as a
                     fair principle suited to all peoples.

                       "Thither shall ye bring your burnt offerings, and your sac-
                    rifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and
                    your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of
                    your herds and of your flocks" (Deut. 12:6).

                        Tithes supported the Levites in the performance of their sa-
                     cred duties, while the freewill offerings made possible the many
                     other forms of religious and charitable service that belonged to
                     Israel.
                        "The contributions required of the Hebrews for religious and
                     charitable purposes amounted to fully one fourth of their
                     income."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 527. "There are many
                     who have looked upon the Jewish nation as a people to be pitied
                     because they were constantly taxed for the support of their
                     religion; but God, who created man and provided him with all
                     the blessings he enjoys, knew what was for his best good. And
                     through His blessing He made their nine tenths worth more to
                     them than the entire amount without His blessing."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 404.

                        There is great significance for the church in Paul's en-
                      dorsement of the principle on which tithing is based. 1 Cor.
                      9:11-14.

                        As the church grew, its members realized the need of system-
                     atic giving for the support of its ministry and the furtherance of
                     the gospel. In the ancient custom of tithing there was a ready-
                     made system that had divine approval and would meet the
                     Christian community's needs. The plan distributes responsibil-
                     ity on a proportionate basis, "For unto whomsoever much is
                     given, of him shall be much required" (Luke 12:48); while the
                     converse is also true, he who has little being only expected to
                     contribute little.
                        A similar principle applies to freewill offerings. However, we
                     should always remember the widow and her mite (Mark 12:41-
                     44)! Gaining wealth becomes a habit easily, and it is danger-
                     ously possible to hug more to onself as one obtains more. The
                     Master knew this, and so He warned His followers: "Beware of
                     covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance
                     of the things he possesseth." He then told of the covetous but
                     foolish farmer who built bigger barns instead of sharing some of
                     his prosperity with needy neighbors. (See Luke 12:15-21.)

THINK IT THROUGH       The claim that nine tenths with God's blessings goes farther
                     than ten tenths without it is unusual arithmetic, but many
                     Christians have "proved" God in this matter. Have we?

                                                                   November 25
          Part 4      Our possessions are not limited to money and the goods that
       RELIGION     money can buy. There are other gifts, whether seen or not, of
       AND OUR      which a Christian is called to be a steward. The Lord has given
    POSSESSIONS     these for a twofold purpose—for our enjoyment and for the
                    benefit of others. Most of us are well able to fulfill the first
                    goal—we instinctively take care of ourselves. But it is all too
                    easy for us to neglect the second—our use of the other gifts to
                    bring happiness to others.

                      Which scripture expresses the principle on which such use
                    of gifts Is based?

                      "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to him-
                    self" (Rom. 14:7).

                      Whether we like it or not, our lives touch those of our
                    neighbors. We therefore need a sympathetic awareness of their
                    circumstances and outlook and a willingness to meet their
                    needs. We all have possessions the use of which might benefit
                    others besides ourselves—there are our homes, our gardens
                    and their produce, our cars, our tools, our skills. Stewardship in
                    such areas comes so easily to some, with such effort to others,
                    but it is possible for all who yield to the Spirit's promptings.

                     Note Jesus' summary of His disicples' duty toward others.
                    Matt. 10:7, 8.

                      This commission was not given to the Twelve alone. Its
                    motivating principle, that of service based on gratitude, applies
                    equally well to us today. We can be useful stewards of our
                    intellectual gifts, our scriptural and spiritual knowledge, our
                    artistic talents, our musical abilities, our social accomplish-
                    ments, and our developing compassions. The hearts and minds
                    God has given us can be used for His glory and the salvation of
                    our neighbors.
                       "We should feel it our special duty to work for those living in
                    our neighborhood. Study how you can best help those who take
                    no interest in religious things. As you visit your friends and
                    neighbors, show an interest in their spiritual as well as in their
                    temporal welfare. Speak to them of Christ as a sin-pardoning
                    Saviour. Invite your neighbors to your home, and read with them
                    from the precious Bible and from books that explain its

              Part 5   On which vital points of true religion does James focus the
          RELIGION Christian's attention?
        AND OTHERS
                       "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
                     this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and
                     to keep himself unspotted from the world" (James 1:27).

                        This verse needs to be studied in its setting in order to avoid
                      an unbalanced interpretation of its message. It is the climax 10.
                      the writer's counsel begun in verse 22, where he stresses deeds
                      above words. His purpose in verse 27 is not to give a theological
                      definition of "pure religion and undefiled," but to explain that in
                      God's eyes genuine religion includes care of orphans and
                      widows, who represent all who need Christian compassion and
                      service. A necessary part of stewardship, then, is the use of
                      one's time, energy, sympathy, and money in the care of those
                      who cannot adequately care for themselves.

                        In what ways does Jesus' teaching of the Christian duty of
                      promptly caring for the unfortunate apply to us today? Luke
                      10:25-37.

                         The parable is too well known to need detailed exposition
                      here, but we might well note the two questions that led to its
                      application. "Master," inquired the lawyer, "what shall I do to
                      inherit eternal life?" Later, he asked, "Who is my neighbour?"
                      Christ's reply to the first inquiry emphasized the paramount
                      importance of love to God and to our neighbors, while the
                      second response established need as the basis for neighborly
                      assistance, though that need cut across racial and social prej-
                      udices. The application is nothing but practical: "Go, and do as
                      the Samaritan did!"
                         The Lord's instruction shows that stewardship includes the
                      generous use of compassion; first aid when no medical service
                      is at hand, the application of simple emergency remedies, the
                      use of our own car or other available means of transport to the
                      nearest medical facility, readiness to give financial aid where
                      needed, and a continuing interest in the welfare of the one we
                      have tried to help.
                        Christ "showed that our neighbor does not mean merely one
                      of the church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to
                      race, color, or class distinction. Our neighbor is every person
                      who needs our help."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 376.

                      selfishness in our religion?

Christian Stewardship         LESSON 9                                 111 Friday
                                                                    November 27
          Part 6      When the tithing plan is faithfully followed, of what may the
   BLESSINGS ON     participant be assured?
   STEWARDSHIP
                      "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may
                    be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the
                    Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
                    pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
                    receive it" (Mal. 3:10).

                       Here we find three good reasons for returning a tenth of our
                    total income to the Lord: (1) The plan is authorized by God. (2)
                    The plan is used by God for the support of His work on earth. (3)
                    Taking part in the plan produces God's rich blessing. While we
                    do not follow the plan to obtain the blessing, the blessing comes
                    when, in willing obedience to the divine urging, we bring "all the
                    tithes into the storehouse."
                       "If all the tithes of our people flowed into the treasury of the
                    Lord as they should, such blessings would be received that gifts
                    and offerings for sacred purposes would be multiplied tenfold,
                    and thus the channel between God and man would be kept
                    open."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 474.

                      What does Christ promise those who are generous givers?
                    Luke 6:38.

                      While the Master makes rigorous demands on His followers,
                    He also promises. rich rewards to those who follow His own
                    sacrificial example. Many a time the rewards will seem out of all
                    proportion to the relative little that we have given. They will be
                    "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and run-
                    ning over," until the recipient protests that he by no means
                    merits such abundant blessings—and that will be true. But the
                    harvest follows a divinely ordained formula—we reap what we
                    have sown. "He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bounti-
                    fully" (2 Cor. 9:6). The converse is also true—"he which soweth
                    sparingly shall reap also sparingly."
                       When it comes to giving, let us err on the side of generosity,
                    even if our gifts sometimes seem to go astray. "The followers of
                    Christ should not wait for thrilling missionary appeals to arouse
                    them to action. If spiritually awake, they would hear in the
                    income of every week, whether much or little, the voice of God
                    and of conscience with authority demanding the tithes and
                    offerings due the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 474.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Let each Sabbath School member review his or her own
                    record as a steward and ponder the blessings that have fol-
                    lowed faithfulness.

         IN THE OLD    selection. Consider their response.
         TESTAMENT
                         "For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord
                       thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
                       above all people that are upon the face of the earth" (Deut.
                       7:6).

                          Here and in similar passages (for example, Deut. 4:20; 14:2;
                       26:18, 19; Ex. 6:7; 19:5, 6) Scripture makes it clear that the Lord
                       called Israel from among all other nations to be an exhibit or
                       demonstration of what sinful men and women could become by
                       His enabling grace.
                         This divine intention had already been revealed by the rescue
                       of Noah and his family from the Flood (Gen. 6:5-9, 17, 18; 7:1;
                       9:8-17), in the call and career of Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3 and
                       onward), of Jacob (Gen. 28:10-15), and of the children of Israel
                       (Ex. 19:3-6). Through His chosen people God planned to bring
                       all others under his own kind rule for their true and lasting
                       happiness.

                         How does Stephen describe those with whom God made His
                       covenant at Sinai? Acts 7:37, 38.

                          Stephen stood before the Sanhedrin and, until he was vio-
                        lently stopped, reviewed God's providences as given from
                       Abraham to Solomon. Like Peter (Acts 3:22-26), he applied to
                        the incarnate Son of God the prophecy spoken by Moses con-
                        cerning the coming of a prophet. In Acts 7:38 Stephen identifies
                        the "prophet" with "the angel which spake to him [Moses] in the
                        mount Sina [that is, Sinai]," while he describes the Israelites as
                       "the church in the wilderness." In this setting, the word here
                       translated "church (ekklasia) would be better rendered "as-
                       sembly" or "congregation." At the same time, we must recog-
                       nize that Luke, the author of Acts, was writing for Christians and
                       that elsewhere in his book (19 times) he, without question, uses
                       ekklasia for "church." There is little doubt, then, that the New
                       Testament believers saw the Old Testament assembly or con-
                       gregation as the forerunner of the Christian church.

THINK IT THROUGH         As a member of His church, how far do I fulfill the Lord's
                       intent as given in Deuteronomy 7:6?

     FURTHER STUDY       The book par excellence for the study of the church is the
                       Epistle to the Ephesians. It is suggested that we slowly, thought-
                       fully, prayerfully consider selected passages for this week's
                       Further Study sections. The passage chosen for today is chap-
                       ter 1:1-10.

The Church      LESSON 10                                            ❑ Monday
                                                                   November 30
           Part 2    In what momentous words did the Master announce the
          IN THE founding of His church?
       MASTER'S
       MINISTRY      "I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
                  build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
                  it" (Matt. 16:18).

                      We should mark well the setting of this declaration (verses
                   13-20). The central question is the identity of the Son of man
                   (verse 13). The answer comes in Simon Peter's confession
                   (verse 16). Christ's reference to "my church" (verse 18) arises
                   from Peter's declaration and is not basic to it. From it we learn
                   that the church—My church, that is Christ's own churdh, the
                   Christian church—was not then built. Its construction lay still in
                   the future.
                      This does not deny the reality of the Old Testament church,
                   but it does spell a change from the earlier tradition. The change
                   was brought about by the Son's advent and the universal scope
                   of the institution He was then establishing. The founding of that
                   church was accompanied by no fanfare of trumpets, but by the
                   quiet announcement to the small circle of His chosen Twelve.
                   Through the faithful witness of those disciples, the church
                   reached out to the ends of the world and has drawn into its
                   fellowship people of every nation.
                      "Not on the rock of human strength, but on Christ Jesus, the
                   Rock of Ages, was the church founded, 'and the gates of hell
                   shall not prevail against it.' "—Prophets and Kings, pp. 595, 596.

                      What authority did Jesus bestow on the disciples for the
                    government of His church? Matt. 16:19; 18:18-20.

                      The Saviour knew His remaining days on earth were few. He
                    therefore placed authority upon Peter "as the representative of
                    the whole body of believers. . . .
                      " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ.
                    All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here
                    included."—The Desire of Ages, p. 413. But the disciples were
                    not left to their own methods. The Master's authority under-
                    girded them and their successors for the right conduct of the
                    church's business, and by His Spirit He was ever present to
                    guide them into right decisions. There is a neat phrase from the
                    Latin that sums up the relationship between the Lord and His
                    church—Where Christ is, there is the church.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is our level of awareness of Christ's lordship over the

             Part 3      When did significant growth begin in the early Christian
               THE     community? What was the cause of this growth?
         APOSTOLIC
           CHURCH        "Then they that gladly received his [Peter's] word were
                       baptized: and the same day there were added unto them
                       about three thousand souls" (Acts 2:41).

                         Until Pentecost the infant church was composed of those, few
                      in number, who had responded to Christ's own ministry. As a
                      result of Pentecost (sometimes known as "the birthday of the
                      church")—when the apostles had become the Spirit's effective
                      instruments—some 3000 accepted the Saviour's personal invi-
                      tation, answered His servants' appeals, were baptized, and
                      greatly strengthened the church. Their very number called for
                      organization and accelerated the development of church order.
                      But no infallible blueprint dropped from heaven; the leaders
                      adopted no ready-made, sophisticated system of government.
                      Instead, as the need arose, they engaged in prayer and group
                      discussion, sought the Spirit's counsel, followed it, and found
                      the best ways to conduct church business. (See Acts 6:1-8;
                      15:1-31.)

                         What fuller evidence does Acts provide concerning the de-
                       velopment of church organization? Acts 9:31; 20:28.

                        The preferred reading of Acts 9:31 speaks of "the church"
                      rather than "the churches." This is significant, for it harmonizes
                      with the Lord's own words that we studied in yesterday's lesson.
                      The reference is not to membership of local churches, but to a
                      corporate group of churches that together composed "the
                      church." The conversion of Saul brought ''''rest"—literally,
                      "peace"—to the persecuted Christians; and, as a result, the
                      church was "edified" or "built up" and grew as the number of
                      believers steadily increased.
                        With the exception of Acts 20:28, which speaks of "the church
                      of God"—a phrase which might justly be taken as a reference to
                      the church membership as a spiritual entity rather than as a
                      local congregation—the other 19 references in Acts to
                      "church" or "churches" are to local groups. The one apparent
                      exception (Acts 2:47) carries no weight, since the words "to the
                      church" do not appear in the best manuscripts. Luke's account,
                      however, does provide a picture of rapid growth, of the found-
                      ing of many groups of Christians, and of the emergence of the
                      concept of the church as embracing all believers in the ever-
                      increasing number of local congregations.

THINK IT THROUGH        As members of local congregations, what can we do to
                      strengthen ties with the worldwide church?

                                                                       December 2

     CHRIST AND       What strength is there for us in Christ's relationship to the
     HIS CHURCH     church and in the church's relationship to Christ?

                      "He is the head of the body, the church: who is the begin-
                    ning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might
                    have the preeminence" (Col. 1:18).

                       We use the week's memory verse to impress on our minds
                    Christ's first place in relation to the church. We would not wish
                    to lose sight of the Head while studying the body, for we recog-
                    nize that no living body exists apart from a living head. The
                    headship of Christ saves us from seeing the church as a late
                    development—an afterthought—and sets its genesis in times
                    eternal.
                       The human body is used in several scriptures to illustrate the
                    vital relationship that exists between Christ and His church (see
                    Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 1:22, 23; 4:15,16; 5:23, 30; Col.
                    1:24). In particular, our text emphasizes that Christ is the head
                    and the church is the body. This is more than an illustration—it
                    is an expression of a timeless truth. Christ, who is "the begin-
                    ning" and "beginner," who is "the first," "the preeminent,"
                    "the supreme"—He, as Creator, always has been and ever will
                    be first. He is also the controller, even as the head controls the
                    body. As the body is subject to the directives that come from the
                    head, so is the church subject to Christ. It can own no other
                    master and remain the church. Indeed, when the body ceases to
                    obey the head, it is diseased and on its way to death. Happy are
                    those sections of the church that with spiritual integrity ac-
                    knowledge Christ as their Head!

                      What exalted office does Christ fill as Head of the church?
                    Eph. 5:23.

                      The body cannot save itself or its head, except as it obeys the
                    injunctions that come from the head. The analogy is richly
                    fulfilled in Christ's ministry for the church. He not only saves it
                    by giving the right directives, protecting it from self-injury and
                    destruction; but He has given Himself—His own life—to save
                    the church from eternal death. If He, the Head, had not sacrifi-
                    cially died, the church would have no life. Indeed, it would have
                    been stillborn. How willingly subject to His kind biddings the
                    church ought then to be!

THINK IT THROUGH      As a part of the body of Christ, how obedient am Ito the
                    signals that come from the Head?

                                                                        December 3
           Part 5      What lessons can be drawn from New Testament titles that
     PICTURES OF     are given to the church?
     THE CHURCH
                        In addition to being called "the body of Christ" (1 Cor. 12:27;
                     Eph. 4:12), the Christian church is given these descriptions:
                        1. The temple of God. Eph. 2:19-22. There are several
                     illustrations taken from the building trade in this one of Paul's
                    many long sentences. Mention of "fellowcitizens" and "house-
                    hold" (verse 19) suggests a city and a house; "foundation" and
                     "cornerstone" (verse 20) refer to construction; "framed" and
                     "temple" and "habitation" (verses 21, 22) are linked to edifices;
                     while "built," "building," and "builded" specifically apply to
                    the erection of a temple. (Compare 1 Peter 2:5.) The Greek word
                     used here and generally in the epistles and the Revelation for
                    "temple" is naos, which refers to the inner sanctuary, and not
                    hieron, which is used for the complete temple complex. Naos
                    may therefore be translated as "sanctuary," which is most ap-
                    propriate to the spiritual concept of the individual Christian and
                    the corporate body of the church as being the dwelling place or
                    sanctuary of the Most High.
                        2. Jerusalem, the heavenly Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem.
                    Gal. 4:26; Heb. 12:22, 23; Rev. 21:2, 3. The image of the city may
                    not be so clear as that of the sanctuary. The revelator describes
                    the Holy City both as a "bride," "the Lamb's wife" (21:2, 9),
                    which is a clear reference to the church, and also as the capital
                    city of the new earth (verse 10). But there is no contradiction
                    here. John sees both the city and its holy inhabitants, or the city
                    containing the church. (Compare Psalm 48, which speaks of the
                    church as Mount Zion.)
                        3. Pillar and ground of the truth. 1 Tim. 3:15. The apostle
                    identifies "the house of God, which is the church of the living
                    God," which he then defines as "the pillar and ground [hed-
                    raidma, foundation or mainstay] of the truth." The thought is a
                    little complex, but one very important function of the church
                    emerges—it is to be the sustainer, and, by extension, the re-
                    pository of truth.
                        4. The kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven. Strictly
                    speaking, this is not a title for the church; but, for the duration of
                    human history, the kingdom and the church are almost identi-
                    cal. Matthew speaks almost exclusively of "the kingdom of
                    heaven," while Mark and Luke prefer "the kingdom of God,"
                    indicating that the different titles refer to the same kingdom,
                    which is closely related to the church.

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I, as a member of the church of the Living God, a conse-
                    crated unit, albeit small, in the sanctuary or habitation of my
                    God?

          Part 6     What qualities are expected of the remnant—the church

        CHURCH
                     "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
                   the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev.
                   14:12).

                      This latter-day church—specifically, the Seventh-day Advent-
                   ist Church—flourishing just prior to the return of the Son of man
                   (verses 13-16), will possess the regular qualities that have
                   characterized the true church in every age. (See S.D.A. Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 814, 815.) But to cope with the last-day
                   stresses, it will also need the special endowments listed in verse
                   12:
                      1. The patience of the saints. In the context of persecution
                   (compare Rev. 12:17) this covers more than forbearance. It
                   includes strong elements of fortitude, which saints need when
                   brought under the wrath of the dragon power.
                      2. Keep the commandments of God. In the original, there is
                   no word for "here" at this point. The phrase may therefore be
                   taken as a further definition of "saints"—they are command-
                   ment keepers. Since no one commandment is mentioned, we
                   may understand that God's nonceremonial commands are in-
                   tended, those in the Decalogue and others that have been given
                   to the church on other occasions since Sinai.
                      3. The faith of Jesus. This also further describes the saints.
                   In addition to keeping the commandments, they keep the faith
                   of Jesus—that is, they retain and use the faith that Jesus had, or
                   they keep their faith in Jesus. They will, in fact, retain both.

                     What is God's eternal purpose with respect to His church in
                   all ages? Eph. 3:8-11.

                     Since this passage is too rich in meaning to be studied in full
                   here, we can only consider the core (verses 10 and 11). God's
                   eternal intention has been that the church should be the
                   medium through which His manifold wisdom—multi-colored,
                   much-variegated, of infinite diversity and sparkling beauty—is
                   displayed to the watching universe, to the principalities and
                   powers in heavenly places. What a responsibility for the church!
                   "The church is the depositary of the wealth of the riches of the
                   grace of Christ, and through the church eventually will be made
                   manifest the final and full display of the love of God to the world
                   that is to be lightened with its glory."—Testimonies to Ministers,

                                                                        December 6
             Part 1       The Old Testament is well supplied with advance views of
          PATTERNS    God's solution to the problem of sin. From Genesis 3:15
                      through Genesis 4:3, 4; 8:20-22; 22:3-18 and onward, Scripture
                      gives partial revelations of the Lord's redemptive plans. In this
                      lesson we glimpse two of these illustrations.

                        What ceremony of remembrance, established in Israel
                      under the crisis of the Exodus from Egypt, pointed to the way
                      of salvation from sin and its penalty?

                         "It shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
                      you, What mean ye by this service? That ye shall say, It is the
                      sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses
                      of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyp-
                      tians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
                      head and worshipped" (Ex. 12:26, 27).

                        "The Passover was to be both commemorative and typical not
                      only pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but forward to
                      the greater deliverance which Christ was to accomplish in free-
                      ing His people from the bondage of sin. The sacrifical lamb
                      represents 'the Lamb of God,' in whom is our only hope of
                      salvation. Says the apostle, 'Christ our passover is sacrificed for
                      us.' 1 Corinthians 5:7. It was not enough that the paschal lamb
                      be slain; its blood must be sprinkled upon the doorposts; so the
                      merits of Christ's blood must be applied to the soul. We must
                      believe, not only that He died for the world, but that He died for
                      us individually. We must appropriate to ourselves the virtue of
                      the atoning sacrifice."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 277.

                       What other Exodus events foreshadowed the New Testa-
                      ment ordinance of baptism? 1 Cor. 10:1-4.

                        Jewish Christians and first-century converts had little if any
                      difficulty in following parallels between ancient historical oc-
                      currences and Christian teachings. They readily saw the cross-
                      ing of the Red Sea, the protective pillars of cloud and fire, the
                      water-giving rock, and the earlier rite of circumcision as
                      foreshadowings of the later and loftier revelations centered on
                      Christ and illustrated in the ordinances of baptism and the
                      Lord's Supper.

THINK IT THROUGH         If the partial revelations given in Old Testament times sus-
                      tained the faithful for 40 centuries, how much,more should the
                      historic realities of Christ's ministries and the certainty of His
                      return and reign in eternal glory sustain us!

                                                                    December 7
        Part 2   In what form is the rite of baptism introduced into the New
     BAPTISM—I Testament scene?

                     "John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism
                   of repentance for the remission of sins" (Mark 1:4).

                     Mark, as usual, is the most concise of the evangelists. Here he
                   records that John the Baptizer was baptizing in the wilderness,
                   that is, in the Jordan, after preaching in the barren territory
                   through which the river passed. He called his audiences to
                   confess and repent of their sins that they might find forgiveness.
                   Public baptism would proclaim their break with the past and the
                   new life that then began.
                     Baptism did not originate with John. It was already a Jewish
                   practice—a ceremonial washing by immersion—but without
                   the spiritual overtones that marked John's ministration. John's
                   call also had a still higher purpose—that of preparing his fol-
                   lowers for the appearance of the Messiah (verses 7, 8) and of
                   baptizing the Sinless One Himself (verse 9).

                     What trust did Jesus place upon His disciples immediately
                   before His ascension? Matt. 28:19, 20.

                      The disciples had already baptized those who were converted
                   by Christ's ministry (John 3:22 and 4:2); but now, possessing a
                   far deeper knowledge, they were given a much wider commis-
                   sion. Clothed with the Master's power over all things (Matt.
                   28:18), they were to go into all the world (Mark 16:15) and teach
                   (Matt. 28:19)—literally, "make disciples" (Greekmath6teud, not
                   didaskd, "teach," as used in Matt. 28:20)—all nations. A basic
                   part of their evangelism was to baptize converts in the threefold
                   name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost and instruct them in all
                   that Christ had taught His apostles. Thus, from its beginning,
                   admission to membership in the Christian church included the
                   rite of baptism (compare Mark 16:16). The remainder of the New
                   Testament record shows that the apostles faithfully fulfilled
                   their Lord's command.
                      "Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those
                   who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son,
                   and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life
                   declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan
                   and have become members of the royal family, children of the
                   heavenly King."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 91.

            Part 3    What connection did Jesus see between baptism and salva-
        BAPTISM—II tion?

                       "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
                     man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
                     kingdom of God" (John 3:5).

                        Jesus is here solemnly restating (note the repetition of "Ver-
                     ily, verily" from verse 3) the thought He had already expressed in
                     verse 3, namely, that the new birth is essential for all who would
                     see or enter the kingdom of God. He here reveals that the
                     experience must cover two distinct but closely related
                     stages—new birth by water baptism and new birth by the Holy
                     Spirit. The interlocking of the two is emphasized in the Greek by
                     the union of "water and spirit" in one phrase without any defi-
                     nite article for either noun. Christian teaching and experience
                     reveal that the Spirit's part in the new birth, and therefore in
                     salvation, must come before baptism to give the rite value and
                     must follow immersion in order to sustain its effect and bless-
                     ing.

                       What additional scriptural authority do we have for regard-
                     ing baptism as more than a picturesque ceremony? Rom.
                     6:3, 4.

                        The secular mind would see no more in baptism than an act of
                     purification. The informed Christian sees in the ordinance a
                     symbol of God's most mighty deed, which centered on the
                     death, burial, and resurrection of His Son. This makes the cere-
                     mony holy, clothing it with a spiritual meaning that goes beyond
                     the physical and visible act. It testifies that the participant has
                     died to the old life, that he has been buried, and that a new
                     person rises from the baptismal water to live a new life in union
                     with Christ.
                        "That the rite of Christian baptism is simply a symbol and
                     does not convey divine grace, is evident throughout the NT.
                     Unless a man believes in Jesus Christ (Acts 8:37; cf. Rom. 10:9)
                     and repents of sin (Acts 2:38; cf. ch. 19:18), baptism can be of no
                     value to him. In other words, there is no saving power in the rite
                     itself, apart from faith in the heart of the one receiving the rite.
                     From these considerations it is clear that infant baptism is a
                     meaningless procedure so far as the salvation of the child is
                     concerned. Baptism can become meaningful only when the
                     child is old enough to understand salvation, faith, and
                     repentance."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 298.

          Part 4     Immediately prior to Christ's passion, for which annual
       THE LAST    ceremony did the disciples prepare? For what purpose?
        SUPPER
                     "His disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found
                   as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover"
                   (Mark 14:16). (Read also verses 12, 13.)

                     For more than a thousand years, God's chosen people had
                   been celebrating their deliverance from Egyptian slavery and
                   keeping the Passover as the Lord had commanded. The heart of
                   the observance was the slain lamb, the use of its blood to
                   identify lsraelitish homes, and the eating of the roast flesh
                   immediately before flight from Egypt. (See Ex. 12:3-17.) Jesus
                   Himself must have shared in some 18 such anniversaries during
                   His human lifetime; and now, as faithful Jews, He and His disci-
                   ples prepared for what the Master alone knew would be His last
                   Passover supper. (For the chronology of this supper, see S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 532-537.)

                    What application did Jesus make of the Passover meal?
                   Mark 14:22-25.

                      He who, on the eve of His Palestinian ministry, had been
                   introduced to His fellow countrymen as "the Lamb of God,
                   which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29), was about
                   to fulfill His mission. It was eminently fitting, then, that this
                   fulfillment should come at the time of the observance of the
                   type, the Passover. The tragedy was that its true significance did
                   not then dawn on His followers' minds. Only later did they see
                   that "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" (1 Cor. 5:7).
                      "Christ was standing at the point of transition between two
                   economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb
                   of God, was about to present Himself as a sin offering, that He
                   would thus bring to an end the system of types and ceremonies
                   that for four thousand years had pointed to His death. As He ate
                   the Passover with His disciples, He instituted in its place the ser-
                   vice that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice. The na-
                   tional festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service
                   which Christ established was to be observed by His followers in
                   all lands and through all ages. . . .
                       "It is the means by which his great work for us is to be kept
                    fresh in our minds."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 652, 653.

             Part 5     What preparatory service had the Saviour instituted prior to
        THE LORD'S    celebrating the last Passover with His disciples?
           SUPPER
                        "He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and
                      took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water
                      into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to
                      wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded" (John
                      13:4, 5).

                         Blessing awaits those who meditate upon the service of foot
                      washing. The ceremony should be observed thoughtfully, re-
                      pentantly, humbly, sympathetically, lovingly, and in true frater-
                      nity of spirit. It should be observed with insight into our own and
                      our partner's needs, remembering the quality of love that Christ
                      brought into His own washing of His followers' feet. There is
                      more opportunity for blessing when observance takes place in
                      small groups unpressured by space and time, with each pair of
                      partners enjoying spiritual leisure to savor the uplift that comes
                      from bending low in loving service.

                        How did Jesus sanctify the bread and wine of the Passover
                      supper? Matt. 26: 26-29.

                         In chapter 72 of The Desire of Ages, pages 652-661, Ellen G.
                      White employs at least seven distinctive titles for the second
                      service held in the upper room. After reference to "two great
                      festivals" it is called "the memorial of His great sacrifice," "the
                      ordinance of the Lord's Supper," "the sacramental service,"
                      "the administration of the sacrament," "the communion ser-
                      vice," and "the holy communion."
                        The communion emblems received special attention from our
                      Lord. The bread He blessed and broke, distributing a portion to
                      each disciple; for the wine He gave thanks (Greek eucharisted,
                      "to give thanks," whence the word Eucharist); and He passed
                      the cup around that each might drink from it. How precious
                      would be the apostles' remembrance of that holy occasion!

                                                                   December 11
          Part 6     Let us now reverently review the description of the Lord's
   IN MEMORIAM     Supper as recorded by Paul in A.D. 57, about 26 years after the
                   Saviour introduced the service in Jerusalem (A.D. 31). 1 Cor.
                   11:23-29.

                      1. Paul's account was given in the setting of strife in Corinth
                   (1 Cor. 11:17-22). It represents his appeal to the church for unity
                   and koinonia—"communion" or "fellowship" (1 Cor. 10:16,17).
                      2. He was here recording what he had already given the
                   church verbally, namely, that which he had "received of the
                   Lord."         •
                      3. The setting for the most holy of all services was the night
                   Jesus was betrayed. The reaction to the sad fact would be a new
                   declaration of loyalty, a strengthening of unity among disciples.
                      4. Christ is calm against the background of His impending
                   cruel death. He gives thanks (eucharisted) for the bread which
                   takes the place of the Passover lamb, which is no longer needed
                   now that the antitype, the Lamb of God, is offering Himself for
                   the sins not only of Israel but of the whole world.
                      5. Christ breaks the bread, symbolizing the wounding of His
                   own body on the cross. As in the foot washing, so in the Supper
                   itself: the Master serves the servants. He distributes the emblem
                   of His bodily sacrifice, telling them that He is making the sac-
                   rifice for their sakes and bidding them continue the practice in
                   remembrance of His redemptive ministry. Could they ever
                   forget?
                      6. He then similarly serves the cup, that is, the wine in the
                   common cup, as the emblem of His blood, so soon to be spilled
                   on their behalf. He then reveals that it "is the new testament" or
                   the "new covenant" of Jeremiah 31:31-34 at last—after cen-
                   turies of the shedding of animal blood as a type—ratified by the
                   lifeblood of the Sinless Sacrifice. As with the bread, this shar-
                   ing, too, is to be repeated in remembrance of what He is about to
                    do.
                      7. The sharing of the bread and wine is to be more than a re-
                   freshing observance. It is to be a proclamation of His redeem-
                   ing death and of His intention to return and gather them into His
                   Father's kingdom (Matt. 26:29).

                     In one fleeting lesson we can only touch the fringes of mean-
                   ing found in this sacred service. Each celebration will, if we
                   earnestly request it, yield deeper, richer revelations of God's
                   love for us as shown in Christ Jesus our Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why resolve never willingly to miss sharing in the regular
                   celebration of the Lord's Supper?

                                                                      December 13
             Part 1   In His evangelistic instruction to the Twelve, what promise
        ESSENTIAL did Jesus make to those who would publicly acknowledge Him
      QUALIFICATION as Lord?

                       "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him
                     will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven" (Matt.
                     10:32).

                        At first sight this might appear a commonplace statement—a
                     bargain struck between two parties: you speak up for me, and I
                     will speak up for you. But the setting for Christ's words forbids
                     such an easy analysis. He has commissioned His disciples
                     (verses 1-4) and instructed them in their mission (verses 5-15),
                     forewarned them of its often dangerous nature (verses 16-28),
                     and now acquaints them with a law. Their confession—their
                     public acknowledgement of Him as their Lord and Saviour—will
                     enable Him to acknowledge them as His own before His
                     heavenly Father. They will have declared themselves to be His
                     followers, His servants, His representatives; they will have suf-
                     fered for loyalty to His cause.
                       The day will come when Christ will be proud to testify in God's
                     presence that His disciples have been faithful ministers and are
                     worthy of being with Him eternally. But there are two sides to the
                     picture. Those who publicly deny Him cannot then expect Him
                     to claim them as His own, for He must be truthful and say, "I
                     never knew you: depart from me" (Matt. 7:23). Confession of or
                     witnessing to the lordship of Christ is therefore a matter of life
                     or death.

                       What was an essential qualification for apostleship? Luke
                     24:48; Acts 1:8, 21, 22.

                        Christ bequeathed to His disciples the task of continuing the
                     work that He had begun. They were to testify to the miracle of
                     the incarnation as "eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Peter 1:16),
                     observers of His sinless life, His sacrificial death, His triumphant
                     resurrection, and His glorious ascension. This was then their
                     lifelong calling. The New Testament shows how humbly willing
                     they were to accept this task as soon as the cloud had received
                     their beloved Master out of their sight (Acts 1:9; Luke 24:51-53).

THINK IT THROUGH       Try to grasp the splendor and awesomeness of the respon-
                     sibility that came to the disciples after the ascension.

Christian Witness      LESSON 12                                     ❑ Monday
                                                                   December 14
          Part 2  After John the Baptist's testimony concerning the Lamb of
      THE FIRST God (John 1:29), who first bore witness to Jesus as the Mes-
      WITNESSES siah?

                     "He [Andrew] first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith
                   unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being inter-
                   preted, the Christ" (John 1:41).

                     The Baptist's inspired example in testifying to the divinity and
                   office of our Lord quickly bore fruit in the transfer of two of his
                   own disciples to the group that formed around the person of
                   Jesus of Nazareth. The two who left the Baptist to follow Jesus
                   were Andrew and John. The former became the first Christian
                   missionary as he testified, "We have found the Messias"—
                   which confident declaration has been termed, "this great
                   Eureka" (from the Greek heurEkamen, "we have found").

                     One day later, what further personal witness was given by
                   one who had already been directly recruited by Jesus? John
                   1:43-45.

                      The spiritual magnetism that flowed from Jesus fires Philip to
                   find Nathanael and to announce, "We have found him." But his
                   confidence seems to have fallen short of Andrew's. He does not
                   boldly announce the Messiah; rather, he contents himself by
                   referring to the One of whom Moses and the prophets had
                   written—"Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph" (verse 45)—
                   stressing the humanity rather than the divinity of the newfound
                   Leader. But the witness bore good fruit. After some hesitation,
                   Nathanael acknowledged the Man from Nazareth to be "the Son
                   of God" (verse 49). It would be unfair to expect a full under-
                   standing of Jesus' nature at a first meeting, but both Philip and
                   Nathanael made a commendable beginning, and both proved to
                   be faithful apostles. Such was the fruitage of this early personal
                   witness by one to another.

                     What effect did her discovery of Jesus have on the Samari-
                   tan woman at Sychar? John 4:28-30, 39-42.

                     The woman had the greatest of blesgings in a long personal
                   interview with the Messiah. She immediately bore witness to the
                   Stranger, speaking with such fervor that many of her fellow
                   townspeople believed on Him, while others were convicted
                   "because of his own word" (John 4:41).

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the common factor in these three witnessing
                   events? What can we learn from them concerning the science
                   of witnessing?

        MIRACLES
                      "Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go
                    home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord
                    hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee" (Mark
                    5:19).

                      Mark and Luke (Luke 8:27) mention one demoniac only, but
                    Matthew (Matt. 8:28) speaks of two. The three writers record the
                    request to remain with the Healer and that Christ gave the
                    commission, instead, to share news of the cure with friends.
                    "The two restored demoniacs were the first missionaries whom
                    Christ sent to preach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a
                    few moments only these men had been privileged to hear the
                    teachings of Christ. Not one sermon from His lips had ever fallen
                    upon their ears. . . . But they bore in their own persons the
                    evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell what they
                    knew; what they themselves had seen, and heard, and felt of the
                    power of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 340.

                     When the greatest of all miracles took place, how did those
                    who first learned of it respond?

                       The most notable proclaimers of the resurrection were the
                    following people:
                       Mary Magdalene (John 20:18)
                       Mary Magdalene and the other Mary (Matt. 28:1, 7-10)
                       Peter (Luke 24:34)
                       Cleopas and friend at Emmaus (Luke 24:13, 33-35)
                       At first, there were mixed reactions to the amazing, unbeliev-
                    able news that the crucified Jesus had risen from His tomb; but
                    when Mary Magdalene personally met Him in the garden and
                    other meetings followed, doubt began to disappear. (See John
                    20:20.)
                       Ere long, the once-frightened group, empowered by the
                    Spirit, gave bold witness to the truth of the resurrection. Peter
                    first proclaimed it at Pentecost, others followed, and Saul, hav-
                    ing met the Resurrected One, preached that "he is the Son of

                    witnessed to its reality and its redeeming power.

Christian Witness      LESSON 12                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 16
          Part 4     What was the driving power behind Paul's tireless witness?
      SECRET OF
     WITNESSING      "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus
                   judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead" (2 Cor. 5:14).

                     A moment's thought reveals two possible interpretations of
                   the phrase "the love of Christ"—it refers either to the love which
                   Christ has for us, or the love which we have for Christ, or both
                   meanings are valid. But the significance of these few words is
                   best discovered in the context of this well-known verse, and for
                   that one needs to pick up the thread of thought in 2 Corinthians
                   4:1.
                     Paul has received a commission (compare Acts 9:15, 16),
                   which he fulfills by openly sharing the light of the glorious
                   gospel of Christ (2 Cor. 4:2, 4) which had illumined his own life
                   (verses 5, 6). Such sharing was only done at great personal cost
                   (verses 8-12), but he willingly paid the price because he knew
                   the value of the eternal in contrast to the temporal (verses
                   16-18). Knowledge that all must appear in judgment (2 Cor. 5:10)
                   drives him to address his appeal to all men (verse 11). Indeed,
                   the love of Christ and the knowledge that He died for all "leaves
                   us no choice" (verse 14, NEB). Those who share this knowledge
                   should no longer live for themselves, but for Christ, who died
                   and rose again (verse 15).
                      The climax to this close-knit reasoning is reached in verses
                   18-21, where Paul shares with the Corinthians and with us his
                   understanding of the redeeming love of God revealed in Christ's
                   ministry. It is this that impels Paul's own evangelistic witness.
                   We, in turn, shall only be fired for similar witness when a similar
                   love possesses us. Therein lies the secret of genuine
                   evangelism. When we find it, we shall say, with Peter and John,
                   "We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
                   heard" (Acts 4:20). "No sooner is one converted than there is
                   born within him a desire to make known to others what a pre-
                   cious friend he has found in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying
                   truth cannot be shut up in his heart. . . .
                      "Men may combat and defy our logic, they may resist our
                   appeals; but a life of disinterested love is an argument they
                   cannot gainsay."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 141, 142.

                   our understanding of what God has done for us in His Son?

Christian Witness       LESSON 12                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                     December 17
           Part 5    What did Jesus recommend as an effective and essential
        HOW TO      way of witnessing, and to what purpose?
        WITNESS
                      "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
                    good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matt.
                    5:16).

                       This counsel arises from the giving of the Beatitudes (verses
                    1-12) and the observation that true Christians are the salt and
                    the light of the world (verses 13-15). But even the brightest of
                    lights is useless unless its beams are allowed to illumine its
                    surroundings. Jesus is thus exhorting us so to live the truly
                    godly life that our conduct, especially "our good works," will
                    bring glory to God. The persuasive power of the dedicated life
                    that leads others to follow the same Lord brings our Father the
                    greatest glory of all, for it increases the number of those who
                    adore and serve Him.
                       "Let us remember that a Christlike life is the most powerful
                    argument that can be advanced in favor of Christianity, and that
                    a cheap Christian character works more harm in the world than
                    the character of a worldling. Not all the books written can serve
                    the purpose of a holy life. Men will believe, not what the minister
                    preaches, but what the church lives."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
                    21

                      In addition to the living of godly lives, what worldwide form
                    of witness are Christians called to render? Mark 16:15.

                       It was by scattering that the gospel was first carried beyond
                    the boundry of Jerusalem, and it is by this same law that the
                    gospel will be spread today. The quality of believers' lives is a
                    first means of sharing the good news; but if no other steps are
                    taken, we shall not be fulfilling the divine command. We must
                    "go . . . into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
                    creature," either by personal service beyond our local setting or
                    by sending others who are able to go where we cannot. "All who
                    are ordained unto the life of Christ are ordained to work for the
                    salvation of their fellow men. The same longing of soul that He
                    felt for the saving of the lost is to be manifest in them. . . . All
                    upon whom God's blessings have been bestowed are to re-
                    spond by actual service; every gift is to be employed for the
                    advancement of His kingdom."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 16.

Christian Witness      LESSON 12                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                     December 18
          Part 6   For what comprehensive purpose did the Lord personally
      CHRISTIAN call Saul of Tarsus to be His witness?
       WITNESS
                   "To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
                 and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive
                 forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
                 sanctified by faith that is in me" (Acts 26:18).

                      The real meaning of this verse is best grasped by reading
                   verses 16 and 17, which show that Christ appeared to Saul to
                   make him "a minister and a witness" to the Gentiles for their
                   eternal salvation. This purpose is not restricted to the dramatic
                   call that came to Saul, for "every true disciple is born ihto the
                   kingdom of God as a missionary."—The Desire of Ages, p. 195.
                   We, therefore, can be witnesses who will open eyes that are
                   spiritually blind, turning them from the darkness of unbelief to
                   the light of the gospel, from bondage to Satan to freedom in
                   God. Such witness is able first to bring our friends pardon from
                   sin and holiness of life, then a place in the kingdom of God.
                      "You are not to wait for great occasions or to expect extraor-
                   dinary abilities before you go to work for God. You need not
                   have a thought of what the world will think of you. If your daily
                   life is a testimony to the purity and sincerity of your faith, and
                   others are convinced that you desire to benefit them, your
                   efforts will not be wholly lost."—Steps to Christ, p. 83.

                     What twofold result will flow from our fulfillment of the high
                   calling given us by God? 1 Peter 2:9-12.

                     Those whom God has chosen to be His own people and who
                   have themselves responded to that choice will (1) display in
                   their own characters the virtues of the One who has called them
                   out of spiritual darkness (verse 9) and (2) find that nonbelievers
                   observing Christians' faithful adherence to their declared prin-
                   ciples (verse 11) will themselves be led to glorify God (verse 12).
                      Witness that bears such welcome fruitage must be of a high
                   order. It is possible for all who faithfully fulfill that high calling
                   by living Christlike lives.
                     The picture painted by Peter is really a portrait of the Christian
                   that should be produced by daily adherence to the total body of
                   doctrine. Unless profession of belief results in such a life, that
                   profession will not lead to salvation. This is in no sense salvation
                   by works—it concerns the presence or absence of fruitage from
                   our beliefs.

           Part 1     How may we obtain the peace of mind so much sought after

            LIFE
                      "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
                    on thee: because he trusteth in thee" (Isa. 26:3).

                       The prophet proposes two steps to serenity—first, staying,
                    fixing, or reposing the mind on the Eternal; second, trusting in
                    the Lord. He who takes these steps is assured of mental and
                    spiritual peace. He is encouraged (verse 4) to trust in the Lord at
                    all times because the Eternal is the Rock of Ages and well able to
                    bring peace of mind to those who commit their ways to Him. The
                    New Testament version of this promise can be found in Philip-
                    pians 4:6, 7.
                       Brother Lawrence, a remarkable lay brother who joined a
                    religious community in Paris in 1666, described Isaiah's
                    program as "The Practice of the Presence of God." "The time of
                    business," said he, "does not with me differ from the time of
                    prayer; and in the noise and clutter of my kitchen, while several
                    persons are at the same time calling for different things, I pos-
                    sess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the
                    Blessed Sacrament."—The Practice of the Presence of God,
                    1977 ed. (London: Mowbrays), p. 23.

                      By what means does God intend that we may renew our
                    physical and spiritual strength? Isa. 40:31.

                       This counsel must be tried to be trusted. Those who have
                    waited on the Lord in prayer have found new reserves of
                    strength that have hitherto been unsuspected. They have risen
                    from their knees refreshed and have been able to do exploits
                    that were earlier considered impossible. This "practice" is not
                    acquired in a day. It is realized only after persistent observance.
                    But a host of Christians will testify to its reality and reliability,
                    and we can join their ranks by following their example.
                       "All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for
                    communion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God....
                    When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait
                    before him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice
                    of God. He bids us, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' ... This is
                    the effectual preparation for all labor for God. Amidst the hurry-
                    ing throng, and the strain of life's intense activities, he who is

The Life That Counts        LESSON 13                                  ❑ Monday
                                                                     December 21
          Part 2    What benediction does the Saviour pronounce upon those
   OUR ASPIRING    who cherish high spiritual goals?
            LIFE
                     "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righ-
                   teousness: for they shall be filled" (Matt. 5:6).

                      Blessed are those who feel hungry and thirsty for the right, for
                   they shall be satisfied. Those spoken of in this beatitude must
                   have a finely honed conscience that leads them to want that
                   righteousness or justice, or what is right. This is not often a
                   comfortable doctrine. It is easier to eat and drink the world's
                   fare than to aspire to the finer heavenly diet. But it is possible to
                   develop an appetite for whatsoever things are true, honest, just,
                   pure, lovely, and of good report (Phil. 4:8). Much depends on the
                   food which we feed our souls. If physical diet affects our
                   spiritual appetites—and it does—our mental food has an even
                   greater effect on our spiritual health. We must set our affections
                   "on things above, not on things on the earth" (Col. 3:2). And in
                   the matter of "happiness," or "blessedness," it is well to re-
                   member this truth: "Happiness is not, essentially, something we
                   have, but something we are, though we become what we are by
                   doing."—Gerald Vann, The Divine Pity (New York: Fontana
                   Books, 1962), p. 94.

                      In the light of His faultless knowledge, what counsel on
                   "first things" does Jesus give His followers? Matt. 6:33.

                      For most of us this is a hard doctrine, for "the things which are
                   seen" so easily claim our attention and affection; the unseen
                   seems so far away and easy to neglect. But herein lies the heart
                   of the Christian philosophy of life—the seen is temporal be-
                   cause "the world passeth away, and the lust thereof"; the un-
                   seen is eternal, and "he that doeth the will of God abideth for
                   ever" (1 John 2:17). Christ does not ignore everyday needs, but
                   He assigns them their rightful place while the Christian seeks
                   first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. And this, when
                   we pause to think it through, leaves no area of our lives un-
                   touched.
                      "Those who are willing to make any sacrifice for eternal life,
                   will have it; and it will be worth suffering for, worth crucifying
                   self for, and sacrificing every idol for. The far more exceeding
                   and eternal weight of glory swallows up everything and eclipses
                   every earthly pleasure."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 126.

THINK IT THROUGH     What does my present daily program reveal about my
                   spiritual interests? Are they temporal, or eternal? Where does
                   God and His concept of right stand in my list?

                                                                     December 22
           Part 3      Today's study embraces us all, married and single, for we all
      OUR FAMILY    have family ties, distant though some of them may seem to be.
            LIFE    We all have had a father and mother; we all are children, grow-
                    ing or grown. And if we now stand without immediate close
                    family connections, we create our own familial world for domes-
                    tic purposes and in addition rub shoulders with other family
                    units. How, then, shall we order this daily responsibility of family
                    living?

                      What is the first request framed for us in our Lord's "family"
                    prayer?

                      "Give us this day our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11).

                       It is by no accident that these familiar words find their place
                    early in our Master's model prayer. Just before them, He gives
                    the petition that God's will should be done on earth as it is done
                    in heaven (verse 10). Then He follows them with the request for
                    pardon in respect to neighborly relations (verse 12). The prime
                    reference in verse 11, then, is to spiritual food, and that on a
                    daily basis. Since we do not go to church each day, this calls for
                    taking that food at home; and this calls for "family" worship,
                    with father, mother, and children if that is how we live, or by
                    ourselves if our family unit has been dispersed by time or cir-
                    cumstance or if we otherwise live alone.
                      It is hardly possible to overstress the importance of family
                    worship in our daily spiritual life. There can be only one com-
                    petitor for first place there, namely, the personal devotions of
                    each member of the family. After that, family worship holds the
                    central position. Its faithful observance, morning and evening,
                    keeps the parents in daily touch with the Infinite and opens the
                    children's hearts to the converting influence of the Holy Spirit.

                      What should be the holy ambition of each Christian parent?
                    Eph. 6:4.

                      After the very necessary negative admonition against goad-
                    ing children to resentment by harsh discipline, Paul offers par-
                    ents this positive counsel: "Give them the instruction, and the
                    correction, which belong to a Christian upbringing" (Eph. 6:4,
                    NEB). Happy the family where this advice is followed!

THINK IT THROUGH      What is our experience in family worship? How can we
                    improve its quality? What suggestions for worship at home
                    can we share with our fellow class members?

The Life That Counts        LESSON 13                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    December 23
          Part 4     What standard of honesty is expected of Christians?
     OUR SOCIAL
           LIFE      "Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old
                   man with his deeds; and have put on the new man, which is
                   renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created
                   him" (Col. 3:9, 10).

                     Christian doctrine holds before its followers an extremely
                   high moral and social standard that comes from the character
                   of Christ, who is truth personified. If we then "be risen with
                   Christ" (verse 1), we shall not wish to lie "one to another," for
                   such conduct is alien to the new men and women who are ever
                   gaining a fresh personal knowledge of Christ until they them-
                   selves take on their Creator's image.

                     How will our new life affect our social relations, and how
                   shall we find the spiritual resources to achieve the Christian
                   ideal? Col. 3:11-13.

                      In verse 11 Paul is swiftly covering the population of the world
                   in which the early Christians lived. By "Greek" he refers to
                   non-Jews from a national-political point of view, as distinct from
                   the chosen people. "Circumcision" and "uncircumcision"
                   cares for religious differences; "Barbarian" cares for linguistic
                   distinctions; "Scythian" covers those outside the bounds of
                   civilization. Having thus dealt with various classes into which
                   the human family was then divided, he formulates the Christian
                   response to these sin-induced divisions—"Christ is all, and in
                   all," that is, Christ identifies Himself with each and all of these
                   sections of human society. It is now for us to apply this undi-
                   luted Christian approach to our present world situation. This is
                   not easy. Some find it the hardest test of their religious sincerity.
                   We all need the fine qualities listed in verses 12 and 13 in order
                   to reach the ideal conduct.
                      "Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or
                   creed.... [He] came to break down every wall of partition....
                      "The life of Christ established a religion in which there is no
                   caste, a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are
                   linked in a common brotherhood, equal before God. No ques-
                   tion of policy influenced His movements."—Gospel Workers, p.
                   46.

            Part 5     In view of the high standard required of Christians in all
      OUR QUALITY    aspects of daily life, what Christlike qualities should we delib-
           OF LIFE   erately cultivate?

                       "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,
                     bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
                     longsuffering; forebearing one another, and forgiving one
                     another" (Col. 3:12, 13).

                        Here we again meet the biblical picture of clothing ourselves
                     with clean garments. (Compare Isa. 52:1; 61:10; Matt. 22:11-14.)
                     But we must also heed the counsel not to use high-flown senti
                     ments as a cloak to disguise our true natures (John 15:22;
                     1 Thess. 2:5; 1 Peter 2:16). We are to be genuine, "the elect of i
                     God, holy and beloved." We are to possess compassionate
                     hearts, a hard-hearted Christian being an impossible kind of
                     creature. As John Ruysbroek, the fourteenth-century Flemish
                     mystic, has said: "Be kind, be kind, and you will be saints." That
                     is not the whole truth, for sainthood requires much more than
                     kindness; but saints must be kind! They must also be humble,
                     meek, patient, tolerant of others' weaknesses, and ready to
                     forgive. As always, Christ is the model.

                       To which three virtues does Paul give exceptional em-
                     phasis? Col. 3:14, 15.

                        Beyond dispute, first place is ever reserved for "charity," or
                     love. Without it other spiritual qualities are of little avail (com-
                     pare 1 Cor. 13:13), for it binds all other good qualities together.
                     We should also allow the peace of Christ (better supported than
                     "of God") to reign in our hearts and exert its unifying influence
                     in our relations, and we should always be a grateful people.

                       How may we attain these high standards? Col. 3:16, 17.

                        These suggestions are closely associated with worship, both
                     formal and otherwise. We should so study Christ's Word that it
                     will make its. home in our hearts; we should wisely teach and;
                     counsel one another; we should sing psalms (might we do more \
                     of this?), hymns, and sacred songs, not merely with our lips, but
                     also in our hearts, as expressions of gratitude to the Father sung
                     in Christ's name. What a stimulating program! But how easy to
                     forget.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways do our doctrinal beliefs enrich the quality of
                     our daily spiritual lives?

                                                                      December 25
           Part 6     Contemplate Jesus' summary of the cost of discipleship.
    OUR ETERNAL
            LIFE      "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come
                    after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
                    follow me" (Matt. 16:24).

                       True Christianity is not a matter of assent to a set of doctrinal
                    statements, though these are necessary in order to formulate
                    belief. True Christianity, as its name implies, is Christ's way of
                    life, a matter of Christlikeness, of bringing together those who
                    reach out to be like their Master. The way is one of self-denial,
                    not as a punishing exercise for gathering merit, but as an imita-
                    tion of the example of the Lord who, "though he was rich, ...
                    became poor" (2 Cor. 8:9). Just as Jesus did not allow earthly
                    considerations to interfere with the fulfillment of His mission, so
                    he who follows Him must be willing to "deny himself, and take
                    up his cross," whatever form that cross may take.
                       There are good reasons for this hard condition to discipleship
                    (Matt. 16:25). It we expend our energies in "saving" our lives, we
                    shall lose them, for true eternal life will slip from our grasp. If we
                    are willing to renounce our own interests in order to promote
                    those of Christ's cause and to follow Christ's example, denying
                    ourselves as He did, then we shall find eternal life. Since eternal
                    life is the farthest boundary beyond which none can pass, it is
                    worthy of our most severe self-discipline, most dedicated ser-
                    vice, deepest trust, and highest aspirations.

                      Since personal experience, human history, and biblical
                    revelation show that we can in no wise save ourselves, to
                    whom can we turn for salvation? Jude 24 and 25.

                       We bring our 26 weeks of doctrinal study to a close by humbly
                    and gratefully addressing a reverent doxology to the One to
                    whom all doctrine should point—the Eternal Father, with the
                    Son and the Holy Spirit. He and He alone has power to keep us
                    from stumbling into sin, enabling us to stand not only faultless
                    but blameless and exultingly happy in His presence. To Him,
                    then, the only God who has saved us through our Lord Jesus
                    Christ—to this one God be there ascribed glory, majesty, power,
                    and authority in the past and through eternity. And may this
                    praise be rendered by us as faithful members of the Seventh-day
                    Adventist Church, in company with all the innumerable host of
                    the redeemed, forever and ever. Amen.

                Every Sabbath School teacher and member
                should make this book a close friend. From
                many years of both teaching and professional
          study of teaching methods, the author gives easy-to-
          use "tips on how to get the most out of the time devoted

Sunday-keeping and then refutes them from the Bible. It is crisp,
precise, and biblical—just the right format for busy Adventists
who need something "right now" to answer honest inquirers.

It Must Have Been an Angel

everyday life. As in Bible times, angels are still working for
"those who shall be heirs of salvation."
