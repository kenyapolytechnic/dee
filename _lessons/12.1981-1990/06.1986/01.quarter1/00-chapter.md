    The Epistle to the Ephesians was written by the apostle Paul while under house arrest about A.D.
62. Written to foster unity among the Ephesian believers, the epistle contains much valuable counsel
for the Christian church today. Dr. Veloso brings out this counsel in his inimitable style and presents
it in a format that carries the reader along. While especially designed as a help in studying the
Sabbath School lessons for this quarter, the book may be read with profit at any time.
Introduction to the Epistle to the Ephesians

          "One LoosiP
          One Faith"
   Paul's letter to the Ephesians has warmed the hearts of poets
and reformers, laymen and theologians alike, over the centur-
ies. The magnetic qualities of its message indicate that its au-
thor, Paul, knew Jesus in a deeply personal way, even though
there is no evidence that he had ever come into face-to-face
contact with Him during His earthly ministry. Paul's Damas-
cus-road experience seems to have been his first direct encoun-
ter with the Person about whom he writes so eloquently.
    Paul had many concerns on his mind as he wrote this letter.
One of Paul's major concerns is the mystery of the eternal'
plan of God that has been fulfilled through His Son Jesus
Christ. One facet of the mystery is how the Gentiles can be
united with the body of Christ on the same basis that the
 prophets and apostles were. Because the means by which this
 is accomplished is the grace of Christ, grace becomes another
dominant theme of the epistle. Grace in action brings about
 unity in the body of Christ, the church; thus unity is another
 major theme of this epistle. This quarter the theme of unity
 will serve as the main window through which we will view the
 letter to the Ephesian church. Because Satan does everything
 possible to bring disunity into the church today, the emphasis
 on unity in Ephesians deserves our special attention. If we
 are divided here on earth, how can we be united happily in
 heaven?

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are
PM     called in one hope of your calling" (Eph. 4:4).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Paul wrote this epistle while under house arrest
in Rome. It portrays the strong spiritual ties that he felt for the believers
in a church that he had much to do with establishing.

INTRODUCTION: What a treat awaits us this quarter in our study of
Paul's letter to the Ephesians! Poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge considered
Ephesians to be "one of the divinest compositions of man," and Martin
Luther called it "the true kernel and marrow" of the New Testament.
Writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul helps us understand
what it means for Christ to live in the believer. His letter contains in-
tensely practical instruction for Christians who face the kind of problems
we do in relationships in the family, home, society, nation, and even in the
church.
  When an army goes into battle, it basically faces two types of enemy
forces: external and internal. Not only are the forces that the Christian
has to face internal as well as external, but they are supernatural as well
as natural.
  What threatens the onward progress of the church today is not so much
an external enemy, such as unbelief, liberalism, or worldliness (although
we see these making inroads into the church). The greater threat to the
8
church is internal disunity. One of the oldest strategies in winning a war is
"divide and conquer." If united, the church will stand; if divided, it will
fall.
  The epistle to the Ephesians likens the church to a physical body. A
body must be healthy in order to live. In assessing the church we attend
we need to ask whether it is afflicted with spiritual "hardening of the
arteries" so that the soothing, life-giving graces of Christ have great diffi-
culty flowing from one part of the body to the other. Is it subject to spiri-
tual "fainting spells" that may be due to lack of emphasis on prayer life—
the "breath of the soul"? Many congregations today no longer conduct
prayer meeting, the only real opportunity for spontaneous group prayer
for the church.
   Or perhaps your church could be diagnosed as suffering from the crip-
pling effects of spiritual "arthritis," limiting its effective outreach and
soulwinning in the surrounding community. Your church even may have a
case of the dreaded spiritual "cancer" that little-by-little saps the body's
energy and weakens and finally destroys entire organs. This cancer is the
cancer of disunity. It works imperceptibly at first, but in the end its effects
are fatal.
   The book of Ephesians offers us the divinely-prescribed remedy for the
spiritual maladies that affect the health and vitality of the body of Christ.
The question is whether we want healing enough to be willing to take our
case to our doctor—the Divine Physician.
   In order to understand fully the prescription our Physician has given
us, we need to learn something about the background of the book and its
author and the purpose behind what was written in this epistle.
I. THE WRITER (Eph. 1:1; 3:1; 4:1; 6:20).

  In comparison with Paul's other epistles, how limited is the biographical
information about the author that is given in this epistle?

  Paul devotes only a total of four verses to a description of himself, his
calling, and his present predicament. Three of the four verses refer to his
imprisonment. This stands in contrast to the more lengthy autobiograph-
ical notes found in many of his other letters. (See, for example, 2 Cor.
11:6-33; Gal. 1:10-24; 2 Thess. 3:7-10.)

  An Apostle. In his salutation in Ephesians 1:1, Paul designates himself
"an apostle of Jesus Christ," putting himself on equality with the twelve
disciples. Was he being a bit presumptuous? Not at all. His apostleship
was not his own idea, but it was the Lord's doing and the Lord's will. Paul
was ordained for discipleship by Christ Himself on the road to Damascus.
He was blinded that he might see the light, and he was called personally
by Christ just as Jesus personally called the Twelve to discipleship (Gal.
1:15, 16). Beyond dispute Paul's apostleship was not from man, but from
God; not his own idea, but the Lord's (Gal. 1:1).

 SEARCH AND LEARN: What indications suggest that Paul needed to vali-
 date the genuineness of his letters?

                                                                              9
         1. Gal. 1:6-8

         2. Col. 4:18

         3. 2 Thess. 3:17

       Just as men today forge documents to gain some unworthy end, so
    someone must have attempted to counterfeit an epistle, passing it off as if
    it were from Paul's own hand. Such a forgery may have been written in
    order to gain support for some false teaching. In 1983, sixty-two volumes
    of Adolph Hitler's diaries were purportedly discovered in a barn in East
    Germany and sold as genuine. The fraud soon was discovered, but not
    before some people had been deceived. Not only was the handwriting not
    Hitler's, but the paper did not come from the time in which he lived.
       Paul used his signature to validate the genuineness of his letters. But
    even more importantly, the Holy Spirit is the validation that the message
    is true (1 John 5:6). In Ephesians 1:13 it is the Holy Spirit that is com-
    pared to a seal, an instrument of authentication, as we will study.

    THINK IT THROUGH: In our witnessing to others, what means should we
    use to demonstrate that we are indeed Christians and that our message is
    true?


n   11. THE RECIPIENTS.

      What clues are there as to whom Paul is writing and as to what his rea-
    sons were for writing this letter? Eph. 1:1; 2:11.


       Just as Paul gives almost no biographical information about himself in
    this letter, so he offers few clues as to the characteristics of the people he
    is addressing. However, the following points about the Ephesian believ-
    ers are evident:
       1. They were a group composed largely of Gentiles who had come out
    of paganism (Eph. 2:2, 11; 4:17).
       2. Their lives were characterized by a strong faith in Christ and a love
    for their fellow-believers (Eph. 1:15).
       3. The congregation was composed of husbands, wives, children,
    slaves, and slave-holders (Eph. 5:22, 25; 6:1, 5, 9).
       4. They were in danger of slipping back into pagan practices. Notice
    that some of the practical counsel given by Paul deals with avoiding cus-
    toms such as foolish talking and jesting (Eph. 5:4), immorality (verse 5),
    and drunkenness (verse 18).

      What is the significance of the fact that Paul mentions only one person by
    name in the epistle? Eph. 6:21.


         It is strange that Paul includes only one personal name in this letter,

    10
Tychicus, whereas most of his other letters are filled with personal allu-
sions and remembrances. Colossians, which was no doubt written about
the same time as Ephesians, lists eleven individuals, including Tychicus,
in its final chapter. In writing his concluding chapter to the Romans, Paul
mentions 35 personal names. These include some who were sending their
greetings to the Romans.
   The lack of personal references in Ephesians could suggest that Paul
may have not known many of the Ephesian members by name at the time
he wrote. However, this would be strange in view of the fact that he had
labored nearly three years and three months in Ephesus. (See Acts 19:1,
8, 10.) A better explanation is that the letter was intended for the believ-
ers in the towns and villages surrounding Ephesus as well. If the letter
were addressed to other believers besides those at Ephesus, then we
would not expect Paul to name persons in just the one church. Doing so
would cause the others to feel left out. Thus the opening words of Paul in
this epistle can be better understood to read: "Paul, an apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are in the Ephesian region."
The letter to the Colossians was written not only for the church at
Colossae but also for the churches at nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis
 (Col. 4:13-16). In the same way, Ephesians could have been written for the
 churches in the neighborhood of Ephesus.

I11. THE DATE AND THE OCCASION FOR WRITING.

  What kind of difficult circumstances was Paul undergoing at the time he
wrote the letter, and how harsh were they? Eph. 4:1; 6:20; Acts 28:30.


  Ephesians was written during Paul's first Roman imprisonment that be-
gan in the spring of A.D. 61 and lasted for two years. Because Paul was
under house arrest at the time, he was not under the physical agony that
he had to endure during his second Roman imprisonment. At the time of
his later imprisonment he likely was thrown into the Mammertine
Prison—a dark, damp dungeon that still exists today.While under house
arrest he was able to have visitors and eagerly "received all that came in
unto him" (Acts 28:30). Some of these visitors to Rome were able to take
messages back and forth for Paul, including his letters.

  What attitude did Paul take in regard to his imprisonment? Eph. 6:20.
(Compare with 2 Tim. 1:8; 4:16; Phil. 1:12-14.)


  Whether it was simply a house arrest, as when he wrote Ephesians and
Philippians; or a dungeon existence, as when he wrote 2 Timothy, we
have no clue from Paul as to the severity of his plight. He always seems to
have rejoiced, even when he had good reason to do otherwise.

   What kind of individual did Paul choose to carry his letter to the Ephe-
sians? Eph. 6:21, 22. (See also Col. 4:7.)


                                                                          11
         Paul always chose a trusted individual to deliver his precious letters.
      Tychicus delivered both epistles—Ephesians and Colossians--most
      likely on the same trip.

          What was Tychicus's mission?

         1. He was to make known the full disclosure of Paul's condition in Ro-
      man imprisonment to the believers in both churches (Eph. 6:21; Col. 4:7).
         2. He also was sent to bring encouragement to the believers in both
      congregations (Eph. 6:22; Col. 4:8).
         One evidence that Ephesians and Colossians were written and deliv-
      ered at the same time is that, of all the letters Paul wrote, these two are
      more alike in wording and in subject matter than any other two. One
      scholar has calculated that 70 percent of the material found in Colossians
      has close parallels to what is in Ephesians, while 50 percent of Ephesians
      is reflected in Colossians.

‘6
 , MAP STUDY: Examine the accompanying map that shows the cities of Asia
   Minor in Bible times. Notice the geographic relationship of Ephesus and
   Colossae. Also note how close Laodicea is to Colossae. Paul wrote an epistle
   to Laodicea (that apparently has not been preserved) at the same time he
   sent one to Colossae (Col. 4:16).

IV. PAUL'S GREETING AND FAREWELL (Eph. 1:2; 6:23, 24).

  What can we learn from Paul's characteristic style in the salutations to his
epistles? Eph. 1:2.


  Two of the most beautiful and touching words are grace and peace.
They must have been a favorite expression of Paul's because he used
them in the salutation of virtually all his epistles. (With the greetings to
Timothy and Titus he added the word mercy so that in these personal
epistles he wrote, "grace, mercy, and peace.") In the time of Paul most
Greeks used a slightly different word instead of grace to begin their let-
ters—the word meaning "prosperity" or "health." However, Paul used
the term that means "good will" or "favor"--grace. The word peace in-
cludes the idea of wholeness and health. When Christ first greeted His
disciples in the upper room after the resurrection, He used the very word
peace that Paul used in addressing the believers.
   "The life, death, and resurrection of Christ had brought new meaning
to both these old familiar terms. `Grace' was now understood as the re-
deeming love of God in Christ (see 2 Tim. 1:9). 'Peace' was now peace
with God through redemption (Rom. 5:1). With this Christian signifi-
cance, `grace' and `peace' became Paul's customary greeting in all his
epistles."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 473.

SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT: Have you ever thought about the fact
that when God touches ordinary things they become extraordinary?
• Jacob's stone used for a pillow became a monument.
• Moses' rod was not just another shepherd's crook.
• The cross is not just another wooden instrument used to execute crimi-
  nals.
  Even common things become freighted with new meaning under the
transforming power of the gospel.

   How do the four key things that Paul used at the close of his epistle ex-
 press the warm sentiment of his heart? Eph. 6:23, 24.


   In his farewell Paul uses four meaningful terms: peace, love, faith, and
 grace. The first word, peace, would have special appeal to the Jewish
 members of the congregation because it is equivalent to the Old Testa-
 ment word shalom. It is another way of saying, "May it be well with
 you!" It also stresses unity because it has the root meaning of wholeness.
 The expression "love with faith" likewise emphasizes unity, as reflected
 in what Paul wrote to the Galatian members: "For in Jesus Christ neither
 circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which
 worketh by love" (Gal. 5:6). The use of the word grace has special mean-
 ing for the Christian because it epitomizes everything that Christ did on
 the cross for us.
    Usually Paul wrote the farewell in each of his letters with his own hand,
 after having dictated the rest of the letter to a personal secretary. This fact

                                                                             13
is brought out in 2 Thessalonians 3:17: "The salutation of Paul with mine
own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write." It would be
wonderful to be able to see the final farewell as written in Paul's own
handwriting. In Ephesians the greeting at the opening of the epistle and
the salutation at the end are characteristic of Paul's style in his other let-
ters. This fact adds authenticity to the idea that Paul is the author of
Ephesians. Besides, the content of the epistle itself is so much like Paul's
thought as expressed elsewhere that it would seem unreasonable for us to
deny that Paul wrote Ephesians as some modern scholars do.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Acts 28:16-31 to discover
in greater detail the setting in Rome of the epistle to the Ephesians.
   "Many months passed by after Paul's arrival in Rome, before the Jews
of Jerusalem appeared in person to present their accusations against the
prisoner. . . . His enemies could hope for success only in seeking by in-
trigue to influence the emperor in their favor. Delay would further their
object, as it would afford them time to perfect and execute their plans,
and so they waited for a while before preferring their charges in person
against the apostle.
   "In the providence of God this delay resulted in the furtherance of the
gospel. . . .
   "During this time the churches that he [Paul] had established in many
lands were not forgotten. Realizing the danger that threatened the con-
verts to the new faith, the apostle sought so far as possible to meet their
needs by letters of warning and practical instruction."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 453.
   If available, study the article on "Grace" in the S.D.A. Bible Dictio-
nary (p. 439 in the Revised Edition).

SUMMARY: Just as it is helpful to know about a person's background and
childhood in order better to appreciate that individual and to understand
the person's behavior, it is essential to study the background of the epistle
to the Ephesians in order to be able to interpret it correctly. The following
significant facts emerge:
  1. The epistle was written by Paul, whose basis for authority is his call
to apostleship.
  2. It was written from Rome during his first imprisonment, which was
characterized as a "house arrest."
  3. It was delivered by Tychicus as a companion letter to the Colossian
epistle.

APPLICATION: Many of the world's greatest literary pieces have been
produced during times of great hardship and imprisonment. For example,
there is John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress written from Bedford Jail in
England. It may be that God knows it is best to write upon our lives the
message of love through the steel-tipped pen of suffering.
o Do I sense God's love and concern when I face difficulty or suffering? If
  not, why not?
o What can I do to foster such an understanding and to help others who
  may have a similar problem?

The Bilessimil- of
the Believer
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 1:3-14.

     MEMORY TEXT: "That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he
     might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
     heaven, and which are on earth; even in him" (Eph. 1:10).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: God has a plan that is all-inclusive. He longs to
unite every created being into one body. We can be thankful that His plan
is so comprehensive that it includes each one of us individually.


                       OVERVIEW: Eph. 1:3-14
  Prelude of Praise (verse 3)        Incentives to Gratitude (verses 4-14)
  Praise directed to God,            We can be grateful to God because:
   the source of every                He has chosen us (verses 4-6)
   benefit                            He has rescued us (verse 7)
                                      He has provided us an
                                       inheritance (verses 8-14)


INTRODUCTION: The epistle begins on a high note—a note of praise.
The first phrase of the body of the letter after the salutation is "Blessed be
the God." We might think that it would be most difficult to praise God
while languishing in a prison, even if it were in a case of house arrest. But
Paul could do so. Looking at it from the opposite viewpoint, we can dis-
cover that the more bleak and oppressive the circumstances are, the
more the committed Christian lifts his or her gaze above the surroundings
to contemplate heavenly realities.
   That is exactly what Paul did. His first message is about the God "who
hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ"
(Eph. 1:3). In the New Testament the expression of praise blessed is ap-
plied particularly to God, as He alone is worthy "to receive glory and
 honour and power" (Rev. 4:11). Blessing is ascribed to the One sitting
 upon the throne and to the Lamb at His side (Rev. 5:13). It is the Blessed
One who bestows the blessings and benefits outlined in the verses that
follow. The fact that Paul focuses on "spiritual blessings" indicates how
 much more important these are to the Christian than are material bless-
 ings.
   One of the symptoms of a diseased church is backbiting, but the great-

                                                                             15
est remedy for this soul-sickness is a spirit of thankfulness. Appreciation
and gratitude make up a healing balm for those who have been treated
unjustly and criticized unfairly. Thankfulness contributes not only to the
spiritual health of the church but also to the actual physical health of the
individual. (See Prov. 16:24.)

I. PRELUDE OF PRAISE (Eph. 1:3).

     To whom should gratitude be directed, and for what reason? Verse 3.


   Paul begins the body of his letter with an expression of thanksgiving,
followed by a prayer. The first half of the first chapter reads like a hymn
of praise. In fact, it contains a three-fold refrain unto the praise of His
glory (1:6, 12, 14). Whatever we give praise and thanks for, the glory
should go to God. If we were to attempt to take the glory to ourselves the
beauty of our praise would turn to ashes.
  Some question, "How am Ito express gratitude to God when I don't
feel the spirit of praise within me?" The answer is that praise is much
more than mere feeling. It has to be directed to a reality that lies outside
of ourselves—a reality that extends even to heaven itself. For that reason
Paul indicates that our blessings are "in heavenly places." God does not
ask us to feel the spirit of gratitude, but He simply requests that we ex-
press thankfulness. The surprising thing is that, once it has been ex-
pressed, we often begin to feel more in tune with God and more like prais-
ing Him.

THINK IT THROUGH: What can I find for which to thank God? How can
I know that it is God's hand that provides the blessing when I receive one?

   Paul answers: "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ for giving us through Christ every possible spiritual benefit as citi-
zens of Heaven!" (Eph. 1:3, Phillips). Elsewhere James puts the same
truth into different words: "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father of lights" (James 1:17). This
means that when anything happens to us that produces good in our lives,
even if it is an unpleasant or painful experience, it is a blessing from God;
and we can thank Him for it.

SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the verses listed below, looking for at least
three specific reasons why we ought to be grateful to God:

  1. verse 4

  2. verse 7

  3. verse 10

  4. others

   Consider the all-encompassing nature of God's plan for us. It started
before we were born, even before there was a human race. God already
knew our names. The most visible demonstration of His plan for us took
place on the cross when Christ died for us. There He died for us individ-
ually. That this is so is evident in the fact that He would have given His
life if any one of us had been the only one in need of salvation. His plan
will climax when all things separated by sin have been reunited. God's
plan moves us from paradise lost to paradise restored. The spanning rain-
bow of God's love bridges the gap between the two paradises.

11. THANKFUL FOR BEING CHOSEN—ELECTION (Eph. 1:4-6).

  How can we be sure that in verses 4 and 5 Paul was not teaching that God
determined ahead of time who is to be saved and who is to be lost?


   Paul does not advocate predetermination in the sense that some under-
stand it—that God predetermines who is to be saved. Otherwise we
would not be able to exercise free will or, for that matter, any choice at
all. In verse 5, the word predestinated has been translated from a Greek
word that means "marked out beforehand." It simply expresses the fact
that God's plan for the human race has been in existence from eternity.
Because of His omniscience God knew before the foundation of the
world who will choose to inherit the kingdom.
   It is significant that Paul speaks here of predestination in family terms,
employing the word adoption. An earthly parent may pick out an occupa-
tion and perhaps even a mate for a son or daughter; but the child, upon
reaching the point of decision, sometimes rejects the parent's wishes. In
the same way, a member of the human family may choose to go counter to
the wishes and master plan of the Creator.
   The true concept of predestination is that everything God plans is for
the good of the world and for those who live in it. God is in control of
ultimate outcomes at all times. But He has given us the power of choice
and will not force anyone to be saved. Even when people rebel against
God and follow their own willful ways, God still has a plan and purpose
that controls the ultimate destiny of the world.

  What are some of the blessings or benefits brought about by God's pre-
determined plan? Verses 4, 5, 10.


   In Scripture, predestination is connected to God's foreknowledge.
"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate" (Rom. 8:29). God's
choosing, which is sometimes called election, simply is based upon His
all-seeing, all-knowing foreknowledge (John 13:18) and depends on our
belief and acceptance (John 6:64, 65). "As God foresaw, and thus
foreknew, each generation of men that would come upon the stage of this
world's action, He coupled immediately with His foreknowledge the deci-
sion to predestinate them all to be saved."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
vol. 6, p. 574.

                                                                           17
  Election, like the plan of redemption, was made before the foundation
of the world (Eph. 1:4), but "was manifest in these last times for you, who
by him do believe in God" (1 Peter 1:20,21). "God hath from the begin-
ning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief
of the truth" (2 Thess. 2:13). In this text the two agencies in the salvation
of humanity are revealed,—the divine influence, and the strong, living
faith of those who follow Christ. "It is through the sanctification of the
Spirit and the belief of the truth, that we become laborers together with
God."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, October 15, 1908, p. 7. Nei-
ther Paul nor any other Bible writer suggests that God determines who is
saved or lost, regardless of their own choice in the matter.

     What is the real purpose in election? Read Eph. 1:4 again.


  God's purpose in our election is that we should be holy and blameless.
Not only should we crave the privilege, but we should rejoice in it. John
adds that it takes place in order that the believer "should go and bring
forth fruit" (John 15:16) in fulfilling the mission assigned (John 4:36;
12:24).
  What else does Paul say that God has in mind in predestinating us? Eph.
1:5, 6.

   Paul expands on a theme that he emphasized in his letter to the Roman
believers: predestination has as its goal sonship. "For whom he did
foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his
Son" (Rom. 8:29). The adopted child takes on the characteristics, con-
cerns, and values of his new parents, and has the blessed responsibility of
upholding the standards held by the new parents. The same holds true for
the adopted child of God. There is an even closer tie between God and
His adopted children than there is between earthly parents and their
adopted children. There is an even more far-reaching influence; eternity
is at stake. God's plan for our salvation has been pre-determined or
predestinated, but it can be accepted or rejected by the individual.

THINK IT THROUGH: Do I appreciate what God has done for me in
adopting me into the family of heaven? Am I showing my appreciation by
joyfully doing all that I can to bring honor to my new family name?

I11. THANKFUL FOR BEING RESCUED—REDEMPTION (Eph. 1:7).

   What does the word redemption imply in regard to the plight in which all
of us find ourselves? Verse 7.


  One of the more common words to -appear in the news accounts over
the last ten years is the word hostage. While kidnapping and hostage-
holding have been practiced for ages, the practice has taken on new di-
mensions in the jet age. A planeload of terrified passengers can be held
hostage by a terrorist who holds a brown paper bag and threatens to blow
18
    up the plane unless the terrorist is taken immediately to whatever desti-
    nation he or she has in mind. Also, for the first time, entire embassies
    have been held hostage.
       But the hostage situation which afflicts the entire human race is much
    more serious in that the whole world is being held captive by Satan. It is
    strange how people go about their daily lives totally unaware that they are
    being held hostage. They can be likened to passengers on a train who are
    oblivious to the fact that the train's conductor is being held at gunpoint.
       When Paul speaks of redemption in this passage, he uses a word that
    means "release by payment of a ransom or price." The word forgiveness
    is translated from one that means literally "sending away."

WED IV. THANKFUL TO GOD FOR HIS INHERITANCE—RESTORATION
        (Eph. 1:8-14).

      1. Preparation for the inheritance (verses 8-10).

      Why is unity so important to God's ultimate plan for the human race?
    Verse 10.


      If we say that we have been healed, it implies that previously we had
    been sick or had an infirmity. When Paul says that God wishes to gather
    into one all Christians, it implies that Christians now are scattered.
      "The mystery of God's will was His plan to restore this unity when the
    occasion was ready, a restoration to be accomplished through Christ.
    That mystery will find its culmination at the end of the great controversy,
    when all things in heaven and on earth will be united in Christ, and the
    character of the Godhead will have been vindicated."—S.D.A. Bible
    Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1000.
       Only if we have unity on earth can we be prepared for the inheritance in
    heaven where all things, both animate and inanimate, are in absolute har-
    mony with one another and with their Creator.

     What is Paul talking about when he connects unity with the mystery of
    God's plan and purpose in Ephesians 1:8-10?


       When Paul uses the term mystery he uses it in a way that is different
    from that dictated by popular usage today. For him a mystery is a special
    and extremely valuable piece of information that is known by a select
    few. It is not eternally hidden but has been revealed selectively to those
    ready to pay attention to it. The gospel is called a mystery (Rom. 16:25),
    not because it cannot be understood by people, but because those who do
    not accept will never understand and be benefited by it.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the following texts and indicate below how
    Paul uses the term mystery in a consistent manner:

       1. Rom. 16:25

                                                                             19
     2. 1 Cor. 2:7-10

     3. Col. 1:26, 27

   In the first chapter of Ephesians, Paul states that unity is an outgrowth
of God's mystery. We have just discovered that the gospel is the mystery
to which he refers; therefore, unity must come as the outgrowth of the
gospel.
  When you stop to think of it, it is incredible how God can take people
who have been at odds with one another and blend them into one. He can
take two warring factions or seemingly incompatible races and bring
about a harmonious relationship. He can make brothers out of enemies.
He does so by filling those who respond to Him with His kind of love.

ILLUMINATION: "By the union of church members with Christ and with
one another the transforming power of the gospel is to be diffused
throughout the world."—Testimonies,vol. 6, p. 240.

     2. Reception of the inheritance (Eph. 1:11-14).

  What underlies unity? What is the "reward" for unity, and when and
how do we receive it? Eph. 1:10, 11; 1 John 5:11-13.


  The good news is that we already possess the inheritance! (See 1 John
5:11; John 5:24; 6:47, 54; The Desire of Ages, p. 331.) Notwithstanding,
sometimes we act as though the inheritance were a million miles from
here and a thousand years from now. In Christ it is ours here and now.
  How can we be sure that we, as individuals, have received the magnificent
inheritance made possible through Christ? Eph. 1:12-14.


   There are several reasons why the inheritance is certain:
   1. It is part of God's eternal plan, and His plan has never failed.
   2. It involves trust in Christ, and Christ never lets down anyone who
      believes in Him.
   3. It is sealed (secured) by the Holy Spirit.
  Two vivid symbols are used in these verses in connection with the
Holy Spirit—the seal and the down payment. In ancient times the wax
seal on the outside of a document which had been stamped with signet of
the sender guaranteed that the contents were trustworthy. In the same
way, the seal of the Holy Spirit not only guarantees that God's written
promises are completely trustworthy, but also that the Spirit is an earnest
or down payment: "The promised Holy Spirit, . . . is a deposit guarantee-
ing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's
possession" (Eph. 1:13, 14, NIV). As studied previously, we are hos-
tages and Christ's blood is our ransom payment. The Holy Spirit is the
"earnest," the first installment or deposit, on our inheritance.

      ILLUSTRATION: David composed Psalm 121 in the wilderness of Paran
      after he had fled there upon learning of the death of Samuel. Even the
      hills that fed the dry valleys with water and protected them from the
      storms were not enough to afford him the protection he needed now that
      his last influential friend was gone. "He knew that Samuel's death had
      broken another bond of restraint from the actions of Saul, and he felt less
      secure than when the prophet lived. While the attention of Saul was en-
      gaged in mourning for the death of Samuel, David took the opportunity to
      seek a place of greater security; so he fled to the wilderness of Paran. It
      was here that he composed the one hundred and twentieth and twenty-
      first psalms. In these desolate wilds, realizing that the prophet was dead,
      and the king was his enemy, he sang:
         `My help cometh from the Lord,
         Which made heaven and earth.
         He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
         He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
         Behold, He that keepeth Israel
         Shall neither slumber nor sleep. . . .
         The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil:
         He shall preserve thy soul.
         The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in
         From this time forth, and even forevermore.'
              Psalm 121:2-8."
                 —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 664.
         We, too, can have the certainty that God cares for us and will provide
       the help we need in the way He sees best and that He is preparing us for a
       place in the eternal kingdom soon to come.

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Psalms 103 to 107. Choose
      one of these psalms to meditate on and pray about. Discover that the
      spirit of thankfulness is not based upon feeling alone, but upon the objec-
      tive reality of what God has accomplished.
         "We need to praise God more 'for His goodness, and for His wonderful
      works to the children of men.' Psalm L07:8. Our devotional exercises
      should not consist wholly in asking and receiving. Let us not be always
      thinking of our wants and never of the benefits we receive."—Steps to
      Christ, pp. 102, 103.

      SUMMARY: One of the best medicines for a church that is ailing with the
      harsh spirit of criticism, bickering, and fault-finding is the spirit of grati-
      tude—first of all, gratitude to the One who is the "giver of every good and
      perfect gift." Secondly, sincere appreciation for the work of others.

      APPLICATION: When was the last time you went out of your way to say
        "Thank you" for a kindness someone had shown you?

The Praying Apost0e
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 1:15-23.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fa-
PM      ther of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
        the knowledge of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlight-
        ened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling" (Eph. 1:17,
        18).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: If Paul had a prayer list, it would be most inter-
esting to see what concerns he would put on that list. Actually, we have
the privilege of discovering some of his prayer concerns as we study the
second half of Ephesians 1.

                            power (verses 18, 19)

INTRODUCTION: Some Christians lead a crisis prayer life; that is, they
pray whenever there is a crisis, but largely neglect prayer at other times.
God accepts the sincere prayer for help no matter when it may come and
no matter how dangerous the circumstances may be. But He is pleased to
see a child of His pray when there is no crisis.
   Paul did not write this letter in order to ward off a crisis faced by the
Ephesians, nor to solve difficult problems within the church—such as
those he had to confront in the Corinthian church. Therefore, his prayer
at this point in the epistle took the form of a prayer of gratitude for the
good news received from Ephesus.

THINK IT THROUGH: Were Paul's prayers any more effective as an apos-
tle than are the prayers of the ordinary church member? Are the prayers of
two praying Christians more effective than the prayers of one on behalf of
another?

     I. THE INCENTIVE FOR PAUL'S PRAYERS (Eph. 1:15, 16).
El     What can we learn from that which motivated Paul to pray continually
     for the Ephesian believers? Verse 16.


       It is interesting that verses 15 through 23 of chapter 1 form a single
     sentence, according to the King James Version. Paul is known for his long
     and sometimes involved sentences. It might help to read this section in a
     modern translation that breaks it into short sentences. At any rate, verses
     15 through 23 should be treated as a unit. In it Paul tells his readers what
     he has been praying about.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: As you scan through this section, list what you
     discover to be the major burdens of Paul's prayer:

        Verse 17

        Verse 18

        Verse 19

     11. ELEMENTS OF PAUL'S PRAYER (Eph. 1:17-19).

       1. Prayer for Wisdom and Enlightenment (verses 17, 18).

        When there are so many things for which to pray, why did Paul choose
     first to pray that the believers in Ephesus be granted wisdom?


        Wisdom cannot be viewed in isolation from the revelation of the mys-
     tery of God. Reflect again on verses 7 through 9: "In him we have re-
     demption through his blood, . . . in accordance with the riches of God's
     grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding. And he
     made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure,
     which he purposed in Christ" (NIV). The revelation of the mystery of
     God's will comes through God's initiative, not ours. Wisdom does not
      come through our efforts either. It is a gift of God. It is not dependent on
     I.Q., nor is it the result of the accumulation of knowledge. The wisdom
     Paul refers to comes from a relationship with Christ. It has to do with
     character and conduct that is based on spiritual understanding (Col. 1:9),

      THINK IT THROUGH: How does this kind of wisdom contribute to the
      unity of God's people?

        Revelation is the process by which God communicates His will in a
      specific way to His people. Quite often it is by a dream or a vision. Proph-
      ets and apostles have revelations, but the ordinary believer is not given a
      revelation in its strictest sense. What most believers are given is "the
      spirit . . . of revelation in the knowledge of him" (Eph. 1:17).

                                                                               23
in     How does Paul indicate that the kind of revelation he received involved a
     special experience? Eph. 3:3; Gal. 1:11, 12.


       The ordinary believer does not receive revelations directly from God,
     but he does have enlightenment. Enlightenment is the process whereby a
     person appreciates the true value of that which has been revealed. It is
     somewhat like a person finding a rare coin in the change received during a
     business transaction. Hundreds, even thousands of people, may have al-
     lowed the coin to pass through their hands without perceiving its value.
     That also is true concerning the revealed truths of God's Word. But there
     are those who perceive and treasure God's revelations.
       "All who believe with the heart the word of God will hunger and thirst
     for a knowledge of His will. God is the author of truth. He enlightens the
     darkened understanding and gives to the human mind power to grasp and
     comprehend the truths which He has revealed."—Ellen G. White, The
     Sanctified Life, p. 49.

     THINK IT THROUGH: How can a clear understanding of God's purpose
     for our lives as individual believers strengthen the unity of God's people?

       2. The Prayer for the Expected Results: Hope, Heavenly Riches, and
     Power (Eph. 1:18, 19).

        The unconverted human being probably would reverse the order; wish-
     ing for power first, riches second, and hope third. But, even at that, the
     person involved would misunderstand this concept because the riches it
     talks about are not associated with the glitter of gold or the value of mate-
     rial things. The "riches" Paul speaks about involve the inheritance
     awaiting each Christian. They are "the riches of his glorious inheritance
     in the saints" (Eph. 1:18, RSV). Nothing on earth can compare with the
     inheritance awaiting us. If there were anything earthly having more glory
     than what our future riches hold, then it might be understandable why we
     would set our affections on that earthly object.

     What does Paul mean when he refers to "the hope of his calling"? Verse 18.


        "Some commentators believe that in this . . . passage Paul refers, not to
     the thing hoped for, but to the principle of hope in the life that is inspired
     by the divine calling. To have that hope is to have something precious
     beyond measure. Paul's readers still did not comprehend the full meaning
     of their calling, and he was anxious that they should see that the Chris-
     tian's hope is based on the facts of redemption. . . . They had forgiveness
     of sins, they were children of God, but still their eyes were holden. He
     wanted them to have the hope that would suggest to them more than they
     had-dreamed of. Hope is a mixture of faith and assurance, but it looks to
     the future for its completion. The believer may know that if he is called by
     God through the -Spirit, his whole life will become suffused with the
     blessed hope."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1003.

        the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? for ye are our glory
        and joy.' 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 309, 310.

          What is one of the greatest demonstrations of God's power? Eph. 1:19,
        20.


          In the last part of Paul's personal prayer for the Ephesians, he prays
        that they might know experientially the power of God, and not just His
        power, but "the exceeding greatness of his power." Paul is famous for his
        use of "double superlatives"—in other words, he uses the doubling of
        descriptive words to make that which he is talking about unequaled in
        splendor, worth, or magnitude. Here he could have said "power" and
        that would have been meaningful, or he could have said "greatness of his
        power," and that would have left a deeper impression, but he says, "the
        exceeding greatness of his power" to describe the incomparable.

        SEARCH AND LEARN: How do the texts that follow illustrate Paul's use of
        "double superlatives"?

          1. Eph 2.7

           2. Eph 3.8

           3. Eph. 3:20

          Besides the resurrection, what other striking demonstration of God's
        power does Paul cite? Eph. 3:16-19.



                                                                                     25
         The two great evidences of God's power are the resurrection of Christ
      from a tomb surrounded by wicked soldiers and evil angels, and the in-
      dwelling of Christ in the life of the believer. The first evidence is not one
      that we can see, except through the eyes of the Gospel writers, but the
      second is one that we not only can see but also can experience. Is it not
      thrilling to see a dramatic conversion of a person steeped in sin, as well as
      to sense Christ making definite changes in our lives?

WED   I11. ADDITIONAL CONCERNS IN PAUL'S PRAYER (Eph. 1:20-23).

           1. The Exaltation of Christ (verses 20, 21).

        Why is it important to know and to believe that Christ has been exalted
      above every other power on earth and in heaven? Verses 20, 21.


         Here are some suggestions:
         o The resurrection without exaltation would be incomplete. Christ's
      throne and kingdom needed to be established again not only on earth in
      the heart of Satan's domain, but in heaven where the great rebellion first
      began.
         o If Christ were not above every created being, good or evil, then he
      could not claim to be our Saviour.
         Christ is said to be placed at the right hand of God "in heavenly
      places," thus suggesting enthronement.
         "Here we have an allusion to Psalm cx. [110] 1, a verse often referred to
      in the New Testament. The exalting of the king of Israel as God's anointed
      lent itself to a supreme application to the Christ. It was so applied before
      His coming, but most especially after His death and resurrection and as-
      cension."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians (Grand
      Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1968), p. 63.
         A careful study of Scripture locates God's throne in the heavenly sanc-
      tuary. (See Eze. 1:26-28; Rev. 4:1-5; 11:19.) The ark of the covenant in the
      earthly sanctuary is symbolic of God's throne in the heavenly. Ellen
      White adds: "In the temple in heaven, the dwelling place of God, His
      throne is established in righteousness and judgment."—The Great Con-
      troversy, p. 415.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the following texts and indicate what the
      enthronement of Christ means to the believer:

           1. Mark 16:19, 20

           2. Heb 1.3

           3. Rev. 3:21




      26
  2. The Headship of Christ (Eph. 1:22, 23).

  How does the headship of Christ over the church, His body, become a
perfect illustration of unity?


   "All of God's people upon the earth are one body, from the beginning to
the end of time. They have one Head that directs and governs the body.
The same injunctions that rested upon ancient Israel, rest upon God's
people now, to be separate from the world. The great Head of the church
has not changed. "—Testimonies , vol. 1, pp. 283, 284.
   If there is one Head, then there must be one body. The Head and body
are so intricately interconnected that one cannot exist without the other.
Later in this letter to the Ephesians Paul affirms, "There is one body"
(Eph. 4:4). This may be one of the most forceful and clear-cut illustra-
tions of unity found in the Bible. Occasionally scientists have been able to
interfere with the normal development of the salamander, a lizard-like
creature, and cause it to develop two or more heads. How long would a
two-headed or four-headed salamander be able to survive in the wild?
Not very long. If it were pursued, the heads might cause the legs to try to
run in different directions at the same time. Every part of the church,
Christ's own body, must be under His absolute control at all times if it is
 to avoid the dangers besetting it on all sides.
    Christ's headship over the body means much to His church:
    1. He is Head over all creation (Eph. 1:22).
    2. He is its means of salvation and protection (Eph. 5:23).
    3. He alone is the body's nourisher—the key to its health and growth
       (Col. 2:19).
    4. He is the agent of reconciliation (Col. 1:18-20).
    This last point is extremely important. Because the body or the church
 is composed of so many diverse elements, it is inevitable that frictions
 among members and factions will emerge. Thank God that Christ as Head
 can reconcile the various parts of the body to Himself !

   Why is Christ granted to be Head over "all things" (Eph. 1:22), and why
is the body said to be "the fullness of him that filleth all in all" (Eph. 1:23)?


   "The apostle does not simply speak of Him as given to be Head of the
Church—Lord of all, and of the Church in particular—but that He is 'su-
preme head' (NEB) or more literally Head over all things 'to' or 'for' the
Church. . . . The Church has authority and power to overcome all opposi-
tion because her Leader and Head is Lord of all. Jesus Himself had au-
thority because He was under the Father's authority; He was doing His
will and therefore had all the authority of God (see Mt. vi11.9f., xi.27; Jn.
xv11.2). . . .
   "This designation of the function of the Church is amplified yet further;
it is not only His body, it is intended to be the fulness of him that filleth all
in all. We may paraphrase this by saying that it is God's purpose that the
Church should be the full expression of Jesus Christ, who Himself fills

                                                                              27
everything there is."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephe-
sians, pp. 65, 66.
   As members of Christ's body we are granted the privilege of experienc-
ing all the fullness of Christ. Twice more in Ephesians Paul amplifies this
point, first by praying that the believers "might be filled with all the
fulness of God" (Eph. 3:19), and second by urging them to grow up "unto
the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph. 4:13). Colossi-
ans 2:10, RV, continues the thought by stating that "in him ye are made
full," or as Phillips translates it, "Moreover, your own completeness is
only realized in him."

THOUGHT QUESTION: Do I feel sometimes that something is missing in
my life, and that as a person I have not experienced fulfillment? According
to Paul's inspired messages, what one provision alone makes it possible for
me to achieve fulfillment?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: This week we have examined
two of our great needs: the need for wisdom and the need for power. For
insights as to how we can obtain more of each, read the "Reward of
Searching" section in Christ's Object Lessons, pages 113, 114, and the
"Power of the Truth" chapter in Testimonies, volume 5, pages 157-162.
   "Many fix their eyes upon the terrible wickedness existing around
them, the apostasy and weakness on every side, and they talk of these
things until their hearts are filled with sadness and doubt. They keep up-
permost before the mind the masterly working of the archdeceiver and
dwell upon the discouraging features of their experience, while they seem
to lose sight of the heavenly Father's power and His matchless love. All
this is as Satan would have it. It is a mistake to think of the enemy of
righteousness as clothed with so great power, when we dwell so little
upon the love of God and His might. We must talk of the mightiness of
Christ. We are utterly powerless to rescue ourselves from the grasp of
Satan; but God has appointed a way of escape. The Son of the Highest
has strength to fight the battle for us, and 'through Him that loved us' we
may come off 'more than conquerors.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 741.

SUMMARY: Our needs never exceed God's ability to meet them. Just as
it is said that the average human being uses less than one percent of his
total brain capacity, so it can be said that we in the Christian sphere use
far less of the divine resources than what God has made available. We
receive little because we ask for little and expect little.

APPLICATION: Take a moment to list your deepest concerns and bur-
dens at the present time. Be specific. Which one concern outweighs all
other concerns? Then ask yourself which aspects of Paul's prayer in
Ephesians 1 are designed to answer your deepest concerns and to meet
your greatest needs.

From Death to Life
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 2:1-10.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love
PM    wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quick-
      ened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved)" (Eph. 2:4, 5).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: We need to pause from time to time to consider
what we were before becoming Christians, in order to appreciate more
fully what we are now, and what Christ is doing for us and will continue to
do for us.

                        OVERVIEW. Eph. 2:1-10

INTRODUCTION: In last week's lesson we examined Paul's personal
prayer for the Ephesian believers. In this week's lesson we will discover
the thrill that comes from living the new life in Christ. Only those who
have witnessed the death of a loved one or a close friend can understand
fully the starkness and tragic reality of death. When the arrow of death
strikes someone close to us, it comes with a vividness that is not present
when it strikes a person living down the street or across the town.
   People nowadays even have experienced so-called "death" and lived
to tell about it. Perhaps an automobile accident resulted in bones crushed
beyond repair, or perhaps a person drowned. The doctors were not able
to detect a pulse and pronounced the person dead, but by the application
of modern medical techniques the accident victim lived. What rejoicing

                                                                         29
     there was when the person who seemed dead was recognized to be alive!
     Experiences such as this help us imagine the thrill that would come from
     seeing a dead person being made alive.
       In the spiritual realm also, a thrill sweeps over us when life follows
     death and healing replaces sickness. Paul calls this transition from spiri-
     tual death to life a resurrection. Resurrection has both a present and a
     future reality. For the present, it means being made alive in Christ and
     participating in the joy of His resurrection. In the future resurrection, our
     "lowly bodies" will be "like his glorious body" (Phil. 3:21, NIV).
        Paul considered this transition from death to life, from infirmity to
     wholeness, as an act of creation that is no less miraculous than the origi-
     nal Creation. This act takes place "by grace through faith"—grace on
     God's part, received by faith on our part.

       Our study of this section of Ephesians will be guided by the following
     outline:
        I. The Old Life (Eph. 2:1-3).
           1. Dead in trespasses and sins.
           2. Children of disobedience.
       11. The New Life (Eph. 2:4-10).
           1. Made alive by God.
           2. Raised up by God.
           3. Saved by grace through faith.
           4. Created in Christ unto good works.

SUN I. THE OLD LIFE (Eph. 2:1-3).

      Two things characterize the old life: (1) being dead in sin, and (2) being
    children of disobedience. The one condition is no better than the other,
    because both result in a separation from God that leads to eternal death.

         1. Dead in Trespasses and Sins (verse 1).

      What condition of the Ephesians before they were saved is typical of all
    who are without Christ?


       The spiritual plight in which the Ephesians once found themselves was
    nearly identical to the condition of Israel as described by Isaiah: "The
    whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot
    even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises,
    and putrifying sores" (Isa. 1.:5, 6). The one difference was that the Ephe-
    sians had come out of their hopeless condition, whereas Israel had
    slipped back into and remained in it. Human beings in their natural state
    are slaves to death. Our natural state results in moral as well as physical
    death. Paul compares moral death to the works of darkness: orgies,
    drunkenness, sexual immorality, debauchery, dissension, and jealousy.
    (See Rom. 13:12-14, NIV.) A human being is dead morally when that per-
    son clings to sin and a sinful way of life. Sin separates the sinner from
    Christ, the Life Giver.

    30
THINK IT THROUGH: Are there degrees of spiritual death? How would it
be possible to be half alive and half dead spiritually?

  The Bible does not recognize "degrees of death." It does not speak of
one person being more dead spiritually than another, although it does
speak of degrees of guilt and degrees of evil. A person who is dead is
dead. There is no hope of life from self or through self effort.

  What does the expression "trespasses and sins" found in verse 1 mean?


  "Man's trouble is not merely that he is out of harmony with his environ-
ment and with his fellows. He is 'alienated from the life of God' (iv. 18),
that is, with respect to his true spiritual nature he is dead in trespasses
and sins. There is probably no essential difference between the two
nouns; the root meaning of the first is 'missing the mark' and of the sec-
ond 'slipping' or 'falling from the way,' and thus both express man's fail-
ure to live as he could and ought."—Frances Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul
to the Ephesians, p. 68.

  2. Children of Disobedience (Eph. 2:2, 3).

  What are some of the characteristics of "children of disobedience"?
Verses 2, 3.


  The one main characteristic of "children of disobedience" is that they
are entirely self-willed and self-centered. Because of this they con-
sciously resist the will of God.
  It is frightening when a willful child continually and deliberately
chooses to disregard the will of his or her parents. But how awful it is
when children of God flout the authority of their heavenly Parent! (See
Prov. 13:1; 17:25.) The way that we relate to Christ, God's Son, reveals
the way that we will relate to the Father. (See John 3:35, 36; 14:21.)
  The disobedient child walks "according to the course of this world,"
the course that is easiest to follow. The disobedient child also walks "ac-
cording to the prince of the power of the air" (Eph. 2:2).

   What does the reference to walking in verse 2 suggest about our former
life of sin?


   The term walking suggests the image of the sinner taking step after step
into evil. Psalm 1 outlines what some see as a progressive decline into evil
in three steps: (1) walking in the counsel of the ungodly, (2) standing in the
way of sinners, and (3) sitting in the seat of the scornful. Perhaps the
natural bent is to walk in the direction of evil and, as we progress, to
become more established in it. Because the non-Christian walk leads the
sinner downhill, the way seems deceptively easy.


                                                                           31
   What mental picture do you form when you read the words "lusts of the
flesh" and "desires of the flesh"?


     The word for "lusts" here is an unusual word in that the original Greek
word can be used in a positive sense as well as a negative. Basically
meaning "desires," it is used most often to describe "deceitful lusts,"
"worldly lusts," or "fleshly lusts." (See Eph. 4:22; Titus 2:12; 1 Peter
2:11.)
  ..    However, on one occasion Christ used this identical word in a posi-
tive sense when He said, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover
with you before I suffer" (Luke 22:15). Paul once wrote that he endeav-
ored to see the Thessalonians face to face "with great desire," using the
same word. A comparison of these usages suggests that "deceitful lusts"
are a perversion of God-given motives. Because of sin, selflessness is
perverted into self-centeredness, ambition is prostituted into avarice and
greed, and love becomes lust. Such is the power of evil that it takes what-
ever God planted originally within humanity as good and turns it into evil.
On the other hand, the power of the gospel is such that it takes what is
evil—the perverted desires and inclinations, for example—and trans-
forms them into good.

11. THE NEW LIFE (Eph. 2:4-10).

     1. Made Alive by God (verses 4-6).

  What two miracles has God performed for us because of His rich mercy
and great love?


 This remarkable passage begins with the two simple words, "But
God." These words assure us that no predicament of ours is too great for
God to solve.

   According to Ephesians 2:4-6, what is basic to the development of Chris-
tian unity?


  In reading these verses it would be easy to overlook the theme of unity,
just as a person walking along a beach might overlook a rare shell unless
specifically searching for it. But the theme of unity is brought out in the
fact that, at all stages in the Christian life, we must be united completely
with Christ. There must be a.divine-human togetherness.

COMPLETE: Read Ephesians 2:5, 6; then fill in the missing words in the
blanks below:

     • We are made              together with Christ.
     • We are               up together with Him.

       • We sit in                          together with Him.

       2. Raised up by God (Eph. 2:6, 7).

       What characteristics mark those who dwell in "heavenly places"?

       "Those who appreciate this great sacrifice receive from the Saviour
     that most precious of all gifts—a clean heart. They gain an experience
     that is more valuable than gold or silver or precious stones. They sit to-
     gether in heavenly places in Christ, enjoying in communion with Him the
     joy and peace that He alone can give. They love Him with heart and mind
     and soul and strength, realizing that they are His blood-bought heritage.
     Their spiritual eyesight is not dimmed by worldly policy or worldly aims.
     They are one with Christ as He is one with the Father."—Ellen G. White,
     In Heavenly Places, p. 7.
       There can be just one solution for disunity and disharmony: sitting to-
     gether with Christ in heavenly places. What would it be like if church
     members would spend just one thoughful hour each day sitting with
     Christ?

       What is God's overall purpose in raising us up? Eph. 2:7.


       In the resurrection of Christ, God exemplified the exceeding greatness
     of His power at work. (See Eph. 1:19, 20.) In our spiritual resurrection,
     God demonstrates the kindness that is part of the immeasurable riches of
     His grace. He will continue to do so throughout eternity.

61
       3. Saved by Grace Through Faith (Eph. 2:8, 9).

       How are we saved? Is it through grace alone, or through faith alone, or
     through grace and faith combined?


       Often we hear it said that salvation is "by faith alone," and that is cor-
     rect in a sense. But a deeper truth is involved. Actually our faith does not
     save us, but God's grace does. If there were any saving power inherent in
     our faith, then faith would become another work, as Martin Luther so
     aptly pointed out. We do not even have enough strength to exercise faith
     by ourselves. That is why faith has to be a gift of God. But we can cry out,
     "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief" (Mark 9:24), as did the father
     of the demon-possessed boy.

     ILLUMINATION: "There is nothing in faith that makes it our saviour.
     Faith cannot remove our guilt. Christ is the power of God unto salvation
     to all that believe."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-
     tary, vol. 6, p. 1071.

       Spiritually we are as if we have been brought to a hospital, having been
     critically injured in an accident. There is no hope that we should see the

                                                                               33
      light of another day unless prompt action is taken. We have great confi-
      dence in the doctor and all his associates; we have faith that the medicine
      likewise will provide healing. But it is the divinely-directed operation of
      nature that in the end brings healing. Doctors admit that they have no
      power to cure disease, nor does the medicine they prescribe cure, al-
      though it may assist the healing process. Doctors are instruments in
      God's hand, and it is God's power that brings healing. Antibiotics can kill
      disease germs, but that does not make the patient well. God has to heal
      the inflamed area and repair the damage. Because the same Greek word
      used in the New Testament for "saving" sometimes is used for "healing,"
      it would be consistent to read the verse this way: "By grace are ye saved
      [healed] through faith; and that not of yourselves."
         Salvation, then, is a free gift from God received by means of faith. This
      faith does not originate in us, but it can reside in us and work for us. Paul
      says that it is "the operation of God" (Col. 2:12). (See also Gal. 5:22.)

      ILLUMINATION: "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and
      knows best what is for our good. Thus, instead of our own, it leads us to
      choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in
      place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righ-
      teousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His
      ownership and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have been
      pointed out as secrets of life's success. It is faith that puts us in posses-
      sion of these principles."—Education, p. 253.

        Why does God not want us to have any occasion for boasting? 1 Cor. 1:27-
      29 (Read this passage also in a modern translation, if available.)



kg,        4. Created in Christ Unto Good Works (Eph. 2:10).

        How do good works fit into the picture? Does saving faith eliminate the
      need for good works? Verse 10.


         Because God has raised us up from the spiritual death that is the result
      of sin, as new creatures and God's children, we are His handiwork.

        How can the children of disobedience and the children of wrath be trans-
      formed into children of God? 2 Cor. 5:17.


        The good works that God expects can be produced only when the will
      and affections have been committed totally to God's direction. Some-
      times it is asserted that when a person becomes a Christian, good works
      come naturally. Of course, there is some truth there, but the statement
      could be misleading. Good works are the product of a struggle. The
      Christian life is a battle and a march. The enemy of souls does not give in
      one inch without a fight. Even for a Christian there is enough of the old

      34
nature left so that any attempts at doing good will be met with fierce resis-
tance, a resistance from both without and within. Good works are the
outgrowth of a crucifixion. Scripture never speaks of them as coming
easily or naturally. True, it describes them in terms of fruit (Luke 3:8;
John 15:4, 5; Gal. 5:22); but we must not forget that fruit also is not pro-
duced without a struggle—a struggle against the attacks of insects, or
birds, or fruit-eating bats, and the ravages of wind, lightning, or hail.
Sometimes it is a struggle for a fruit tree to obtain enough water for the
fruit to mature.
   The Christian would despair of bearing fruit were it not for the miracle-
working power of God exercised in the creation of a new life. This new
creation is made "in Christ." Paul describes God's creative power as seen
in nature (Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16; Rom. 1:25), and this power is no different
from that which is used in creating a human being into a new person.

ILLUMINATION: "It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
wrought by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made
pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine
nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all he-
reditary and cultivated tendencies to evil and to impress His own charac-
ter upon His church."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Rom. 4:16; 6:5-18; 7:15-23;
8:5-8; Gal. 5:16-21; Steps to Christ, "The Test of Discipleship," pages 57-
65.
   "Grace is too commonly regarded as a pleasing sentiment, a welcome
feeling of cosy favour entertained toward us by our God. The interpreta-
tion is ineffective, and inevitably cripples the life in which it prevails.
Grace is more than a smile of good nature. It is not the shimmering of an
illumined lake; it is the sun-lit majesty of an advancing sea. It is a tran-
scendent and ineffable force, the outgoing energies of the redeeming per-
sonality of God washing against the polluted shores of human need."—
J. H. Jowett, quoted by W. E. Orchard and N. P. Williams, The Study
Bible: Ephesians to Philemon (New York: Richard R. Smith, 1930), p. 18.

SUMMARY: Life can be characterized as a continuous series of con-
trasts: night and day, planting and harvest, summer and winter, laughter
and sorrow, success and failure. But the greatest contrast of all is be-
tween the old life of sin and the new life in Christ that we receive through
God's creative power.

 APPLICATION: Take a moment to list your deepest concerns and bur-
 dens. Which one concern outweighs all others? How does it affect your
 spiritual development? How much of the "old" way of life is left over in
 your life and occasionally manifests itself? How much progress have you
 made in the "new" life? Does life perhaps seem even more of a struggle
 then when you first set foot on the Christian pathway? Are you willing to
 let Jesus bring you full victory? Do you believe that He who brought you
 new life will enable you to become like Him?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 2:11-22.

       MEMORY TEXT: "In whom all the building fitly framed together
       groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded
       together for an habitation of God through the spirit" (Eph. 2:21, 22).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: In the first two chapters of Ephesians Paul uses
two different types of imagery to describe the church: the human body
and a building. Both types of metaphors have much in common and em-
phasize the same point—the church must be unified if it is to function
successfully.

INTRODUCTION: Today some of the deepest divisions among human
beings are caused by differences in race, cultures, and religion. These
struggles do not take place just between the "haves" and the "have-
nots," or between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. When wars,
rebellions, or riots arise, they often can be traced to long-lasting animos-
ities based on cultural or racial tensions. Add to the racial differences the
deep-seated hatred due to religious differences, and the conflict is com-
pounded greatly. Pick up almost any major daily newspaper or weekly
news magazine and you will find vivid, up-to-date illustrations of this ten-
sion between societies divided by such differences.

36
         The animosities we read about today reflect the animosities that ex-
      isted between Jews and Gentiles some 1900 years ago. The hatred be-
      tween the two groups was racial and cultural as well as religious in na-
      ture. The deeper the hatred and the greater the conflict, the more of a
      miracle it would take to reconcile the two groups. Violence was mani-
      fested not only in physical acts of sabotage and torture, but also in slan-
      der, innuendo, false reports, and verbal attacks. The miracle that recon-
      ciliation would take would have to clear away the bitterness of the mind
      and erase the hatred that was etched almost indelibly upon people's
      memories.
         Last week we studied about the amazing miracle of God's power that
      rescued the Gentiles from their former way of life. This week we will
      view this power in action as it melts the hearts of the Jews and levels the
      barrier between Jew and Gentile.

        Paul asks the Gentiles to remember that in their "time past" life, they
      belonged to the uncircumcision, being without Christ. Circumcision was
      an external sign of God's covenant with His people, a covenant that was
      said to be written on the heart (Jer. 31:33). When God gave this important
      ceremony to Abraham and his descendents, He said to Abraham, "My
      covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant" (Gen. 17:13).

      THINK IT THROUGH: Does God take a risk in giving us symbols and
      outward signs? If so, why does He give them?

         The risk God took in giving circumcision to Israel was that the outward
      sign would become more significant to them than would the inward expe-
      rience it was intended to represent. Religiosity would become a substi-
      tute for true religion, and the people involved would spend their time and
      efforts pursuing the love of praise rather than the praise of love. The same
      thing also can happen with baptism—the Christian ceremony that takes
      the place of and holds the significance that circumcision did with Abra-
      ham's descendants. The Gentiles were "called Uncircumcision" (Eph.
      2:11). They did not belong to the community of the covenant.

      ILLUMINATION: "Paul in Rom. 2:28 had had to insist that true circumci-
      sion was not something external and physical, but 'inwardly' and 'of the
      heart'. The outward mark had come to be not so much a sign that God
      ruled the man's heart, but all too often a substitute for it. So in Phil. 3:3
      Paul wrote to those who had become Christians, whether Jew or Gentile:
      'We are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit, and glory in
      Christ Jesus, and put [have] no confidence in the flesh' (i.e., in the merely
      physical mark of circumcision)."—C. Leslie Mitton, Ephesians (London:
      Marshall, Morgan & Scott, 1976), p. 102.

                                                                                37

      We need to balance these comments with the thought that belonging to
    God's community demands some external evidence as well as the deep
    experience of having Christ with us. Although the spiritual relationship to
    Christ is vital, the formal part of belonging to the church also is important
    because it helps keep us well grounded spiritually.


n   11. STEPS TO ONENESS OR RECONCILIATION (Eph. 2:13-18).

         How are we brought near to God and to His community? Verse 13.


       Life is full of contrasts—sickness contrasted with health, joys with sor-
    row, triumph with tragedy, success with failure, memory of the past with
    hope for the future. In the same way, in the spiritual life the sinful life of
    the past can be contrasted with the new life in Christ.
       Past. The "past" life of the believer was characterized by disobedience
    (Eph. 2:2), "wrath" (verse 3), being without Christ, without hope, with-
    out God, and being alienated from God's people (verses 11, 12).
       Present. The present or "new" life is one of a deep, present spiritual
    reality that produces unity. Those "who sometimes were far off" are now
    "made nigh." This is possible only because they are "now in Christ
    Jesus" (verse 13).
       Being "now in union with Christ Jesus" (verse 13, NEB), the true be-
    liever leaves behind his former state of being "apart from Christ" (verse
    12, TEV). Separation is no longer a factor in his attitudes, thoughts, or
    experience. The life he lives is the "in" life—in Christ, in God, in the
    Spirit, in peace, in love, in hope, in the church, and in its mission, and in
    unity.
       "Made nigh by the blood of Christ." Christ's sacrificial death
    "cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7). It cleanses us from the sins of
    separation and alienation that started the human race on the downward
    path away from the Creator.

    THINK IT THROUGH: In what way has the blood of Christ brought us
    into closer union with God than if we had never sinned? (See The Desire of
    Ages, p. 25.)

      How alone can the barriers that sin has erected between God and us and
    between us and our fellow human beings be broken down? Eph. 2:14.


       "There was a barrier both literally and spiritually. In Jerusalem, be-
    tween the temple proper and the Court of the Gentile, there was a stone
    wall on which there was an inscription in Greek and Latin 'which forbade
    any foreigner to go in, under pain of death'. It is strangely significant that
    Paul was finally arrested and condemned by the Jews in Jerusalem on the
    basis of a false accusation that he took an Ephesian, Trophimus, beyond
    this barrier (Acts xxi.29f.). But Christ had now broken down the barrier
    between Jews and Gentiles, of which that dividing wall in the temple was
    a symbol."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians

    38
       (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1963),
       pp. 81, 82.


       SEARCH AND LEARN: Today society has erected certain barriers that
       alienate people. Legislation has a hard time removing these barriers. Is it
       part of a Christian's task to remove barriers? How did Christ go about re-
       moving the chains that society had forged around certain people? John 4
       would be a good place to begin searching for answers to these questions.



1.11
         What did Christ do to remove or abolish the "middle wall" separating
       Jews and Gentiles? Eph. 2:15, 16.


          First, Christ had to abrogate completely that which the Jews had al-
       lowed to divide and alienate the two groups—the ceremonial system. He
       did so by dying on the cross. His death removed the need for the system
       of types and ceremonies that had pointed forward to the Redeemer.
          Second, when Christ ascended to His Father, He took with Him human
       flesh and human form. His ministry in the sanctuary in heaven on our
       behalf did away with the need for an earthly priesthood, as the torn veil of
       the Jerusalem temple so dramatically illustrated. Since that time the be-
       liever—whether Jew or Gentile—has unlimited access to the Father
       through the ministry of Jesus. (See Heb. 6:19, 20; 7:25.)

         By what agent are we brought into the presence of the Father and thus
       into closeness with fellow believers? Eph. 2:17, 18.


         The peace that Paul proclaimed is that which results from unity. Paul
       had discussed previously the means for producing the unified church:
       Christ and what He did for us on the cross.

       COMPLETE the following in order to review how Paul emphasized oneness
       in the verses we have studied so far this week:

         a. "For he is our peace, who hath made both            " (verse 14).

         b. "To make in himself of twain           new man" (verse 15).

         c. "That he might reconcile both unto God in                 body by the
            cross" (verse 16).

          d. "Through him we both have access by               Spirit unto the Fa-
             ther" (verse 18).

       THINK IT THROUGH: Why is there so much emphasis on unity in this
       section of Ephesians? What does it mean to us today?

                                                                                39

      I11. THE RESULTS OF RECONCILATION (Eph. 2:19-22).
MN
       What significance do you find in the contrast between being a citizen of
      God's household and being a foreigner? Verse 19.


        The church is the city in which the saints, members of the spiritual
      commonwealth, have their citizenship and those who were strangers and
      foreigners are now accepted as fellow-citizens.

      THINK IT THROUGH:What are some of the duties and privileges of being
      members of God's community of faith?


         While Christ's sacrifice and death took place as much for the non-
       member as for the member, there rests upon each member a greater re-
      sponsibility and greater privileges. Each member is to be an example to
      the believer as well as to the non-believer in all things. The member who
      falls into flagrant sin becomes much more of a stumbling block to others
      than does a non-member who falls into that same sin.
         Sometimes members accept all the rights and privileges of being citi-
      zens of the household of God but fail to realize that there are duties and
      responsibilities connected with those rights. They love to exert their in-
      dependence of thinking, freedom of teaching, and liberty of opinion while
      ignoring the duties demanded of the citizens of God's kingdom. Our du-
      ties include obedience to Christ and all His commands, responsibility of
      conduct, submission to God-given authority, and active participation in
      the mission of the church.

        If the church is compared to a building, how is it to be kept from being
      swept away in time of storm? Eph. 2:20; Col. 2:7.


         It is fascinating to study Paul's use of metaphors and spiritual symbol-
      ism. First, we find him comparing the church to the human body (1:23;
      2:16; 4:4, 12, 16; 5:23, 30). One of the main lessons we learn from this
      metaphor is the close relationship and unity that is to exist between the
      body and its Head as well as between the members of the body and their
      fellow members. Members have different functions but are to work to-
      gether in unity.
         Second, we find Paul drawing upon the symbol of a building, most
      likely a temple. The building stones must have cohesion, or the temple
      will topple over during the first earthquake or windstorm. Again unity is a
      key element.
         Each stone in this hallowed structure gains its true worth from its rela-
      tionship with the cornerstone that represents Christ. "A stone that does
      not shine is worthless. That which constitutes the value of our churches is
      not dead, lusterless stones, but living stones, stones that catch the bright
      beams from the Chief Cornerstone, even the Sun of Righteousness—the
      bright glory in which are combined the beams of mercy and truth that

    have met together, of righteousness and peace that have kissed each
    other."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
    p. 1116.

      What is the main purpose of the church? Why do we need to be part of a
    "structure"? Eph. 2:21.


       It is interesting that the same expression "fitly framed together" in the
    original language appears elsewhere in Ephesians: "From whom the
    whole body fitly joined together . . . , maketh increase of the body unto
    the edifying of itself in love" (Eph. 4:16). (Emphasis supplied.) This ex-
    pression, which means "to join closely together," is used first in connec-
    tion with the symbolism of the building, then in connection with the sym-
    bolism of the body. At first it may appear that Paul is mixing symbols that
    do not match—the building being cold and lifeless and the body being
    living and pulsating. But Paul viewed the building in a different light be-
    cause he was adding a spiritual dimension. He thought of the building as
    alive and dynamic; in fact, it grows , as he states in verse 21. One of God's
    purposes for the church is for it to be alive and growing so that God can
    dwell in and be seen in it.

t      How can Paul's use of "temple" imagery in verse 21 be harmonized with
i    1 Peter 2:4, 5.


        Peter calls the individual members "lively stones," or "living stones,"
     whereas Paul states that the building "grows." It would seem that in or-
     der to have a growing temple, living stones would be required. The stones
     are unusual in that they merge into and intertwine with one another, just
     as the personality of a husband blends with the personality of his wife
     whom he loves and cherishes dearly. There can be no unity without this
     growing together, this blending of interests, goals, feelings, and affec-
     tions.

       What additional spiritual lessons can we draw from Paul's comparison of
     the church to a building?
        Here are some possibilities:
        1. To be of any use, building stones must be brought from the quarry,
           which requires an expenditure of toil, energy, and perseverance.
        2. The true value or worth of a building stone should not be judged on
           the basis of its roughened exterior.
        3. Each stone has its appointed place in the building. It may require
           much cutting and polishing before fitting it into that place.
        4. The stronger stones are used for the pillars and support structures;
           the weaker ones are used to complete the building. Each performs a
           vital service.

        What more is required of the Christian other than being part of a church
     structure or taking part in church activities? Eph. 2:22.
                                                                               41
  There is a world of difference • between being "builded" and being
"builded together." (Notice how Paul returns again to his favorite theme
of togetherness.) We can sit from Sabbath to Sabbath with the same peo-
ple in church pews, and yet there may be no togetherness. We may be in
close proximity in body but not in spirit. Unity does not mean being with
people; it means being interested in people—in their cares and concerns,
their triumphs and tragedies, their joys and sorrows. Some of the
loneliest people may attend round after round of parties or social events
seeking togetherness, but they have no one that truly cares for them. A
member can sit in church week after week and still be lonely inside. The
unity that should characterize the caring church comes from "casting all
your care upon him; for he careth for you" (1 Peter 5:7). If we truly are
followers of Christ, we too will care deeply when others are hurting
deeply.

THINK IT THROUGH: If it is not enough to sit on the same pew with
others, then how do we show that we indeed care? How does an ordinary
church become a caring church?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Romans 9:31-33; 1 Peter
2:1-10; and Psalm 144:12.
  "The mighty cleaver of truth has taken you out of the quarry of the
world. You were rough stones with jagged edges, bruising and marring
whoever you came in contact with; there is a work to be done to smooth
off the rough edges. If you appreciated the value of the work that is to be
done in the workshop of God, you would welcome the blows of the ax
and the hammer. Your self-esteem will be hurt, your high opinion of your-
self will be cut away by the ax and the hammer, and the roughness of your
character will be smoothed off; and when self and carnal propensities are
worked away, then the stone will assume proper proportions for the heav-
enly building, and then the polishing, refining, subduing, burnishing pro-
cesses will begin, and you will be molded after the model of Christ's char-
acter. His own image is to be reflected in the polished character of His
human agent, and the stone is to be fitted for the heavenly building."—
Sons and Daughters of God, p. 319.
  When does most of the polishing take place—while the stone is yet in
the quarry or after it has been fitted into its place within the structure?

SUMMARY: The church is compared to both a body and a temple. The
body derives its unity and harmony of action from one source, and that is
the head; the temple derives its united strength also from its connection
with one source, and that is the cornerstone. Spiritually speaking, Christ
is both the Head and the Cornerstone.

APPLICATION: Ask yourself, How closely connected am I to the One
who is the source of all strength and unity? What do people think of
Christ when they learn that I am His representative?

PM.    is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the un-

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Because Paul was given special insights into the
mystery of God, he was anxious to be able to share those insights with
others, particularly with the Gentiles.

 INTRODUCTION: In this week's lesson Paul picks up the themes that he
 dealt with in chapter 1 and expands them. He reestablishes his creden-
 tials for a divine calling. It is vital that we sense a "calling" for our
 lifework, for it is the sense of calling or the sense of mission that makes
 our work a delight rather than drudgery. When difficulties arise and road-
 blocks stand in the way, it is the knowledge of our calling that moves us
 forward against seemingly insurmountable opposition.
    Paul's calling came in the form of a revelation. Through that revelation
he received the dispensation, or stewardship, of God's grace to take the
gospel to the Gentiles. He received the stewardship of "the mystery"
(verse 3)—something unknown in the past in the way that it "is now re-
vealed" to God's apostles and prophets "by the Spirit" (verse 5).
    The content of this revelation stood in total opposition to many of
Paul's previous convictions and to many of the traditions of the Jews. The
Israelites thought that God would have nothing to do with the Gentile
world. But this was not so. The Gentiles are fellow-heirs, members of the
same body, and partakers of God's promises, provided that they are "in
Christ" and this "by the gospel" (verse 6).

                                                                         43
sr I. PAUL'S SPECIAL COMMISSION (Eph. 3:1-7).
     As he wrote this epistle, Paul was undergoing imprisonment in Rome. On
    whose behalf was he suffering imprisonment? Eph. 3:1; Acts 21:27.29.


       Although Paul was a prisoner of the Roman authorities, waiting to be
    brought before Nero's judgment, he considered that passing reality to be
    an illustration of his permanent spiritual reality. Paul considered himself a
    prisoner of Jesus Christ, under the arrest of His calling, to be an apostle
    to the Gentiles. He had come to be a prisoner while doing this work and
    for the cause of the upbuilding of the Lord's church.
       It was because of his great burden for the Gentiles and his active labor
    among them that he was arrested within the sacred precincts of the tem-
    ple. He had been accused of bringing Ephesian Gentile Christians into the
    Court of the Jews, rather than leaving them in the Court of the Gentiles.
    Probably it was Jews from the province of Asia who accused Paul of this
    violation. They also must have come from Ephesus because they recog-
    nized "Trophimus an Ephesian," whom they charged that Paul brought
    into the temple.

         What special ministry was given to Paul? Eph. 3:2.


      The "dispensation" or, better, the "administration" of God's grace is
    the "dispensation of the gospel" (1 Cor. 9:17), which makes those who
    receive it "stewards of the mysteries of God" (1 Cor. 4:1). In Ephesians
    1:10 we found that the word dispensation was used in the sense of "stew-
    ardship."

    ILLUMINATION: "The word here (oikonomia) is one that was used ei-
    ther for the administration of a household (oikos), or for the responsibility
    of the one who administered it. It is used several times in the New Testa-
    ment in this latter sense of stewardship. For the Church is the household
    of God, Jesus Christ is Chief Steward, and under Him His ministers are
    called to serve as stewards (see 1 Cor. iv. lf., ix.17; Tit.i.7; 1 Pet.
    iv.10)."—Frances Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians (Grand
    Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1963), p. 52.
      A steward must maintain the same relationship to the Chief Steward as
    an undershepherd must maintain to the Chief Shepherd. (See 1 Peter 5:
    1-4.)

         In what way was Paul's ministry different from Peter's? Gal. 2:7.


      Paul could have quarreled with Peter about who was to have the special
    position of "apostle to the Jews" just as Peter could have contended with-
    Paul for the "apostleship to the Gentiles." But each was content with his
    own role. Actually, Paul could have considered himself better qualified
    for Peter's position, having been a "Hebrew of the Hebrews" (Phil. 3:5).

    44
    His education as a strict Pharisee under the famed teacher Gamaliel could
    have provided him with the necessary academic credentials for relating
    much better to his fellow countrymen than Peter could. But each ac-
    cepted his divinely-assigned task.

    THINK IT THROUGH: When someone else receives a church office, such
    as head elder, deacon, Sabbath School leader, or school board member—
    positions for which I think I am better qualified—what should my attitude
    be?


n     How did Paul receive the knowledge of the mystery of Christ? Was it any
    different from the way that we receive a knowledge of spiritual things to-
    day? Eph. 3:3, 4.


      Paul already had said that he received his ministry from God (verse 2).
    Now he defines the grounds on which he bases his knowledge of the gos-
    pel and his mission—God revealed these to him. (See Gal. 1:11, 12; 2:2;
    Acts 9:4-18; 22:7-16; 26:17-19).

      What does Paul mean by the term mystery in Ephesians 3:4-6? Is it any
    different from what he had mentioned in Ephesians 1:9, 10 or from what is
    recorded in Colossians 1:26, 27?


      Both in the first few verses here in Ephesians 3 and in Colossians 1:25-
    27, Paul speaks about the special dispensation or stewardship that has
    been granted to him. What has been put under his care is not a bank ac-
    count, or a tent-making business, or a rich person's collection of sculp-
    tures and art work. Instead it is the "mystery" which had been hidden
    "from the beginning of the world" (Eph. 3:9) or "from ages and from
    generations" in the past (Col. 1:26). Some have asserted that Paul defines
    the mystery differently in Ephesians from the way that he defines it else-
    where.
      In Ephesians 6:19 Paul speaks of the "mystery of the gospel" in a gen-
    eral sense, and in Ephesians 3:6 he speaks of the mystery as it relates to
    the Gentiles in a specific sense. There is no inconsistency here.

      According to Paul, what two factors determined his ministry? Eph. 3:7.


       If it is to be most effective, grace must be accompanied by power. In
    any type of true Christian ministry, God's grace and power can be seen in
    action. In that way all the glory and the credit for results will be attributed
    to the true Source.
       Paul speaks from his own experience of the grace that set him apart on
    the Damascus road and the power that made such remarkable changes in
    his life."He was unworthy to be a preacher of God's word, because he
    had been a persecutor; but the grace of God had made him all that he was,
    a new man in Christ (1 Cor. xv.10). It also made him Christ's servant in the

                                                                                45
proclamation of His gospel, and in the particular work that he had of min-
istering it to the Gentiles. But mercy was not enough. He was also a min-
ister by the effectual working of his power. The task to which he was
called needed no mere human strength and patience and power of
endurance. It needed the power of God, and, as in i.19, Paul shows that
power is given, and not just as an abstract thing, or as a force applied
from afar, but as energizing strength (energeia) operative in his life by the
Spirit's indwelling."—Frances Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephe-
sians, pp. 95, 96.

11. THE SCOPE OF PAUL'S COMMISSION (Eph. 3:8-13).

     Why did Paul call himself "less than the least of all saints"? Verses 8, 9.


   Paul may have been the one convert to Christianity who was responsi-
ble for the deaths of more Christians than any other convert. For this
reason, he may have felt that his guilt before God was greater than that of
the converts who came out of the dissipating practices of paganism, such
as the very ones to whom he is addressing this epistle—the Ephesians.
This is not "mock humility" on the part of Paul because false humility
never wins converts to Christ. Mock humility is foreign to the spirit of
Christ, who genuinely humbled Himself, even to a lowly death on Calva-
ry's cross. Paul is not boasting of his humility, but is sharing his amaze-
ment with fellow church members that God would call him to such a
weighty and important task.
   Paul had to be blinded with God's grace in order that he could help
others see the depths of God's mystery. If he were to permit the thought
to reside in his mind that he was better than the other converts to Chris-
tianity, God's grace could not be poured out fully into his life. They would
not be able to see the depths of God's mystery.

   Why does Paul emphasize God's creatorship when discussing the depths
of the mystery? Eph. 3:9.


   The Greeks taught that matter is eternal. The eighteenth-century
French deists likewise believed matter to be eternal. One problem with
such a concept is that God could not have been the Creator of all things if
matter was eternal. Scripture stoutly rejects the pagan Greek idea of the
eternity of matter when it affirms that "things which are seen were not
made of things which do appear" (Heb. 11:3). The mystery of God is
linked in Ephesians with that which is from eternity—not to inanimate
matter but to God the living Creator. (See Eph. 3:9, RSV.)
   The idea that the universe has been in existence for millions or even
billions of years is not foreign to Seventh-day Adventist belief as long as
we avoid the pagan concept of the eternity of matter and as long as we
attribute the existence of everything to God's creative power. Along with
that we need to recognize that our inhabited world was brought into being
only a comparatively few thousand years ago. The point here is that

46
    God's mystery is older than the oldest created thing; and the marvel is
    that we, along with the Ephesian believers, have the privilege of seeing
    this ancient mystery being unfolded before our eyes.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: To understand better Paul's teachings about Cre-
E   ation, study the following texts and note to whom each is addressed.

      a. Acts 14:15

      b. Rom. 1:19, 20

      c. 1 Cor 8.6
      What role does the church have in sharing the mystery of God? Eph.
    3:10.


       Paul was extremely grateful for "the privilege of proclaiming to the
    Gentiles the good news of the unfathomable riches of Christ, and of bring-
    ing to light how this hidden purpose was to be put into effect" (Eph. 3:8,
    9, NEB). Is the task of the church any different from Paul's task?

    ILLUMINATION: "God has made His church on the earth a channel of
    light, and through it He communicates His purposes and His will. He
    does not give to one of His servants an experience independent of and
    contrary to the experience of the church itself. Neither does He give one
    man a knowledge of His will for the entire church while the church—
    Christ's body—is left in darkness. In His providence He places His ser-
    vants in close connection with His church in order that they may have
    less confidence in themselves and greater confidence in others whom He
    is leading out to advance His work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 163.

    ILLUSTRATION: Even collective effort is not enough without being con-
    nected to the source of power. How much light is provided by a carload of
    unlit matches or by a warehouse filled with candles that have not yet been
    used? Each must be individually struck or lit in order to become effective.
    How much light does a case of unattached light bulbs give off? Before the
    church can provide light to a dark world the individual members must be
    connected to its only available Source of power.

       What other dimension of the mystery of God did Paul mention? Eph.
     3:11.


       Paul stresses the greatness of the mystery in four different ways:
         1. He ties the mystery with the "unsearchable" or "unfathomable
            riches of Christ" (verse 8).
         2. He links it with the greatness of Creation in ages past (verse 9).
         3. He associates it with "the wisdom of God in all its varied forms"
            (verse 10, NEB).

                                                                            47
     4. He emphasizes it as part of God's eternal plan (verse 11).
  The scope of the proclamation and demonstration of God's purpose in-
cludes all created beings:
     1. Gentiles (verse 8, compare Rom. 1:16).
     2. All of mankind (Eph. 3:9).
     3. All heavenly beings (verse 10).
  Thus God's plan touches upon all dimensions, covering all of time and
space. The cross bridges the gap from earth to heaven, and its extended
arms overshadow all of humankind. You may feel yourself outside of the
shadow of the cross and beyond reach of the sunshine of God's love, but
your very existence owes itself to the sustaining power of God. He up-
holds the galaxies in their immensity and is aware when a tiny sparrow
falls to earth. Every breath you take can be traced back to the great wis-
dom and power of God displayed at Creation, and every pulse of blood
that surges through your veins has been made possible by the One who
poured out His blood for you at Calvary, because He loves you. To Christ
you owe everything. The bread you eat is "the purchase of His broken
body." The water you drink "is bought by His spilled blood." (See The
Desire of Ages, p. 660.)
  What qualities does knowing Christ and His eternal plan help develop
within us, and why are they important? Eph. 3:12, 13.


  Boldness is needed so that we can share the mystery with others. While
having boldness, we need not faint, spiritually speaking. It is amazing
that Paul was not concerned to any great extent about himself during his
imprisonment. But he was concerned that the Ephesian believers not
grow faint-hearted as they heard reports of his trials and of his subse-
quent afflictions. What kept Paul in good faith and courage through all of
his troubles was the knowledge that it was part of God's eternal plan. In
other words, his afflictions were for the sake of the Ephesians and other
believers and for their glory and encouragement.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Acts of the Apostles,
pp. 160-165.
   A person committed to the Lord and His truth can endure any amount
of insult and abuse hurled at him as long as he knows that it fits in with a
larger plan. Unknown to him, Paul's trials were for our "glory" and en-
couragement as well. Do we have trials that sometimes are for the glory
of others, even those individuals we have never met?

SUMMARY: In true humility Paul stands amazed that God should bestow
upon him such a weighty responsibility—helping others to see and under-
stand the mystery of God's grace. We too can have a part in the unveiling
of this mystery and in sharing it with others.

APPLICATION: Do I sense God's calling in my life? Am I committed
without reservation to the accomplishment of His purpose? What kind of
testimony to His goodness do I give in my home, in my community, and
to the universe?

      MEMORY TEXT: "Unto him that is able to do exceedingly abun-
 PM   dantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that
      worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus
      throughout all ages, world without end. Amen" (Eph. 3:20, 21).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: In the same way that the greatness of the uni-
verse and the complexity of a single atom is beyond our comprehension,
the fullness of Christ's love cannot be fathomed. Even after studying it for
an eternity we will not have plumbed its depths. Christ can do so much
more for us than we can ever comprehend, including bringing unity out of
disunity.

INTRODUCTION: At this mid-point in the study of our quarter's lesson,
it would be well for us to look once again at the theme we have chosen for
the quarter—unity. Few verses in this inspiring and inspired letter actu-
ally mention the words one or unity, but most verses bear on the topic in
some way. In this week's lesson we focus on a two-fold prayer of Paul's.
In the first part of his prayer he prays that the believers might be
strengthened inwardly by the Spirit.
   Prayers often are the best indicators of what a person's deepest feelings
or heaviest burdens might be. So it is with Paul. Why is he so passionately
concerned that the Ephesian members should have strength? Had they
not received Christ into their lives, and thus should they not already have
experienced the strength that His indwelling presence brings? Of all the
congregations to which Paul wrote, and for which written records exist,
the Ephesians probably received less reproof than any others. But even
 in a vibrant Christian experience, there still is danger that disunity can set
 in like a disease.
                                                                            49
   There is a cause-effect relationship between unity and strength—the
greater the spiritual strength of indviduals, the greater the collective
strength of the congregation. An apt illustration of this principle is a rope.
A rope made of eight or ten strands is much stronger than one made of
only two or three strands. However, if some of the strands of an eight-
strand rope become worn and frayed, then the strength of the entire rope
is weakened.
   In the second part of his prayer Paul asks the Lord to send the Ephe-
sians love, an ever-deepening and ever-widening love. True Christian
love leads to unity. The two best remedies that can be applied to a dis-
united and diseased congregation are Christian love and spiritual
strength. The best way to cooperate with God in the development of love
and spiritual strength is participation in soul-winning activity.

I. THE PRAYER FOR STRENGTH (Eph. 3:14-16).

What kind of example does Paul give us in his prayer life? Verses 14, 15.


   Paul once again is seen to be a praying apostle.As we listen in on his
prayers, we discover that he was not concerned so much for his own
needs as for the needs of those whom he had led to Christ. His prayer was
truly an intercessory prayer. He prayed as parents would pray for the
needs of a precious child. This type of intercessory prayer contains three
vital elements:
  1. It must have something important as its focus.
  2. It must show a deep sense of reverence toward God.
  3. It must be the product of obedience to Christ.

     What was the underlying cause for Paul's fervent prayers?


   The first three words of verse 14 give a crucial clue: "For this cause."
These words refer back to what Paul had written. (See verse 1.) Upon
examining the previous verses and chapters we can discover several pos-
sible motivations for his prayers.
   One is that Paul felt himself a part of the all-embracing unity that in-
cluded the Ephesian believers. Along with them he was a part of the body
of Christ (Eph. 2:16).
   Another motivation was that he was called to a divine mission, or-
dained to carry the gospel to the Gentiles, and certified as one of the
apostles (Eph. 3:1-8). To fail to intercede on behalf of the Ephesian be-
lievers would be to annul his divine ordination.
   A third motivation was the grandeur of the vision he received as he saw
and understood the fellowship of the mystery of salvation that had been
hid from eternal ages past (Eph. 3:9-11). The fact that he had been granted
this special privilege created within him a desire to share it. "For this
cause" Paul bent his travel-worn knees and bowed his deeply tanned face
to pray for those dear to his heart.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the following texts indicate about bowing
    in prayer?

      1 Kings 19:18. An indication of what/



      Luke 22:41, 42. To signify what attitude?



      Rom. 14:10-12. A part of what event/



      Phil. 2:9-11. An acknowledgment that


       All of these texts mention bowing the knee in an attitude of prayer or
    acknowledgment. Does this mean that the only proper form of prayer is
    praying on our knees? Actually, the Bible describes prayers taking place
    both in a kneeling and a standing position, and such prayers being ac-
    cepted by God. Kneeling took place in such cases as Solomon's dedica-
    tion of the temple (1 Kings 8:54), Daniel's daily prayers (Dan. 6:10), and
    Stephen's final prayer (Acts 7:50, 60). Christ mentioned prayer being of-
    fered while standing (Mark 11:25; Luke 18:13). Nehemiah must have been
    standing when he offered a silent petition before a heathen monarch
    (Neh. 2:4).
       Nevertheless, Ellen White counsels: "When you assemble to worship
    God, be sure and bow your knees before Him. . . .
       Our spiritual strength and our influence are not increased by confor-
    mity to a worldly attitude during prayer. . . . Let man come on bended
    knee, as a subject of grace, a suppliant at the footstool of mercy."—Ellen
    G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 1130, 1131.


n     Why does Paul interject the idea at this point (Eph. 3:15) that "the whole
    family in heaven and earth" is named after the Father?


      The model prayer is the Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6:9-13), and the very first
    words of that prayer are "Our Father." Here Paul is appealing to the Fa-
    therhood of God as the basis for the assurance that His prayers are in
    earnest and will be heard in heaven. The words translated "whole family"
    indicate the wide circle of created beings around the universe who are
    included under the Fathership of God.

       What is the burden of Paul's petition in Ephesians 3:16?


       Paul prays that the believer might have inward strength, but it is diffi-

                                                                              51
       cult for someone who is weak in the faith to comprehend how he might be
       able to replace that weakness with strength. The guarantee that this will
       take place is the riches of God's glory. God's glory is synonymous with
       His character. When Moses asked to see God's glory in all its fullness
       (Ex. 33:18), the beautiful facets of God's character were revealed to him
       (Ex. 34:6, 7). Today God's glory is to be revealed on earth through His
       people who reproduce His character. According to Romans 9:23, 24, God
       has made known the "riches of his glory" through his "vessels," and the
       marvel of this is that we who are believers are these "vessels." People
       today depend on us for the revelation of God's glory. The only way they
       can see it is if we become like Christ in words, thoughts, and actions.

       THINK IT THROUGH: How can I receive inward strength from the Fa-
       ther?

         "The might that strengthens is the power of God. . . . The same power
       that converts men must continue in them if there is to be Christian
       growth. Here is where many Christians fail. They do not recognize that
       spiritual endurance requires as much of the grace of God as did the initial
       conversion."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1017.

TRUE   11. THE PRAYER FOR GROWTH (Eph. 3:17-19).

         What one quality more than any other prepares the way for the indwell-
       ing of Christ? Verse 17.


          The faith which Paul is talking about here is not mere intellectual as-
       sent. Paul points out the futility of an intellectual belief that is divorced
       from faith in 1 Timothy 1:4. In Ephesians 3:17 faith is closely linked with
       the indwelling of Christ. The word used in the original language for
       "dwell" means "to dwell permanently." If he chose, Paul could have used
       another Greek word that would have conveyed the connotation of a
       "temporary sojourning." Paul's prayer and concern was that Christ's in-
       dwelling in the lives of the Ephesians would be an experience that would
       last into eternity.

         How can we keep this indwelling experience alive? How can this experi-
       ence be made permanent, and not just a passing fancy? Eph. 3:17, last part.


          The secret of Christian living is to be "rooted and grounded in love"
       (verse 17). The New English Bible speaks of "deep roots and firm founda-
       tions." Some have suggested that Paul is mixing his metaphors here, the
       word rooted being taken from plant life, and the word grounded taken
       from the construction trade. But he must have combined the two symbols
       consciously and for a purpose. In Ephesians 2:21 he also combined the
       organic and inorganic realms: "In whom [Christ] the whole structure is
       joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord" (RSV). So Paul
       skillfully compares the church to both a building and a body. Love is epit-

       52
      omized by the finest example of endurance that we find in the natural
      world—a large-spreading tree that is braced against the severest gales. It
      also is beautifully illustrated in that which gives a building permanence—
      the foundation stone—because it is anchored fast in bedrock. The com-
      bined imagery of trees and building stones is applied especially to youth
      in the Old Testament. (See Ps. 144:12.)

         What effect does the development of a deep, abiding love have upon doc-
      trinal unity within the church? Col. 2:2.


        Only twice is the expression "knit together" used in the New Testa-
      ment, and both times Paul uses it in Colossians. In Colossians 2:19 it in-
      corporates the idea of an organic relationship between the head and the
      rest of the body. Colossians 2:2 states that "being knit together in love"
      leads "unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding."
         As our love for Christ deepens, our desire for a greater knowledge of
      His will and teachings will increase. A deepening love for the Head ought
      to produce a corresponding love for the body and the proper incentive for
      entering into greater doctrinal unity. "When we yearn for a deeper,
      broader realization of the Saviour's love, we shall cry to God for more
      wisdom."—Gospel Workers, p. 177.

      THINK IT THROUGH: Why is doctrinal unity so important to the health
      of the body?

WEB
         What are the dimensions of divine love? How is it to be measured? Eph.
Gil 3:18, 19.

          Paul mentions here "breadth, and length, and depth, and height" as the
       dimensions of God's love. Some scholars have wondered whether per-
       haps Paul has been a bit confused here, listing four dimensions when in
       reality there are but three. Others have suggested that the fourth dimen-
       sion is love itself. But the simplest explanation is that the apostle is
       speaking from the standpoint of a single human observer: that person
       may go forward and backward (length), far to the left or to the right
       (breadth), to the deepest sea (depth), or the highest mountain (height),
       and still not escape from the sphere of God's love. God's love is not boxed
       in by dimensions. This is an echoing of the sentiments expressed in Ro-
       mans 8:38, 39 where Paul exclaims that absolutely nothing—neither
       "height nor depth"—could "separate us from the love of God, which is in
       Christ Jesus our Lord."
          It is comforting to know that when we stray to the right or to the left,
       God's love in all its breadth always is there to woo us back to the straight
       and narrow path, the only path of safety. Whether we are making progress
       forward in the Christian life, or we begin to slip backward, we are never
       outside of the canopy of His infinite love, for the arms of the cross reach
        from heaven to the darkest corner of the earth. On rare occasions we may
        ascend to the very heights of success in our Christian struggles, and there

                                                                                53
        taste fully of His victorious, all-conquering love; but so often we slip into
        the depths of discouragement. But even there we can experience the
        depths of His forgiving love that knows no limits.
           No matter how rebellious we have been as His children, it is reassuring
        to know that we cannot escape from the sphere of God's love.

        SEARCH AND LEARN: Besides His love, what are some other aspects
        about God that are impossible to measure, humanly speaking? Ps. 57:10;
        139:1-6; Isa. 40:28, 29; Rom. 11:33.


           Because we are (mite, and because He is infinite, it is exceedingly diffi-
        cult to even begin to appreciate and understand God's great love. We are
        like little children, letting the tiny sand grains of God's love slip through
        our fingers, while the great ocean of His measureless love lies just before
        us, waiting to be explored. Such is true of His other qualities:
           o His great wisdom and unsearchable understanding.
           o His matchless mercies and never-failing forgiveness.
           o His untiring strength and creative power.
           o His knowledge of our needs and willingness to help us.
           We have no idea of the greatness of these qualities. If we did we would
        exhibit a much stronger faith, a faith that would indeed move mountains
        of difficulties.

TRH U
        I11. PRAISE TO GOD FOR HIS GREATNESS (Eph. 3:20, 21).

           Paul introduces a doxology here in the middle of his epistle when nor-
        mally it would be used at the end as a grand finale. When he wrote to the
        Romans he concluded his letter with a doxology that began and ended
        with the same style of expression used here: "Now to him that is . . . be
        glory through Jesus Christ for ever" (Rom. 16:25-27). Jude used a similar
        style to conclude his brief letter (Jude 24, 25). Actually the close of chap-
        ter 3 in Ephesians marks the end of the first half of the book, the doctrinal
        portion. The second half, chapters 4-6, deals with the practical side of
        Christianity—the Christian's relationship to fellow Christians.

           How can we begin to understand God's awesome power when it is stated
        as being beyond what we are able to "ask or think"? Eph. 3:20.


          Here we find Paul using a literary device that can be called a "double
        superlative" (compare Eph. 1:19). He could have easily said, "above all
        that we ask or think" and he would have been absolutely correct. But he
        has gone a step farther in saying that God can do for us "exceeding abun-
        dantly above all that we ask or think" (Emphasis supplied).
          To comprehend the greatness of God's power we must first compre-
        hend the greatness of the universe that surrounds us. The world's most
        brilliant scientists find it challenging to understand the greatness of the
        universe and the vastness of space that separates galaxies and star sys-
        tems. They have chosen the fastest traveling unit known in the universe

        54
to measure these vast distances—the speed of light. Light travels at
186,000 miles per second. In other words, the light which bounces off the
moon at night reaches the earth in less than one and one half seconds, and
the sun's hot rays travel to earth in only 8 minutes and 20 seconds—about
the time it takes the average jogger to run one mile. Our nearest neighbor-
ing star, Alpha Centauri, is four and one half light-years away, or the same
as 140,000 round trips between the earth and the sun. Our solar system is
a tiny part of a swirling cluster of stars called the Milky Way Galaxy. The
center of our galaxy alone contains about 100 billion stars such as our
own sun, yet there are some 100 billion galaxies or more in the known
universe.
   God exercises His enormous power continually in upholding galaxies,
stars, and planets in their various courses. His love must exceed the
bounds of the vast universe because there is no created object outside the
circle of His love and care. Imagine what it meant for God to focus all of
His love upon one tiny speck in a darkened corner of our own galaxy and
to concentrate all of Heaven's best in the sacrifice upon Calvary!

  What agencies will join in bringing glory to God throughout eternity?
Eph. 3:21.


  When Paul puts down the words, "throughout all ages, world without
end," he again is using a "double superlative." If God's love is infinite
and His power is limitless, then our glorification of Him must never
cease.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Acts of the Apostles,
pages 469, 470.
  "So ends the apostle's prayer and the first part of the epistle. Amazing
glory and majesty embodied in the promises of God to His erring yet
hopeful ones has been the theme, beyond human language to express. It
leaves the heart uplifted, the spirit chastened, and gives a living hope for
the coming of the kingdom of God in its fullness."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 6, p. 1019.

SUMMARY: In bringing this portion of his letter to a grand climax, Paul
states everything in the superlative: God's love cannot be put into human
dimensions; His power is not only above but exceedingly above anything
we can imagine, and we have the privilege of being filled with "all the
fulness of God." Finally, time also is superlative—stretching into eternity.

APPLICATION: The greatness of God's love is often focused upon the
smallest of objects. Take for example the butterfly's wing. Notice the mo-
saic of color that is lavished upon what we would consider as being very
insignificant. Sometimes we feel insignificant and unimportant in the eyes
of others and before our Maker. Think of some of the ways you have been
able to see God's love in action in your life in the past few days and
weeks. How does this give evidence that you are important in His sight?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 4:1-16.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "Unto every one of us is given grace according to
PM      the measure of the gift of Christ" (Eph. 4:7).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: When Christ ascended to heaven, He showered
gifts upon His church. A partial list of the spiritual gifts includes apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. These gifts were given not
only for developing, instructing, and bringing God's people to maturity
but also for bringing about unity. It is remarkable how a diversity of gifts
can bring about unity of the faith. But that happens because there is but
one Lord who has given the gifts and one Spirit who sets them into oper-
ation.

INTRODUCTION: Paul begins the second half of his letter with an ap-
peal: "I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called" (Eph. 4:1). "This verse
begins what may be called the practical section of the epistle, although
the apostle Paul did not think of doctrine and practice as separate
branches of the faith. Theory and application are interwoven in the tex-
ture of his presentation of the great theme of the unity of believers. But in
this section special exhortations are given concerning Christian duties
and privileges, in view of the grace that has been received and of the
responsibilities that fellow believers have to one another. The stress is
here placed on the effects rather than on the causes of spiritual living."—
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1020.

       "Altogether we fmd truth and life, here in Ephesians, as generally in
    Scripture, so closely, so vitally interwoven that it is impossible to treat
    either of the two as really isolated. Doctrine runs of itself into practice, in
    the mind of the Apostles, and practice always feels its footing in doc-
    trine."—H. C. G. Moule, Ephesian Studies (Fort Washington, Penna.:
    Christian Literature Crusade, 1975), pp. 169, 170.

SUN I. UNIFIED IN ONE BODY (Eph. 4:1-6).

       To what has every Christian been called? Eph. 4:1.


       The vocation referred to here is not an occupation, but a life of service
     for the Lord. More accurately, Paul is saying, "I beg you to live lives
     worthy of your high calling" (Phillips). Everyone is called to become a
     member of Christ's body, but only a select few within that body have the
     privilege of being prophets, teachers, or evangelists. But the calling to
     membership in that body is just as important and vital as, for instance, is
     the calling to be a prophet.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the following references to see more specifi-
     cally what is involved in our calling:

       Col. 3:14-16

       1 Tim. 6:11, 12

       In what way are Christians to walk worthy of their calling in Christ?
     Eph. 4:2, 3.


        1. "With all lowliness and meekness." The Greek word translated
     "lowliness" conveys the idea of "humility of mind." This is a most impor-
     tant characteristic in Christian service and mission. In speaking to the
     elders of Ephesus in Miletus Paul said, "I have been with you at all sea-
     sons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind" (Acts 20:18, 19). Meek-
     ness is a quality essential to the unity of the church.
        2. "With longsuffering, forbearing one another in love." In these
     qualities we fmd a progression from patience to forbearance to love.
        3. "Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
     It was under the Spirit that the apostles were no longer "independent
     units or discordant, conflicting elements," but rather they became of
     "one accord."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 45.

   What parallel is drawn between being possessed by the Holy Spirit and
 oneness in the church? Eph. 4:4.
•

       As with the human person, Scripture always presents spirit and body in
     terms of united entity, so with the spiritual body, the church, the Bible

                                                                                 57
         describes the Spirit of God as united with the body. It follows, then, that
         whenever there are divisions, schisms, gossiping, backbiting and strife
         within the church there is a corresponding lessening of the power and
         effectiveness of the Holy Spirit. He does not condone divisiveness.

        ILLUMINATION: "The apostle exhorts his brethren to manifest in their
        lives the power of the truth which he had presented to them. By meek-
        ness and gentleness, forbearance and love, they were to exemplify the
        character of Christ and the blessings of his salvation. There is but one
        body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one faith. As members of the body of
        Christ all believers are animated by the same spirit and the same hope.
        Divisions in the church dishonor the religion of Christ before the world
        and give occasion to the enemies of truth to justify their course. Paul's
        instructions were not written alone for the church of his day. God de-
        signed that they should be sent down to us. What are we doing to pre-
        serve unity in the bonds of peace?"—Testirnonies, vol. 5, p. 239.

          What is the spiritual relationship between having one Lord, one faith,
        and one body? Eph. 4:5, 6.


          In the same way that hope was related to the "one body" and the "one
        Spirit," faith and baptism connect the believers to the Lord and the Fa-
        ther. In this way the Christian believer is closely tied to the church, to
        Christ, and to God the Father. Faith accepts Christ as a personal Saviour.
        There only is one means of salvation. We are saved by grace through faith
        (Eph. 2:8). The "one baptism" is the door through which believers ex-
        press their faith and enter into the church. "Baptism by water aptly sym-
        bolizes death and resurrection. Also, it signifies cleansing and separation,
        and is a public announcement of union with the body of Christ."—S.D.A.
        Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1022.

jTjUE   11. THE GRANTING OF GIFTS (Eph. 4:7-11).

          What is God's provision for keeping unity in His church, and on what
        basis is this provision received? Verse 7.


          "In what measure will God impart to us that we may impart to others?
        `According to the measure of the gift of Christ.' Eph. 4:7. Angels are
        watching with intense interest to see how man is dealing with his fellow
        men. When they see one manifest Christlike sympathy for the erring,
        they press to his side and bring to his remembrance words to speak that
        will be as the bread of life to the soul. So 'God shall supply all your need
        according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.' Phil. 4:19."—Christ's
        Object Lessons, pp. 148, 149.

           What did Christ give to His church when He ascended to heaven in a
        triumphal procession after His resurrection, and why did He make this be-
        stowal? Eph. 4:8.

        58
       MIA         1.0322? cf, MIMED WRI                                 esson   w

          Note that it does not say that He gave gifts "to all men." God gives
       basically two types of gifts. One is universal, given to all of the human
       race. The other is special, given only to the church or His chosen people.
       Salvation is a gift offered at first to all of mankind, but in the end granted
       only to those who obey (Heb. 5:9). The ascension gifts at first were
       granted to a handful of men and women gathered in: an upper room
       awaiting the special dispensation, but subsequently were granted to the
       church at large.
          "Not until after the ascension was the gift received in its fullness. Not
       until through faith and prayer the disciples had surrendered themselves
       fully for His working was the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a
       special sense the goods of heaven were committed to the followers of
       Christ. 'When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and
       gave gifts unto men.' Eph. 4:8. 'Unto every one of us is given grace, ac-
       cording to the measure of the gift of Christ,' (Eph. 4:7) the Spirit 'dividing
       to every man severally as He will' (1 Cor. 12:11). The gifts are already
       ours in Christ, but their actual possession depends upon our reception of
       the Spirit of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 327.
          The major reason for the granting of these spiritual gifts was to bring
       about unity among a group that up until then had been sharply divided.
       Paul has been stressing the oneness that God expects in His church, and
       he has pointed out that there are some things in the church that are one
       and cannot be divided: the church "is one body," vitalized by "one
       Spirit," and called in "one hope." All the members of the church are
       united to the "one Lord" and to "one God and Father" by "one faith."
       They come into the church by "one baptism." It is remarkable that in this
       oneness we find "diversities of gifts" and "differences of administra-
       tions" (1 Cor. 12:4, 5).

WED    THINK IT THROUGH: How is it possible for a body to have a multiplicity
11.1   of gifts and yet have a complete unity in spirit, belief, and action? Study
       1 Corinthians 12. (Note particularly verses 6-11.)

         How were the gifts granted to the church at Christ's ascension to benefit
       the church, and how does the list in Ephesians 4:11 compare with that in
       1 Corinthians 12:28?


          Paul states that Christ gave gifted people to the church. In the list in
       Ephesians Paul mentions several categories of gifted individuals,
       whereas in First Corinthians he mentions gifts as well as persons.
          "Paul is not so much saying that certain gifts were given to men in order
       that they might become apostles, as that they who had received the gift
       were themselves being given to the church. The church was receiving to
       its ministry men who were properly equipped for their functions."—
       S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1023.
          In this way each gift is a double gift. He first endows the man or the
       woman. Then He gives these endowed people to the church. In the body
       of Christ are members charged with various functions and gifts that are to
       be used in unity with the body and for the perfection of the church.

                                                                                  59
  How do the gifts of "pastors and teachers" mentioned in Ephesians 4:11
relate to each other?


  The offices of "pastors and teachers" are interrelated closely because
of their being linked together by a single article in the Greek. "The struc-
ture of this phrase, in the Greek, suggests that Paul intends to speak of
two phases of one office. Any effective ministry is a teaching ministry.
The pastoral function of the ministry is presented in John 21:16; Acts
20:28, 29; 1 Peter 5:2, 3; etc., and the teaching aspect in Acts 13:1; Rom.
12:7; 1 Tim. 3:2, and many other passages. The Master Himself was the
great pastor-teacher, shepherding the flock and teaching them."—S.D.A.
Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1023.

I11. THE PURPOSE OF THE GIFTS (Eph. 4:12-16).

  List below God's threefold purpose in giving endowed men and women to
the church. Verse 12.

     1

     2

   3
   The "work of the ministry" includes the many and varied types of min-
istry and serving within the church. Edification has the basic meaning of
"building up." This presupposes the concept of the church as a building
or a temple. Through fault-finding Satan attempts to tear down what God
has established, but one reason that God has given spiritual gifts is that
the church might be built up as a monument to God's grace.
   The term perfecting has the connotation of completion or completing
that which has been started. Unlike erring humans, God always brings to
completion that which He has started. (See Phil. 1:6.) This process of
perfecting refers to the process of growth, progress, and maturation in
our Christian experience.

SEARCH AND LEARN: Read Ephesians 4:13-15 and see how many
references to and illustrations of growth you can find.


  What additional details does Paul present concerning the function and
work of God's gifted men and women in Ephesians 4:13, 14?


   Paul first explains the ministry of the gifted men in a positive way.
Then, in parallel, he explains their ministry through the negative
elements that ministry is designed to overcome. These gifts are to be op-
erative until the members have come to "the unity of the faith" and to
"the stature of the fulness of Christ."

60
   In mentioning the negatives Paul shows what the results will be if there
is unity of doctrine—the body of Christians will not be "children tossed to
and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine." It is the nature of
children to quarrel and fight when inequalities arise among them. People
have differences of temperaments and personalities that sometimes lead
to misunderstanding and even hostility. In the church God gives different
talents and spiritual gifts to the members, but these are intended to unify
the church rather than to lead to jealousies and quarrels.

THINK IT THROUGH: Can there be differences of opinion and still be
unity of doctrine within the church?

  What is the ultimate purpose for all spiritual gifts? Eph. 4:15, 16.


   If spiritual gifts do not serve to aid the church to grow, develop, and
mature into the stature and likeness of Christ, they have failed their pur-
pose. When every part of the body is surrendered to the absolute control
of the Head, who is Christ, unity will prevail. There is no shortcut to
unity. "If the professed followers of Christ would accept God's standard,
it would bring them into unity; but so long as human wisdom is exalted
above His Holy Word, there will be divisions and dissension."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, p. 124.
   Much of Christianity today is characterized by a growing trend of inde-
pendence. Some base this movement on the concept that Christians
should be answerable to no human being, but to God alone. The Protes-
tant idea of "the priesthood of all believers," the teaching that we are not
answerable to any human being for our salvation, is being carried to an
extreme. One part of the body is led to assert its independence from the
rest of the body, thus leading to spiritual "gangrene" and finally to death.
   "God is leading a people out from the world upon the exalted platform
of eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. He will
discipline and fit up His people. They will not be at variance, one believ-
ing one thing and another having faith and views entirely opposite, each
moving independently of the body. Through the diversity of the gifts and
governments that He has placed in the church, they will all come to the
unity of the faith. If one man takes his views of Bible truth without regard
to the opinion of his brethren, and justifies his course, alleging that he has
a right to his own peculiar views, and then presses them upon others, how
can he be fulfilling the prayer of Christ? And if another and still another
arises, each asserting his right to believe and talk what he pleases without
reference to the faith of the body, where will be that harmony which ex-
isted between Christ and His Father, and which Christ prayed might exist
among His brethren?"—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 29, 30.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Testimonies, volume 4,
pages 16-20. Then think of some of the ways that your local congregation
can improve in the matter of unity.
  "Every branch of the work of God is to have recognition. 'He gave
some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some,

                                                                            61
pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.' Eph. 4:11, 12. This scrip-
ture shows that there are to be different workers, different instrumental-
ities. Each has a different work. No one is required to lay hold of an-
other's work, and, though untrained, try to do it. God has given to each
according to his ability. One man may think that his position gives him
authority to dictate to other workers, but this is not so. Ignorant of their
work, he would enlarge where he should retrench, and retrench where he
should enlarge, because he can see only the part of the vineyard where he
is working."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 170, 171.

ILLUSTRATION: It Takes All of Us. "The conference is not one member,
but many. If the literature evangelist shall say, 'Because I am not the
preacher, I am not of the conference' is he therefore not of the confer-
ence? And if the doctor shall say, 'Because I am not the educational
worker, I am not of the conference,' is he therefore not of the conference?
If the whole conference were an educational worker, where were the
evangelists? If the whole conference were the publishing department,
where were the medical workers? But how hath God set medical and edu-
cational institutional workers, field workers, department secretaries,
pastors, evangelists, and office helpers, every one of them, in the confer-
ence as it hath pleased Him. And if they were all one member, where
were the conference? But now are they many members, yet but one con-
ference; and the teacher cannot say to the colporteur, 'I have no need of
thee,' nor again the evangelist to the medical worker, 'I have no need of
thee.' But God hath tempered the body together, that there be no schism
in the conference; but that all members should have the same care for one
another.—Adapted from 1 Corinthians 12:14-21, 24, 25.
   "They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother,
Be of good courage. So the preacher encouraged the colporteur, and he
that worked in the surgery him that taught in the classroom, saying,
`World conditions are ripe for His coming. Let us join our hearts and
hands for the finishing of the work.'—Adapted from Isaiah 41:6, 7."—
R. H. Pierson, 501 Illustrations and Stories (Nashville, Tenn.: Southern
Publishing Association, 1965), p. 90.

SUMMARY: The church today exhibits an amazing amount of diversity
as it spans the barriers of culture, language, and race. To bring about har-
mony is a miracle of divine grace, the grace given freely to all. The unity
that arises out of such striking diversity is no accident, but it results from
the members of the body placing themselves under the absolute control
of Christ, the Head. "If the world sees a perfect harmony existing in the
church of God, it will be a powerful evidence to them in favor of the
Christian religion."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 19.

APPLICATION: What are some ways I can work together with my fellow
members that will contribute to unity in my church? Do I sometimes dic-
tate what I think ought to be the work and responsibilities of others, thus
forcing others into my mold of thought and action; not allowing them to
be themselves?

The New and the
Old Contrast
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 4:17-32.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiv-
PM    ing one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you"
      (Eph. 4:32).

CENTRALTHOUGHT: God wants us to recognize that the Christian way
of life stands in direct contrast to the former or unchristian way of life.
Such a recognition helps us focus on the advantages of being _a Christian.
Following Christ's way involves continual choices.

INTRODUCTION: Paul began chapter 4 with a call to Christians to walk
worthy of their high calling. He counseled them to grow spiritually in the
fellowship of the body of Christ, and showed that God had given the
church spiritual gifts and gifted people to help accomplish this. Then, in
very practical terms, he explains how they are introduced into a new way
of life. In the last part of chapter 4 and in the first half of chapter 5 Paul
uses an excellent teaching method—instruction by contrasts. It might
help you understand better what he is doing if you will take a few minutes
to read Ephesians 4:17 through 5:21. While doing so jot down all of the
contrasts that you can find between the new and the old ways of life. The
old life in all its sordidness is set beside the new life in all its beauty and
loveliness. When we contrast the distastefulness of a life of sin with the
joy and satisfaction that can be found in a life of submission, we are more
apt to make the right choice—to choose the good.
                                                                            63
SUN   1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OLD WAY OF LIFE (Eph. 4:17-22).

           What characteristic of the old way of life distorts our values? Verse 17.


         ILLUMINATION: "Vanity is not only a state of emptiness but it is the
      condition of a misdirected life. Values become distorted; those things
      which should hold eternal value are treated as scum or refuse, and those
      things which are valueless in the light of eternity are treated on earth as if
      they were all-important. The New International Version translates it as
      `the futility of their thinking.' The two life patterns—the old and the
      new—actually begin with the mind. Just as the old way is characterized
      by a futility of the mind, so the new life springs from a renewed mind
      (verse 23).
         "The idea is not of conceit but of frivolous and empty aims. Without
      Christ the Gentile wanders on aimlessly, hopelessly, and recklessly. In
      Romans 1:21-32 Paul draws a picture of utter depravity when man gives
      himself up to 'vain' . . . imaginations. This degeneration has taken place
      in the governing part of the man's nature, the mind, so that the rational
      faculties have yielded to misdirected or undirected imaginings. This van-
      ity was not merely worthless, it was degrading."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
      mentary, vol. 6, p. 1025.

        What additional characteristics of the old way of life does Paul caution
      against? Eph. 4:18, 19.


         Now Paul explains the condition and the actions of those who live in
      the vanity of their mind. This condition is described by such expressions
      as darkened and alienated in verse 18. Satan is the one who dark-
      ened their understanding. This is in direct opposition to the work of God
      who enlightens the understanding of the believers (Eph. 1:18). Through
      such enlightenment God gives hope, inheritance, and power. The dark-
      ened mind makes people become fools, worshipers of the creature, and
      "burned in their lust" (Rom. 1:22, 25, 27). This leads the mind to a state of
      being "reprobate" or depraved (Rom. 1:28).
         Alienated means that those who act according to the vanity of their
      mind are "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel" (Eph. 2:12). This is
      not simply a passive condition; it could be quite active, because being
      "alienated" they are also "enemies" in their mind (Col. 1:21). Those who
      are enemies of God and of His church always undermine the authority of
      the church and its leaders and thus undermine God's authority.
         Two other characteristics of those following the empty way of life are
      interrelated—blindness and insensitivity. Literally, the word blindness
      means "hardness of heart." Pharaoh is a prime example of this nearly
      hopeless condition. While the King James Version translates the first part
      of Ephesians 4:19 as "being past feeling," the New International Version
      gives it a more up-to-date and poignant translation: "having lost all sensi-
      tivity." You would think that such a condition would be beyond the grasp
      of the saving power of the gospel, but it is not.

    THINK IT THROUGH: Do you know anyone who seems to be totally insen-
5    sitive to spiritual things? Can you think of examples of Christians who were
     once in that same condition before the compelling love of Christ penetrated
     their hardened shell?

       What assurance do we have that it is possible for human beings who are
     trapped in the conditions Paul has so graphically described to escape to the
     new life in Christ? Eph. 4:20, 21.


        The emphasis in these verses is on the power of the truth to transform
     the mind. Paul is not talking about mere intellectual knowledge. In chap-
     ter 1, verse 13 he states that the believers "heard the word of truth," the
     gospel of their salvation. To hear in this context has the meaning of ac-
     cepting, following, or obeying. We cannot "learn Christ" without accept-
     ing Him as a person and without obeying His commandments. "When
     Jesus Himself said 'learn of me' (Matt. 11:29), He was presenting Himself
     as an example; here He is offered, not as the great teacher, but as the very
     object of knowledge and faith."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
     1026. True learning of Christ means accepting Him fully without reserva-
     tion.

        How difficult is it to rid ourselves of the old way of life and to begin prac-
     ticing the new way? Eph. 4:22.


        Unfortunately, some may feel that a change from the old to the new is
     not much different than changing one's soiled clothes for a brand-new,
     nicely pressed set of clothes. But the difficulty in making the change is in
     proportion to the deep-seatedness of the corruption that has invaded our
     natures.
        "The old man" and "the former conversation [conduct]" are phrases
     that refer to the same thing—a former manner of life, the things described
     in verses 17-19. The very mind and nature of the "old man" characteristi-
     cally involve anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication, and
     lies (Col. 3:8, 9)—things that come all too naturally and cannot be aban-
     doned without a struggle.

     11. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEW WAY OF LIFE (Eph. 4:23-32).

       What is the secret for the transformation from this old way of life to the
     new? How must it begin? Verses 23, 24.


       The change that Paul urges each believer to experience is not a superfi-
     cial one. The change God wants involves the governing principles of the
     mind and includes desires, goals, and the power of the will. While it must
     begin with the mind, the controlling center of our actions, it also must
     involve a power from without—the creative power of God. Elsewhere
     Paul admonishes us to "put on the new man, which is renewed in knowl-

                                                                                    65
      edge after the image of him that created him" (Col. 3:10)—another refer-
      ence to Creation. The theory of evolution proposes that all of nature has
      an innate power that continually and gradually improves organisms, rais-
      ing them to higher levels; in other words, the power for change is internal
      rather than external. The doctrine of Creation teaches that an omnipotent
      Being applies power from without, that is externally, to produce living
      organisms that had no existence prior to their creation. The dust that was
      shaped into human form in the Garden of Eden was lifeless until the great
      Lifegiver breathed life into its nostrils. When we are without Christ, our
      lives are empty and lifeless until the Saviour Himself breathes in new life
      through His Word.

        How can we avoid conforming to the world's maxims, philosophies, cus-
      toms, and pleasures? Rom. 12:2.


        ILLUMINATION: "An enlightened judgment compels us to acknowl-
      edge that heavenly things are superior to the things of earth, and yet the
      depraved heart of man leads him to give precedence to the things of the
      world. The opinions of great men, the theories of science, falsely so-
      called, are blended with the truths of Holy Writ.
        "But the heart that is surrendered to God, loves the truth of God's
      word; for through the truth the soul is regenerated. The carnal mind finds
      no pleasure in contemplating the word of God, but he who is renewed in
      the spirit of his mind, sees new charms in the living oracles; for divine
      beauty and celestial light seem to shine in every passage."—
      Fundamentals of Christian Education , p. 182.

        What is to be our motivation for living the kind of practical Christian life
      that Paul outlines in the second half of his letter? Eph. 4:25.


         The recognition that we are "members of one another" and that Christ
      is head of the body of which we are a part should motivate us to live a
      Christlike life. We will treat every member of the body as we would treat
      the Head.
         The unity of the body can be destroyed by not speaking the truth (Eph.
      4:25), by anger, by giving place to the devil (verses 26, 27), by stealing or
      not giving to the needy ones (verse 28), by corrupt communication or not
      ministering grace to the hearers (verse 29), by grieving the Holy Spirit or
      not being sealed for the day of redemption (verse 30), and by evil speak-
      ing or not forgiving one another (verses 31, 32).

WED   1. Truthful Speaking.

        Why should the Christian speak truthfully, and in what manner should
      the truth always be spoken? 2 Cor. 4:1, 2; Eph. 4:25. (Compare with Eph.
      4:15.)



      66
 In? 55:30         Un3 (NB (•, ra e                              esson
  A Christian who lies not only hurts the person to whom he has told the
falsehood, but, by destroying confidence, injures the entire body of
Christ. As members of the divine body, we must build it up (verse 16). We
should never tear it down by lying or by any other sin. "How can those
who are followers of the One who is the truth do anything else but hold to
the utmost integrity in all things?"—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol„ 6, p.
1027. We must go out of the way to be people of integrity.

2. Righteous Indignation.

  Under what conditions is it proper for a Christian to exhibit anger? What
type of anger should we avoid? Eph. 4:26, 27.


  The most likely meaning is that Paul is referring to righteous
indignation when he says, "In your anger do not sin" (NIV, quoted from
Ps. 4:4). "Righteous indignation has a most important function in stimu-
lating men in the battle against evil. Jesus was not angered by any per-
sonal affront, but by hypocritical challenges to God and injustices done to
others (see Mark 3:5)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1027.

THINK IT THROUGH: Does a Seventh-day Adventist have a right to be
angry as he sees false teachings or worldly practices begin seeping into the
church?

3. Honest Labor.

  What kind of work ethic is advocated by Paul, and how does it compare
with the counsel he gave to the Thessalonian church? Eph. 4:28. (Compare
with 2 Thess. 3:10-12.)


   "There were those in the communities to which he addressed himself,
as Paul makes specific in 1 Corinthians vi.10f., who had been in the habit
of making a living by pilfering (the present participle in the Greek implies
this rather than a thief in any other sense). There must be no more of such
practices, but honest toil instead."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul
to the Ephesians, p. 134.
   Christianity should never encourage a lazy church member to take ad-
vantage of those who are more industrious, thus absorbing funds need-
lessly which ought to be used in God's work. On the other hand, Chris-
tians must always be ready to extend material help willingly to those who
stand in genuine need.

4. Edifying Speech.

  What kind of communication should Christians practice in order to foster
unity within the body of Christ? Eph. 4:29.



                                                                          67
   Paul exhorts, "Let no evil talk come out of your mouths" (RSV). "The
word evil here literally means 'rotten', as of fish or fruit no longer fit to
eat. Jesus uses the same word for a rotten tree which cannot produce
good fruit (Mt. 7:17). As applied to talk it is perhaps represented by the
word 'foul'. This, however, in English may put the emphasis on inde-
cency to the exclusion of other 'rottenness'. It means anything which
lowers the moral tone of the community. This may include such things as
ascribing bad motives to other people's apparently good actions, or
putting a sinister interpretation on quite innocent conduct. This is the
more probable because in Col. 3:8 'evil talk' is linked with 'slander'. Evil
talk may, therefore, include within its scope words of a complaining,
sneering, cynical, sarcastic type, all of which spread demoralisation in a
community."—C. Leslie Mitton, Ephesians (London: Marshall, Morgan,
& Scott, 1976), pp. 170, 171.
   On the other hand, words that are spoken from pure, sincere motives
and out of genuine compassion soothe like a healing balm the many hurts
suffered by the members of the body of Christ. A simple word of appre-
ciation spoken to someone who is struggling to do what is right can go a
long way to spur that person to put forth greater efforts for Christ. Kind
words bring health to the body and healing to the soul.

     What makes it important not to "grieve" the Holy Spirit? Eph. 4:30.


   Ephesians 1:13, 14 indicates that the Holy Spirit is the down payment
or certification that God will make good on His promises: "Having be-
lieved, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of
those who are God's possession" (NIV). There is no more potent force
for providing and guaranteeing unity than the gift of the Spirit.

5. Kindness.

  What is to take the place of bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil
speaking once we have been converted? Eph. 4:31, 32.


  If the power of kindness were not greater than the power of hatred, we
would have to say that the power of evil is greater than the power of good.
Although at times it may not appear to be so, good is much more powerful
than evil. Paul lists five steps that lead an unconverted person from bad to
worse, until that person's hatred erupts like a mighty volcano.
  1. A seed of bitterness or resentment is sown in a corner of the heart.
  2. Wrath seethes like a boiling caldron.
  3. Anger becomes the outward expression of that wrath.
  4. Clamor—a violent torrent of words—follows.
  5. Evil speaking vents the person's rage. The person even may go as
      far as to curse the Creator Himself.
  God alone can help us root out the seeds of bitterness and resentment
before they produce a harvest such as this. "Let the tenderness and

mercy that Jesus has revealed in His own precious life be an example to
us of the manner in which we should treat our fellow beings. . . . Many
have fainted and become discouraged in the great struggle of life, whom
one word of kindly cheer and courage would have strengthened to over-
come. . . . We cannot tell how far reaching may be our tender words of
kindness, our Christ-like efforts to lighten some burden. The erring can
be restored in no other way than in the spirit of meekness, gentleness,
and tender love."—Ellen G. White, My Life Today, p. 235.

of Discipleship," pages 57-65.
   For a further clarification of what our duty is as Christians in providing
assistance to those living in poverty-stricken conditions, read Testimo-
nies, volume 4, pages 508-511 and volume 6, page 255.
   "We are counseled to let no corrupt communication proceed out of our
mouth; but a corrupt communication is not simply something that is vile
and vulgar. It is any communication that will eclipse from the mind the
view of Christ, that will blot from the soul true sympathy and love. It is a
communication in which the love of Christ is not expressed, but rather
sentiments of an un-Christlike character."—Ellen G. White Comments,
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1117.
   The contemporary evangelical British preacher, John R. W. Stott, has
this to say: "If we are truly a new creation of God, we shall undoubtedly
develop new standards of conversation. Instead of hurting people with
our words, we shall want to use them to help, encourage, cheer, comfort
and stimulate them."—John R. W. Stott, God's New Society, The Mes-
sage of Ephesians (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1979), p.
188.

SUMMARY: The Christian life is not simply a remodeling of the old life,
nor is it merely putting on clean outer garments to cover up a soiled and
stained life. It involves a radical change in which truthful speaking re-
places lying; honest labor replaces pilfering; encouraging words replace
corrupt speech; and kindness uproots bitterness.

APPLICATION: If Paul were writing a letter to me personally, a letter
both of encouragement and rebuke, which of the matters that he raises in
the letter to the Ephesians would he have to bring to my attention? How
would I personally respond to such a letter from the imprisoned apostle if
he were to mention some specifics in my life needing the transforming
influence of the Spirit?

 Light and Darkness
 Contrast
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 5:1-21.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
PM      light in the Lord: walk as children of light" (Eph. 5:8).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: Life can be compared to two paths—the way of
light and the way of darkness. It is our choice as to which path we follow.
No one has been given the power of making the choice for us—not even
God Himself. But none of us can carry out the choice for the right path by
ourselves once it has been made. That power is God-given. Another word
for it is grace.


                         OVERVIEW: Eph. 5:1-21

        Following the Path of Light        Results of Walking in the Light
               (verses 1-14)                        (verses 15-21)
     No one who practices the works of      Wisdom, wise use of time
      darkness will inherit the kingdom     Spirit of thankfulness
     The children of light demonstrate      Spirit of submission
      the beauty of God's way
     Nothing can be kept secret from
      the One who is light


INTRODUCTION: The Bible is a book of contrasts. From the book of
Genesis, where we find the joy of Creation and the sorrow of the Fall, to
the book of Revelation, where we find a description of the sea of glass and
the lake of fire, we discover a continuous succession of contrasts. If the
Bible had been written from a human point of view without divine assis-
tance, it most likely would have presented just one side of any question.
  Last week we looked carefully at the contrast between the old and the
new. This week we will study the differences between the children of light
and the children of darkness. The child of light—
  * is a follower of God,
  o acts according to God's blueprint for moral conduct,
  o is not led astray by doctrinal deceivers,
  o does not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness,

70
   • uses time wisely,
   • understands the will of the Lord,
   • abstains from vice, and
   • experiences good personal relations with others.
   These demands upon the child of light would seem overwhelming were
it not for the saving and empowering grace of Christ.

I. FOLLOWING THE PATH OF LIGHT (Eph. 5:1-14).

  As children of light, how should we walk? Verses 1, 2.


   Our daily walk should tell the world that we are beloved of God, not
children who are forsaken and forlorn. Notice that the closeness of our
walk with Him can be measured by the degree of our response to His love
and by how much we can perceive His hand of love leading in our daily
lives. We should walk in love, "as Christ also hath loved us."

ILLUSTRATION: In modern technological societies photocopying ma-
chines are becoming more and more perfected so that the photocopy
closely resembles the original. The ultimate goal is that our lives will not
only resemble the character of God Himself but that there will be such a
close resemblance between the "copy" and the great "Original" that oth-
ers too will want to be followers of Him.

  In our study of Ephesians 3:14-21 we learned that one of the quickest
ways to create unity within the church is to develop a relationship based
on love. Other Bible passages teach the same truth: "Beloved, if God so
loved us, we ought also to love one another" (1 John 4:11). True love
always gives. Love does not give merely things or services. Christ gave
Himself to us. We also should give ourselves to God and to our neighbors.

  How is Christ's love made most attractive? What aspect of the sanctuary
service symbolizes this love? Eph. 5:2.


  The Greek word that is translated "sweet savour" or "sweet smelling
savour" is derived by combining the words "good" and "smell." This
same word used in the Greek Old Testament is applied to the aroma of the
incense used in the tabernacle services. (See Ex. 29:18; Lev. 1:9, 2:2.)

SEARCH AND LEARN: What can we learn from Paul's use of this ex-
pression as we compare the passages that follow?

  1. 2 Cor. 2:15

  2. Phil. 4:18

  Some may be tempted to complain that their day-to-day experience in-


                                                                         71
cludes bitterness, pain, and hardship of various sorts. They may wonder,
 Where is the sweet smell of incense? But remember that in Christ's last 24
 hours before His death He experienced pain, torture, disappointment,
and verbal abuse such as we never may be called upon to endure. Yet as
He hung upon the cross His sacrifice became a sweet smelling savor to
the Father.
  "If we are following Christ, His merits, imputed to us, come up before
the Father as sweet odor. And the graces of our Saviour's character, im-
planted in our hearts, will shed around us a precious fragrance. The spirit
of love, meekness, and forbearance pervading our life will have power to
soften and subdue hard hearts and win to Christ bitter opposers of the
faith."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 174.

THINK IT THROUGH: After quoting Ephesians 5:1, 2, Ellen White asks
this pertinent question: "Have we accepted the privileges so dearly pur-
chased? Are we followers of God as dear children, or are we servants of the
prince of darkness?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 173.

  Why should certain undesirable activities never be associated with, nor
be suspected of being associated with, the life of one of God's children? Eph.
5:3, 4.


   Verse 3 lists three forbidden activities: fornication, uncleanness, and
covetousness. The Greek word for fornication, porneia, is "a general
term applying to illicit sexual relationship," and it "covers all illicit rela-
tionships both before and after marriage."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
vol. 5, pp. 337, 454.
   In this permissive age even some Christians have argued that sex be-
fore marriage is permissible. They claim that the word fornication is
equivalent to the word adultery and thus applies only to the breaking of
the marriage vow through an illicit affair. But that is not the way that
Scripture presents it. In I Corinthians 6:15-18 we discover that. harlotry
(or prostitution) is one form of fornication. The warnings against harlotry
apply to the married as well as to the unmarried. In 1 Thessalonians 4:3-7
we notice that the admonition to avoid, fornication is not limited to the
married. Those contemplating marriage should have a high enough stan-
dard of conduct that even the intimation of immoral behavior should not
be circulating among those who know the couple. That is what Paul
means when he says, "Let it not be once named among you" (Eph. 5:3).
Nor should any other type of immoral behavior ("all uncleanness") or
covetousness be found in the life of a Christian.
   In verse 4 Paul focuses on the use of the tongue, considered by James
to be a "little member" that causes great trouble (James 3:5). For Paul the
way to control the evil that can be produced by the tongue is to make it a
source of good. He urges that the "giving of thanks" replace "filthiness,"
"foolish talking," and "jesting." Notice how he presents this by using
contrasts: "Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor levity, which are
not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving" (Eph. 5:4, RSV).
  "Levity means clever witticisms with nasty insinuations which raise a

72
       laugh at the expense of someone's good name. It would include cheap
       jokes about sexual matters, but also cruel sallies against other people's
       frailties, errors, or simple goodness. This kind of conversation which
       cheapens human relationships is not appropriate to those whose lives are
       supposed to be Christ-controlled."—C. Leslie Mitton, Ephesians (Lon-
       don: Marshall, Morgan & Scott, 1976), pp. 178, 179.

       THINK IT THROUGH: Why does it seem easier for most people to discuss
       subjects that are low, degrading, and insinuating than to talk about spiri-
       tual things?

R
T UE     What are several reasons for walking as "children of the light" (verse 8)?
       Eph. 5:5-14.


          Perhaps you can find five or six reasons for walking as "children of
       light," but our study will focus on three of them.

         Reason No. 1. Those who practice the works of darkness cannot inherit
       the kingdom of heaven. (See Eph. 5:5.)
         This is made crystal clear in a modern translation: "Be sure of this, that
       no immoral or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater),
       has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one
       deceive you with empty words, for it is because of these things that the
       wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience" (Eph. 5:5, 6, RSV).
       Probably the one description of the works of darkness listed here that
       comes to haunt us more than the others is covetousness.

         In what way does Paul connect covetousness with idolatry? Col. 3:5.


          Idolatry means placing a greater value upon a person, object, activity,
       or even philosophy than upon God. Thus it is a work of darkness because
       it allows something else or someone else to eclipse one's view of the Sun
       of Righteousness, the Source of all light.
          "Covetousness is an evil of gradual development."—Patriarchs and
       Prophets, p. 496. It leads to fracturing of strong social ties with family,
       friends, or church. It eats away on the inside like a cancer. "Covetous-
       ness is greed for more, and this is also a mark of all the sensual sins. . . .
       Greed is a deadly sin that often passes unnoticed in the most respectable
       circles; indeed, it is frequently hidden in such terms as 'competition' and
       `success.'"—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1032.

       THINK IT THROUGH: Should I not make it my daily prayer that I be so
       enamored with the light and with the One who is the Light that the cancer of
       covetousness will not eat away my soul?

         Reason No. 2. As children of the light we have been called out of dark-
       ness to demonstrate the beauty of the path of light. (See Eph. 5:7-10)
         A person who has wasted half of his or her life as an alcoholic or drug

                                                                                  73
      addict knows the terrific grip that addiction has. But once the chains of
      addiction have been shattered by the power of Christ, people who have
      been addicted begin to discover true happiness and peace of mind, often
      for the first time. Then they do not want to go back to their old life. Those
      who once lived in darkness, practiced the works of darkness, and have
      been called into God's marvelous light should not continue to practice the
      works of darkness. It is totally incongruous to do so. Because we have
      experienced the amazing transformation from darkness to light—a minia-
      ture of what happened on the first day of Creation when light was called
      out of darkness—we have the thrilling privilege of walking as representa-
      tive children of light.

        How does God's activity on the first day of Creation—the transforming of
      darkness into light—have a spiritual application? 2 Cor. 4:6.



WED
         Reason No. 3. The secret things of darkness are going to be tested by
      the light and brought out into the open. (See Eph. 5:11-13.)
         We fool ourselves if we think that as Christians we can hide certain
      secretive aspects of our lives from the all-seeing eye of Deity. Humanity
      is developing newer and better techniques for observing the inner pro-
      cesses of the human body. For nearly a hundred years X rays have been
      used. In recent years scanners have been developed for exploring the in-
      tricate processes of the body, entering even into the labyrinth of the brain
      itself. But the One who has counted every hair of our heads knows every
      hidden thought. (See Heb. 4:13.)


        In what way is it possible for Christians to participate vicariously in the
      works of darkness by discussing the sordid details of evil acts? Eph. 5:12.


         "Christian delicacy and refinement will not permit the discussion of
      certain things, let alone the practice of them. Usually it is sufficient to
      name evils without describing them and their processes in detail. A cer-
      tain frankness is to be commended, but little can be said in favor of the
      startling bluntness with which sin is often discussed in our sophisticated
      age. Paul named and denounced shameful vices (vs. 3-5), but he did not
      paint them in lurid colors so as to appeal to the low and sensual appetites
      of readers."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1033.

        How does Paul summarize his discussion on the importance of walking in
      the light? Eph. 5:14.


        Paul quotes from an unknown source, this exact quote not being found
      anywhere in the Old or New Testaments. However, it has its roots in the
      Old Testament. (See Isa. 9:2; 26:19; 52:1; 60:1.) Whatever its source, this
      quotation describes beautifully the contrast between the darkness of

      74
L111T add LO:=20 (ctii-frmita
death and the power of light. When Christ was raised from the dead, the
bright light of an angelic being broke through the darkness of the tomb,
blinding the eyes of the soldiers. That light symbolized life. Christ's res-
urrection guarantees that we will rise to new power through light.
   In the springtime it takes the power of sunlight to melt the crusted cov-
ering of snow overlying barren soil. Once the snow has been melted, the
sunlight then must warm the ground, causing dormant life to arouse into
action. Flowers bloom and grass turns green. How much more powerful
is the light provided by the Sun of Righteousness that brings new life and
verdure into the barrenness of a human heart.

   List some other ways that sunlight (or even starlight) has observable ef-
fects on the world around us and then compare those to the spiritual realm.
(For example, many species of birds migrate at night according to the pat-
terns of the stars.)



H. RESULTS OF WALKING IN THE LIGHT (Eph. 5:15-21).

  In the last part of chapter 4 and the first part of chapter 5 we have
examined carefully the contrasts between the Christian life and the life
apart from Christ. The Christian can be characterized as one who re-
places lying with truthful speaking; stealing with honest labor; corrupt
language with talk that builds up; and quarreling with kindness. Now we
are about to add more characteristics to that list. The Christian replaces
folly with wisdom, drunkenness with thankfulness, and pride with sub-
mission.

  What is included in being a truly "wise" person? Verses 15-17.


  In their private conduct wise Christians control their attitudes. They
are sensitive and alert to every situation, with no intention of using craft
or deceit. They use their time in a proper way to make the most of every
opportunity, spending it in noble pursuits, doing "good unto all men"
(Gal. 6:10), and being active in building up the unity of the church—eager
to fulfill its mission. Finally, wise Christians are those who understand.
They carefully consider the circumstances, seek to discern the will of the
Lord, and want to act in harmony with His will.

  How are the various activities of a Christian listed by Paul as an antidote
or a preventive to keep from falling into excesses? Eph. 5:18-21.


  Paul contrasts two different "filling" experiences: being filled with
wine with being filled with the Spirit. He probably considered drunken-
ness "not only as a gratification of appetite, but also as a social evil that
glorifies wastefulness, emotional excitement at the expense of good
sense, and reckless pursuit of pleasure. Anything that takes man's reason

                                                                          75
from him means deterioration of soul and unfitness for the kingdom of
God."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1034.

ILLUMINATION: "The Spirit of God is freely bestowed to enable every
man to lay hold upon the means of salvation. Thus Christ, 'the true
Light,' lighteth every man that cometh into the world.' John 1:9. Men
fail of salvation through their own willful refusal of the gift of life."—The
Great Controversy, p. 262.

  What is one way that the peace of God in the heart can be expressed in
order to encourage others? Col. 3:15, 16.


  Instead of using the tongue to gratify selfish pleasure and selfish pur-
suits, we are to use the tongue for building up, strengthening, and encour-
aging fellow members of God's family. Doing so will lead to greater unity.
One of the most powerful forces on earth is the power of music.

ILLUMINATION: "Song is one of the most effective means of impressing
spiritual truth upon the heart. Often by the words of sacred song, the
springs of penitence and faith have been unsealed."—Evangelism, p. 500.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Prophets,
pages 496, 497, and think of the different ways covetousness can crop up
in our lives. Also read The Acts of the Apostles, pages 473, 477, and note
some of the dangers facing the church.
   The symbolism of light has many applications to the Christian life. In
the natural world most plants respond to light by growing toward it. No-
tice how potted plants lined up on a window sill lean in the direction of the
sunlight. When the pots are rotated 180 degrees, the plants respond by
bending back again in the direction of the source of light—a fitting illus-
tration of how the Christian is to respond to the rays that come from the
Sun of Righteousness.

SUMMARY: The following inspired gem nicely summarizes this week's
lesson: "Jesus is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. His children are
the children of light. They are renewed in His image, and called out of
darkness into His marvelous light. He is the light of the world, and so also
are they that follow Him. They shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life. The more closely the people of God strive to imitate
Christ, the more perseveringly will they be pursued by the enemy; but
their nearness to Christ strengthens them to resist the efforts of our wily
foe to draw them from Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 405, 406.

APPLICATION: Christ once said, "There is nothing outside a man which
by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man
are what defile him" (Mark 7:15, RSV). How can I apply this to what I
have studied this week?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 5:22-33.

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also
PM     loved the church, and gave himself for it" (Eph. 5:25).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: The home might be thought of as a laboratory
where the experiment of love is being worked out. Friends, relatives,
people in the neighborhood, business associates, and church members
are watching to see the outcome of the experiment. The true nature of
love is being put to the test to see if it really is a love that comes only as a
gift that cannot be bought or sold; a love that can heal all wounds; a love
that unites rather than divides; a love that sees the good in others rather
than the evil; a love that requires self-sacrifice and shuns self-defense; a
love that comes from Christ and leads to Christ; and a love that is divine.

INTRODUCTION: To a large degree the unity of the church depends
upon the unity of the home. Because the church is a composite or mosaic
of the homes it represents, the level of spirituality within the church re-
flects the level of spirituality within the individual homes. What takes
place within the confines of the home, perhaps unnoticed by anyone out-
side of that home, actually has observable effects upon the church, its
 programs, and the effectiveness of its mission. Anything that will upbuild
and strengthen the home will likewise strengthen the church. To look at
this from another perspective, the home actually is the church in minia-
ture. "In the home it is possible to have a little church which will honor
and glorify the Redeemer."—The Adventist Home, p. 323.
   When Paul wished to emphasize the unity, love, and respect that should


                                                                             77
exist between husband and wife, he chose the finest illustration avail-
able—the relationship that exists between Christ and His church. The
home should exemplify everything that the church must possess—good
organization, Christlike leadership, tender love, unity of action and
thought, true companionship, and outreach to others. The home, like the
church, is a training ground for service. "Our work for Christ is to begin
with the family, in the home. . . . There is no missionary field more impor-
tant than this. By precept and example parents are to teach their children
to labor for the unconverted."—Christian Service, p. 106.
  Not all who study this lesson will share a husband-wife relationship.
But because all are, or are interested in becoming, members of a church
family, the principles being studied can be applied equally as well to our
relationships as members of the family of God.

I. OBLIGATIONS OF WIVES (Eph. 5:22-24, 33).

  Why does Paul counsel wives to "submit" as their first duty to their hus-
bands? Is he suggesting thereby that husbands and wives are not equal?
Verses 22, 24.


   In this week's lesson we will be examining the obligations on the part of
both husbands and wives—their duties , not their rights. The first duty for
wives that Paul lists is that of submission to their husbands. Does submis-
sion imply inferiority? Certainly not. Paul recognizes that in Christ there
is no inequality based upon differences in race, sex, or social standing.
"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:28).

SEARCH AND LEARN: In order to understand fully Paul's counsels in
Ephesians 5 we need to consider other New Testament statements on the
role and position of women. In your own words summarize the main
point on this topic that is being made in the following passages:

     1 Cor 111

     1 Tim. 2:11-15

     Titus 2:4, 5

     1 Peter 3:1, 5-7

  In interpreting Scripture it sometimes is difficult to separate that which
has local and temporary application from that which has permanent and
universal application. For example, in the first passage given above, Paul
continues his counsels to women by warning them against praying with
their heads uncovered (1 Cor. 11:5). This counsel had an obvious local ap-
plication. Another example of counsel with a local application is the sec-
ond passage in which Paul counsels against women being allowed to be
teachers, but they are counseled to "learn in silence" (1 Tim. 2:11, 12)-

78
reminiscent of the counsel given in 1 Corinthians 14:34. This is in harmony
with the principle that Christianity should honor the deeply-ingrained so-
cial mores and customs when those customs do not violate the principles
of Christianity. Particularly is this true when ignoring those customs would
impede the progress of the gospel. Paul does not mean to imply that
women are to be viewed as inferior to men.

  What kind of stipulation or qualification does Paul add to his counsel that
women should submit to their husbands? Eph. 5:22; Col. 3:18.


  Notice how the two passages parallel one another. Ephesians 5:22
should not be interpreted as saying that wives must surrender to their
husbands in the same way that they surrender themselves to God. Hus-
bands should not act as if they are God in the demands that they may
make upon their spouses. Sarah in calling her husband "lord" was using
the accepted title of respect and was not considering her husband as if he
were God to her.(See 1 Peter 3:6.) What Paul is saying in Ephesians 5:22
and Colossians 3:18 is that a wife's submission is to be shaped or deter-
mined by what is proper and becoming for a person who is "in the Lord,"
that is, in Christ.

  When Paul counsels the wife to "reverence" her husband, does this not
imply that the husband is to stand in the place of God in his relationship to
his wife? Eph. 5:33.


   In this text, "to reverence" means "to respect." Respect does not
come automatically; it must be earned. It is the result of a relationship,
and a relationship takes time 10. cultivate. One of the fruits of genuine
love, then, is respect. A wife is not dependent upon her husband for sal-
vation, nor is the husband to be dependent upon the wife for his salva-
tion. In the great day of judgment each is answerable to God alone.

ILLUSTRATION: An unbelieving husband who was married to a devout
Christian wife tried to justify his not accepting Christianity in the follow-
ing way: "When it comes time for me to enter the Holy City," he said, "I
am going to make sure that I have my wife standing next to me as we wait
in line outside the gate into the city. That way, my wife can speak for both
of us when we are being questioned by the guardian angel at the gate."
Although his great respect for his wife's Christian principles is to be com-
mended, this husband's theology was misguided. Unless he learned to
look to Christ rather than to his wife for salvation he would not be given
an opportunity to be present when she entered the Holy City.

  What is the basis for instructing the wife to submit to her husband? Eph.
5:23, 24.


  Paul's counsel here is consistent with what he says in 1 Corinthians

                                                                          79
11:3: "I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and
the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God." A man
is qualified to be head of his household only if he has submitted himself
first to Christ as his head, just as Christ earned the right of headship over
the church after He submitted Himself in humility to His Father (Phil.
2:8-11). We must point out that headship does not mean dictatorship.
Some husbands do not allow the wives to make decisions for themselves,
thus taking away their power of choice. The danger is that if the husband
makes the major decisions in areas such as fmances, choice of a house or
job, and activities outside of the home, then he may overstep his bounds
and expect to make spiritual or church-related decisions for the wife.
True love not only honors but also jealously guards the other person's.
God-given prerogative, and that is the power of choice.
   In a business partnership, in a club or service organization, in a large
corporation, in a political party, or in any social structure someone must
take the lead; someone must serve as head. So it is with the home. Scrip-
ture assigns the husband as the head of the household, and his headship
means that he is the priest of the family.
   "All members of the family center in the father. He is the law-maker,
illustrating in his own manly bearing the sterner virtues: energy, integrity,
honesty, patience, courage, diligence, and practical usefulness. The fa-
ther is in one sense the priest of the household, laying upon the altar of
God the morning and evening sacrifice. The wife and children should be
encouraged to unite in this offering and also to engage in the song of
praise."—The Adventist Home, p. 212.

  How do Paul's counsels to husbands and wives apply if the one spouse is a
believer and the other is not? Should the Christian wife have to submit
herself to a husband who is not a Christian? 1 Peter 3:1, 2.


   The Christian wife who is married to a non-Christian still is obligated,
because of her devotion to Christ, to show Christlike respect, kindness,
and even obedience to her spouse, as long as his demands are not a viola-
tion of any biblical principle. That is why her submission is to be "in the
Lord" (Col. 3:18). That means that if a spouse gives a directive that is
contrary to what is in God's law or in the Bible, then the obligation to
submit or to obey is no longer binding. Even if the wife's obedience must
be withheld in such cases, her obligation to love and to cherish is binding.
The same principle holds true for Christian husbands whose wives are
unbelievers.

11. OBLIGATIONS OF HUSBANDS (Eph. 5:25-33).

  What is the divine dimension of the Christian husband's love for his wife?
Verses 25-27.


 The husband should love his wife with the same quality of love that
Christ has bestowed on His church. "The supreme test of love is whether

80
      it is prepared to forgo happiness in order that the other might have it. In
      this respect the husband is to imitate Christ, giving up personal pleasures
      and comforts to obtain his wife's happiness, standing by her side in the
      hour of sickness. Christ gave Himself for the church because she was in
      desperate need; He did it to save her. Likewise the husband will give him-
      self for the salvation of his wife, ministering to her spiritual needs, and
      she to his, in a spirit of mutual love."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
      pp. 1036, 1037.

      ILLUMINATION: "Home should be made all that the word implies. It
      should be a little heaven upon earth, a place where the affections are cul-
      tivated instead of being studiously repressed. Our happiness depends
      upon this cultivation of love, sympathy, and true courtesy to one another.
         "The sweetest type of heaven is a home where the Spirit of the Lord
      presides. If the will of God is fulfilled, the husband and wife will respect
      each other and cultivate love and confidence."—The Adventist Home, p.
      15.

        What is the human dimension of the Christian husband's love for his
      wife? Eph. 5:28-30.


        The most startling aspect of this counsel is that Paul says that a hus-
      band's love for his wife should match the love that he shows for himself.
      Many Christians feel that it is wrong for people to love themselves. Con-
      ceit often is described as "self-love," but in reality conceit occurs when a
      person loves himself more than he ought and thinks more highly of him-
      self than he ought. Christian psychologists tell us that we ought to have a
      sense of self-worth based on our understanding of how much God values
      us.
        "The husband is the head, the wife is his body. The head is to love its
      body. So the Head, Christ, loves his Body, the church. Indeed, husband
      and wife are one flesh, no less. The fact that the relation of Christ to the
      church lies on a far higher plane alters nothing in the earthly relation of
      the husband to his wife; only when we compare the superior relation to
      the inferior, the latter is lifted and ennobled."—R. C. H. Lenski, The In-
      terpretation of St. Paul's Epistles to the Galatians, Ephesians, and
      Philippians (Minneapolis, Minn.: Augsburg Publishing House, 1961), p.
      638.

WED   SEARCH AND LEARN: What are some ways that we can follow Paul's
      admonition to nourish and cherish our own flesh? What aspects of our lives
      should be cultivated? Look for the physical, mental, emotional, and spiri-
      tual aspects in the following texts:

        1 Cor. 9:24-27

        2 Peter 3:18

        Luke 2:52

                                                                                81
  One of the earmarks of people who cherish their own flesh is that they
take care of their health. If we let our health steadily deteriorate, then it
would seem that our sense of self-worth is beginning to wane. It also can
be a sign that our love for Christ is growing cold.
  Christians who take care of their own health will want to see to it that
the health of their life mate also will be properly cared for. Likewise,
Christian husbands or wives who are careful about seeing to it that they
grow mentally, emotionally, socially, and spiritually will want to see a cor-
responding growth take place in the life of their spouse. The Christian
home offers the ideal setting for this type of growth and enrichment to
take place.

  When a marriage is consummated under the blessing of God, what must
be done in order to ensure that the marriage will be a success? Eph. 5:31.


  There may be two problems preventing success in marriage: First, a
spouse may have failed to break his or her ties with parents at home; and
second, the couple fails to become united as "one flesh." They may live
together, eat together, and sleep together, but their lives go separate
ways. They live under one roof, but live two lives.

ILLUMINATION: "Now at last comes the quotation from Genesis 11.24
that has been influencing all the apostle's thought. This statement from
the creation story is the most profound and fundamental statement in the
whole of Scripture concerning God's plan for marriage. It has been the
ultimate bulwark of the Church against the arguments for allowing polyg-
amy to remain in the societies where she has met it; it is the ultimate
argument against promiscuity; it is the ultimate reason against the
Church's countenancing the dissolution of marriage by divorce. When
our Lord was questioned concerning the legal permission given to di-
vorce, he gave the answer that must still be given. In an imperfect society,
in need of such laws, and for the 'hardness of men's hearts' , divorce may
be allowed, but it is a declension from the divine purpose, and it can never
be seen in any other light. The Lord gave no new teaching on the matter,
but directed His appeal back to this verse (Mt. xix.3-9 and Mk. x.2-12).
Prior to marriage a man or a woman has his or her closest bond with
parents, and to them owes the greatest obligation. The new bond and ob-
ligation that marriage involves transcends the old. Filial duty does not
cease, but the most intimate relationship now, and the highest loyalty, is
that between husband and wife, and parents only imperil that relationship
by trying in any way to come between."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of
Paul to the Ephesians (Grand Rapids, Mich.: The Tyndale Press,1968), p.
161.

  How does the relationship that exists between husband and wife illustrate
the relationship Christ wishes to have with His church? Or how does the
relationship that Christ already has demonstrated in His kind regard for
His people illustrate the love and tender regard that should be in the home?
Eph. 5:32, 33; Jer. 31:3, 4; Hosea 2:19, 20; 2 Cor. 11:2.

82
   We already have seen in Ephesians 4:4, 5, that there is "one body, . . .
one Lord, one faith, one baptism." This means that Christ has only one
bride, the church, for there is just "one faith" and "one body." There is
only one husband in the spiritual marriage, and that is Christ. In a sense,
baptism becomes the wedding ceremony between Christ and the new
church member. Christ as the husband becomes "jealous" when His peo-
ple start following after "other lovers." You can imagine how it must
break His heart to see them becoming infatuated with the world.
   It is beautiful to watch two beings who have many distinctive differ-
ences as well as similar interests become more united as their love
deepens. This kind of unity results in those who are so much unlike com-
ing together in a mutual relationship, without losing their personal iden-
tity. Such a union helps us understand the union of Christ with His
church. Both are one. Let no one separate them—man and wife, the
church and Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH: How is it possible for the church made up of so
many diverse elements to achieve unity?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Adventist Home,
pages 211-215 for a picture of what the father's role is to be, and pages
231-239 for a description of the mother's role.
  Ephesians 5 outlines Christ's relationship to His church as well as the
husband-wife relationship. How does Christ regard the church as His
earthly bride? "The church of Christ is very precious in His sight. It is the
case which contains His jewels, the fold which encloses His flock."—
Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1118.
  "The church is the bride, the Lamb's wife. Every true believer is a part
of the body of Christ. Christ regards unfaithfulness shown to Him by His
people as the unfaithfulness of a wife to her husband."—Ellen G. White
Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary ,vol. 7, pp. 985, 986.
  "Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one object
upon which God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard."—The
Acts of the Apostles, p. 12.

SUMMARY: If love is a plant of divine origin and all true love comes from
God, then the unity which is an outgrowth of love can come from God
alone. Apart from Christ there can be no genuine unity in this world.

APPLICATION: There is no broken home which is beyond the power of
Christ's transforming grace to mend and to heal if both partners are will-
ing to yield to Him. Likewise, if our relationship with Christ has been
severed or severely strained, it is never beyond the hope of restoration.
Christ is willing for this to happen. All it takes, then, is our willingness.
There is hope for what appears to be hopeless. Ask yourself the follow-
ing:
• Has my relationship with Christ been strained?
• If so, is it affecting my home relationship?
• Am I willing to let Christ mend and heal if such action is needed?

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord,
PM     and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the re-
       ward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ" (Col. 3:23,24).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: This week we will examine guidelines for having
harmonious relationships both in the home and at the place of employ-
ment. Non-Christians can give practical suggestions as to how to get
along with people, but they cannot offer the power to carry out their sug-
gestions. Christianity offers the best motivation as well as God's enabling
power for building effective relationships with others.

INTRODUCTION: The greatest test of the truth of Christianity is to be
found in the kinds of relationships that Christians develop with those
about them. Perhaps the greatest testimony that the Christ who ascended
yet lives and reigns is that He has set up His throne within Christian
hearts and homes. As the inspired writer has stated it, "A well-ordered
Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of the reality of the
Christian religion—an argument that the infidel cannot gainsay."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, p. 144.
   Even though the book of Ephesians devotes only three verses out of
155 to the duties of children and only one verse to the duties of the fathers
to their children, the needs of the home—particularly Christian homes—
are so great today that this subject merits our spending a considerable
portion of time in studying it this week.

        We also are given a glimpse into employer-employee relationships. At
     first glance it may not seem that the two topics are connected, but they
     are. Our success on the job is to a large degree determined by the influ-
     ence that our homes have had and still have on us. A person who has a
     difficult time in working harmoniously with his associates in his place of
     employment often has a poor relationship with his own parents, spouse,
     or children. One of the main problems facing our society is the break-
     down of authority. That breakdown begins in the home.
        The New Testament may not seem to say much in any one place on the
     importance of the home, but what it does say is invaluable. Take a few
     minutes to look at some other New Testament passages on the home;
     then list the central thought of each to serve as a basis for comparison
     with the counsel that we find in Ephesians:

       Luke 2:51, 52

       1 Tim. 3:4, 5

       1Tim 5.8

       Titus 2:4, 5

     I. ADVICE TO CHILDREN (Eph. 6:1-3).
El     What is to be at the very root or foundation of the relationship children
     should have with their parents? Why are they to obey? Eph. 6:1; Col. 3:20.


        One of the principles of Bible study is that scripture illuminates scrip-
     ture, and one text becomes the key to unlock or deepen the meaning of
     another text. Notice the reason Paul gives for obedience in his Ephesian
     epistle is that obedience is right, and in Colossians it is because obedience
     is pleasing to God. How pleased and even proud earthly parents are when
     their son or daughter obeys after being given a difficult. task or assign-
     ment—one that it would have been most natural not to carry out! How
     pleased our heavenly Parent is when His children respond to their duties
     and responsibilities in loving obedience!
        The fact that the word used for obey is stronger than the one translated
     "submit" in Ephesians 5:22 indicates a different relationship. In Scrip-
     ture, those who are disobedient to parents are placed in the same cate-
     gory as "haters of God" (Rom. 1:30), and "lovers of pleasures more than
     lovers of God" (2 Tim. 3:4). On the other hand, obedience is portrayed as
     reasonable and just. "The best way to educate children to respect their
     father and mother is to give them the opportunity of seeing the father
     offering kindly attentions to the mother and the mother rendering respect
     and reverence to the father. It is by beholding love in their parents that
     children are led to obey the fifth commandment and to heed the injunc-
     tion, 'Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.' "—The
     Adventist Home, pp. 198, 199.


                                                                               85
  What is the true meaning of the fifth commandment? What kind of moti-
vation should children have for showing obedience to their parents? Eph.
6:2, 3.


   Paul explains that there is a cause and a purpose for honoring one's
parents. The cause is found in God's commandment in Exodus 20:12.
   "The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield respect,
submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love
and tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to
succor and comfort them in old age. It also enjoins respect for ministers
and rulers and for all others to whom God has delegated authority."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 308.
   Paul expresses the purpose for this commandment as follows: "That it
may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth" (Eph. 6:3).
This promise of well-being and long life not only applies to this world but
also to the new earth.

ILLUMINATION: "Children who dishonor and disobey their parents,
and disregard their advice and instructions, can have no part in the earth
made new. The purified new earth will be no place for the rebellious, the
disobedient, the ungrateful son or daughter."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp.
497, 498.

   Some parents may ask themselves, Should I reward my children for
doing that which is right, or should they automatically do what is right
without any thought of a reward? One of the greatest challenges in Chris-
tian parenthood is proper motivation. What kind of incentives should be
used? Should material things such as toys, gadgets, or money be used in
order to motivate a child to establish right habits of behavior? The great-
est reward for right doing is a clear conscience, but a child's conscience is
only partly developed. Love, praise, and encouragement are types of
positive reinforcement that Christian parents can use as incentives to
obedience. Is it wrong to use other types of rewards as well?

SEARCH AND LEARN: Study what the Bible has to say about the matter
of rewards. Here are some references:
    Prov. 3:1, 2                        Deut. 7:12-15
   Matt. 6:4, 6; 16:27                   Rom. 6:23
   Because God as heavenly Father gives rewards to His earthly children,
it is fitting that Christian parents give rewards to their children.

THINK IT THROUGH: What are the most effective types of incentives that
can be used in working with people?

11. ADVICE TO FATHERS (Eph. 6:4).

  How does the counsel that Paul gives to the fathers in the Ephesian
church differ with what was given to those in the Colossian congregation?
Compare Eph. 6:4 with Col. 3:21.

86
   In times past it was a common practice for philosophers and writers to
give advice to fathers on how to be good fathers. This advice usually ap-
peared in the form of sayings. At first glance some of these sayings ap-
pear to be similar to what Paul has to say, such as the following two from
the church historian Neander:
   "A father who is always threatening does not receive much reverence."
   "One should correct a child not by hurting him but by persuading
him."—Quoted by E. K. Simpson and F. E Bruce, Commentary on Epis-
tles to the Ephesians and the Colossians (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B.
Eerdmans, 1957), p. 292.
   However, Christianity offers a much deeper dimension to child
rearing—the spiritual aspect. In Colossians Paul tells us that fathers
should not be so harsh that they discourage their children, discourage-
ment being an absence of incentive for doing what is right. In Ephesians
Paul stresses the positive side of motivation. When children are properly
instructed and trained in the way of the Lord, then parents will not have
to resort to threats, demands, and harshness to force the child to obey.
"Another prolific cause of resentment among children is the capricious,
inconsistent demands of some parents. Even if outward obedience is
gained by violent means, it is at the expense of honor and respect."—
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1041.
    Phillips translates Ephesians 6:4 as, "Father, don't over-correct your
children or make it difficult for them to obey the commandment." The
New English Bible renders it as, "You fathers, again, must not goad your
children to resentment." If this counsel was needed nearly two thousand
years ago in households relatively unencumbered with all the pressures
that are inherent in a high-technology society, certainly it is needed even
 more today. The term fathers is generic, and thus applies to mothers as
well. How sad it is when such pressures as those of a job, getting out of
debt, paying school bills, meeting health costs, and doing all that most
societies expect of us today keep parents so tense that they occasionally
 let loose their frustrations on their children by being needlessly severe.

THINK IT THROUGH: How can I make my life less complicated and more
serene so that I do not lash out at those who are closest and dearest to me?

I11. ADVICE TO EMPLOYEES (SLAVES) (Eph. 6:5-8).

  In what way is a Christian employee to serve his employer, whether the
employer is a Christian or not? Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22.


   In his Ephesian letter Paul fills four verses with instruction to servants
(literally "slaves") and only one verse with instruction to masters. The
fact that he has more to say to slaves than to masters may indicate that a
large proportion of the early converts to the Christian faith were slaves.
Even though Paul was discussing master-slave obligations, his counsel is
just as relevant today to employer-employee relationships.
   "He [Paul] is searchingly practical. He demands that service be given


                                                                          87
      in singleness of . . . heart. Honesty of purpose and wholehearted effort
      must characterize the Christian employee. The same word . . . is applied
      to both 'secular' work and to the 'spiritual' service of Christians; the New
      Testament uses it most frequently of liberality in Christian giving (Rom.
      x11.8; 2 Cor. vi11.2, ix.11, 13). The Bible allows no distinction between
      sacred and secular. Eye-service is excluded, and here and in Colossians
      i11.22 a word seems to have been invented by the apostle to express his
      thought. Service 'under the compulsion of inspection' (Moule, CB)
      should not so much as be considered by the Christian."—Francis
      Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians (Grand Rapids, Mich.: The
      Tyndale Press, 1968), p. 168.

        In the ultimate sense, what attitude should employees take toward their
      employment? Eph. 6:6.


        "The work of God is sacred and calls for men of lofty integrity. Men are
      wanted whose sense of justice, even in the smallest matters, will not al-
      low them to make an entry of their time that is not minute and correct—
      men who will realize that they are handling means that belongs to God,
      and who would not unjustly appropriate one cent to their own use; men
      who will be just as faithful and exact, careful and diligent, in their labor, in
      the absence of their employer as in his presence, proving by their faithful-
      ness that they are not merely men-pleasers, eye-servants, but are consci-
      entious, faithful, true workmen, doing right, not for human praise, but
      because they love and choose right from a high sense of their obligation to
      God."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 25.

WED        What is the highest motive for service? Eph. 6:7, 8; Col. 3:23.


         It is easy for those who work for the church and who receive their sal-
      ary out of tithe funds to know that they are working for the Lord, but it is
      more difficult for those who are working for a secular employer, for a
      large corporation, or for a governmental agency to realize that they too
      are working for the Lord. If we are to do everything "as to the Lord,"
      then it means that whatever our job, work, or profession, we are being
      employed by the Lord in His service. This fact is alluded to in Ephesians
      6:5 where servants are counseled to obey their "masters according to the
      flesh," thus implying that they have a higher obligation to a heavenly
      Master. This point also was brought out by Christ when He made the oft-
      quoted statement, "No man can serve two masters" (Matt. 6:24).
         A Christian is radically different from the secular person. Everything
      the Christian does is done with eternity in mind and the cross in view.
      Reread the first few verses of Ephesians 6 and notice how much of what
      we do is to be in reference "to the Lord." Review the earlier chapters of
      Ephesians and you will be reminded that our singing is to be done "to the
      Lord" (Eph. 5:19) and wives are to bring themselves into harmony with
      their husband's wishes "as unto the Lord" (Eph. 5:22).


      88
    [(MVO' =MEMiri
      What additional motivation does the Lord offer us in order that we might
    be sure to do everything as to the Lord? Col. 3:24, 25.


       Notice that these words are addressed to slaves, many of whom were
    working for pagan employers. In spite of this, they are considered by Paul
    to be serving the Lord in their lowly responsibilities. This illustrates the
    magnificent way that Christianity, beyond any other religion or philos-
    ophy, is able to give dignity to that which the world would consider de-
    meaning. This concept glorifies common labor. The real reward for ser-
    vice does not come from employers, but comes from the Lord who is the
    true Employer.

    IV. ADVICE TO EMPLOYERS (MASTERS) (Eph.6:9).
ki
 llli
      What is the one trap that employers are prone to fall into and the one that
    Paul counsels them to avoid? Eph. 6:9; Col. 4:1.


      It is contrary to Christian principles for employers to take advantage of
    employees. Employers know that it would be most difficult for their em-
    ployees to find new jobs if they become dissatisfied with their present
    ones. The employee has the added pressure of knowing that his or her
    family is dependent upon the income received. The golden rule might be
    paraphrased as follows: "Employers, do unto your employees as you
    would wish them to do unto you if they were in your position."

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Notice how many of the parables taught by Christ
    illustrate the basic principles of employer-employee relationships. What is
    the main lesson on this topic being taught in the examples given below?

          The unforgiving servant (Matt. 18:23-35)



           Laborers in the vineyard (Matt. 20:1-16)



          The two sons (Matt. 21:28-32)



          The pounds or talents (Matt. 25:14-30; Luke 19:11-27)



        THINK IT THROUGH: How can we expect there to be unity within a local
        congregation if some of its members who hold church offices may be taking
        advantage of fellow church members in their business relationships? How

                                                                               89
can there be unity if employees work diligently only when their employers
are observing them? How can there be peace and harmony within the
church when there are quarrels at home—when a parent vents his or her
wrath upon a child, or when children are allowed to grow up with no respect
for authority?

  Unity with others can come about only when we are in tune with God
and our stubborn wills have become united with His selfless will.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter, "The Home a
Missionary Training Center" in Christian Service, pages 206-210, and the
chapter, "Business Principles and Methods" in Education, pages 135-
145.
   "Fathers and mothers who make God first in their households, who
teach their children that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
glorify God before angels and before men by presenting to the world a
well-ordered, well-disciplined family, a family that love and obey God in-
stead of rebelling against Him. Christ is not a stranger in their homes; His
name is a household name, revered and glorified. Angels delight in a
home where God reigns supreme, and the children are taught to rever-
ence religion, the Bible, and their Creator. Such families can claim the
promise: 'Them that honor Me I will honor.' As from such a home the
father goes forth to his daily duties, it is with a spirit softened and sub-
dued by converse with God. He is a Christian, not only in his profession,
but in trade, in all his business relations. He does his work with fidelity,
knowing that the eye of God is upon him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 424.
   "Parents, God desires you to make your family a sample of the family
in heaven. Guard your children. Be kind and tender with them. Father,
mother, and children are to be joined together with the golden links of
love. One well-ordered, well-disciplined family is a greater power in dem-
onstrating the efficiency of Christianity than all the sermons in the world.
When fathers and mothers realize how their children copy them, they will
watch carefully every word and gesture."—Ellen G. White Comments,
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1118.

SUMMARY: The unity of the church is being tested in the everyday lives
of its members. We spend most of our time either in our homes or at our
jobs, and the closest relationships possible for us to develop usually are
cultivated in the home or at work. The strength of the church can be no
stronger than are these vital, day-to-day relationships.

APPLICATION: Our study of this lesson should infuse us with new vital-
ity in the performance of our daily tasks. How often we feel that what we
are doing is unimportant, particularly if it is done for a secular employer.
But remembering that what we are doing is "for the Lord" adds a new
dimension to that which seems mere drudgery. Ask yourself, What
should I pray for during the coming week as a result of my study of this
lesson?

Strong in the Lord
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ephesians 6:10-24.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and
 PM   in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye
      may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil" (Eph. 6:10, 11).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: The Christian life is a daily battle with self and
with wrong. It is a battle that we cannot win in our own strength. We may
gain strength from others, but most of all we gain strength and victory
over self and sin from the One who already has conquered the enemy.

INTRODUCTION: If you never have been in such a situation, try pictur-
ing what it must be like to be a soldier out on the battlefield. Imagine the
conflicting turmoil of thoughts and the nagging doubts that would press
into your mind. Will you ever see your loved ones at home again? If so,
will you return home crippled or scarred for life, but clutching life itself as
your only trophy? What must it be like to know that the enemy is closing
in fast on all sides? You can almost sense the soldier's feeling of helpless-
ness and vulnerability. What keeps him from surrendering when his mind
is beginning to play tricks on him for lack of sleep and his body is faint
from hunger? His clothes are wet, his body is shivering, his nerves are
shattered, his strength is depleted, yet the valiant soldier continues to
fight on because he has a country and a cause that he is defending. Vic-
tory must be won at any cost, even at the sacrifice of his life.
   Paul concludes his epistle with a clarion call to warfare and to the
launching of an all-out attack on the forces of evil that are arrayed around

                                                                            91
    us. At the very moment Paul was writing this letter a Roman centurion
    stood guard over him, reminding him that life indeed is a battle. (See Acts
    28:16.) He could still vividly recall Julius, the Roman soldier who had
    charge of him on the voyage to Rome. This made him aware of the garb
    and the life of a soldier. He could sense the unswerving loyalty of a sol-
    dier for his commander. He could see that a soldier was duty-bound to
    endure any amount of sacrifice, discomfort, or pain in order to fulfill his
    commission. Death was not too high a price to pay for victory. No wonder
    that Paul, under divine inspiration, seized upon the imagery of a soldier to
    provide one of the finest illustrations of what the Christian life is about.

SUN I. THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE (Eph. 6:10-17).

       What is the source of the Christian's strength and the secret in obtaining
    victory in the battle? Verse 10.


       When we first read Paul's challenge to "Be strong in the Lord," we
    might infer that the source of our power comes from within rather than
    from without. Actually the original Greek is better translated as, "be
    strengthened" or "be made powerful in the Lord," thus pointing more
    directly to the Lord as the source of our strength.

    ILLUMINATION: "Of our own selves we can do nothing; but through
    Christ we can do all things. God intends that we shall be a help and bless-
    ing to one another, and that we shall be strong in the Lord and in the
    power of His might. . . . God lives and reigns; and He will give us all the
    help we need. It is our privilege at all times to draw strength and encour-
    agement from His blessed promise, 'My grace is sufficient for you.' "—
    Evangelism, p. 98.

       Being made strong in the Lord includes being strengthened "in the
    grace that is in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim. 2:1), and being strengthened "in
    faith, giving glory to God" (Rom. 4:20). Grace and faith are blended to-
    gether in the power of Christ.
       This was true in the life of the apostle Paul. Paul said that this strength
    that came to him from the Lord gave him power to preach successfully to
    the Gentiles (2 Tim. 4:17). Paul could declare, "I can do all things through
    Christ which strengtheneth me" (Phil. 4:13).
       We should also be strengthened "in the power of his might" (Eph.
    6:10). This is the same might that raised Christ from the dead and set Him
    at the right hand of God. It is a power that is far above all principalities
    and powers and might and dominion (Eph. 1:19-21). It is a might that will
    not fail to reach the long-sought victory in the end.

      Why is it vitally important that we put on the whole armor of God? Eph.
    6:11, 13.


      We must be prepared in order to win the battle. This spiritual battle will

    92
become more and more difficult as we approach the end of time. The
wicked powers will do everything possible to destroy God's people and
divide the church, even to performing signs and mighty wonders. "That
time will soon come, and we shall have to keep hold of the strong arm of
Jehovah; for all these great signs and mighty wonders of the devil are
designed to deceive God's people and overthrow them. Our minds must
be stayed upon God, and we must not fear the fear of the wicked, that is,
fear what they fear and reverence what they reverence, but be bold and
valiant for the truth. Could our eyes be opened we should see forms of
evil angels around us, trying to invent some new way to annoy and de-
stroy us. And we should also see angels of God guarding us from their
power; for God's watchful eye is ever over Israel for good, and He will
protect and save His people if they put their trust in Him. When the en-
emy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard
against him.
   "Said the angel, 'Remember, thou art on the enchanted ground.' I saw
that we must watch and have on the whole armor and take the shield of
faith, and then we shall be able to stand, and the fiery darts of the wicked
cannot harm us."—Early Writings, p. 60.

   What is the real nature of the struggle in which we are engaged, and why
is it so crucial that God's people be united? Eph. 6:12.


   If we realized fully the true nature of the battle that we are fighting, we
would put forth much more than the feeble efforts we are so accustomed
to exerting. The battle is unique in that the enemy forces for the most part
are unseen, thus enabling them to work within the church as easily as
outside of it. Human nature is such that we will rally against an enemy
that is visible much more quickly and with much greater ardor than we do
against one that we cannot see. In this conflict the motto of the enemy is,
"Divide and conquer!" One of the most effective weapons in his arsenal is
disunity.

ILLUMINATION: "In this prayer of Christ's (John 17:17-23), God has
expressed his desire for the unity of his believing people. But there is an
unwearied conflict kept up on this earth. Satan works to make the prayer
of Christ of none effect. He makes a continual effort to create bitterness
and discord; for he knows that where there is unity, there is strength,—a
oneness which all the powers of hell can not break. All who bring weak-
ness and sorrow and discouragement upon God's people, by their own
perverse ways and tempers, aid the enemy of God, and are working di-
rectly against the prayer of Christ."—Ellen G. White, Review and Her-
ald, April 27, 1897.

1. Girded with Truth. (Eph. 6:14, first part).
   "The girding would be done by a belt. NEB in fact translates: 'Buckle
on the belt of truth.' The phrase 'gird the loins' is meaningless today for
westerners with the kind of clothes they wear, but very appropriate for
the first-century easterner with his flowing robes. His outer garment

                                                                            93
would be a long loose-fitting cloak reaching to his ankles. If he tried to
run or fight in it, it would wrap itself round his legs and trip him up. If he
needed to act quickly and with agility, this loose garment had to be lifted
clear above the knees and fastened securely round the waist. So to gird
the loins was the necessary preliminary to any vigorous action. For in-
stance, the Israelites, at the time of the first Passover, as they waited for
the signal to make their escape from Egypt, were at the ready 'with loins
girded' (Exod. 12:11). Elijah, as a herald of the fulfilment of God's prom-
ise of rain, prepared to outrun on foot the horse-drawn chariot of Ahab,
by 'girding up his loins' (1 Kg. 18:46). Understandably the phrase came to
be used metaphorically of mental and spiritual readiness for exceptional
tasks. 1 Pet. 1:13 summons Christians to 'gird up the loins of your minds'.
So here in Ephesians the Christian is called to 'gird up his loins' spiri-
tually. This means getting rid of anything which might be a hindrance in
the struggle against evil, eliminating any easy-going casualness which
might make him less than ready for the fray."—C. Leslie Mitton, Ephe-
sians, (London: Marshall, Morgan & Scott, 1976), pp. 224, 225.

THINK IT THROUGH: What effect does the telling of half-truths or mis-
leading insinuations have upon the life of the Christian?



   2. The Breastplate of Righteousness (Eph. 6:14, second part).
   The breastplate covered the heart of the soldier. "So important is the
breastplate of righteousness in the defense of the Christian soldier in the
warfare against the hosts of evil that in 2 Corinthians 6:7 the entire armor
is called 'the armour of righteousness.' Since Christ is our defense and
hope of victory, we are told that if we abide 'in Christ Jesus' He 'is made
unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.'
(1 Corinthians 1:30). . . .
   "Experiencing the imputed righteousness of Christ by faith to take care
of the past, and His imparted righteousness to produce character devel-
opment into His likeness, are what is involved in the putting on of 'the
breastplate of righteousness,' and being clothed with the beautiful robe of
the righteousness of Christ."—Taylor G. Bunch, The Armor of Righ-
teousness (Nashville, Tenn.: Southern Publishing Association, 1957), pp.
45, 52, 53.

     3. The Sandals of the Gospel of Peace (Eph. 6:15).

     Why is footwear so important?


   "Battles, historians tell us, have sometimes been lost by inadequate
footwear. Swords and helmet lose their effectiveness if the soldier is foot-
sore or crippled by ill-fitting boots. A soldier for whom every step is a
drudge or a misery is not likely to win battles. The equivalent of strong,
light, well-fitting boots for the Christian soldier is that he is equipped with
the gospel of peace. Few things make a man feel more agile and mobile

94
than the confidence that he is the bearer of joyous good news (gospel)."—
C. Leslie Mitton, Ephesians, pp. 225, 226.
ILLUMINATION: "The Lord is soon coming. Talk it, pray it, believe it.
Make it a part of the life. You will have to meet a doubting, objecting
spirit, but this will give way before firm, consistent trust in God. When
perplexities or hindrances present themselves, lift the soul to God in
songs of thanksgiving. Gird on the Christian armor, and be sure that your
feet are 'shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.' "—My Life
Today, p. 312.
  An important element of waging warfare successfully is communication
between the front lines and headquarters; messages must be carried faith-
fully. What does Paul say about the "gospel of peace" in Romans 10:15?



   4. The Shield of Faith (Eph. 6:16).
   A soldier who is trapped on the battlefield by enemies on all sides and
who is running low on ammunition and food has one thing alone left to
depend on, and that is faith—the faith that gives the victory. The shield
itself is perhaps more important than some of the other pieces of armor, in
that if rightly used it provides covering for every part of the body. In an-
cient times the shield was not the small round shiny bronze "target" that
sometimes is pictured, but rather a large oblong, lightweight one measur-
ing four feet high and two-and-a-half feet wide. When the soldier was
forced to run, he had to be able to take his shield with him. The "fiery
darts" were burning arrows that produced double devastation: first, pen-
etrating a weak spot in the armor, they could kill, and second, they set
clothing or gear on fire, causing soldiers to panic.

ILLUMINATION: "Faith in God's Word, prayerfully studied and practi-
cally applied, will be our shield from Satan's power and will bring us off
conquerors through the blood of Christ."—My Life Today, p. 313.

  5. The Helmet of Salvation (Eph. 6:17, first part).

  What makes the helmet so important in the Christian's armor?


   "Salvation is a provision for man that can as definitely be received as
any other part of the Christian armour—the soul's deliverance is not a
matter of uncertainty to the end. In Isaiah lix.17 the divine Warrior wears
the helmet of salvation as the Worker and Bringer of salvation. For the
Christian, salvation is part of the defensive armour that is essential for his
safety in the fray. It may be taken as God's gift of salvation from the pen-
alty of sin, but even more as His saving help to protect from the power of
sin, and the parallel in 1 Thessalonians v. 8 suggests that here also we may
take it to include 'the hope' of final deliverance from the very presence of
sin."—Francis Foulkes, The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: The Tyndale Press, 1979), p. 176.
                                                                           95
         6. The Sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17, second part).
         The sword is the only element of the weaponry that Paul mentions that
      is used for offense as well as defense. It can be used to cause the opposing
      forces of evil to flee. While the other items listed are primarily for protec-
      tion, the sword can be used for aggressive attack. (See Heb. 4:12.)

      ILLUMINATION: "The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
      pierces the heart of the sinner and cuts it in pieces."—Testimonies, vol. 4,
      p. 441.

      11. THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER (Eph. 6:18-20).

           How does prayer serve Christians in the battles and struggles of life?


        A common fallacy is that people who are spiritually strong need not
      pray as much or as earnestly as those who are weak. But Paul, the valiant
      missionary who had won victory after victory for Christ, felt his need for
      prayer and specifically asked that the Ephesian church remember him in
      their prayers so that he could speak boldly for his Saviour when appear-
      ing before the throne of the mightiest monarch on earth. Christ, the
      divine-human Son of God, felt His need of prayer and continued depen-
      dency upon His Father. "If the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the
      need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the ne-
      cessity of fervent, constant prayer."—Steps to Christ, p. 94.

TAU      When life is going smoothly for us, it is easy to become lax in our prayer
      life, or even to neglect prayer entirely. But Paul says that we are to be "pray-
      ing always." What was in the parable that Christ told that vividly illustrates
      the point "that men ought always to pray"? Luke 18:1-7.


         Perseverance in prayer does not mean approaching God in sheer per-
      sistence to make Him change His mind, like a begging child does to get
      something from an unwilling parent. Perseverance in prayer indicates a
      state of mind on the part of the suppliant that gives God an opportunity to
      do things He could not do safely for the individual otherwise.
         One of the most powerful influences to bring about unity in the church
      is prayer. If you are praying for an individual by name, then you will not
      be harboring bitterness or holding a grudge against that person.

      I11. PAUL'S FINAL SALUTATION (Eph. 6:21-24).

        What were the uppermost concerns on the apostle's mind as he bid fare-
      well to the church members at Ephesus? Verses 21-24.


       With stalwart Paul we find no note of self-pity, no personal worries that
      might lead to preoccupation with self. Instead, he is sending the trusted
      messenger Tychicus in order to "comfort" the members at Ephesus.

      96
Tychicus is one of the unsung heroes of the cross in the first century. He is
listed as one of the seven men who accompanied Paul at the end of his
third missionary journey (Acts 20:4) and who undoubtedly followed Paul
all the way to Jerusalem prior to his arrest there. He continually plays the
role of bearer of good news, for he is the one that Paul entrusted with the
delivery of three epistles—Ephesians (2 Tim. 4:12), Colossians (Col. 4:7),
and Titus (Titus 3:12). What if Tychicus had fallen by the wayside and
failed to deliver these precious messages? The world would have been
the poorer if Tychicus had "lost" the epistle to the Ephesians.

THINK IT THROUGH: Paul says, "Ye are our epistle ... , known and read
of all men" (2 Cor. 3:2). Are you faithfully delivering the message God has
entrusted you in the same way that faithful Tychicus did?

FURTHER STUDY AND APPLICATION: Read The Acts of the Apostles,
page 76 to learn how to have your "loins girt about with truth."
   If available, secure a copy of the Ellen White devotional book, My Life
Today, and read the selections on the Christian's armor on pages 309-315.
If not avaable, you can meditate on the following thoughts taken from
that section:
   "To every one God has made an offer that will help to brace every
nerve and spiritual muscle for the time of test that is to come to us all. I
am charged with the message, Clothe yourself with the whole armor of
Christ's righteousness. . . . And, having done all you can do on your part,
you have the assurance of victory. To every soul is granted the gracious
opportunity of standing on the Rock of Ages."—My Life Today, p. 311.
   "When souls are converted their salvation is not yet accomplished.
They then have the race to run; the arduous struggle is before them to do,
what? 'To fight the good fight offaith,' to press forward to the mark for
the prize of the high calling which is in Christ Jesus. There is no release in
this warfare; the battle is lifelong, and must be carried forward with deter-
mined energy proportionate to the value of the object you are in pursuit
of, which is eternal life."—My Life Today, p. 313.

SUMMARY: The strong are tempted to rely upon self—to go out to battle
in their own armor. The weak recognize their need of help from above
because their plight is desperate and their future well-nigh hopeless. The
strong often start their busy day's activities neglecting personal prayer
and Bible study, like a soldier running in great haste to the front lines
while forgetting to take his sword with him. The weak who recognize
their need flee to the Lord in prayer. Never forget that "the race is not to
the swift, nor the battle to the strong" (Eccl. 9:11). Paul states this mar-
velous truth in another way, "When I am weak, then am I strong" (1 Cor.
12:10).

APPLICATION: Take a few moments to review one by one the various
pieces of armor, and then ask yourself these questions: Which of the
pieces of armor am I in need of the most? What am I doing with those I
have in hand? What orders from my Commander am I neglecting?

Lessons for Second Quarter, 1986
  Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult
Lessons for the second quarter of 1986 will be helped by the following
outline in studying the first two lessons. The title of this series is "In Full
Assurance."

First Lesson:
HOW TO HANDLE DOUBT

  MEMORY TEXT: Hab. 2:4.

  THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Habakkuk 1:1 through 2:4.

   CENTRAL THOUGHT: Doubts and questions may arise from both
God's seeming inactivity and His activity. Nevertheless, His followers
find assurance in a faith that grows as a result of the questionings of faith.

  OUTLINE:
    I. Why does God allow evil to go unchecked? (Hab. 1:1-4).
   11. The Babylonians will bring judgment on Judah (Hab. 1:5-11).
  I11. How can God use the wicked Babylonians for such a purpose?
       (Hab. 1:12-2:1).
  IV. Trust in Me! (Hab. 2:2-4).

Second Lesson:
GOD IN CONTROL

  MEMORY TEXT: Hab. 2:20.

  THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Hab. 2:5-20.

   CENTRAL THOUGHT: Inherent in sin are the seeds of its own de-
struction. Despite the apparent success of human pride, injustice, and
exploitation of others, the sinner cannot find happiness and peace. Only
faith in the God who still is in charge brings peace and assurance.

  OUTLINE:
    I. God's Woes (Judgments) on Babylon (Hab. 2:5-19).
   11. Faith's Assurance: God Is in Charge (Hab. 2:20).
