    The Adult Sabbath School Lessons are prepared by the Department of Church Ministries
of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The preparation of the lessons is under
the general direction of a worldwide Sabbath School Lesson Committee, the members of which
serve as consulting editors. The published lesson quarterly reflects the input of the committee
and thus does not solely or necessarily represent the intent of the authors.

Seminary in the Philippines.
   Dr. Hardinge has published eight books, in-
cluding These Watched Him Die and The Con-
querors. Since his retirement he has worked

1981.
    Elder Holbrook wrote the column called
"Frank Answers" for These Times for many
years as well as numerous articles for Ministry
and the Adventist Review. He has authored
several booklets and one academy textbook. He
is the editor of the proposed eleventh volume of
the SDA Bible Commentary.
    The Holbrooks have three adult children.

       The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study
of the lessons, not merely to mechanically repeat the words, while the
mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—
Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 53.

        Daily Lesson Study Pledge.
❑ As one greatly desirous of improving my knowledge of the Scriptures
and of the Lord to whom they point, I pledge to carefully and prayerfully
study some portion of the Sabbath School lesson each day of the week.
      How To Study These Lessons
   You need the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit. Jesus
promised that the Holy Spirit would be given to those who ask Him
(Luke 11:13). Without the Spirit's special enlightenment there can be no
genuine understanding of the spiritual message of the Bible. Before
beginning your study each day pray that the Holy Spirit will instruct
your mind. Not only does He make difficult things plain, but also He
brings Christ to your heart as your indwelling righteousness (Rom. 8:9,
10).
   Read through the entire lesson in the quarterly at the beginning
of the week. Whole learning is more effective than part learning. When
you see the whole picture first it is then much easier to put in the
details. The parts of the whole can be remembered better when you un-
derstand the overall message.
    Study one section of the lesson each day. It is not always neces-
sary to look up every verse to find the answer to the question. Some-
times we incorporate additional verses for those who are anxious to
have more Bible evidence. It is important for you to read enough of the
Bible passages so that you can understand the message that is being
taught. If you discover problem words, phrases, or ideas, go to a good
Bible commentary or dictionary for clarification. The aim of your study
is always to gain a closer walk with God. Factual information is helpful,
but spiritual insight is essential. Do not worry if you do not understand
everything in the book, chapter, or verse being discussed. No one under-
stands everything. God's Word is a mine of truth that always contains
much more than our finite human capacity is capable of grasping. Even
so, we are blessed when we make the effort to receive the blessing the
Lord has for us.
   Use the writings of Ellen G. White as a commentary on the
Bible text. Her interpretations of Scripture were given by the Lord to
lead us to a better understanding of His Word. First seek to determine
the meaning of a Bible passage by comparing Scripture with Scripture.
Then see what Ellen White has to say on the passage. The Index to the
Writings of E. G. White will be invaluable to you in this study.
   Allow the Bible to speak to you personally. Leviticus is not the
easiest book of the Bible to understand. But it has important spiritual
messages for each one of us. If we compare the book of Leviticus with its
New Testament parallels, it is possible to understand its great sig-
nificance for Christians. The Lord has spoken to His people in many dif-
ferent ways through the ages. The book of Leviticus reveals how He ap-
proached the children of Israel shortly after their escape from Egypt. It
enabled the Israelites to understand something of the Messiah's work in
the future. And it enables us to grasp more fully what Jesus has done
and is continuing to do for us.

   Introduction to the Book of Leviticus

     Leviticus and Us
    Many translations of Scripture call Leviticus the "Third Book of
Moses." Our English name comes from the Greek, and means "The
Levitical Book," although Levites are mentioned only twice (Lev.
25:32, 33). Its title is based on the fact that it contains the rules by
which the Levites carried out their ministrations.
    The Levitical regulations codify and clarify the ways in which
God's people worshipped Him from the beginning. They also are
filled with symbols and types of salvation. The regulations for wor-
ship reveal spiritual truth that God wished His people to grasp. The
symbols point prophetically to Christ's atoning ministry.
    Can the book of Leviticus speak to people today, or should it be
deleted from our Bibles as a worn-out "manual for ministers"—a
relic from a long-forgotten age when men offered animal sacrifices
and burned incense?
    The book of Leviticus does contain a message for us. Because
modem people remain carnal, the everlasting gospel that brought
God's saving grace to sinners in antiquity still is needed today.
    The book of Leviticus, along with portions of Exodus and Num-
bers, provides written guidelines for the services of the Israelite
sanctuary. It also provides a code for practical, everyday living for a
committed, covenant people who desire to mirror the character of
God. The book of Leviticus furnishes God's people a theological
model for understanding the plan of salvation.
    A study of the literary structure of the book of Leviticus reveals
that the first half (chapters 1-15) dwells on the general subject of
"justification" ("the priest shall make an atonement for him," Lev.
5:10). The second half (chapters 17-28) focuses on the subject of
"sanctification" ("Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am
holy," Lev. 19:2). At the center is the theological bridge between the
two parts, the Day of Atonement.

Sanctuaries o Salivation
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Insights on Leviticus from the New Testa-
ment. Hebrews 11:4, 7; 10:1-4; Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39.

7A73 MEMORY TEXT: "For the law having a shadow of good
 PM things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never
      with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continual-
      ly make the comers thereunto perfect" (Hebrew 10:1).
YOUR SALVATION COMES THROUGH FAITH. God's method of
saving sinners is the same in all ages. Salvation comes through faith in the
Saviour whom God provided to pay the penalty for our sins.

                   OVERVIEW: Sanctuaries of Salvation

    Heb. 11:4, 7           Heb. 10:1-4           Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39

KNOWING GOD'S WILL. How did people living before the time of
Jesus Christ know the will of God for their lives? How did God make them
aware that the societies in which they were living were vastly inferior to
the divine ideal? How did God convince them that they were sinners in
need of a Saviour? What means did He use to help them understand the
work the Saviour would do for them? The answers to these questions are
found in the book of Leviticus.
    To many modern Christians the book of Leviticus appears to be a
musty relic from the ancient past. Such is not the case. Certainly Leviti-
cus is an old book. But things that are old are not always musty relics. A
study of Leviticus can give us a new understanding of the Christian gospel.
It can reinforce the New Testament message that there is forgiveness and
salvation in Jesus Christ, and it can awaken us to God's will regarding
many aspects of human behavior and relationships.
    The book of Leviticus is also of central importance to us as it is
studied in relation to the New Testament. Jesus and New Testament writ-
ers acknowledged Moses as the inspired author of Leviticus. (See Matt.
8:1-4; compare Lev. 14; Heb. 7:14.) New Testament writers often referred
to the Levitical services and laws as meaningful illustrations of Christ's
work for us.
    From the book of Leviticus the Master drew the "second" command-
ment when He summarized the Decalogue: "Thou shalt love thy neigh-


8
hour as thyself" (Matt. 22:39; compare Lev. 19:18). James characterized
the same immortal statement as "the royal law according to the scripture"
(James 2:8).
   Religious faith is the same in Old and New Testaments. When we,
who are removed more than three thousand years from the writing of
Leviticus, turn to the New Testament—especially to the book of
Hebrews—we gain fascinating insights into the broad meaning of the
Levitical sanctuary-centered rites. In doing so, we observe that the
religious faith taught in the Scriptures is essentially the same throughout
both testaments. In addition we catch a fresh vision of the Saviour "who
his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24).
I. THE FAITH OF THE PATRIARCHS (Heb. 11:4, 7; Gal. 3:8; John
   8:56).
   The lives of the patriarchs from Adam to Moses are sketched briefly in
the book of Genesis. Some we know only by name. Three are mentioned
whose experiences provide insights into their faith and that of other loyal
patriarchs who lived prior to the Mosaic era.
1. Through what means did Abel express his faith in God? Heb. 11:4.


   "Abel grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself a
sinner, and he saw sin and its penalty, death, standing between his soul and
communion with God. He brought the slain victim, the sacrificed life, thus
acknowledging the claims of the law that had been transgressed. Through
the shed blood he looked to the future sacrifice, Christ dying on the cross
of Calvary; and trusting in the atonement that was there to be made, he had
the witness that he was righteous, and his offering accepted."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 72.
2. In addition to the coming Flood, what truth did Noah proclaim to
   his contemporaries and preserve to pass on to post-Flood genera-
   tions? 2 Peter 2:5; Heb. 11:7.


3. How did God announce to Abraham the gospel or plan of salvation?
   What did the promise mean? Gal. 3:8; compare Gen. 12:3.


4. What experience imprinted on Abraham's mind the substitutionary
   nature of the coming Saviour's sacrifice? John 8:56; compare Gen.
   22:8, 13.



                                                                          9
   Abraham learned the meaning of the gospel. "Through type and
promise God 'preached before the gospel unto Abraham.' Galatians 3:8.
And the patriarch's faith was fixed upon the Redeemer to come. . . . The
ram offered in the place of Isaac represented the Son of God, who was to
be sacrificed in our stead. When man was doomed to death by transgres-
sion of the law of God, the Father, looking upon His Son, said to the sin-
ner, 'Live: I have found a ransom.'
   "It was to impress Abraham's mind with the reality of the gospel, as
well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son. The
agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial was per-
mitted that he might understand from his own experience something of the
greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God for man's redemp-
tion."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 154.
  Ask yourself: What can the experiences of Abel, Noah, and Abraham
add to my understanding of the love and sacrifice of God through Jesus
Christ?
11. THE FAITH OF ISRAEL (Heb. 10:1-4).
   God unfolded His plan. The Israelites were organized as a nation
under God at Sinai. But their religion should not be regarded as new and
different from that of the patriarchs. It was a flowering, a natural expan-
sion, of the ancient patriarchal faith expressed in the sacrificial system.
   Two observations confirm this view:
   o At Sinai Israel entered into covenant relationship with the same
God who had covenanted with their immediate forebears--Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. (See Gen. 17:7, 8; Ex. 6:2-8; 19:3-6.) Israel worshiped the
same God who had been worshiped by their distant ancestors. Israel's
spiritual heritage could be traced back through Noah and Seth to Adam.
   o The burnt offering, the basic sacrifice of patriarchal worship,
was continued in the Israelite sanctuary. (See Gen. 8:20; Job 1:5; 42:8.)
The patriarchal burnt offering was retained as the central, morning-evening
sacrifice, offered by the priests for all Israel. (See Ex. 29:38-42.) Ap-
parently the altar in the court derived its name from this fact. It was called
"the altar of burnt offering" (Ex. 30:28).
   Tabernacle worship disclosed God's purposes. The fact that Israel's
tabernacle/Temple sanctuary worship was locked into the earlier patriar-
chal worship is an example of unfolding revelation. There may be seen in
Israel's sanctuary new worship forms that disclosed more fully the pur-
poses of God.
   In the divine planning it was time for God's people to be given new and
deeper concepts of the Deity, the sin problem, and the means by which
God would effect man's reconciliation with Himself.
5. What function did the ceremonial law (as found in Leviticus) have
   for the Israelites? What were its limitations? Heb. 10:1-4.


10
   This statement by the apostle provides the key to open the book of
Leviticus and to inform us of its general subject matter. Note the following
points:
   • The "law" in this passage refers to the Mosaic instruction relating
to the sacrifices, festivals, and related elements of the ritual system. This
legislation is found briefly in the book of Leviticus.
   • The Levitical laws were intended to foreshadow or prefigure the
"good things to come."
   • God never intended the Levitical rituals to have (in themselves)
any saving value. They were simply to function as shadow-types—as
pointers—to focus the attention of the people on the coming Messiah and
to fix their faith on Him as their true Saviour from sin.
   • The "good things to come" refer to the all-sufficient sacrifice of
the coming Redeemer to purify penitent sinners. They also refer to His
priestly ministry in their behalf before God.
   God's tabernacle through time. The first step God took in expanding
the religious worship of Israel was to call for the erection of the tabernacle.
In the reign of Solomon, almost 500 years later, this "temporary" tent was
replaced by a permanent Temple in Jerusalem. That magnificent structure,
the glory of the nation, was destroyed in 586 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar.
Eventually the exiles who returned from Babylon built a second Temple.
Herod the Great began to reconstruct and embellish this Temple in 20 B.C.
The building process was still in progress during the days of Jesus. It was
completed only a short time before its total destruction by the Romans in
A.D. 70.
   Although the various structures of the Israelite sanctuary varied some-
what, there appears to have been no significant change in the rituals as set
out by Moses in the book of Leviticus.
6. What relationship do you find between the earthly and the
   heavenly sanctuaries? Ex. 25:8, 9, 40; Heb. 8:5; 9:24.


   The Hebrew word translated "pattern" can signify a three-dimensional
model, or a set of architectural plans, or both. Does this term point to and
reflect a higher reality—namely, a heavenly sanctuary, the heavenly dwell-
ing place of God? The apostle in the book of Hebrews confirms that it
does. Citing Exodus 25:40 as proof, he affirms that the earthly sanctuary
was an "example" (copy) and "figure" of the "true" sanctuary in
heaven. (See Heb. 8:1, 2.)
    God the Architect. "God Himself gave to Moses the plan of that struc-
ture, with particular directions as to its size and form, the materials to be
employed, and every article of furniture which it was to contain. The holy
places made with hands were to be 'figures of the true,' patterns of things
in the heavens' (Hebrews 9:24, 23)—a miniature representation of the
heavenly Temple where Christ, our great High Priest, after offering His
life as a sacrifice, was to minister in the sinner's behalf. God presented
                                                                            11
      before Moses in the mount a view of the heavenly sanctuary, and com-
      manded him to make all things according to the pattern shown him."—
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 343.
      7. What did God intend to teach Israel by the services of the priests in
         the various Levitical rituals? Heb. 4:1, 2.



          In this passage "us" refers to Christians; "them" refers to the Israelites
      in the Exodus (discussed in Hebrews 3:7-19). The point is being made that
      both Christians and Jews have received the same gospel—the same invita-
      tion to salvation from sin by faith in God and His saving provisions.
          "The statement may be rendered, 'we have been gospelized, just as
      they also.' In OT times the gospel was 'preached' through type and
      ceremony, in sacrifice and ritual, but it was the same gospel as that more
      recently proclaimed by Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 418.
      8. What was God's ultimate design for Israel's Temple-sanctuary and
         the Levitical rituals that portrayed His saving gospel in symbol and
         rite? Isa. 56:6, 7.



          The heart of our heavenly Father embraces the entire human fami-
      ly. His was a glorious ideal for Israel, whom He had chosen as His agents
      in a grand strategy to extend grace to all races. His Temple was to provide
      "an house of prayer for all people" (Isa. 56:7). Through Levitical rite and
      symbol He desired to teach them His plan of salvation and lead them to
      personal redemption.

WED   DI. THE FAITH OF CHRISTIANS (Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39).
      9. At what crucial point did the Levitical sacrificial system reach its
         fulfillment? How did this fact underscore the "glad tidings" of
         apostolic preaching about Jesus? Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39; compare
         Heb. 10:4.



         God's method of saving sinners is the same in all ages. Through the
      sacrificial rites (simple forms in pre-Mosaic ages; greatly expanded in the
      Mosaic era) both patriarch and Israelite were taught the gospel—salvation
      through faith in God's promised Saviour. From New Testament times on-
      ward, Christians could rejoice in the actual fact of Christ's appearance. The
      plan of salvation was long foreshadowed in rite and symbol as recorded in
      Leviticus. The same plan became a confirmed reality in the spotless life,
      atoning death, and priestly ministry of Jesus Christ.
      12
10. Where should Christian faith focus today? What are needy sin-
    ners invited to do? Heb. 8:1, 2; 4:14-16.


    Patriarchs and Israelites looked forward to the first advent of the Mess-
iah. Christians look back to Calvary and forward to Christ's second ad-
vent. But the New Testament also has a vertical focus. It focuses on the
living Christ, our high priest today in the heavenly sanctuary.

11. How does the book of Revelation portray the reality of the
    heavenly sanctuary where Jesus ministers?
    • Rev. 4:1, 5
    • Rev. 7:15

    • Rev. 8:3
    • Rev. 11:19
    • Rev 15:5, 8
    Christ's sanctuary ministry essential. "The sanctuary in heaven is the
very center of Christ's work in behalf of men. It concerns every soul living
upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of redemption, bringing us down
to the very close of time and revealing the triumphant issue of the contest
between righteousness and sin. . . .
    "The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is as
essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His
death He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to
complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil, 'whither the
forerunner is for us entered.' Hebrews 6:20. There the light from the cross
of Calvary is reflected. There we may gain a clearer insight into the mys-
teries of redemption."—The Great Controversy, pp. 488, 489.

12. How can my study of the sanctuary rites and priestly ministries
    enrich my understanding of Christ's death followed by His
    priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary? Heb. 8:1-5.


13. By what principles shall we interpret the sanctuary symbolism
    and types as given to us in the book of Leviticus? Heb. 9:9; 8:4,
    5; 10:1.

   The sanctuary a parable and a shadow:
   • As a teaching device the Levitical sanctuary is defined as a

                                                                           13
    "parable." After describing its two apartments and services in general
    terms, the apostle describes the sanctuary as "a figure [Greek, parabole =
    `parable] for the time then present" (Heb. 9:9; compare verses 1-8). A
    parable ordinarily is a short story designed to illustrate and drive home a
    single truth. Only those details are significant that serve to clarify the point
    under consideration. The sanctuary is a complex parable designed to il-
    lustrate several interrelated truths. But we should look for the major em-
    phases. Some of the details are part of the ritual parable and have no
    spiritual significance.
        o The Levitical sanctuary, its priesthood and ritual, is defined also as a
    shadow or type of the heavenly sanctuary and its ministration. (See Heb.
    8:4, 5; 10:1.) As a type, the sanctuary functions like a prophecy to
    prefigure in broad outlines the atoning death of Jesus and the two phases of
    His priestly ministry.
        o The gospel, or plan of salvation, is illustrated and prefigured by the
    types in Leviticus. (See Heb. 4:1, 2; 8:1-6.)
        This means not only that the Levitical sanctuary as a parable and as a
    shadow-type will illustrate and clarify the truth of the plan of salvation but
    also that those portions of Scripture dealing with the plan may be used to
    illuminate our understanding of the parable-type.


n       The gospel is the key. "The significance of the Jewish economy is not
    yet fully comprehended. Truths vast and profound are shadowed forth in
    its rites and symbols. The gospel is the key that unlocks its mysteries."—
    Christ's Object Lessons, p. 133.
    HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO ME?
      o Have I personally accepted the provisions of the "everlasting
        gospel" still being offered?
      o How can my relationship to the living Christ as my High Priest before
        the Father enable me to meet the daily challenges of life?
      o How can I use the sanctuary message to lead others to Christ?
    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "What Is the
    Sanctuary,"—The Great Controversy, pp. 409-422.
    SUMMARY: There is one God, one rebellion in the universe, and only
    one plan of salvation for sinful human beings: faith in the Saviour whom
    God has provided. Sacrificial types foreshadowed this truth to the peoples
    who lived before Christ's first advent. Now we can look back upon the ac-
    tual realities of the Saviour's incarnation, atoning death, resurrection, and
    by faith observe His present priestly ministration in the heavenly
    sanctuary.

Cleansing From the
Leprosy of Sin
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus chapters 13 and 14.
7703 MEMORY TEXT: "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the
 PiN   light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
       Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).
CHRIST HEALS AND CLEANSES. In Scripture leprosy is used as a
symbol of sin. Pervasive and corrosive, its "issues" display the working
out of poisonous principles. The cleansing ceremony focused on Christ's
ministry of healing and resulted in the restoration of lepers to full fellow-
ship with God and man. Only the grace of Christ can cleanse us from the
inner contamination of sin.

CHRIST MEETS HUMAN NEED. Modern secular society dismisses sin
as an outdated notion, attributing the human predicament to other causes.
The Scriptures employ a variety of models to underscore the seriousness of
human sin and the helplessness of the sinner on his own to escape from its
grip.
   The Bible perceives sin as a defilement or contamination, an in-
ward, penetrating stain and corruption. Salvation comes through
cleansing. The evidence for the presence of this model in Leviticus is seen
in the fact that Moses uses the word for "unclean/defile" (tame') and its
related forms more than 140 times and its antonym "clean/pure" (taher)
more than 70 times. Furthermore, the Levitical system proposes the
process by which the cleansing may take place and the defilement be
removed: through water and blood.
   Like sin, leprosy works from within, silently, insidiously, benumbing
the senses, invading the life forces, and eventually poisoning the body's
vital currents.
    This week we will consider the defilement caused by leprosy, and
                                                                           15
analyze the story of four Biblical lepers. Then we will study the elements
required for the cleansing rite, and by the Spirit's aid, seek to read the mes-
sage they teach.
    The focus of the ritual cleansing is Jesus. He is the Sacrifice, the
Fount of Cleansing, and the intervening Priest, meeting the desperate needs
of human beings. Because He took our leprosy (sin) upon Him, He is able
to sympathize with the most degraded and to cleanse and restore them to
fellowship with His Father.
I. DEFILED BY SIN.
   Because leprosy is typical of what humanity is by nature, the ritual
cleansing deals especially with what is in man, and not merely with what
he has done outwardly.
1. What brought hope to the person who was terrified that he might
   have leprosy? Lev. 13:6, 23, 28, 34.


   The purpose of the plan of salvation has always been first to contain,
and then to destroy sin.

   "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of sin in
which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them.
`Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.' The carnal
mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be.' Job 14:4. Romans 8:7. Education, culture, the exercise of
the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are
powerless. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they
cannot change the heart; they cannot purify the springs of life. There must
be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be
changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can
quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holi-
ness."—Steps to Christ, p. 18.
2. In the Levitical system it was important for the believing Israelite
   to be cleansed from all defilement. How serious was the Lord about
   this matter? Why? Lev. 15:31-35.



   Purification from ritual uncleanness required the same offering as that
previously prescribed for sin. Sin offerings and burnt offerings were of-
fered for both sin and the more serious kinds of uncleanness. This suggests
that ritual defilements served to underscore the seriousness of moral sin
and the vileness resulting from sin's contamination.
   Like the leper the sinner is diseased and doomed to a solitary death.
Leprosy for the ancient was somewhat like AIDS for the modern.
16
E9   3. If a person was diagnosed as afflicted with leprosy, how was his
         contagion prevented from spreading to other people? How did
         Aaron in terror express his horror of this dread condition? Lev.
         13:45, 46; Num. 12:9-12.


         "Of all diseases known in the East the leprosy was most dreaded.
     Its incurable and contagious character, and its horrible effect upon its vic-
     tims, filled the bravest with fear. Among the Jews it was regarded as a
     judgment on account of sin, and hence was called 'the stroke,' the finger
     of God.' Deep-rooted, ineradicable, deadly, it was looked upon as a sym-
     bol of sin. By the ritual law, the leper was pronounced unclean. Like one
     already dead, he was shut out from the habitations of men. Whatever he
     touched was unclean. The air was polluted by his breath. One who was
     suspected of having the disease must present himself to the priests, who
     were to examine and decide his case. If pronounced a leper, he was iso-
     lated from his family, cut off from the congregation of Israel, and was
     doomed to associate with those only who were similarly afflicted. The law
     was inflexible in its requirement. Even kings and rulers were not exempt.
     A monarch who was attacked by this terrible disease must yield up the
     scepter, and flee from society.
         "Away from his friends and his kindred, the leper must bear the curse
     of his malady. He was obliged to publish his own calamity, to rend his gar-
     ments, and sound the alarm, warning all to flee from his contaminating
     presence. The cry, 'Unclean! unclean!' coming in mournful tones from the
     lonely exile, was a signal heard with fear and abhorrence."—The Desire of
     Ages, p. 262.
     4. Review the context of each of the following stories, then describe
        the "leprous" qualities of each person that led to his or her being
        "stricken." What meanings do these experiences have for us
        today?
        • Moses: Ex. 4:1-7

        • Miriam: Num. 12:1-6, 9, 10
        • Gehazi: 2 Kings 5:20-27
        • Uzziah: 2 Chron. 26:15-21
        The Hebrews believed that leprosy was the result of a "stroke" from
     heaven. (See Lev. 14:34, where God is spoken of as "putting" leprosy on
     a house.) A leper was "smitten of God" (Isa. 53:4). Because of this pre-
     diction by Isaiah the Jews believed that the Messiah was to be "the leper
     of the house of Judah," who shared man's condition. The Messiah would
     take on human corruption as the divine Substitute.

                                                                               17
5. What meaning for us can you see in the Biblical description of the
   leprous symptoms covering deeper corruption?
   o Lev. 13:21, 30
   o Num. 12:10, 11
   o Hosea 7:1, 2, 9-13
6. After Christ had cleansed the lepers, what did He order them to
   do? Why? Luke 5:13, 14; 17:11-14; Matt. 8:4.


   In His instructions the Saviour not only established that Moses wrote
the Levitical regulations but also showed His compliance with the legisla-
tion He had given to Israel almost fifteen centuries earlier. A further pur-
pose was His attempt to teach the priests that the Messiah had indeed
come.
   My prayer: "Father fill me with a sense of Thy perfection. Give me a
sense of how terrible sin is in Thy sight. Reveal to me Thy love and give
me Thy cleansing grace."
H. THE DEFILEMENT CLEANSED.
   The contamination was removed figuratively by three different agen-
cies: water, blood, or fire. All three pointed forward to the cleansing grace
of God provided in the Messiah to come.
7. What experience did Isaiah have in vision? What effect did it have
   on him? What would reference to his lips imply? How was he
   cleansed of his defilement? Isa. 6:1-7; compare Matt. 12:34.


   Christ's unsurpassed perfection accents our sinful defilement.
"While he [Isaiah] listened to the song of the angels, . . . the glory, the in-
finite power and the unsurpassed majesty of the Lord passed before his vi-
sion, and was impressed upon his soul. In the light of this matchless radi-
ance that made manifest all he could bear in the revelation of the divine
character, his own inward defilement stood out before him with startling
clearness. His very words seemed vile to him. . . .
   "As humanity, with its weakness and deformity, was brought out in
contrast with the perfection of divine holiness and light and glory, he felt
altogether inefficient and unworthy."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1140.
   "So will it be with all who behold Christ. The nearer we come to
Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the purity of His character, the more
18
      clearly shall we see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the less shall we
      feel like exalting ourselves. There will be . . . a continual, earnest, heart-
      breaking confession of sin and humbling of the heart before Him. At every
      advance step in our Christian experience our repentance will deepen. We
      shall know that our sufficiency is in Christ alone and shall make the apos-
      tle's confession our own: 'I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth
      no good thing.' God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
      Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
      world.' Romans 7:18; Galatians 6:14."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 561.
       8. What important truths are revealed by the priest's examination
          of the suspected leper and his decision in the case? Scan
          Leviticus chapters 13 and 14 for the answer. Then compare these
          passages with John 5:22; 1 Peter 4:5.


         No fewer than 36 times Moses mentioned that only the priest might
      make the examination and pronounce the decision. Jesus is our Priest—the
      only One to whom the Father has committed "all judgment" (John 5:22;
      Acts 17:31). The Levitical rule foreshadowed our Lord's teaching, "Judge
      not, that ye be not judged" (Matt. 7:1, 2). No one has been authorized to
      judge those whose lives show symptoms of "leprosy."

a61    9. Because cleansed lepers could not come to the sanctuary, what
          did the law require the priest to do? Lev. 14:2, 3.


      10. How does the Levitical law illustrate the ministry of the Good
          Shepherd? Luke 15:1-7; 19:10.


      11. What items did God require the leper to provide at the time he
          requested restoration? What did these items typify? Lev. 14:4, 5,
          10; compare Matt. 10:29-31; Psalm 51:7; John 1:29, 36.


      12. What did the priest's act in "going out of the camp" with the
          leper teach us about our High Priest? Lev. 14:3; compare Lev.
          16:27; Heb. 13:11, 12.


      13. What do you think is illustrated by the way in which the priest
          killed the sparrow, and then squeezed its blood into the water?
          Lev. 14:7.
                                                                                 19
    Jesus was the victim. "The wonderful symbol of the living bird dipped
in the blood of the bird slain and then set free to its joyous life, is to us the
symbol of the atonement. There were death and life blended, presenting to
the searcher for the truth the hidden treasure, the union of the pardoning
blood with the resurrection and life of our Redeemer. The bird slain was
over living water, that flowing stream was a symbol of the ever flowing,
ever cleansing efficacy of the blood of Christ, the Lamb slain from the
foundation of the world, the fountain that was open for Judah and
Jerusalem, wherein they may wash and be clean from every stain of sin.
We are to have free access to the atoning blood of Christ. This we must
regard as the most precious privilege, the greatest blessing, ever granted to
sinful man. And how little is made of this great gift! How deep, how wide
and continuous is this stream! To every soul thirsting after holiness there is
repose, there is rest, there is the quickening influence of the Holy Spirit,
and then the holy, happy, peaceful walk and precious communion with
Christ. Then, oh, then, can we intelligently say with John, 'Behold the
Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world' "—Ellen G. White
comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1111.
14. Ultimately, what alone can cleanse us sinners from the contamina-
    tion of sin? In reaching out to accept Jesus Christ as our Saviour
    and Lord we find a fundamental action taking place in our inner
    selves. What is this? 2 Cor. 5:17.


   Transformation requires re-creation. "To transform a lost sinner into
a 'new creature' requires the same creative energy that originally brought
forth life . . . . It is a supernatural operation, altogether foreign to normal
human experience.
   "This new nature is not the product of moral virtue presumed by some
to be inherent in man, and requiring only growth and expression. There are
thousands of so-called moral men who make no profession of being Chris-
tians, and who are not 'new' creatures. The new nature is not merely the
product of a desire, or even of a resolution, to do right (Rom. 7:15-18), of
mental assent to certain doctrines, of an exchange of one set of opinions or
feelings for another, or even of sorrow from sin. It is the result of the
presence of a supernatural element introduced into a man, which results in
his dying to sin and being born again. Thus are we created anew in the
likeness of Christ, adopted as sons and daughters of God, and set on a new
path."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 868, 869.
   There is no experience written in the Old Testament of a healed leper
participating in the cleansing rites of the Levitical system. The Gospels
portray Christ's compassion on such persons. He was careful to uphold the
Mosaic instructions (after healing them) by sending them off to the priests
to begin the process of re-entering society. (See Matt. 8:1-4.)
   When the sinner sees the perfect character of God, he sees also the
defilement which sin has brought upon him. He must turn to see Jesus, in
His perfection, seeking to cleanse and make whole the willing heart.

HAS MY LEPROSY BEEN CLEANSED?
  • How does understanding my sinful condition as an inward con-
    tamination help me to sense its seriousness and my great need?
  • Why is it not necessary to have ritual cleansings today?
  • Have I experienced Christ's cleansing?
  • How can I share this message of cleansing with others?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read, "The Sinner's Need
of Christ," Steps to Christ, pp. 17-22; "Thou Canst Make Me Clean,"
chapter 27, The Desire of Ages, pp. 262-271.
   "Many are leaning upon a supposed hope without a true foundation.
The fountain is not cleansed, therefore the streams proceeding from that
fountain are not pure. Cleanse the fountain, and the streams will be pure. If
the heart is right, your words, your dress, your acts, will all be right. True
godliness is lacking. . . . A Christian has victory over his besetments, over
his passions. There is a remedy for the sin-sick soul. That remedy is in
Jesus. Precious Saviour! His grace is sufficient for the weakest; and the
strongest must also have His grace or perish."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p.
158.
SUMMARY: In the book of Leviticus the nature of sin as it relates to us is
described as an inward contamination "or pollution. This model of the sin
problem helps us to sense more seriously our great need, for none of us can
bring something clean out of our unclean condition. The concept drives us
to Christ, whose blood alone can cleanse our defilement and who alone can
create a new heart and a new life from within.

Why Sacrifices and
Offerings?
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 1-3.
 T'ATS MEMORY TEXT: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
 PM     mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
        holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service"
        (Romans 12:1).
CHRIST IS OUR ALL. The burnt offerings, meal, and drink offerings,
were designed to teach that all we are and all we have came from Christ
and belong to Christ.

OFFERINGS POINT TO CHRIST'S ATONEMENT. The four great
offerings of Leviticus set forth Christ's sufferings. (See Psalm 40:6-8; Heb.
10:4-10.) They illustrate the way in which He atones for the sinner. Three
characteristics are basic to all sacrifices: (1) the designated offerer, (2) the
prescribed offerings, and (3) the officiating priest. The focus in each case
is on Jesus. As Offerer He displays His character to us as perfect Man. As
Offering He gives His life for us as perfect Substitute. As Priest He pleads
His victory on our behalf as perfect God.
    In this lesson we will study the burnt offering, the meal offering, and
the peace offering. Our next lesson will deal with the sin/trespass offering.
    Three elements in the Levitical system bring about purification:
blood, water, and fire. They are interdependent in their focus on Jesus.
    Blood is the best cleanser of sin'(Heb. 9:22), because "the life of the
flesh" is in it (Lev. 17:11). Because blood is the symbol of life laid down
in sacrifice it is most precious. Blood declares that everything has been ab-
22
solutely and finally surrendered. Blood symbolized Christ's sacrifice
which makes possible cleansing from sin.
   Water removes superficial defilement painlessly, and points to the
"fountain . . . for sin and for uncleanness" which flowed from the riven
heart of Christ (Zech. 13:1; John 19:34; 1 John 5:5, 6). Paul compares this
water to the inspired word applied to the heart by the regenerating Spirit
(Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5).
   No finer agent exists for destroying defilement than fire, another
symbol of the Holy Spirit. Through His fire Jesus purges away the dross
(Mal. 3:2, 3; Isa. 4:4). The altar fire, coming from God Himself (Lev.
9:24), represented the Lord's acceptance of what was worthy, as He did
Abel's offering at Eden, and Elijah's at Cannel. Fire, water, and blood ren-
der sanctuary offerings pleasing to God because they mirror the power of
Jesus.
I. THE WHOLE BURNT OFFERING—ALL I AM IS CHRIST'S
   (Lev. 1:1-17).
   Leviticus opens with a description of the whole burnt offering, which
probably was the most frequent of Israel's sacrifices. It was regularly
offered by Abel, Noah, Abraham, and the other patriarchs. It seems to have
been the only offering mentioned for the 2,500 years from the expulsion of
Adam and Eve from Eden to the time when God educated His people in
the science of salvation at Sinai. The exceptions are Abraham's covenant
sacrifice and Israel's annual offering of the paschal lamb. Most of the con-
cepts illustrated in the other sacrifices were present in the burnt offering.
   While focusing on the Saviour dying in his stead, the burnt offering
also represented the worshiper himself. Through its rites the worshiper
was alerted to the great truths of salvation. His guilt was placed on the vic-
tim, while its innocence was attributed to him.
   The ritual reminded the penitent that the law could not be altered, and
that the penalty for sin is death. The substitute animal's blood, both
"spilled" and"sprinkled," assured the offerer that guilt had been par-
doned and atonement made by the priest.

   The presentation to God of the whole burnt offering represented
complete consecration to God. To illustrate this the creature was entirely
consumed upon the altar. Through it the worshiper declared, "All I am is
Christ's."

   The Offerings. Both the burnt and peace offerings are described as
"sweet savour" offerings (Gen. 8:21), a term suggesting a satisfying or
fulfilling odor.

1. Study the following texts and comment on why sacrifices were a
   "sweet savour" to God. Lev. 1:9; Eze. 20:40, 41; 2 Cor. 2:15; Phil.
   4:18; Eph. 5:2.


                                                                           23
   God required His people to present "continual" or "daily" morning
and evening whole burnt offerings at His sanctuary to display their national
consecration to Him (Ex. 29:38-42). He also asked individuals to bring
their personal sacrifices whenever they chose.
2. Review the contexts surrounding the following stories. Then explain
   the reasons why you think these five persons offered burnt offer-
   ings:
   • Noah (Gen. 8:20-22)
   • Abraham (Gen. 22:1-14)
   o Job (Job 1:4, 5)
   o Job's friends (Job 42:7, 8)
   o Hezekiah (2 Chron. 29:27, 28)
   We need constant discipline. If left to ourselves we are prone to forget
God, and devote our time, resources, and energy to ourselves. The Lord
sought to help His faithful ones to overcome this tendency by participating
in daily burnt offerings before they set about their day's activities, and as
they closed each day. These sacrifices were twin arms embracing the life
of Israel. Those who lived at a distance from the tabernacle prayed toward
the sanctuary, as did Daniel in Babylon (Dan. 6:10).
   The Victim. The Lord specified six kinds of victims from which the
burnt offerings might be chosen (Lev. 1:3, 10, 14; 14:4).
3. Study the following texts; then suggest the characteristics of Christ
   that you feel each kind of offering illustrated for the worshiper:
   o Ox/bull (Prov. 14:4; Rev. 4:6, 7)
   • Sheep/lamb (Isa. 53:6, 7)
   • Goat/kid (Heb. 9:12, 13)
  • Turtle dove (Matt. 10:16)
  • Young pigeon (Luke 2:24)
  • Sparrow (Matt. 10:29)
   The Priest. While the victim represented both the sinner and the
Saviour, the priest represented Christ, serving, assisting and encouraging
the worshiper, and doing for Him what he could not do for himself. He
took the "spilled blood" of the sacrifice and converted it into the
"sprinkled blood" by ministering it in the sanctuary.
24
4. What did God teach by sending the sacred fire to consume the
   sacrifice on the altar? Lev. 9:24; Gen. 15:17.


  See also Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 359.

5. What do you think the priest aimed to achieve for the penitent
   through the burnt offering? Lev. 1:4.


  The burnt offering reminded Israel that all they were was because of
Christ and His sacrifice. Presentation of a burnt offering represented
complete consecration to God.
    Have you laid all on the altar? Have you surrendered every area of your
life to Christ?

H. MEAL AND DRINK OFFERINGS—ALL I HAVE IS CHRIST'S
   (Lev. 2:1-16).

   Meal and drink offerings expressed the worshiper's pledge, "All I
have is Christ's." The Hebrew minchah, rendered "meat offering," re-
flects the older meaning of "meat" as food generally. No flesh ever
formed part of the "meal offering." Modern translators use terms like
"cereal offering" instead. These vegetable offerings consisted of oats,
barley, wheat, spelt, goat-grass, and rice. Grape juice and olive oil might
be added. Frankincense also might be included. Salt was always added.
(See Lev. 2:13.)
   As a reminder of the worshiper's gratitude and willingness to serve
Christ, in Israel's ritual the priest took a part of each meal offering (min-
chah) and presented it to the Lord by lifting it up before the altar. Part of
this meal offering, which now belonged to God, the priest flung on the
altar to be consumed as a "sweet savour." The Lord accepted this token
"memorial" in lieu of the dedicated possessions of the offerer and re-
turned the remainder of the meal offering for the use of both the priests and
the worshiper.

6. Explain the significance of the meal offering, or minchah. Lev. 2:1-
   10.


7. Of what is oil a symbol? Lev. 2:1; Zech. 3:1-6; Matt. 25:4.


                                                                          25
         Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit. He gives fuel to the seven golden
      candlesticks (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1118), bestows grace
      (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 966), produces fruit (see Tes-
      timonies to Ministers, p. 511), illumines the five wise virgins (see Christ's
      Object Lessons, p. 408), and bestows Christ's righteousness upon His dis-
      ciples (see Testimonies to Ministers, p. 234).
      8. What did the salt added to the meal offering symbolize? Lev. 2:13;
         Mark 9:49, 50.



         "The saving salt" is "the righteousness of our Saviour" (The Desire of
      Ages, p. 439). It is a symbol of Divine grace (see Testimonies, vol. 3, p.
      559). It represents the influence of God's true people in their communities
      (Matt. 5:13). To be effective in preserving and flavoring, salt must pervade
      the substance into which it is put.

WED   9. Of what did the drink offering consist? Lev. 23:13, 18; Num. 28:7, 8.


         According to the Mishnah no other kinds of fruit juices were offered on
      the altar than olive and grape.
         The drink offering was never drunk! The grape-juice portion of the of-
      fering was poured upon the sacrifice already burning on the altar (Ex.
      29:40; Lev. 23:13, 18; Num. 15:5, 7,10, 24).
         As the blood represented the life, the very essence of being (Lev.
      17:11), grape juice represented the very essence of the fruit of the true
      Vine. It is the symbol of Christ's blood.

         The apostle Paul referred to the drink offering in his letter to his
      beloved Timothy. At his second trial before Nero, he had been sentenced
      to death. Sensing the executioner's sword pointing down his path, he wrote
      in effect, "I am already willingly allowing myself to be poured out as a
      drink offering" (2 Tim. 4:6). The Greek verb translated "offered" in the
      King James Version means "to offer drink offering." The form of the verb
      pictures Paul's voluntary share in this act.
      10. What do you think Paul meant by indicating that he was in the act
          of pouring out his life as a drink offering? 2 Tim. 4:6.


         Meal and drink offerings acknowledged Christ's gift of life through sal-
      vation and represented the worshiper's gratitude and willingness to serve
      God. What can we do today to testify of Christ's gifts?

        M. PEACE OFFERING—ALL MY JOY IS CHRIST'S (Lev. 3:1-17).
           Sin has caused alienation and rebellion, turmoil and war in the hearts of
        humans. This hostility is directed against God, our fellow beings and our
        environment. Rage reigns almost universally in the human heart. The plan
        of salvation is designed to restore harmony between this rebellious world
        and the divine government on the basis of the death of Christ.
           God planned the "sacrifice" of the peace offering to teach the wor-
        shiper how Calvary causes strife to cease. Of the four great offerings, the
        peace offering alone provided food for a banquet at which God, the in-
        visible Host, shared the "food of the offering" with the priest and the
        penitent. The Lord accepted His portion of the meal as it was vaporized
        and rose to heaven as "a sweet savour."
           Only the death of the innocent victim could provide this meal that
        bound all participants together in the new covenant. Christ's sacrifice of
        Himself thus lies at the foundation of true peace and lasting happiness.
           The technical expression "sacrifice of peace offering" frequently ab-
        breviated simply to "sacrifice," emphasizes that death is the basis for true
        peace in this world. It tells us that it was by dying that Jesus broke the
        power of Satanic hatred. He was able to provide His "flesh and blood" for
        our nourishment, and to draw the entire universe to Himself (John 12:32).

iT_HU   11. Three species of victims were permitted for peace offerings. Study
            the following texts, then write down the characteristics of Jesus
            each creature typified.
           • Lev. 3:1
           • Lev. 3:6
           • Lev. 3:12
        12. Outline the details of the ritual that the worshiper was to follow in
            presenting his peace offering. Lev. 3:1, 2, 6, 8, 12, 13; 7:28-30.


        13. Explain the meaning of the ceremony carried out with the blood
            before the sacrificial meal might be cooked and eaten. Lev. 3:2, 8,
            13; 7:14; 17:5, 6.


           The blood was given to God; therefore it must never be eaten (Lev.
        17:10-14). It was poured out at the altar after some had been sprinkled on it
        (Lev. 7:14).


                                                                                  27
       Spilled and sprinkled blood. It is important to keep in mind the dif-
    ference in emphasis between the "spilled blood" by the hand of the
    penitent, and the "sprinkled blood" by the finger of the priest. Ask your-
    self, Would the first-born in Egypt have survived if the lamb's blood had
    simply been "spilled"?
    14. After His death for us, what else that Jesus did is important for our
        salvation? 1 Cor. 15:12-18.
       Following His death, resurrection and ascension, Christ presented His
    "spilled blood" (death) to His Father in the heavenly sanctuary. It became
    the "sprinkled blood" (mediation) when He applied it as Priest to the
    needs of repentant sinners. (See Hebrews 9:11, 12.) Those two steps are
    vital before the redemptive transaction can be completed. The complex
    role of the "sprinkled blood" must never be put to one side.
    15. What were the three occasions for which the Lord recommended
        peace offerings? Lev. 7:12, 13; 22:21-25; 7:16, 18.


       Peace offerings were sacrifices presented on three occasions: (1) when
    the worshiper wished to praise God for His loving kindness and majesty,
    (2) when he felt gratitude for specific gifts and blessings that he and his
    family had enjoyed, and wished to say thank you to God, and (3) after he
    had carried out the provisions of a pledge or vow to abstain from some-
    thing, or to do something for the Lord. (See also Psalm 116:12-19.) The
    covenant meal, at which God, the priest, and the worshiper joined, united
    them in a bond of fellowship. The fact that an animal had been slain to
    provide this feast reminded all that the death of the Messiah, to whom the
    victim pointed, lay at the basis of all happiness.

E   WHAT CAN THESE OFFERINGS TEACH ME TODAY?
     • Have I consecrated all that I am and have to Christ?
     • Do I show my gratitude to God daily for His manifold blessings?
    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and
    Prophets, pp. 352-354, 576, 708; Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 394.
    SUMMARY: Burnt offerings, meal, drink offerings, and peace offerings
    were presented to God as an acknowledgement of His ownership of the in-
    dividual, his talents, and possessions, as well as an expression of gratitude
    for the fact that the death of the Messiah would bring total reconciliation
    between God and humanity. As he entered into these services the Israelite
    renewed his consecration to God.

Sacrifice for Sin
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 4-7

-§7•
  03   MEMORY TEXT: "But he was wounded for our transgressions,
PM
 N     he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace
       was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5).
CHRIST'S SACRIFICE FORETOLD AND REMEMBERED. Only
the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse the human heart from the deep, cor-
rupting stains of sin. In the ancient Israelite sanctuary services the offering
of animal sacrifices by private individuals enabled them to grasp more
fully the significance of the work to be performed by the coming Messiah.
As we look back the meaning of Christ's sacrifice and heavenly ministry is
clearer in the light of the ancient sanctuary sacrifices.

                        OVERVIEW: Leviticus 4-7

         4-5; 6:24-30                          6:1-7
       Sins of ignorance           Sins consciously committed

THE MEANING OF SACRIFICE. Our universe operates under two
great systems of law: physical law and moral law. Inanimate nature is con-
trolled by physical law, but the intelligent beings in God's creation are
subject to both. Moral law expresses the will of the Creator for both unfal-
len beings and humanity. It rests on the two-fold principle of supreme love
to the Creator and impartial love to fellow beings. God's moral law has
been adapted and codified for the human family in the form of the Ten
Commandments. The Ten Commandments, brief, comprehensive, and
authoritative, define the duty of humanity to the Creator and to one
another. (See Matt. 22:37-39; Rom. 13:8-10.)
    It was the violation of the principles undergirding the Ten Command-
ments that brought sin into the world. The result is the moral and spiritual
corruption of sinners, their progressive physical decline, and ultimate
death. (1 John 3:4; Rom. 5:12; 8:6-8).
    The sanctuary services emphasized three aspects of Christ's work
for us: sacrifice, mediation, and judgment. In general the three parts of
the sanctuary corresponded to these three kinds of ministry. Sacrifice oc-
 curred in the court, mediation in the holy place, and judgment in the Most
 Holy Place. The sacrifices and services of the sanctuary enabled God's
 people in every age to understand the steps He would take in carrying out
 the plan of salvation.
                                                                             29
   Each sacrifice reminded the offerers of the wages of sin and the gift
of eternal life through the coming Redeemer. Each sacrifice also
provided a visible medium through which the individual could worship
God, confess sin, and express dedication and gratitude. In a sense these
sacrifices were like prayers, fastening the worshipers' faith on the
Redeemer.
I. SINS OF IGNORANCE (Lev. 4; 5; 6:24-30).
    Sin originated in the heart of Satan. To give a reason for sin's existence
is to make it excusable and no longer sinful. We must accept its presence,
face its power by God's grace, and deal with it through His proven
provisions and methods.
    The sin offering was an acted parable illustrating aspects of the sacrifice
and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the details of its rituals He is
shown as the Offerer who presented the perfect sacrifice of Himself on the
sinner's behalf. As the Offering He died in the penitent's place. As the
Priest He mediates His blood in the sanctuary. In each role He works for
the salvation of the lost, as well as for the fmal eradication of sin. The sin
offering reveals Calvary as God's appeal to a lost world to receive Jesus as
Substitute and Sacrifice, Redeemer and Mediator.
1. What four classes of sinners are listed? What kind of sin-offering
   was to be brought by each?
                           SINNER                      SIN-011-.ERING

     Lev. 4:3

                                              5:11
2. Why did God require different kinds of sin-offerings for different
    classes of people? What relationship do you see between influence
    and accountability?
    Influence for good or evil. "By revealing in our own life the character
of Christ we co-operate with Him in the work of saving souls. It is only by
revealing in our life His character that we can co-operate with Him. And
the wider the sphere of our influence, the more good we may do. . . . But
never should it be forgotten that influence is no less a power for evil. To
lose one's own soul is a terrible thing; but to cause the loss of other souls is
still more terrible."—Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 340.
    "The more intelligent a man becomes, the more should religious in-
fluence be radiating from him. .. . Those who have had great light and pre-
cious opportunities are accountable to God, who has given to every man
his work. They are never to betray the sacred trust, but are to be indeed the
light of the world."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 245.

3. What is a "sin of ignorance"? Lev. 4:1, 13, 14, 22, 23, 27, 28; 5:3.


   We are not always immediately aware that a specific act of thought,
word, or deed is sin. Some time after committing the sin, we are convicted
by the Holy Spirit that what we have done is wrong. When we receive such
light and conviction we are held accountable for our past act and, if truly
dedicated to Christ, we ask Him to forgive us.
4. How did Jesus demonstrate that sin is not counted against people
   until they are made aware that their behavior was wrong in God's
   sight? John 15:22, 24.


5. What examples of this kind of failure are common today among
   Christians?
   • Psalm 19:12, 13
   • Psalm 139:23, 24
   • Acts 17:29, 30
    Sins of ignorance are unintentional sins, shortcomings, and mistakes
that stem from our defective, sin-bent human nature and dull perceptions.
The apostle Paul spoke to the Athenians about their practice of idolatry as
"the times of this ignorance" (Acts 17:30)—ignorant sinning before con-
version—but that now God called for people everywhere to repent. Grace
tells the Christian that there is no need to sin, but the stumbling Christian
is assured that genuine repentance will lead to forgiveness and restoration.
As our knowledge of God's will for us expands, we will recognize our
need for greater conformity to the divine will.
   Hope for the stumbling saint. "There are those who have known the
pardoning love of Christ and who really desire to be children of God, yet
they realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty, and they are
ready to doubt whether their hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit.
To such I would say, Do not draw back in despair. We shall often have to
bow down and weep at the feet of Jesus because of our shortcomings and
mistakes, but we are not to be discouraged. Even if we are overcome by
the enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God. No;
Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."—
Steps to Christ, p. 64.
6. From clues furnished in the following texts, formulate a composite
   Biblical definition of sin: 1 John 3:4; 5:17; Rom. 3:23; 14:23;
   James 4:17.

                                                                            31
         7. Why is death the inevitable result of sin? Rom. 6:23.


         8. In the sanctuary service, what two acts were performed by the
            confessing sinner? Lev. 4:4, 15, 24, 29.


         9. When a more serious sin of ignorance had been committed, what
            additional act was to be performed by the penitent? Lev. 5:14-16:
            Num. 5:7, 8.


           Guilt or trespass offerings atoned for more serious sins committed in-
        advertently, or unintentionally, as well as for certain sins consciously com-
        mitted. In such cases, the penitent sinner was to bring a rain as His sin
        offering. The procedure for offering the guilt or trespass offering was the
        same as for the sin offering. (See Lev. 7:7.) As far as the penitent sinner
        was concerned, the new element in the guilt or trespass offering was God's
        requirement that he make restitution for the wrong committed.

TAO E   10. In what way did Jesus express His endorsement of the principle
            of restitution for wrongs done? Matt. 5:21-24; compare Luke
            19:8.


           "True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges
        particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God
        only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who
        have suffered injury through them; or they may be of a public character,
        and should then be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be de-
        finite and to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which we are
        guilty."—Steps to Christ, p. 38.
           Without the ministry of the priest, sinners' needs could not be met
        in the sanctuary. The priest's duties were of supreme importance to them,
        pointing forward to Christ's role in the plan of salvation. Remove His high
        priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, and the cases of all would be
        hopeless. (See 1 John 2:1, 2; Heb. 7:25; 8:1-3; 9:24.)
        11. What rituals did the priests perform that are significant in the
            light of Christ's future mediatorial ministry?
             • Lev. 4:5, 6; Heb. 9:12
             • Lev. 4:6, 7, 30; Heb. 9:11, 12

   • Lev. 4:11, 12, 21; Heb. 13:11-13
   Priest transfers sin to the sanctuary: After the penitent sinner had taken
the life of the sin offering, the priest performed one of two kinds of minis-
try:
   (a) In the case of the sin offering for a fellow priest, or for the whole
congregation, the officiating priest sprinkled some of the blood seven
times before the veil in the holy place as well as on the horns of the altar
of incense.
   (b) In the case of the sin offering for the ruler or the common person,
the officiating priest sprinkled the blood on the horns of the altar of burnt
offering in the court. He then ate some of the flesh of the sin offering in the
court of the sanctuary (Lev. 6:26). By eating the flesh, the priest became
the sin-bearer (Lev. 10:17). Bearing the sin of the penitent, the priest min-
istered daily in the holy place, offering incense before the Lord (Ex. 30:7,
8). Thus the penitent's sin was borne by the priest into the holy place and
symbolically transferred to the sanctuary.
    "In some cases the blood was not taken into the holy place; but the
flesh was then to be eaten by the priest, as Moses directed the sons of
Aaron, saying, 'God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congrega-
tion.' Leviticus 10:17. Both ceremonies alike symbolized the transfer of
the sin from the penitent to the sanctuary."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp.
354, 355.
    Confession, sacrifice, atonement. By means of the sacrifice and sprin-
kling of the blood of the sin offering the penitent sinner was forgiven. Four
times in Leviticus 4 it is emphasized that "atonement" made by the offi-
ciating priest provided forgiveness (Lev. 4:20, 26, 31, 35). There could
have been no priestly atonement without the sacrifice, and there could
have been no forgiveness without priestly atonement. "Atonement," or
cleansing from sin became a reality for the penitent because of his confes-
sion, the sacrifice of the animal, and the priest's sprinkling of the blood.
    In the antitype to which the sanctuary services pointed, Christ's sacri-
fice, the sinner's confession, and Christ's heavenly mediation all are essen-
tial to forgiveness of sin. (See 1 John 1:9; Heb. 4:14-16; 6:19, 20; 7:23-28;
8:1-6; 10:19-23; The Great Controversy, p. 489.)
    Symbolically, the pardon for the penitent's sin was recorded in the
sanctuary. The pardoned sins awaited the services of the Day of Atone-
ment for their removal from the sanctuary.
   Ask yourself: How does the sanctuary service illuminate my under-
standing of Christ's sacrifice for me?
                                                                            33
11. SINS CONSCIOUSLY COMMITTED (Lev. 6:1-7).
   There were no sacrifices for sins that were committed in a spirit of
rebellion against God. (See Deut. 17:2-6; Num. 35:30; Ex. 31:15; Num.
15:30-36; Heb. 10:26-31.) But consciously committed sin that was not
committed in a spirit of deliberate rebellion against God's will could be
atoned for.
   Leviticus 6 discusses such deliberate sins as perjury, robbery, and fraud
(vs. 2-7). The repentant sinner was instructed to bring a ram for a trespass,
or guilt offering (verse 6). Trespass, or guilt, offerings atoned for more se-
rious sins committed unintentionally (Lev. 5:14, 15) as well as for certain
sins consciously committed. (Compare Lev. 6:1-7; 19:20-22; Ezra 10:19.)
12. What new principle is now given? Lev. 6:4, 5; compare Eze.
    33:15.


13. What was the penitent to do if the defrauded person was dead
    and none of his kinsmen could be found? Num. 5:5-8.


    The trespass or guilt offering taught the Israelite the principle of resti-
tution. He or she was to be willing and was to attempt to make amends
with persons who had been injured. Repentance and confession of sin to
God leads to confession and restitution to fellow human beings we have
wronged. The Christian will do everything possible to rectify past mistakes
if it is possible to do so.
    Righting a wrong. "This will in most cases include restitution, paying
back that which we have stolen, and making every effort to right wrongs.
Trespasses include questionable business transactions, fraudulent repre-
sentation of values, giving wrong impressions for selfish motives,
downright crookedness. It includes sharp deals to the disadvantage of the
poor, and the grinding down of the needy for profit. It includes exorbitant
charges of all kinds, excessive interest on money loans, dishonest work for
the wages received. It includes taking advantage of the misfortunes of
others, and demanding more than is just for services rendered merely be-
cause the other person is in a position where he cannot help himself."—
M. L. Andreasen, The Sanctuary Service, second ed. (Washington, D. C.:
Review and Herald Pulishing Association, 1947), pp. 167, 168.
14. Compare the procedure for offering trespass or guilt offerings
    with the procedure for offering sin offerings. Lev. 7:1-7.


   The offering of sin and trespass offerings in the ancient sanctuary
symbolized the means provided by Christ for the forgiveness of our
34
 Sacrifice Ga? 0"i)                                         4Mirftiiv
sins. Christ was made "to be sin for us," so that "we might be made the
righteousness of God in him" (2 Cor. 5:21; compare Isa. 53:6; 1 Pet. 2:24;
2 Cor. 9:15). Because of Christ's sacrifice, we can come confidently to the
throne of grace for forgiveness and spiritual power. (See 1 John 1:9; Heb.
10:22.) As our heavenly High Priest, Jesus provides the antitype of the
sprinkling of blood by the priest and the bearing of the penitent's sin into
the holy place. (Heb. 9:11-14, 24; 1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 2:1.) Christ's sacri-
fice, our confession, and His High Priestly mediation provide forgiveness
for our sins. Our guilt is removed from us. (See Rom. 8:1; Micah 7:19;
1 John 2:2; 4:10; John 3:18; 5:24.) Jesus bore our guilt on Calvary and, be-
cause we have accepted Him as our sin offering, we are free from all con-
demnation.
   The record of our pardoned sin remains in the sanctuary above to
be finally removed in the pre-Advent judgment, the antitypical Day of
Atonement. (See Dan. 7:10; 12:1; Rev. 3:5; 19:7, 8.) The record of pre-
viously forgiven sin was removed from the sanctuary on the Day of Atone-
ment. Just so, previously forgiven people are finally, eternally, vindicated
in the pre-Advent judgment. Preparation to meet our returning Lord in-
volves a daily relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, our sin offering and
High Priest. As we daily turn to Him for forgiveness and, by His grace, re-
move ourselves ever further from sin we are spiritually purified and made
ready for the events of the final judgment.
APPLYING LEVITICUS TO MY LIFE:
  • Is my conscience "void of offence toward God, and toward men"
    (Acts 24:16)? Is the Holy Spirit prompting me to make amends with
    others where I can?
  • Should I ever worry as to whether my forgiven sins are hanging
    over me in condemnation? Why?
  • Am I specific enough in my confession when I ask my Saviour to
    forgive my sins?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapters on "Re-
pentance" and "Confession" in Steps to Christ, pp. 23-41.

SUMMARY: The sin and trespass offerings provided an innocent victim's
life as ransom for a person's sin. Either through the "sprinkled blood" in
the sanctuary, or in the person of the priest the sinner's guilt was trans-
ferred to the sanctuary to await disposal in God's good time and way. As
soon as the penitents repented, confessed their sins, and accepted the sub-
stitute's death, they were free to live happily to the glory of their merciful
God.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 8, 21, 22.

75773' MEMORY TEXT: "Now of the things which we have spoken
    NA I this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the
LF J.1
      right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a mini-
      ster of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
      pitched, and not man" (Hebrews 8:1-2).
AN ADVOCATE FOR ME. To help fallen humanity to understand God's
love, and to reconcile the sinner to his Judge, Heaven called a man to serve
as priest. He was endued with grace to represent the great High Priest and
Mediator who by His sinless life and atoning death reconciled the world to
God. Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary makes it possible for us to
come to God for salvation.

                     OVERVIEW: Priestly Ministry
  1 Tim. 2:5                Lev. 8, 9, 21, 22      Heb. 8:1-5;
                                                     9:1-7
  Priestly mediation        Consecration for       Christ's priesthood
                            priestly service

A BRIDGE TO GOD. The Israelite sanctuary worship flowered out of
patriarchal worship. With the establishment of a central sanctuary, the
priestly function of the father was expanded to include the institution of an
official priesthood. New insights into the plan of redemption were to be
portrayed in symbol and rite.
   In the religion of both patriarch and Israelite the shedding of blood
"spoke" of expiation and forgiveness. But another aspect of the process of
reconciliation was accentuated in the office of priest—the need for media-
tion between God and man.
   The need for a priesthood underscores the seriousness of sin, the
sharp cleavage it has made between heaven and humanity, and the ugliness
of the estrangement between the creature and the Creator. How can a holy
God who "dwells in unapproachable light," (1 Tim. 6:16, RSV) be ap-
proached by sinners?
   In the sanctuary system the chasm that separates God and man was
bridged symbolically by the priesthood, composed of persons certified
by God to mediate between Him and the people. As "my priesthood" (Ex.
                                                                           37
      28:3, RSV), they represented Him to the people. Because they were chosen
      "from among the people" (Ex. 28:1, RSV), they also represented the na-
      tion to God. Through the ministries of the priests Israel could approach the
      holy God in penitence, praise, and worship, confidently expecting His full
      acceptance. The office and ministry of the Israelite priests foreshadowed
      the priesthood of Christ and His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.

SUN   I. PRIESTLY MEDIATION (1 Tim. 2:5, 6).
      1. Who is a mediator? What qualifications would be needed for this
         task? Who is the estranged party? Why is only one mediator ap-
         pointed? Who is He? In what major way does a priestly mediator
         differ from secular mediators? 1 Tim. 2:5, 6.


          A dictionary definition of the verb to mediate gives the following idea:
      "to interpose between parties as the equal friend of each, especially to ef-
      fect a reconciliation." A mediator works between estranged parties. In the
      sin situation in which life on our planet functions, through no fault of
      God's, man is estranged from Him.
          Secular mediators usually are able to bring about reconciliation by per-
      suading the estranged persons to yield somewhat on this or that point until
      both can reach an agreement. But priestly mediation between God and
      humanity is different. The barrier between heaven and earth is the rebellion
      of sin, a situation that a holy God and a sinner cannot negotiate. A priestly
      mediator could remove the sin barrier symbolically through the min-
      istration of sacrificial blood. Thus the Levitical priest foreshadowed the
      priestly ministry of Christ, who offers the merits of His own sinless life
      and atoning death to remove the sin barrier as He intercedes on behalf of
      all penitent sinners who desire to be reconciled to God.
         "Since the sin of our first parents there has been no direct com-
      munication between God and man. The Father has given the world into
      the hands of Christ, that through His mediatorial work He may redeem
      man and vindicate the authority and holiness of the law of God. All the
      communion between heaven and the fallen race has been through
      Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 366.
      2. For what basic reasons do the Godhead and the human family need
         a mediator between them?
           o Man's condition: Rom. 5:6-10
           o God's condition: 1 Tim. 6:16; Psalm 71:19
           o Man's need: Heb. 7:25; 1 John 2:1
        Love awakened love. "The earth was dark through misapprehension of
      God. That the gloomy shadows might be lightened, that the world might be
      38
 brought back to God, Satan's deceptive power was to be broken. This
 could not be done by force. The exercise of force is contrary to the prin-
 ciples of God's government; He desires only the service of love; and love
,cannot be commanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by
 love is love awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be
 manifested in contrast to the character of Satan. This work only one Being
 in all the universe could do. Only He who knew the height and depth of the
 love of God could make it known. Upon the world's dark night the Sun of
 Righteousness must rise, 'with healing in His wings.' Mal. 4:2."—The
 Desire of Ages, p. 22.
       In Christ God has provided a bridge to salvation. Only through the
    perfect love, perfect character of Christ may we approach the Father. Have
    I contemplated Christ's deep love to provide me with such a bridge to sal-
    vation?

n   H. CONSECRATION FOR PRIESTLY SERVICE (Lev. 8, 9, 21, 22).
        The book of Leviticus discusses priestly ministration of the sacrifices. It
    provides legislation dealing with the fitness of the priest for holy office
    and the consecration of Aaron and his sons to this ministry. We will look
    first at the physical- and spiritual-fitness requirements, and what they mean
    to us today.
    3. Why would God require that a high priest or one of his assistant
       priests be physically fit and without any blemish? Lev. 21:17-23.


    4. To what degree should such restrictions be applied today to those
       desiring to enter the gospel ministry?


       In the book of Leviticus the concepts of "holiness" and
    "wholeness" are linked closely. Any physical blemish or incompleteness
    in his physical makeup would mar the holiness of the priest who ap-
    proached God. Such a person would be an offense to Him. We must keep
    in mind that the entire sanctuary system is a parable-ritual that symbolizes
    the plan of salvation in general and the person and work of the Saviour in
    particular. Consequently both the sacrifices and the priesthood must be
    without blemish in order to portray the perfections and moral excellencies
    of the coming Saviour.
       While the Christian minister does not function in a ritual/symbolic role
    as did the priest, his physical wholeness, strength, appearance, and well-
    being do impact on his suitability for the public ministry.
    5. God intended that His "royal priests" were to be holy because He
       is holy (Lev. 21:8). What standards had to be reached in these areas
       of the priest's life?
                                                                         39
             o Character, Lev. 11:44, 45;
             o His wife, Lev. 21:7, 13-15
             o His children, Lev. 22:12, 13; Deut. 6:6, 7
             o His diet, Lev. 11:1-8
             o His home location, Num. 18:20; Josh. 21:1-3
             o His morals, Lev. 21:4-7
             o His remuneration, Num. 18:21-24
             o His habits, Mal. 2:1-9
             o His body, Lev. 21:17-23; 22:4, 5

TAO E   6. List the steps in the consecration to Israel's priesthood. What
           bearing do they have on Christ's call and ours? Lev. 8:143.




        7. Contrast the conditions of this divine call to priestly service with
           the campaign for office waged by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
           Numbers 16:1, 3, 17, 18.


        8. After Aaron and his four sons were washed and clothed in their
           special priestly garments, how did Moses employ the blood of the
           ram of consecration and the holy oil? What did this unusual pro-
           cedure signify? Lev. 8:22-24, 30; compare Ex. 29:19-21.


           After the seven days allotted for Aaron's consecration and that of his
        sons (Lev. 8:33), he offered sin offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offer-
        ings in behalf of the priests and the people (Lev. 9:1-21).
        9. At that point what did Aaron do? What is the message of the
           Aaronic blessing? Lev. 9:22; Num. 6:23-27.


        40
      10. What divine act took place at that moment? What was its sig-
          nificance? Lev. 9:24.


         The fire that came from the Lord consumed the burning sacrifices, con-
      secrated the sanctuary, and placed the divine acceptance on the whole.
         Reflect. What do God's requirements for the priesthood tell me about
      sin? Christ's mission? My relation to God?

WED   M. CHRIST'S PRIESTHOOD (Heb. 8:1-5; 9:1-7).
         The book of Hebrews discusses the old and new covenant arrange-
      ments, clearly stating that each has its own sanctuary (Heb. 8:1-9:1). The
      earthly sanctuary (the tabernacle and later temples) pertained to the first or
      Sinaitic covenant; the heavenly sanctuary pertains to the new covenant.
      11. According to the book of Hebrews what is the relationship be-
          tween the earthly sanctuary and the heavenly sanctuary? Heb.
          8:4, 5; 9:23, 24.


         In one sense the sanctuary in either dispensation may be defined as
      the dwelling place of God. The link between God's heavenly and earthly
      dwellings is affirmed by the book of Hebrews. The earthly sanctuary is
      described as "the copies of the heavenly things," and "a copy of the true
      one" (Heb. 9:23, 24, RSV). The relationship between the two is of copy to
      original, of shadow to substance. The priests on earth served "a copy and
      shadow of the heavenly sanctuary" (Heb. 8:5, RSV).
         Israel understood their sanctuary to be a counterpart of God's
      heavenly dwelling. (Compare 1 Kings 8:27, 30, 32.) John testifies that he
      saw "the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony" in heaven (Rev. 15:5).
      These statements of Scripture are not to be construed to mean that the
      heavenly sanctuary consists of a tent or is similar to some Phoenician
      temple. The language simply means that the earthly sanctuaries pointed to
      a heavenly reality—a reality far beyond man's ability to grasp. Of neces-
      sity, directions to build were given in architectural terms familiar to
      Moses.
          "The matchless splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected to
      human vision the glories of that heavenly temple where Christ our fore-
      runner ministers for us before the throne of God. The abiding place of the
      King of kings, where thousand thousands minister unto Him, and ten
      thousand times ten thousand stand before Him (Daniel 7:10); that temple,
      filled with the glory of the eternal throne, where seraphim, its shining
      guardians, veil their faces in adoration, could fmd, in the most magnificent
      structure ever reared by human hands, but a faint reflection of its vastness
                                                                                 41
         and glory. Yet important truths concerning the heavenly sanctuary and the
         great work there carried forward for man's redemption were taught by the
         earthly sanctuary and its services."—The Great Controversy, p. 414.

ITFIU_   12. What was the purpose of the sacrifices and priestly ministrations
             in the earthly sanctuary? Why is the earthly sanctuary and the
             Levitical law that governed it called a "shadow"? Heb. 8:4, 5;
             10:1; compare Heb. 8:1, 2.



            The Levitical law that governed the entire sacrificial system, involving
         both sacrifice and priestly ministrations, is described as a "shadow of good
         things to come." A "shadow" is like a prophecy. The earthly sanctuary
         with its services was intended to foreshadow the coming death of the Mes-
         siah and subsequent priestly ministration of His merits in behalf of repen-
         tant sinners. Thus this system of types and symbols foreshadowed and
         taught the great truths of the gospel or plan of salvation to those who lived
         before the first advent of Christ.
            "Christ was the foundation and life of the temple. Its services were
         typical of the sacrifice of the Son of God. The priesthood was established
         to represent the mediatorial character and work of Christ. The entire plan
         of sacrificial worship was a foreshadowing of the Saviour's death to
         redeem the world."—The Desire of Ages, p. 165.
         13. What earthly sanctuary services especially foreshadowed the kind
             of ministries Christ would carry out in reality in the heavenly
             sanctuary? Heb. 9:1-7.



             Our Lord's ministry in heaven can be known in general terms by
         examining the Israelite sanctuary that foreshadowed it (Heb. 8:4, 5).
         The Levitical priests engaged in two distinctive divisions of ministry—a
         daily and a yearly—each characterized by certain specific rituals. The
         daily service related to the holy place, whereas the yearly related to the
         Most Holy Place in particular. The daily ministry (earthly or heavenly)
         may be characterized as a ministry of forgiveness, reconciliation, and
         restoration; the yearly ministry (earthly or heavenly) may be seen as a min-
         istry of judgment and vindication. Because of these clear distinctions in the
         types, Seventh-day Adventists believe that Christ's priestly ministry in
         heaven is in two phases: the first beginning at His ascension; the second
         beginning in 1844 as indicated by the prophecies of Daniel 7-9 and
         Revelation 14:6, 7.
             As forgiveness was still available through priestly mediation on the Day
         of Atonement (Lev. 16), so Christ still mediates for sin after 1844. Such
         mediation will cease when the pre-advent judgment is concluded.

         42
14. Because He has given us insights from the Levitical priesthood
    and sanctuary, where would God have our faith center now? Heb.
    4:14-16; 8:1, 2.


THINK ABOUT IT:
  • How does an understanding of Christ's priestly ministry explain why
    He taught His followers to pray in His name?
  • As a part of the "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9) of believers, what
    can I do to consecrate my head, hands, and feet to God's service and
    glory?
  • As a member of His "royal priesthood" am I working with the great
    High Priest for the salvation of others?
  • Am I reluctant to share my problems, perplexities, and joys with God
    through the ministry of Jesus? Why? (See Phil. 4:6, 7.)
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "In the Holy of
Holies," The Great Controversy, chapter 24, pp. 423-432.
SUMMARY: It is important for Christians to understand the priestly
mediatorial role of Christ because it is as essential to our salvation as is the
cross. Both His atoning death and priestly ministry are parts in God's
saving process. Both aspects were foreshadowed by the consecrated Leviti-
cal priests and their ministrations.

The Final Judgment
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Lev. 16:1-34; 23:26-32. The yearly Day of
Atonement and its significance.

  3   MEMORY TEXT: "For we shall all stand before the judgment
W1    seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every
      knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So
      then every one of us shall give account of himself to God"
      (Romans 14:10-12).
THE VERDICT OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT IS VITAL TO YOUR
SALVATION. The final judgment, prefigured by the ritual of the Day of
Atonement, finally takes care of the sin problem. The judgment clears the
character of God from Satan's unjust charges and confirms the loyalty of
the unfallen universe. It also seals the truly penitent for eternal salvation
and passes a sentence of destruction upon Satan, his evil demons, and
those human beings who have followed him. Thus the final judgment re-
stores moral harmony to the universe.

THE DAY OF ATONEMENT PREFIGURED THE FINAL JUDG-
MENT. The Levitical sanctuary is defined by the Bible as a parable and as
a shadow-type. This unique parable or type emphasized three major truths
of the gospel: (1) the substitutionary, atoning death of Christ; (2) Christ's
priestly mediation; (3) the final judgment.
   The sanctuary rituals and symbols were intended to enable Israel to
understand the gospel (Heb. 4:1, 2). The plan of salvation—including the
judgment—is not being carried out to inform God. He knows all things.
The plan was laid, and is progressively unfolding, in order to bring the in-
habitants of the universe into agreement with God's view of sin and
righteousness. Heavenly beings as well as the human family are interested
in the issues involved. (See 1 Peter 1:10-12; Eph. 3:8-11.) At the end of
44
     time the redeemed of earth will join in singing, "Great and marvellous are
     thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
     saints" (Rev. 15:3).
        Leviticus chapters 16 and 23 direct our attention to the services of
     the Day of Atonement and their significance for Christians today.
     These services prefigured the fmal judgment. The daily services of the
     sanctuary involved the forgiveness and cleansing of the individual from
     sin. The yearly services involved the cleansing of the sanctuary as well as
     the fmal cleansing of the people.
        The Day of Atonement services looked beyond Calvary, although
     Calvary was their central focus. These services looked beyond the salva-
     tion of the individual to the final destruction of sin. The Day of Atone-
     ment included in its symbolism the final eradication from the universe of
     sin, sinners, Satan, and his demons. Thus the Day of Atonement
     foreshadowed the final judgment.
     I. THE DAY OF ATONEMENT IN TYPE (Lev. 16:1-34; 23:26-32).
El       The legislation dealing with the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16) lies be-
     tween the two literary halves of the book. This format underscores the im-
     portance of the yearly ritual in Israel's worship and its significance for us.
         The Day of Atonement is the center and climax of the book of
     Leviticus. "This is one way of saying by literary form that the subject of
     the Day of Atonement lies at the heart of the book of Leviticus. . . .
     Leviticus 16 is the thematic culmination and climax of the sacrificial sys-
     tem of the book. It is also the center and climax of its literary structure.
     These two factors fit together and lend a mutual emphasis to each
     other." William H. Shea, "Literary Form and Theological Function in
     Leviticus," The Seventy Weeks, Leviticus, and the Nature of Prophecy
     (Daniel and Revelation Committee Series, 1986), vol. 3, p. 151.
     1. What was the yearly service called? When did it take place? How
         were the people to spend this day? Lev. 23:27, 28, 32.



     2. What was involved in the expression, "Ye shall afflict your souls?"
        Lev. 23:27; 16:29; compare Isa. 58:3, 6; Acts 27:9.


        The Day of Atonement, commonly referred to today as Yom Kippur,
     was the most solemn religious day in the sanctuary worship. It was a fast
     day. Normal work was laid aside as God's people searched their hearts,
     confessed their sins, and humbled themselves before God.
     3. What was the purpose of this special Day of Atonement? Lev.
        16:15, 16, 20, 21, 30, 33.


                                                                                45
       The purification rites performed on the Day of Atonement were directed
    toward the cleansing of the sanctuary, as well as the spiritual cleansing of
    the people. The contamination of the sanctuary had come about through
    the transference to it of the confessed sins of penitents throughout the year.
       Pardoned record cleansed. "It is stated in Leviticus 16:16 that the
    Day of Atonement ritual was intended to cleanse the sanctuary 'because of
    the uncleannesses of the people of Israel,' and 'because of their transgres-
    sions.' Transgression and uncleanness are the two major areas treated in
    the first fifteen chapters of Leviticus. Transgressions are dealt with in
    Leviticus 1-7, and uncleannesses are treated in Leviticus 11-15.
       "The position of the Day of Atonement ritual as the capstone to these
    sections dealing with sacrifices for these concerns indicates a close
    relationship with them. This close relationship implies that the Day of
    Atonement served to cleanse the sanctuary of those transgressions and un-
    cleannesses that had been pardoned and transferred to it throughout the
    year by means of the rituals prescribed in Leviticus 1-15."—William H.
    Shea, "Literary Form and Theological Function in Leviticus," pp. 152,
    153.
4. Describe the Day of Atonement services involving the two goats
• presented by the congregation. What did the casting of lots deter-
    mine? Where did the high priest administer the blood of the Lord's
    goat? What was accomplished by this? What was placed on the
    scapegoat (Azazel)? Where was the scapegoat taken? Who do the
    two goats represent? Lev. 16:7-9, 15, 16, 18-22.


       The Lord and Satan. "As one goat is for the Lord, a personal Being
    [Lev. 16:8], so the other goat must also be for a personal being; and as they
    are evidently antithetical, the most consistent view would be that Azazel
    stands in opposition to the Lord, and hence can be no other than Satan."—
    SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 775.
       Sanctuary cleansed. During the year the confessed sins of repentant Is-
    raelites were transferred to the sanctuary. In a symbolic manner, the par-
    doned record of the sin was retained in the sanctuary, and the sinner was
    forgiven. The blood of his sin offering pointed the penitent sinner to the
    merits of the coming Redeemer. His guilt was removed and he could
    rejoice in God's mercy.
       The Day of Atonement services did not repeat this daily procedure. Its
    purpose was to illustrate another facet in the redemptive process. On this
    day the sanctuary was cleansed. Ultimate accountability for sin was placed
    upon the scapegoat (Azazel) which was banished from the camp. The ser-
    vice typified the final bringing of Satan, the originator of sin, to account.
    5. What happened to those Israelites who had not confessed their sins,
       had chosen to live sinful lives, and did not enter into a spirit of con-
       fession and contrition on the Day of Atonement? What was
    46
       provided for all the truly penitent in Israel, both priests and
       people? Lev. 16:30,33,34.


       The Day of Atonement focused on two kinds of Israelites, both of
    whom professed to be the covenant people of God. As the record of their
    pardoned sins was cleansed from the sanctuary, God gave faithful Is-
    raelites a great blessing. They were spiritually purified. But impenitent Is-
    raelites bore accountability for their own sins and were cut off from the
    congregation.
E9 6. In what condition was the sanctuary, the believing congregation,
        and the camp when the Day of Atonement rites were completed?
        Lev. 16:30,33,34.


       Final judgment foreshadowed. The Day of Atonement at the close of
    the religious year was the appointed time for the removal of sins that had
    been figuratively transferred from penitent sinners to the sanctuary through
    the blood or flesh of the daily sin offerings (Lev. 16:15-22). The sanctuary,
    the congregation, and the camp were made ritually clean. This service
    foreshadowed the final judgment. In God's plan of saving mankind, the
    final judgment will finally eradicate sin. The devil and all the results of his
    wickedness will be destroyed.
       The Day of Atonement foreshadowed the final application of the merits
    of Christ, resulting in sin's banishment and the reconciliation of the entire
    universe to the government of God. The final judgment completes God's
    eternal purpose, "that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might
    gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and
    which are on earth; even in him" (Eph. 1:10).
        Satan responsible for all sin. "Since Satan is the originator of sin, the
     direct instigator of all the sins that caused the death of the Son of God, jus-
     tice demands that Satan shall suffer the final punishment. Christ's work
     for the redemption of men and the purification of the universe from sin
     will be closed by the removal of sin from the heavenly sanctuary and the
     placing of these sins upon Satan, who will bear the final penalty. So in the
     typical service, the yearly round of ministration closed with the purifica-
     tion of the sanctuary, and the confessing of the sins on the head of the
     scapegoat."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 358.
     11. THE INVESTIGATIVE PHASE OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT
         (Dan. 7-9,12).
        There are three phases to the final judgment. The prophecies of Daniel
     describe a pre-Advent, investigative phase of the final judgment. The
     prophecies of Revelation portray a review phase during the Millennium,
     and an executive phase at its close when God acts upon the verdict of the
                                                                            47
      heavenly court regarding the wicked. The full sweep of the final judgment
      was enfolded with the typical Day of Atonement just as an oak is enfolded
      within an acorn.

WED   7. What was Daniel shown would occur in heaven after a succession of
NMI      earthly powers had risen and fallen? What would happen at the
         close of this heavenly event? Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14, 21, 22, 26, 27.



          Daniel chapter 7 portrays the convening of a great judgment in heaven
      at some point after the 1260 year period of the little horn. Thus the judg-
      ment would begin after 1798. (See Dan. 7:25; Rev. 12:6, 14.) The
      prophecies of Daniel 8:14 and 9:24-27 locate the beginning of this phase of
      judgment in 1844. Daniel 7:9, 10, 13, 14 direct attention particularly to the
      beginning and the end of this pre-advent judgment. Christ receives His
      eternal kingdom composed of the vindicated saints at the close of this
      judgment in heaven (Dan. 7:13, 14). The vision portrays an aspect of the
      final judgment that will take place before Christ returns the second time
      for His believing people.
      48
      8. In this pre-advent judgment, what are opened in the presence of the
         heavenly angels? Why are they opened? Dan. 7:10; 12:1.


      9. What light is shed on the pre-advent judgment by Christ's parable
         of the wedding garment? Matt. 22:2, 9-14.



         In the pre-advent judgment, Christ is awarded the eternal kingdom and
      the little horn is judged. All the issues in the controversy between God and
      Satan are resolved at this time. God is proved to be perfectly just.
         The true separated from the false. The openly wicked who have
      never accepted Christ's grace, are not examined in this judgment. There is
      no question where they stand. But who is a genuine believer in Christ, and
      who is not? Both classes have had their names placed in the book of life.
      The gospel net brings in both good and bad (Matt. 13:24-30; 22:10). The
      investigative, pre-advent judgment is necessary to sift out the false from
      the true and to reaffirm the genuine believer before the heavenly tribunal.
         This is what constitutes Christ's second apartment ministry. (Compare
      Daniel 7:21, 22; Rev. 3:5; 6:10, 11; 19:7, 8.) The records of the pardoned
      sins of the genuine believer will be blotted out in this reaffirming judg-
      ment.

         A work of investigation. "As anciently the sins of the people were by
      faith placed upon the sin offering and through its blood transferred, in
      figure, to the earthly sanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the
      repentant are by faith placed upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the
      heavenly sanctuary. And as the typical cleansing of the earthly was ac-
      complished by the removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so
      the actual cleansing of the heavenly is to be accomplished by the removal,
      or blotting out, of the sins which are there recorded. But before this can be
      accomplished, there must be an examination of the books of record to
      determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in Christ, are entitled to
      the benefits of His atonement. The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore in-
      volves a work of investigation—a work of judgment. This work must be
      performed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His people; for when
      He comes, His reward is with Him to give to every man according to his
      works. Revelation 22:12."—The Great Controversy, pp. 421, 422.

161   HI. THE MILLENNIAL REVIEW PHASE OF THE FINAL JUDG-
          MENT (Rev. 20:4).
         The scapegoat was banished to the wilderness. This symbolized the
      binding of Satan on this earth for a thousand years (the millennium) after
      the second coming of Jesus. The redeemed will reign with Christ in
      heaven.
                                                                                49
10. Who participates in the millennial phase of the final judgment?
    Who will be judged and by whom? What is the purpose of this
    judgment? Will the lost be given another chance? Rev. 20:1-6;
    1 Cor. 6:1-3.


   The judgment during the millennium can only be a review of cases to
see why people were lost. No one will be acquitted. Probation closed
before the second coming of Jesus. As the redeemed review the issues in
the rebellion of fallen angels and the records of lost humanity, doubtless
questions will be answered. The redeemed will see the evidence of the
lavish mercy of God and people's stubborn resistance of His will. They
will be convinced that God is fair. Heaven had done all that was possible
to save the human family and to restore the universe to harmony again.
   The judgment of the heavenly court. "In union with Christ they [the
redeemed] judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book,
the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body.
Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is meted out, according to
their works; and it is recorded against their names in the book of death."—
The Great Controversy, p. 661. (Compare Luke 12:47, 48.)
IV. THE EXECUTIVE PHASE OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT (Rev.
    20:11-15).
11. Where and when does the executive phase of the final judgment
    take place? What happens in this judgment? Rev. 20:11-15.


12. What reward is now formally granted the saved? What has faith
    in Christ wrought in their characters? What sentence is now for-
    mally passed on the impenitent? Matt. 25:31-46.


13. What will be the attitude of both the saved and the lost at this
    time? Rom. 14:10, 11.


   The lesson of history will stand. "Every question of truth and error in
the longstanding controversy has now been made plain. The results of
rebellion, the fruits of setting aside the divine statutes, have been laid open
to the view of all created intelligences. The working out of Satan's rule in
contrast with the government of God has been presented to the whole
universe. Satan's own works have condemned him. God's wisdom, His
justice, and His goodness stand fully vindicated. . . . The history of sin will
stand to all eternity as a witness that with the existence of God's law is
50
     bound up the happiness of all the beings He has created. With all the facts
     of the great controversy in view, the whole universe, both loyal and rebel-
     lious, with one accord declare: 'Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of
     saints.' "—The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671.
     WILL I BE WITH THE SAVED OR THE LOST?
Ei    • Am I afraid to face the final judgment? Why, or why not?
      • Since I am living in the "hour" of God's final judgment, the antitypi-
        cal Day of Atonement, what should characterize my behavior and
        lifestyle?
      • Do I have the assurance that my name will be retained in the book of
        life?
     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Facing Life's
     Record," The Great Controversy, chapter 28, pp. 479-491.
     SUMMARY: The yearly Day of Atonement ceremony in the Israelite
     sanctuary was a ministry of judgment and vindication. It foreshadowed the
     events of the pre-advent, investigative judgment, the millennial judgment,
     and the executive judgment.




                                                                             51

CaIlendar o Redemption
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 23. The religious festivals cele-
brated in connection with the sanctuary worship.

rd 3 MEMORY TEXT: "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye
FUJ
 V may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our
        passover is sacrificed for us: Therefore let us keep the feast, not
        with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wick-
        edness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
        (1 Corinthians 5:7, 8).
   A TIME OF REFRESHING. The Lord provided for periods of holy
time—both in the moral law of the Ten Commandments and in the ritual
code—for refreshing the spiritual memory and for rededication. Although
the typical festivals with their annual sabbaths ceased to be practiced, the
observance of the seventh-day Sabbath continues to remind the Christian
every week of his Creator and Redeemer.

SPECIAL TIMES OF WORSHIP FOR ISRAEL. When the Lord or-
ganized Israel as a nation at Sinai, He not only entrusted the Sabbath to
them, but also provided a number of religious days in the ritual system to
keep fresh in their memories His saving acts in their past history. At the
same time these rites would foreshadow His ultimate salvation.
   In addition to the new-moon feasts, celebrations occurring on the first
day of each new month (Num 10:10; 28:11), the Lord instituted the Pas-
sover festival with its accompanying Feast of Unleavened Bread and the
Feast of Pentecost, which came fifty days after the Passover. The Passover
festival began the "religious" calendar for the year. These three occasions
constituted the Spring types.

52
   Of the spring, or early festivals, Ellen White noted: "These types
were fulfilled, not only as to the event, but as to the time"—The Great
Controversy, p. 399. Concerning the festivals consummated in the autumn,
or "end" times, Ellen White continues: "In like manner, the types which
relate to the second advent must be fulfilled at the time pointed out in the
symbolic service."—The Great Controversy, pp. 399, 400.
   The Fall types came in the seventh month of the year. The Feast of
Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), which fell on the fast day of the month,
marked the beginning of the civil calendar. The important Day of Atone-
ment occurred ten days later. The eight-day celebration of the Feast of
Tabernacles, beginning on the fifteenth day of the month, concluded the
annual festival cycle.
   Seven annual, or ritual, sabbaths were also observed in connection
with the spring and fall feasts. The first and last days of the Feast of Un-
leavened Bread and the day of Pentecost were spring ritual sabbaths; the
day of the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the first and
last days of the Feast of Tabernacles were the ritual sabbaths of the fall
types.
I. THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH (Lev. 23:2, 3).
1. Before instituting the ritual festivals with their accompanying holy
   days, what did the Lord restate with regard to the seventh-day
   Sabbath? What is "an holy convocation"? What insight does this
   give on how Israel observed the Sabbath? Lev. 23:2, 3; compare
   Ex. 20:8-11; Luke 4:16.


2. How did Jesus indicate the weekly Sabbath would have sig-
   nificance after His death and right down to His second advent?
   Matt. 24:15-20.


   "He who made the Sabbath did not abolish it, nailing it to His
cross. The Sabbath was not rendered null and void by His death. Forty
years after His crucifixion it was still to be held sacred. For forty years the
disciples were to pray that their flight might not be on the Sabbath day."—
The Desire of Ages, p. 630.
   Matthew 24:15-31 provides an excellent commentary on Daniel 8:13;
9:27. The "abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet"
(Matt. 24:15) is the work of the "little horn" power of Daniel 8. It does
not refer only to the attack of the Romans on Jerusalem in A.D. 70. It also
refers to the work of Papal Rome in the Middle Ages, and that of antitypi-
cal "Babylon" at the end of time. (See Rev. 13; 17; 18). The "little horn"
power of Daniel 8, to which Jesus was referring, will not be destroyed until
the coming of Christ. (Compare Daniel 8:25 with 2:44, 45.)
   Hence, when Jesus urged His followers to flee from the "abomination
of desolation," He was thinking of the situation between A.D. 68-70 as a
                                                                            53
type of the end-time. As first century Christians were to pray that their
flight would not be on the Sabbath (Matt. 24:20), so end-time Christians
are to pray. The Sabbath is Christ's appointed day of rest for His people in
every age, including the period just prior to His advent.
3. How did the practice of the apostles demonstrate the significance
   of Sabbathkeeping long after Christ died? Acts 13:42, 44; 16:13;
   18:4.


   Ask yourself, "Does my Sabbathkeeping reflect Christ's example?"
H. SPRING TYPES (Lev. 23:4-22).
4. When did the Passover come and what seven-day feast immediate-
   ly followed it? Lev. 23:4-6.


5. How were these two events regarded in the time of Jesus? Luke
   22:1, 7.


    The first Passover, eaten in haste (Ex. 12:11), in a sense, marked the
birth of the nation Israel. Because of its importance, God directed that the
month in which it occurred should be designated as the first month of the
religious calendar (Ex. 12:2).
6. What did this special meal commemorate? What was done with
   the blood of this first Passover lamb? Why? What was eaten with
   the roasted lamb? What would this article of food commemorate?
   Ex. 12:1-17, 23, 27.


7. Because the people left Egypt so quickly, what was the condition of
   the bread dough that the Israelite families were in the process of
   preparing? How were they to eat it? How was this circumstance
   remembered? Ex. 12:34, 39, 14-20; 13:6, 7.


   The deliverance from physical bondage, which the Passover com-
memorated, also sounded a spiritual note: deliverance from the bondage of
sin. Just as the Lord provided physical salvation for Israel's firstborn
through the blood of the Passover sacrifice (Ex. 12:27), so this special
lamb—as a type—foreshadowed spiritual salvation by the blood (the life
given) of the coming Lamb of God (John 1:29).
54
8. What spiritual interpretation did the inspired apostle Paul give in
   regard to the significance of the Passover and Feast of Unleavened
   Bread in Israel's calendar of redemption? 1 Cor. 5:7, 8.


9. What four steps were initially required of enslaved Israel. How do
   you see these steps relating to the experiences of Jesus, the antitypi-
   cal Paschal Lamb? Ex. 12:3-10, 21, 22; Dent. 16:6, 7.


   Feast of deliverance. "The Passover was to be both commemorative
and typical, not only pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but for-
ward to the greater deliverance which Christ was to accomplish in freeing
His people from the bondage of sin. . . . It was not enough that the paschal
lamb be slain; its blood must be sprinkled upon the door-posts; so the
merits of Christ's blood must be applied to the soul. We must believe, not
only that He died for the world, but that He died for us individually. We
must appropriate to ourselves the virtue of the atoning sacrifice.
   "The flesh was to be eaten. It is not enough even that we believe on
Christ for the forgiveness of sin; we must by faith be constantly receiving
spiritual strength and nourishment from Him through His word. Said
Christ, 'Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye
have no life in you.' . . . The followers of Christ must be partakers of His
experience. They must receive and assimilate the word of God so that it
shall become the motive power of life and actions. . . . The spirit and work
of Christ must become the spirit and work of His disciples."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 277, 278.
10. Explain the reason for the prohibition against breaking any of the
    bones of the Paschal lamb. Compare Ex. 12:46 with John 19:33,
    36.


11. What message did the endive salad (or "bitter herbs") eaten as
    part of the paschal meal, teach the Israelites? Ex. 12:8; Num.
    9:11.


   "The lamb was to be eaten with bitter herbs, as pointing back to the
bitterness of the bondage in Egypt [Ex. 1:14]. So when we feed upon
Christ, it should be with contrition of heart, because of our sin."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 278.
12. What message for Israel, and for us, lies behind the requirement
    to eat only "unleavened bread"? Ex. 12:8; 1 Cor. 5:8.

                                                                         55
     "The slaying of the Passover lamb was a shadow of the death of
Christ. . . . The sheaf of first fruits, which at the time of the Passover was
waved before the Lord, was typical of the resurrection of Christ . . . Christ
is the first fruits of that immortal harvest of redeemed ones."—The Great
Controversy, p. 399.
    The amazing accuracy in the fulfillment of the prophetic types pin-
pointing important details of the first advent of Jesus established Him as
the Paschal Lamb, and the Messiah. The accomplishment of His death on
the fourteenth of Nisan, led naturally to His resurrection on the day of the
Wave Sheaf or first fruits.

13. What did the Saviour establish through the covenant meal at the
    "last" Passover? Matt. 26:17, 18, 26-30.


14. How is the Feast of Pentecost linked to the Feast of Unleavened
    Bread? Lev. 23:15, 16; Ex. 34:22.


15. What special offering was presented to the Lord on the Feast of
    Pentecost? Lev. 23:17-20.



   Pentecost was a harvest feast in that it marked the close of the grain har-
vest in general and the wheat harvest in particular. Thus the Feast of Un-
leavened Bread, with the wave sheaf or first fruits of the barley harvest,
was linked with the "wave loaves" of wheat, baked with leaven, that were
presented as a thank offering to the Lord at the Feast of Pentecost at the
close of the wheat harvest.
16. Throughout their history what did the Lord require all the able-
    bodied men of Israel to do for this one day's festival? Ex. 23:14-
    17; compare Acts 2:1-3.


   Giving worship precedence. "With those who lived at a distance from
the tabernacle, more than a month of every year must have been occupied
in attendance upon the annual feasts. This example of devotion to God
should emphasize the importance of religious worship."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 541.
   Pentecost lasted just one day. For even this brief period of time the
Lord required all the men, and any others who were able, to travel to His
sanctuary for worship.
56
         Pentecost was the Feast of Leavened Bread, in contrast to the Paschal
     Feast of Unleavened Bread. As the sheaf of the first fruits of barley had
     been "waved" before the altar on the sixteenth of Nisan to celebrate the
     gathering of the first barley crop in Palestine, so the waving of the two
     loaves of leavened wheat bread joyfully acknowledged the conclusion of
     all the grain crops.
     17. If the concept of "harvest" is the key to the symbolism of Pen-
         tecost, what event in A.D. 31 harvested the labors of Jesus and
         brought about the birth of the Christian Church? Acts 2:1-12, 37-
         47.


        Think about it. How does knowing that Christ perfectly fulfilled the
     spring or "early" feasts bring new meaning to the Old Testament sym-
     bolism?
     HI. FALL TYPES (Lev. 23:23-44).
19   18. What festival marked the first day of the civil calendar? How was
         it observed? Lev. 23:24, 25.


        Because the feast of the Day of Atonement was described in lesson 6, it
     will not be described in detail in this lesson.
     19. In what two ways did the Feast of Trumpets differ from regular
          new moon feasts? Lev. 23:24, 25.


        Unlike the other eleven new moons, the new moon of the seventh
     religious month was a ceremonial sabbath during which no servile work
     might be done. But like the others it was a "holy convocation," requiring
     attendance at local houses of worship.
     20. What bearing did the blowing of the trumpets have on the soon
         coming Day of Atonement? Lev. 23:27.


       The rabbis described the time between the Feast of Trumpets and the
     Day of Atonement as "the ten days of penitence." These days provided
     God's ancient people with opportunity to prepare for the "judgment,"
     which was believed to occur on the Day of Expiation.
       The message of the trumpets was, "The Day of Atonement is nearing!
     Be warned! Heed the trumpets' challenge!" A special worldwide message
     was given by William Miller and others to prepare the world for the corn-
                                                                           57
    mencement of the pre-Advent judgment in 1844. The message emphasized
    the urgent need of spiritual preparation for the second advent of Jesus. In
    the last days the gospel trumpet must give its "certain" sound of warning
    and appeal to all the world to be ready for the climax of the antitypical Day
    of Atonement in the heavenly sanctuary.
    21. How extensively does Christ purpose that this invitation to be
        prepared shall spread? Matt. 24:14; Rev. 22:17.


    22. What are the names by which the final festival of the agricultural
        year was known? What double emphasis did this feast make on
        the minds of the people? Lev. 23:34, 39-44; Ex. 23:16; 34:22.


       The Feast of Tabernacles or Booths marked with rejoicing and
    peace the ingathering of all the crops for the year. For the week of this last
    of Israel's pilgrimages the people of God dwelt in temporary leafy booths
    or tents erected about the sanctuary, or around the Temple at Jerusalem,
    commemorating their sojourn in the wilderness. The activities then carried
    out anticipated the joy of earth's final "harvest" of souls, and the glad
    homecoming that will take place in the "many mansions" in the Father's
    everlasting house in the New Jerusalem. (See Num. 29:12-29; Deut. 16:13-
    17; Neh. 8:14-18.)
    23. When will the antitypical feast of tabernacles be celebrated? Rev.
        8:1; 7:9, 10.


       See Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 542.

n   QUESTIONS FOR ME TO ANSWER:
      • Why is my attendance at gatherings of believers important to my
        spiritual well-being? (Compare Heb. 10:25)
      • Am I, by Christ's grace, making the necessary spiritual preparation
        for the heavenly Feast of Tabernacles?
      • How can I obtain a deeper spiritual refreshment from my Sabbath
        observance?
    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter in
    Patriarchs and Prophets entitled, "The Annual Feasts," pp. 537-542. On
    the Sabbatic Years and Jubilees see: Lev. 25:2-55; 26:34, 35; 27:16-25.
    SUMMARY: The weekly Sabbath and the festivals of the Levitical ser-
    vice helped Israel to remember God. The annual festivals pointed forward
    to aspects of Christ's ministry from Calvary to the Second Advent and
    beyond.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 17:7; 19:26, 31; 20:6, 27. The coun-
sels given in regard to satanic agencies and practices.

773 MEMORY TEXT: "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and
PM   the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table,
     and of the table of devils" (1 Corinthians 10:21).
WAR OF THE SUPERPOWERS. Two superhuman forces are engaged
in a deadly war on our planet: God, our Creator and Redeemer, contends
with demonic beings, Satan and the other fallen angels. Because Satan
continually seeks to lead believers away from their loyalty to God, their
only safety is to heed strictly the Lord's warnings about the dark powers.

OCCULTISM THREATENS CHRISTIANS. The Israelites were at-
tracted continually by the idolatrous practices of the Egyptians,
Canaanites, and other nations. Their history, until they returned in the sixth
century B.C. from Babylonian exile, was one of repeated disloyalty to
God. They engaged in the worship of pagan deities. Through the prophet
Jeremiah, the Lord lamented: "Be astonished, 0 ye heavens, at this, and be
horribly afraid, be ye very desolate. . . . For my people have committed
two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed
them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water" (Jer. 2:12, 13).
   Interest in pagan occultism is not dead. New forms continue to
threaten Christian faith, and Seventh-day Adventists are not immune. In
the past two decades Western occultism has linked with Eastern mysticism
to present a new face to modern society. Theories and practices based on
the so-called ancient wisdom of Eastern mysticism and Western occultism
have penetrated every area of contemporary life: science, business, health,
education, psychology, religion, politics, the arts, and entertainment. At its
foundation lies the non-Biblical worldview of pantheism. Pantheism once

                                                                           59
    knocked on the Adventist door through the teachings of Dr. J. H. Kellogg,
    superintendent of our first medical facility in Battle Creek, Michigan. One
    student of the contemporary scene makes this succinct statement:
       "The religious options open to humanity are limited: We can believe in
    no God and be atheists. We can believe in one God and be theists. Or we
    can believe that all is God and be pantheists. Of these three, pantheism has
    been humanity's major preoccupation throughout history. . . . In the ab-
    sence of revealed religion, humanity gravitates to natural religion, assumes
    nature is all that is, and deifies it and humanity accordingly."—Robert J.
    L. Burrows, "Americans Get Religion in the New Age," Christianity
    Today, May 16, 1986, p. 17.
       One contemporary approach is to supplement the older occult prac-
    tices such as spiritualism with techniques designed allegedly to elevate
    humanity. The solution to the human problem is sought in various forms of
    meditation, a holistic health movement, and efforts to awaken the "higher
    powers" alleged to be latent within each person.
       This week we will examine the Bible's insights on the nature of the oc-
    cult and the attitude the Christian should adopt to it.

    I. INTELLIGENT BEINGS IN OPPOSITION TO GOD (LEV. 17:7).
9   1. Against what kind of worship was Israel warned? Lev. 19:4; 26:1,
       30.



    2. Who were the powers behind such worship? Lev. 17:7; compare
       Deut. 32:17; Psalm 106:34-38.



    3. Who were the Israelites to worship? Why? Ex. 20:3-6, 11.



    4. What insight does the apostle Paul give on the demonic powers that
       are opposed to the one true God? How should Christians relate to
       them? 1 Cor. 10:19-21.



       "Knowing the real nature of idol worship, that it is communing with
    Satan and his evil angels, Paul urgently admonishes the Corinthians to
    avoid idolatry. Christians are solemnly dedicated to Christ; they belong to
    Him by creation and redemption, and they cannot give the least degree of
    sanction to a form of worship that would give honor to any being other
    than the one true God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 746, 747.
    60
5. How did the devils originate? What is their relationship to God?
   Rev. 12:7-9; 2 Peter 2:4; compare Isa. 14:12-14; Eze. 28:13-18.


   "The connection of the visible with the invisible world, the ministra-
tion of angels of God, and the agency of evil spirits, are plainly revealed in
the Scriptures, and inseparably interwoven with human history. There is a
growing tendency to disbelief in the existence of evil spirits, while the holy
angels that 'minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation' (Hebrews
1:14) are regarded by many as spirits of the dead. But the Scriptures not
only teach the existence of angels, both good and evil, but present unques-
tionable proof that these are not disembodied spirits of dead men."
   "Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature,
power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers. But
fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and
the destruction of men. United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him
cast out from heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, cooperated
with him in his warfare against the divine authority. We are told in Scrip-
ture of their confederacy and government, of their various orders, of their
intelligence and subtlety, and of their malicious designs against the peace
and happiness of men."—The Great Controversy, pp. 511, 513.
6. Since Satan has usurped control of this planet by leading Adam
   and Eve into sin, what position is he recognized as holding? John
   12:31; 2 Cor. 4:4.


7. As probationary time shortens, in what kinds of activities will the
   devils engage? What is their purpose? 1 Tim. 4:1; Rev. 16:13, 14.


8. How can Christians be protected from believing the delusive
   "doctrines of devils?" Eph. 6:10-18.


   Our secular society is ripe for satanic deceptions. To a large extent
the scientific mind has turned away from the Bible and from the claims
and authority of God. Likewise secular man rejects belief in Satan and evil
spirits. Because modem physics now views energy as the fundamental
reality, there is a tendency on the part of some secular intellectuals to iden-
tify it with the pantheism taught by Eastern mysticism. The attempt is to
unite modern science, the occult, and Eastern mysticism into one world
system of belief.
  The pantheistic view of reality clashes with the testimony of the
Bible: 1. It denies the existence of a personal, creator God who stands out-
                                                                         61
   side His creation. 2. It rejects the biblical teaching that the human family
   has sinned and can be redeemed only through the merits of the sinless life
   and atoning death of the Saviour, Jesus Christ. 3. It teaches that there is no
   death or final judgment to meet. Life is upward and mobile through rein-
   carnations. 4. Physical phenomena, such as the curing of disease, are
   thought to be caused by latent "higher powers" within the human mind, or
   by the radiating energy of which all reality is said to be composed.
      Such a view blinds the mind to the workings of Satan, who is using
   every possible means to draw humanity to its ruin and to block the gospel
   of God's grace from its saving mission.
      "None are in greater danger from the influence of evil spirits than
   those who, notwithstanding the direct and ample testimony of the
   Scriptures, deny the existence and agency of the devil and his angels.
   So long as we are ignorant of their wiles, they have almost inconceivable
   advantage; many give heed to their suggestions while they suppose them-
   selves to be following the dictates of their own wisdom. This is why, as we
   approach the close of time, when Satan is to work with greatest power to
   deceive and destroy, he spreads everywhere the belief that he does not
   exist. It is his policy to conceal himself and his manner of working."—The
   Great Controversy, p. 516.
      Ask yourself. Am I aware of the pervasive influence of pantheism in
   the media, in education, in all aspects touching my life?

f4.1A IL WARNINGS AGAINST SPIRITUALISM (Lev. 20:6, 27).
   9. With whom did God prohibit His people to counsel? Why? Lev.
      19:31; compare Isa. 8:19.


   10. On what satanic statement does the practice of Spiritualism rest?
       Why is Satan's statement erroneous? Gen. 3:4; Psalm 146:3, 4;
       Eccl. 9:5, 6,10; compare John 11:11-14.


   11. King Saul attempted to communicate with the deceased prophet
       Samuel. (See 1 Sam. 28:7-25.) Through the medium of Endor an
       apparition resembling Samuel spoke to him. Was God com-
       municating with Saul in this manner? (See 1 Sam. 28:6; 1 Chron.
       10:13, 14.) If Heaven was not speaking to Saul in this seance, with
       whom was the king in contact?


      "The 'familiar spirits' were not the spirits of the dead, but evil an-
   gels, the messengers of Satan. Ancient idolatry, which . . . comprises both
   worship of the dead and pretended communion with them, is declared by
   62
      the Bible to have been demon worship. . . . In their supposed worship of
      dead men they were in reality worshiping demons.
         "Modem spiritualism, resting upon the same foundation, is but a
      revival in a new form of the witchcraft and demon worship that God con-
      demned and prohibited of old."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 685, 686.
         Mediums and others who do not believe in the God of the Bible, yet
      think that they are guided and instructed by good and wise spirits, are
      being deluded. The Bible reveals that such spirits are evil angels who war
      against God and all that is holy and good. Without a commitment to the
      teachings of the Bible the modern secular person (whether educated or not)
      has no defense against the deceptions of the occult and Eastern mysticism.
      They often think that latent supernatural forces are being activated.
      12. In Israel's theocracy what directions did the Levitical law give in
          regard to persons who functioned as mediums for the dark
          powers? Lev. 20:6, 27.


          "Spiritualists are increasing in numbers. ... The only safety for the
      people of God is to be thoroughly conversant with their Bibles, and be in-
      telligent upon the reasons of our faith in regard to the sleep of the dead.
          "Satan is a cunning foe. And it is not difficult for the evil angels to rep-
      resent both saints and sinners who have died, and make these repre-
      sentations visible to human eyes. These manifestations will be more fre-
      quent, and developments of a more startling character will appear as we
      near the close of time." Evangelism, p. 604.
        Think about this. What can I do to prevent deception by unholy
      powers?

WED
      HI. WARNINGS AGAINST THE PRACTICES OF SORCERY (Lev.
          19:26).
      13. In what practices of the Canaanites were the Israelites strongly
          forbidden to engage? Lev. 19:26; Dent. 18:9-14.


         The Canaanites and Babylonians were deeply involved in the occult
      in all its forms. The Levitical code prohibited all forms of divination and
      magic, as well as spiritism. The Hebrew word rendered "enchantment' in
      the King James Version (Lev. 19:26) carries the meaning "to divine," "to
      determine the future," or "to discover hidden knowledge." Nebuchadnez-
      zar "divined" which nation he should attack first (Judah or the Am-
      monites) by consulting a quiver of arrows, figurines, and an animal liver.
      (See Eze. 21:21.) While these procedures appear irrational to us—and they
      are—we must not forget that the dark powers stood behind these occult
      practices.
                                                                                   63
   Divining may take a variety of forms in the occult. It naturally links it-
self with two large areas of human concern: 1. the desire to know the fu-
ture, and 2. the desire to diagnose and cure disease. Psychic healing has al-
ways been an important aspect of the occult.
14. In what manner did God reprove king Ahaziah, the ruler of the
     northern kingdom of Israel when he sought healing through
     demonic powers? 2 Kings 1:2-4,16,17.


    Warning to Christians now. "Today the mysteries of heathen worship
are replaced by the secret associations and seances, the obscurities and
wonders, of spiritistic mediums. The disclosures of these mediums are
eagerly received by thousands who refuse to accept light from God's word
or through His Spirit. Believers in spiritism may speak with scorn of the
magicians of old, but the great deceiver laughs in triumph as they yield to
his arts under a different form. . . .
    "The apostles of nearly all forms of spiritism claim to have power to
heal. They attribute this power to electricity, magnetism, the so-called
`sympathetic remedies,' or to latent forces within the mind of man. And
there are not a few, even in this Christian age, who go to these healers, in-
stead of trusting in the power of the living God and the skill of well-
qualified physicians. The mother, watching by the sickbed of her child, ex-
claims, 'I can do no more. Is there no physician who has power to restore
my child?' She is told of the wonderful cures performed by some clair-
voyant or magnetic healer, and she trusts her dear one to his charge, plac-
ing it as verily in the hand of Satan as if he were standing by her side. In
many instances the future life of the child is controlled by a satanic power
which it seems impossible to break."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 210, 211.
(Italics supplied.)
   "These Satanic agents claim to cure disease. They attribute their
power to electricity, magnetism, or the so-called 'sympathetic remedies,'
while in truth they are but channels for Satan's electrical currents. By this
means he casts his spell over the bodies and souls of men."—Evangelism,
p. 609. (Italics supplied.)
   Occult practices are today being associated with a current holistic
health movement. It is correctly recognized that the individual must be
treated as a whole; body, mind, and spirit. But medical centers are being
established in which physicians practicing scientific medicine work along
with psychic healers and practitioners of occultic and Eastern arts. The
Journal of the American Medical Association reported in 1979 the exist-
ence of more than 500 such centers/clinics in the United States. They are
headed and staffed by physicians and holistic health care practitioners.
Thus, "ancient" (that is, occultic-Eastern) methods of healing and modern
medicine are joining hands. In the same year the prestigious Johns Hopkins
University opened its doors to lectures in "psychic healing" and other
"unconventional treatments."
64
   Psychic healing, the occult, and pantheism. Psychic healing, often
employing the use of the pendulum or other objects to diagnose and treat
disease, has long been an integral part of the occult. All the occultic-
Eastern methods of treating disease and stress are tied to the non-Biblical
pantheistic world view of reality. There are attempts at times to keep this
fact hidden. It is dangerous for Christians to think that they can borrow and
adapt the healing procedures of the occult. The attempt to give occult prac-
tices a Christian veneer opens the door to satanic delusion and oppression.
   Early in their history Seventh-day Adventists were guided by the Holy
Spirit to adopt rational methods in the prevention and treatment of disease.
Medical institutions were established to train physicians, nurses, and
paramedical assistants in the scientific treatment of disease. God works
through appointed medical agencies. He also continues to answer the
prayers of His faithful people as they follow the counsel of Scripture. (See
James 5:13, 15.)
15. In what other ways do the dark powers confront our modern
     society? What only can be our source of protection? Matt. 24:24;
     2 Thess. 2:8-12.


    Attractive forms of spiritism. "There are many who shrink with horror
from the thought of consulting spirit mediums, but who are attracted by
more pleasing forms of spiritism, such as the Emmanuel movement. Still
others are led astray by the teachings of Christian Science, and by the mys-
ticism of theosophy and other Oriental religions."—Evangelism, p. 606.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO ME TODAY?
 • Why is it dangerous for me as a Christian to employ the procedures
   of the occult—such as the use of the pendulum, hand passes over the
   body, transcendental meditation—even though they appear at times to
   "work"?
 • Why does a pantheistic world view destroy my Christian faith?
 • How can a biblical knowledge of the nature of man and of the exist-
   ence of evil angels protect me from the delusions of the current
   spiritistic movements?
 • How can I share the principles of this lesson so as to safeguard others
   from the subtle dangers of pantheism?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Ancient and Modern
Sorcery," in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 683-689, and "Agency of Evil
Spirits," in The Great Controversy, pp. 511-517; Testimonies, vol. 8,
pp. 290, 291.
SUMMARY: The Levitical prohibitions against pagan occultism are
present truth for Christians today. Satanic agencies—as angels of light (2
Cor. 11:13-15)—confront our modem society with "new" forms of the
ancient demonic practices. Only as God's people are committed to union
with Christ and His Word can He protect them from Satan's deceptions
and false philosophies.

5-0olliness and Health
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 3:17; 15:31-33; 19:17-18.
SWAB    MEMORY TEXT: "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God
 PM
        am holy" (Leviticus 19:2).

YOU CAN REFLECT GOD'S IMAGE. The book of Leviticus gives in-
struction regarding holiness, or sanctification, as it relates to the Chris-
tian's health and well-being. Although sin has weakened the human
family, God devised the plan of salvation to restore in repentant sinners the
image of their Maker.

               OVERVIEW: HOLINESS AND HEALTH

        Lev. 3:17            Lev. 15:31-33            Lev. 19:11-18

       Holiness and          Holiness and             Holiness and
        nutrition             cleanliness             mental health

IN HARMONY WITH A HOLY GOD. The motto of the book of Levi-
ticus can be summed up in the words of our memory text: "Ye shall be
holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" (Lev. 19:2). A similar statement
occurs elsewhere in the book (Lev. 11:44, 45; 20:26).
    The Lord is holy—"a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right"
(Deut. 32:4). He says, "I the Lord, which sanctify you, am holy" (Lev.
21:8). Because God is infinitely pure, He wishes to save His people from
sin and separate them from all its effects. Consequently the religion of the
Bible is more than certain fundamental beliefs about God. It involves a
manner of living, as well. It is living for the God who has redeemed us, in
harmony with the principles of His Word.
    "Holiness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to
God; it is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God; it is
doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in trial, in darkness
as well as in the light; it is walking by faith and not by sight; it is relying
on God with unquestioning confidence, and resting in His love."—The
Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.
    One aspect of sanctified living touched on in the book of Leviticus is
 the physical health of God's people. The holy God would have holy, happy
 people. The religion of the Bible always promotes the wholeness of life,
 the well-being of God's followers. The religious instruction God gave an-
 cient Israel affected their health, both mentally and physically.

                                                                            67
n   I. HOLINESS AND NUTRITION (Lev. 3:17).
       When Israel came out of Egypt, the Lord promised that, if they would
    be obedient to Him and observe His commandments and statutes, He
    would bless them physically. "I will put none of these diseases upon thee,
    which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth
    thee" (Ex. 15:26). Although the book of Leviticus does not address health
    issues directly, in the light of modem science it is evident that religious
    guidelines given by God served to promote the general health of the
    people.
    1. What parts of food animals were strictly forbidden to be eaten?
       Lev. 3:17; 7:23-26.


        The fat and blood of sacrificial animals were used in the sanctuary
    sacrifices. In most of the sacrifices it was essentially the fat that was
    burned on the altar. The sprinkling of the blood provided atonement.
        By reserving the fat and blood as sacred to the ritual, the Lord removed
    a potential cause of disease from His people. While blood carries the
    nutrients for life to our body cells, it also carries away their waste products.
    It is the stream in which disease germs travel throughout the body. Forbid-
    ding the consumption of animal blood was a boon to Israel. So also was the
    prohibition against eating animal fat, which is one of the great causes of
    heart and vascular diseases in modem industrial countries.
        Smoking and high cholesterol levels cause half the deaths in the United
    States and Great Britain in people between the ages of 40 and 69. Too
    much cholesterol in the blood results in the gradual clogging of the blood
    vessels. The normal flow of blood is impeded. Blockage of a blood vessel
    supplying the heart results in a heart attack. Diet and internal metabolism
    are the factors that determine the amount of cholesterol in an individual's
    blood stream.
        According to modem scientists the chief cause of cholesterol build-up
    in the blood vessels is the amount of saturated fat from dairy and land an-
    imal products that a person eats. In removing animal fat and blood from
    the diet of Israel, God protected His people from potential causes of sick-
    ness.
    2. What were the keys for determining what land and water animals
        could be eaten by the Israelites? Lev. 11:1-12.


    3. What kinds of bird were unsuitable for food? Lev. 11:13-23.


    4. What other animal life was specifically forbidden? Lev. 11:29, 30.


    68
5. What did God mean by the terms clean and unclean? Why did
   God impose dietary rules? Lev. 11:47; 20:25, 26.


   Many Christians believe that the distinction between "clean" and "un-
clean" is no longer valid. They argue that it is simply a ceremonial law
that ceased to function when the Jewish ritual system met its antitype.
6. What is unsound in the above reasoning? How far back in histori-
   cal time did God's people know about the distinction between
   "clean" and "unclean" animals? Gen. 7:1, 2.


7. What was the diet God first provided for the human family at crea-
   tion? What was the diet after the fall of our first parents? Gen.
   1:29; 3:18.


8. When was God's second best, supplemental diet of clean flesh foods
   first permitted? Gen. 9:3, 4.


   It is evident from the book of Genesis that the clean/unclean distinction
between animals did not originate with Moses. The distinction was probab-
ly stated after the Fall when the sacrificial system was instituted, because
only "clean" animals were used for sacrifice. (See Gen. 8:20.) When flesh
eating was permitted after the Flood, it was natural for God to restrict it to
the "clean" categories.
   We do not know scientifically why one animal is designated as "clean"
and another as "unclean." The distinction simply means that a particular
kind of flesh is fit for food or not fit for food. Eating "clean" flesh or
abstaining from "unclean" flesh foreshadowed nothing. It appears to have
been a health guideline given to Noah, which is still valid today for the
same reasons.
    The principle still stands. "The story comes to us of Dr. Adam Clarke
who, while calling on a family, was invited to ask the blessing on the meal.
As the chief part of the menu that day they had some kind of pork. It is
said that his prayer was something like this, 'God, if Thou canst bless
under the new covenant what Thou didst curse under the old, please bless
this food.' The demarcation between clean and unclean animals is not
merely Mosaic. It was in existence before the time of the Flood. There is
no reason to believe that the distinction has ever been done away. This is
one of those cases where a 'Thus saith the Lord' stands clearly delineated,
even though at the present time we cannot offer any scientific reason for
it."—Frank L. Marsh, Studies in Creationism (Washington, D. C.: Review
and Herald Publishing Association, 1950), p. 388.
                                                                         69
    9. What Biblical principle directs the follower of God to eat the best
       diet possible? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31.



       Effects of flesh food. "We do not mark out any precise line to be fol-
    lowed in diet; but we do say that in countries where there are fruits, grains,
    and nuts in abundance, flesh food is not the right food for God's people. I
    have been instructed that flesh food has a tendency to animalize the nature,
    to rob men and women of that love and sympathy which they should feel
    for everyone, and to give the lower passions control over the higher powers
    of the being. If meat eating was ever healthful, it is not safe now. Cancers,
    tumors, and pulmonary diseases are largely caused by meat eating.
        "We are not to make the use of flesh food a test of fellowship, but we
    should consider the influence that professed believers who use flesh foods
    have over others. As God's messengers, shall we not say to the people:
    `Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory
    of God.'?"—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 159.

       Knowing that God instructed His people from the beginning con-
    cerning proper diet, can I find any dietary habits in my life that need
    to be modified?
    11. HOLINESS AND CLEANLINESS (Lev. 15:31-33).
M      We can see from Leviticus 15:31-33 that God was serious about the
    removal of ritual contamination. The emphasis on such defilements was in-
    tended to underline the seriousness of moral sin. It is also evident that in
    many cases ritual cleansings functioned to prevent the spread of disease.
    10. What was required of a person who handled the dead body of an
        animal? Lev. 11:24, 25, 39, 40.


    11. What was required of a person who had to remove a corpse and
        the dead person's possessions, or who had to bury the slain from a
        battle? Num. 19:14-16; compare 31:19, 20.


    12. What was required of a person who became contaminated with
        another person's impurities? Lev. 15:5-12.


       In the light of modern understanding of germs and contagion the divine
    guidelines are fully vindicated. Although for religious reasons the Israelite
    washed his body and his clothes and was "unclean until the even," the
    70
      simple procedure of washing the body and clothes was a factor in prevent-
      ing the spread of disease.
         In 1847 one out of every six women died in the maternity wards
      around the world. Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, of Vienna, noticed that in his
      hospital the physicians and medical students performed autopsies on the
      women who had died in the preceding twenty-four hours. Without washing
      their hands they would proceed to give pelvic examinations on the living
      women. He observed that when that sequence was followed in his ward,
      his living patients usually sickened and died. In April of that year fifty-
      seven women died in his ward. At that point Dr. Semmelweis instituted the
      rule that teachers and students must wash their hands before examining his
      patients. The result was that in June, only one out of 42 died; in July only
      one out of 84. The fatal infections had been carried from the dead to the
      living. (See S. I. McMillen, None of These Diseases [Old Tappan, N.J.:
      Fleming H. Revell Company, 1963], pp. 12-15.)
      13. What instruction did God give in order to keep the living areas of
          the Israelites clean from human wastes? What reason did God
          give for this procedure? Deut. 23:12-14.


         "Every form of uncleanliness tends to disease. Death-producing
      germs abound in dark, neglected corners, in decaying refuse, in dampness
      and mold and must. No waste vegetables or heaps of fallen leaves should
      be allowed to remain near the house to decay and poison the air. Nothing
      unclean or decaying should be tolerated within the home."—Child
      Guidance, p. 108.

WED   14. What procedure was followed by the examining priest in treating
          the Israelite who was suspected of leprosy or some type of skin dis-
          ease? Lev. 13:4, 5, 21, 26, 45, 46.


         We would call this procedure of isolating a person suspected of a con-
      tagious disease "quarantine." This might be temporary, but in a confirmed
      leper it was made permanent by isolating the diseased person from the
      society of his home and city.
      15. What was done to a house suspected of having molds or rot that
          would produce disease? Lev. 14:34, 38, 44, 45.



      16. Circumcision of Israelite males was commanded by God as an out-
          ward physical sign of loyalty to His covenant. On what day of an
          infant's life was it performed? Lev. 12:3.

                                                                               71
         According to the medical work Holt Pediatrics (1953) infants are sus-
      ceptible to bleeding between the second and fifth days of life. This seems
      to be because vitamin K—an important blood-clotting element—is not
      formed in sufficient amount in the child's intestinal tract until the fifth to
      the seventh day. Prothrombin, a second element also necessary for normal
      clotting, is at its highest level on the eighth day. Medically speaking, we
      now know that the eighth day was the best day for the rite of circumcision.
      (See S. I. McMillen, None of These Diseases, pp. 19-21.)
         God took care to instruct His people for optimal health. Can I do
      less today than follow His commands?

Vie   I11. HOLINESS AND MENTAL HEALTH (Lev. 19:11-18).
         Negative thoughts of self-centeredness, anger, and revenge tend to
      depress the general health. An outgoing attitude of kindness and helpful-
      ness promotes well-being. To be merciful is to act in a manner similar to
      that of the heavenly Father (Matt. 5:45).
      17. Read Lev. 19:11-18 and answer the following questions:

         a. Note that there are four couplets: (1) vs. 11-12; (2) vs. 13-14; (3)
         vs. 15-16; (4) vs. 17-18. What phrase closes each couplet? What
         does it mean? How does it relate to our memory verse, Leviticus
         19:2?


         b. What direction is given in each couplet that would help an Israel-
         ite develop an outgoing, compassionate attitude toward others?
         o Vs. 11, 12
         e Vs. 13, 14
         o Vs. 15, 16

         o Vs. 17, 18
      18. For what purpose did Jesus draw on this section of Leviticus
          (Lev. 19:17, 18)? Matt. 22:34-40; Compare Rom. 13:8-10.



         The principle of love. "The first four of the Ten Commandments are
      summed up in the one great precept, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
      with all thy heart.' The last six are included in the other, 'Thou shalt love
      thy neighbor as thyself.' Both these commandments are an expression of
      the principle of love. The first cannot be kept and the second broken, nor
      can the second be kept while the first is broken. When God has His rightful
      72
place on the throne of the heart, the right place will be given to our neigh-
bor. We shall love Him as ourselves. And only as we love God supremely
is it possible to love our neighbor impartially."—The Desire of Ages, p.
607.
19. What agricultural laws were designed to weaken the self-centered
    nature of the people and promote a spirit of compassion and
    generosity? Lev. 19:9, 10; 23:22; Deut. 24:19-22.


20. Why would the method of assisting the poor described in Leviticus
    19:9, 10 be superior to granting them an outright gift of food?


21. What kind of guideline was legislated to prevent an Israelite from
    taking advantage of his less fortunate neighbor who might need to
    borrow from him? Lev. 25:35-38.


22. What civil provisions provided for the natural renewal of the soil?
    What law provided for the periodic return of all property that had
    changed hands to the original owner or his heirs? Lev. 25:1-24.


   The sabbatical year permitted the land to lie fallow for a time. Its
natural production provided for the poor. The jubilee year, which came
every 50 years, was intended to equalize the economy by requiring all pre-
viously sold properties to be returned to their original owners. Thus God
designed to teach a compassionate, unselfish spirit within His people.
Living wholeheartedly for God and for others—the core principle of Bible
religion—had the effect of blessing the giver. He enjoyed spiritual,
psychological, and physical health.
   "Men were to cooperate with God in restoring the diseased land to
health, that it might be a praise and a glory to His name. And as the land
they possessed would, if managed with skill and earnestness, produce its
treasures, so their hearts, if controlled by God, would reflect His charac-
ter."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p.
1112.
APPLICATION TO MY LIFE:
  • What changes in my life-style should I make now in order to avoid
    the major killer diseases that are to a large extent preventable?
  • Are there basic practices to ensure cleanliness in my person and home
    that I should incorporate in my daily living?
  • How can I live a more outgoing, generous life?
                                                                       73
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Health Principles,"
"Cleanliness," Child Guidance, chapters 16, 17; The Desire of Ages, p.
556; Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 32.
SUMMARY: "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" is the
motto of Old Testament religion. It is also the motto of the New. The
apostle Peter challenges Christians with the same ideal. (See 1 Peter 1:16.)
Wholeness for God involves our physical and mental natures, as well as
our spiritual. We honor God by obeying His physical law, as well as His
moral law. Both were designed for our happiness.




              A                    is a sign of contradiction—a

HoIllness and the Horne
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 18, 20. Guidelines for moral purity.

e
sa    MEMORY TEXT: "For this is the will of God, even your
 PM   sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication" (1 Thes-
      salonians 4:3).
THE CREATOR KNOWS MY NEEDS. The sexual powers are sacred
to marriage, which is a divinely ordained union. The Levitical guidelines
for sexual morality are based on the divine principle that 'wholeness' and
`normality' are essential aspects of holiness. These aspects of holiness are
found in conformity to God's plan. Consequently, sexual deviations from
the Creator's original design are sin because they introduce confusion and
mar the divine ideal. Living according to the Creator's design promotes
genuine happiness.

             OVERVIEW: HOLINESS AND THE HOME

       Gen. 1:26-28           Lev. 18, 20           1 Cor. 6:13-20

       God-created           Sin-perverted          Spirit-controlled
         Powers                 Powers                   Powers

GOD'S ABSOLUTES PROTECT ME. Worldly societies are experienc-
ing constantly shifting values. There seem to be no absolutes, no rock-
grounded principles of life. The only "absolutes" for many are the current
whims and fancies of the day. The aim is to look out for "number 1" and do
whatever "feels good" to you. This is especially true in the area of morals.
   Without the restraining grace of God we humans reveal our inner
depravity. Contamination from loose morals is a threat to modern Christi-
ans, as it was to Israel in both Egypt and Canaan. By the inspired guide-
lines of Leviticus, God moved to protect His people from the licentious-
ness of the corrupt Canaanites who surrounded them. He sought to pre-
serve their moral and spiritual integrity.
   Seven times Leviticus 18 emphasizes that God's holy people were not
to defile themselves by engaging in the immoral practices and customs of
the Canaanites. (See vs. 3, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30.) Six times the Lord re-
minded them: "I am the Lord your God" (vs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 21, 30)—a phrase
that would imply: "Be holy, be morally pure, for I am holy."
    The phrase carried another important message for Israel and for us: that
all the actions of our lives are carried out in the presence of God. His eye
is upon us. (See Psalm 139:1-12.)
                                                                          75
    Because the instructions in Leviticus assume a previous understanding
of the divine plan for marriage, we begin our study this week in Genesis.
I. GOD-CREATED POWERS (Gen. 1:26-28).
1. How are human beings differentiated from God and from animals?
   What powers were they given? Within what sphere do these powers
   have their proper function? Gen. 1:26-28; 2:22-24.


   Human beings were made a new and distinct order. They were created
as sexual beings. The Creator entrusted them with the power of procrea-
tion, the ability to populate the earth with other persons like themselves.
Whereas animals and the other lower forms of life reproduce instinctively,
God intends that human procreative powers should be subject to divine
principle and reason. God designs that humanity's sexual expression
should be within the loving bonds of marriage.
2. What other purpose besides that of reproduction is served by
   humanity's sexual powers? Prov. 5:18-20; compare 1 Cor. 7:3-5.


   In the first explicit reference to conjugal love (Gen. 4:1) Adam is said
"to know" his wife, Eve. The Hebrew term emphasizes intimate under-
standing of something gained by experience. The marriage privilege was
designed to bind two lives together in a sacred whole: heart to heart, mind
to mind, body to body, and will to will. It was intended to sweeten and en-
hance the blending of two lives in a deep, never-failing, supportive
relationship. The Apostle Paul extols the unmarried state as more blessed
for some people. (See 1 Cor. 7:32-40.) Even so, "marriage is honourable
in all, and the bed undefiled" (Heb. 13:4).
    An exalted relationship. "Those who regard the marriage relation as
one of God's sacred ordinances, guarded by His holy precept, will be con-
trolled by the dictates of reason.
    "Jesus did not enforce celibacy upon any class of men. He came not to
destroy the sacred relationship of marriage, but to exalt it and restore it to
its original sanctity. He looks with pleasure upon the family relationship
where sacred and unselfish love bears sway."—The Adventist Home, p.
121.
    "God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for its
originator the Creator of the universe. 'Marriage is honorable' (Hebrews
13:4); it was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one of the two in-
stitutions that, after the Fall, Adam brought with him beyond the gates of
Paradise. When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this
relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the
race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates the physical, the intel-
76
     lectual, and the moral nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.
     3. What happy picture of domestic wholeness is drawn by the psalmist
        as reflecting Heaven's ideal? Psalm 128:1-6.


         Human happiness derives from being in harmony with the will of the
     Creator. Marriage as a committed relationship is used in the Bible to il-
     lustrate the relationship God desires to have between Himself and His
     people. A marriage functioning in harmony with the divine plan provides a
     little heaven on earth.
        "The home circle should be regarded as a sacred place, a symbol of
     heaven, a mirror in which to reflect ourselves. Friends and acquaintances
     we may have, but in the home life they are not to meddle. A strong sense
     of proprietorship should be felt, giving a sense of ease, restfulness,
     trust."—The Adventist Home, p. 177.
       Ask yourself. How can my home be a "sacred place" in which family
     members may feel safe and loved?


E9 IL Under
      SIN-PERVERTED POWERS (Lev. 18, 20).
            the influence of their polytheistic religions the people of Egypt
     and Canaan commonly violated the marriage ideals the Creator had estab-
     lished for humans. The holiness—the wholeness—of the family was often
     fractured by bizarre, unnatural practices.
      4. How did God warn Israel of the seriousness of copying the immoral
         practices of the Egyptians and Canaanites? Lev. 18:1-5, 24-30;
         20:22-23.


      5. Incest was one practice among the Canaanites that violated the
         sanctity of the home. What rules did God give for marrying rela-
         tives? What punishment did violators incur? Lev. 18:6-18; 20:11,
         12, 14, 17, 19-21.


         The Code of Hammurabi (c. 1727 B.C.) and the Hittite Code (c. thir-
      teenth century, B.C.) both deal with prohibitions against incestuous unions.
      However, the Mosaic legislation (mid-fifteenth century, B.C.) provided the
      more extensive and thorough guidelines. Twelve articles are presented
      which cover fifteen prohibitions (Lev. 18:1-18; Deut. 22:30), the punish-
      ments for violation (Lev. 20), and certain curses (Deut. 27:20, 22, 23). Car-
      nal union or marriage with relatives was forbidden within two degrees of
      blood-relation or of non-blood relation. The nearest relatives who were
                                                                                77
permitted to many were first cousins. Like the other codes the Mosaic laws
have some omissions. Common custom was sufficient to control those
areas. Like English case law, when a Mosaic rule was laid down the prin-
ciple or spirit of the law was to be followed in other related situations.
6. What was another form of immorality that struck at the intimate,
   sacred circle of marriage? Which precepts of the Ten Command-
   ments were designed to protect the home at this point? Lev. 18:20;
   Ex. 20:14, 17.


7. In Israel's theocracy, what punishment befell those who committed
   adultery? Why? Lev. 20:10, 22-24.


   Dishonesty in marriage. "This commandment [seventh] prohibits all
immoral relations between the sexes, and since the illicit act is the result of
evil thinking, it also forbids mental uncleanness and lustful looks. Adultery
is unfaithfulness to the marriage relationship on the part of either husband
or wife. . . . Adultery is the breaking of a most solemn vow and the
betrayal of a most sacred trust. It is dishonesty in the most sacred and bind-
ing of all the relationships of life."—Taylor Bunch, The Ten Command-
ments (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association,
1944), pp. 121, 122.
8. How did the Lord regard the immoral use of the body for hire?
   Lev. 19:29; compare Lev. 21:9.


9. What perversions of the physical powers did the Lord strictly
   prohibit? Lev. 18:22, 23; 20:13, 15, 16.


   In these ancient guidelines to moral purity, which God gave His people,
we may see how sin perverts the sacred physical powers when we yield to
the temptations of passion. Such sins mar the holiness of God. They frac-
ture His ideal for a holy people. They destroy the wholeness of their per-
sons, their homes, and their families.
   "Homosexuality was uniformly condemned in the Old Testament as
an abomination, for which the punishment was death (Lev. 20:13). It vio-
lated the natural order of sexual relationships, and catered to perverted lust
rather than to procreation of the species"—R. K. Harrison, Leviticus, p.
192.

   Think it through. Reading these verses makes it apparent that noth-
ing but the highest standard of thought and conduct can be tolerated by the
78
Creator. Is my life consistent with this high standard? If not, what must I
do to correct the problem?
I11. SPIRIT-CONTROLLED POWERS (1 Cor. 6:13-20).
   The New Testament, like the Old, teaches that the physical powers are
sacred to the marriage bond.
10. What New Testament view of the human body strengthens the
    Christian's resistance to sins of the flesh and provides power to
    live a morally pure life? 1 Cor. 6:18-20.


   Like the ancient sanctuary, holy people—God's, by right of creation
and redemption—become temples, dwelling places of God through the
Holy Spirit. The presence and control of the Holy Spirit brings enabling
strength to resist sin and to live in harmony with God's will. And the
Christian glorifies the Creator, or brings honor to the Creator, by using all
his physical powers in accordance with the Divine plan.
   A willing slave. "Not your own. This is the sixth argument against the
vice of fornication. . . . Man does not belong to himself; he has no right to
use his powers according to the wishes and promptings of his unconverted
body. He is the property of God by creation and by redemption. Man is
bound to live mentally, physically, and spiritually as God directs, to the
glory of His name, and not to the gratification of fleshly desires. The con-
verted man is, indeed, a willing slave of Jesus Christ, . . who lives only to
please his Master."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 703.
11. What will the practice of any shade of immorality prevent? 1 Cor.
    6:9-10, 15; compare Rom. 1:26-27.


   As long as sin reigns, the demands of the carnal nature will break out in
deviant, immoral behavior. Modern civilized society has few restraints,
morally speaking. Our times mirror the age before the Flood and the times
of Sodom.
   Yet Christians must relate to their fellow beings as the Master did.
He reached out to publicans, adulterers and harlots, seeking through His
forgiving grace to win them back to the purity of God's ideal for their hap-
piness. His grace was saving grace; it did not confum the believer in his or
her sins. He said in effect, "God loves you. He accepts your repentance
and freely forgives you. Go and sin no more." (See John 8:11; compare
Luke 7:47-50.)
   Persons who practice homosexual life styles often argue that their
sexual orientation is natural. They want Christians to accept their form of
behavior as a normal option to heterosexual marriage.
                                                                          79
12. What is the Lord's answer to this current viewpoint? Can divine
    power change the lives of His children who have forsaken the
    Lord's design? 1 Cor. 6:9, 11; compare Gal. 5:16-25.


   God does not speak in such strong language because He wishes to
deny His children genuine happiness. Debasing habits ruin lives. Sin al-
ways breaks down and destroys. The divine counsel given in love is, "Re-
pent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
be your ruin." "For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith
the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye" (Ezek. 18:30, 32).
    Many students of the modern scene have concluded that homosexu-
ality is a learned behavior. The real issue is that handicaps, whether ac-
quired from inheritance, environment, or accident, cannot be made excuses
for sinning. A person may by inheritance or accident be incapable of a nor-
mal marriage relationship. But such handicaps do not provide a license to
live an impure life. The good news of the gospel is: "And such were some
of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor.
6:11, RSV). An alcoholic may never lose his disposition to drink until he
receives an immortal body at Christ's return. Yet by God's grace he can
live soberly now. A homosexual may feel that he can never escape his
deep-seated propensities, but by God's grace he too can live a morally pure
life.
13. The unnatural sins of the ancients—incest, adultery, homosex-
    uality, and prostitution—are prominent in modern society, as
    well. Sometimes even Christians succumb to their appeal. What
    should such widespread, brazen, and open conduct tell us about
    the times in which we live? Luke 17:26-30.


   Separate from sin. "The world is fast becoming ripe for destruction.
Soon the judgments of God are to be poured out, and sin and sinners are to
be consumed. . . .
   "There was a coming out, a decided separation from the wicked, an
escape for life. So it was in the days of Noah; so with Lot; so with the dis-
ciples prior to the destruction of Jerusalem; and so it will be in the last
days. Again the voice of God is heard in a message of warning, bidding
His people separate themselves from the prevailing iniquity."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 166.
14. With what words did Jesus describe the Creator's ideal for
    human beings created as sexual persons? Can persons live happy,
    useful lives as singles? Matt. 19:3-6; 1 Cor. 7:6-9.

80
   Jesus reaffirms God's ideal of monogamous marriage. The sexual
powers are sacred to this union and intended by the Creator to function
only in this hallowed, intimate marital relationship. The entrance of sin
into our world has altered human relationships to a large degree. While
marriage may not now be possible for each person, this in no wise permits
promiscuity on the part of single persons. By God's grace the sexual drives
can be sublimated. Worthwhile interests can be pursued leading to a rich
and rewarding life. Christian singles, as well as marrieds, are privileged to
live under the control and direction of the Holy Spirit, who indwells every
believer.
15. In what ways did Jesus honor the marriage institution when here
     on earth? John 2:1-11.


   "In both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage relation is
employed to represent the tender and sacred union that exists between
Christ and His people. To the mind of Jesus the gladness of the wedding
festivities pointed forward to the rejoicing of that day when He shall bring
home His bride to the Father's house, and the redeemed with the Redeemer
shall sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 151.
APPLYING THIS LESSON TO MY LIFE:
  • God's holiness calls me to live in moral purity before Him. Are there
    practices in my life that He is asking me to put away through His
    grace?
  • How does knowing that I am a temple for the Holy Spirit assist me in
    controlling my physical desires?
  • What practical steps can I take to develop a life of moral purity in
    thought and action when I am surrounded by sex-saturated media that
    continually appeal to my physical passions?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Marital Duties and
Privileges," The Adventist Home, pages 121-128; "The Builders of the
Home," The Ministry of Healing, pages 356-362.
SUMMARY: God's holiness extends to the hallowed precincts of the mar-
riage bed. "Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled" (Heb.
13:4). God's plan—when followed—will make the Christian home a little
heaven in which to go to heaven.

HoOlness and
Commlitment
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 26, 27. A study of the significance
of God's covenant promises and Israel's practice of making vows.

gW3 MEMORY TEXT: "What shall I render unto the Lord for all
 PM his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call
    upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord
    now in the presence of all his people" (Psalm 116:12-14).

OUR HOLY GOD KEEPS HIS WORD. His promises never fail. In like
manner His holy people are challenged to stand by their commitments.

          OVERVIEW: HOLINESS AND COMMITMENT

           Leviticus 26                        Leviticus 27

          Divine vows:                        Human vows:
     Covenant promises/curses                Dedication/tithe

SACRED VOWS TO GOD AND MAN. To a great extent the stability of
human society depends upon our truthfulness with one another. A man's
word should be as good as his bond. A promise is a sacred matter and
should be kept inviolate if at all possible. Our communities would soon be
in chaos if we could no longer depend upon one another's commitments.
    God is dependable. The same is true in the spiritual realm. How uncer-
tain human existence would be if we could no longer rely upon God's pro-
mises! He assures us through the prophet Malachi, "I am the Lord, I
change not" (Mal. 3:6). The apostle James characterizes our heavenly
Father as One "with whom there is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning" (James 1:17). The testimony of Scripture regarding Jesus is:
"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Heb. 13:8).
Our God is dependable.
    Taking God seriously. The religion of the Bible is placed in the form
of a covenant. The covenant is a committed relationship between God and
His people. It involves His promises, our obligations of obedience, and the
saving means to carry out those obligations. This week's study will focus
first on the divine promises made to Israel in the covenant. The Leviticus
26 record will be studied under the heading of Divine Vows.
    God takes us seriously. Strictly speaking Leviticus 26 and 27 stand
outside the literary structure of Leviticus, but they serve to cap and bind
82
      'together both halves. Chapters 1-16 deal with the sacrificial rites, and
       chapters 17-25 deal with holy living. Leviticus 26 emphasizes God's vows
       to His people (blessings/curses), while Leviticus 27 emphasizes Israel's
       vows to God. A vow is a sacred promise made to the Creator. It is not to
       be taken lightly. Christians may learn from Israel's example.
          "The people need to be impressed with the sacredness of their vows
       and pledges to the cause of God. Such pledges are not generally held to
       be as obligatory as a promissory note from man to man. But is a promise
       less sacred and binding because it is made to God? Because it lacks some
       technical terms, and cannot be enforced by law, will the Christian disre-
       gard the obligation to which he has given his word? No legal note or bond
       is more obligatory than a pledge made to the cause of God."—Ellen G.
       White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1056.
SUN   I. DIVINE VOWS: COVENANT PROMISES AND CURSES
         (Leviticus 26).
         The Covenant blessings and curses recorded in Leviticus 26 are similar
      in some respects to those recorded in Deuteronomy 28.
      1. In Leviticus 26 what major blessings are promised by the holy
         God to the people of Israel who are called to mirror His charac-
         ter?
         o Verses 3-5
         o Verses 6-8
         o Verses 9-10
      2. Besides receiving the natural results of living in harmony with
         God's physical and moral laws, what was the basis of Israel's
         prosperity? Isa. 60:1-6; compare Matt. 5:14-16.


         "God desired to make of His people Israel a praise and a glory.
      Every spiritual advantage was given them. God withheld from them noth-
      ing favorable to the formation of character that would make them repre-
      sentatives of Himself.
         "Their obedience to the law of God would make them marvels of pros-
      perity before the nations of the world. He who could give them wisdom
      and skill in all cunning work would continue to be their teacher, and would
      ennoble and elevate them through obedience to His laws. If obedient, they
      would be preserved from the diseases that afflicted other nations, and
      would be blessed with vigor of intellect. The glory of God, His majesty
      and power, were to be revealed in all their prosperity. They were to be a
      kingdom of priests and princes. God furnished them with every facility for
      becoming the greatest nation on the earth."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
      288.
                                                                              83
3. Spiritual Israel is not restricted to a certain land area but is scat-
   tered throughout the world. To what degree is spiritual Israel the
   inheritor of the material promises made to literal Israel? Rom. 9:6,
   7, 23-26; Gal. 3:27-29; compare Heb. 11:10, 16.



4. What was the greatest promise made in the covenant? What did it
   foreshadow? Lev. 26:11-13; compare Matt. 1:23; John 1:14; Rev.
   21:3.


5. If Israel should turn from her allegiance to God and break cov-
   enant with Him, what curses or judgments would fall upon them?
   Study the following verses in Leviticus 26:
     First curse, verses 14-1
     Second curse, verses 18-20

     Third curse, verses 21, 22
     Fourth curse, verses 23-26

     Fifth curse, verses 27-39
   Terrible as these scourges were, they were designed to save, not merely
to punish. God desired to lead His people to repentance and confession.
(See Lev. 26:40-43.)
   Relevance for me. The children of Israel were promised a blessing if
they obeyed God and a curse if they did not. Does the promise of a bless-
ing or a curse hold true today? What can I do to assure myself and my
church a blessing?
11. HUMAN VOWS: DEDICATIONS (Leviticus 27:1-25).
   Vows stand outside the requirements of the covenant relationship. God
does not demand them. But if a commitment is made, a word of promise
spoken, then it becomes a serious matter to violate the vow. Vows are
often made in a crisis situation. If God will heal me from this disease, will
deliver me from my enemies, will grant me a child, will bring me home
again—then I will dedicate my life, or my property to Him. On the other
hand, vows may be made under the prompting of the Spirit when appeals
are made to sustain God's cause. In gratitude to God individuals respond
with sacrificial pledges. When the initial conviction has passed, misgivings
sometimes arise and the temptation presents itself to disregard the vow.
The legislation of Leviticus 27 is designed to protect against this human
tendency.
84
6. What kinds of things could be vowed or dedicated to God?
  • Lev. 27:1-8
  • Lev. 27:9-13
  • Lev. 27:14-25
7. Often in Israel a person would make a vow to dedicate himself or
   herself to God. What was the nature of Absalom's vow made
   during his self-imposed exile in Syria? 2 Sam. 15:8.


   While Absalom's later actions demonstrated the insincerity of his vow,
the story provides an insight into how Israel made vows of this kind. In this
instance, Absalom promised that he would serve the Lord, if He would
bring him home again. Had the regulations permitted it, he would have
given the rest of his life to service in the sanctuary. But since this was not
possible, according to the specifications of Leviticus 27:1-8 he could sub-
stitute a money gift. The divine instruction provided a scale of values
based on sex and age. The highest price was set for men at their peak of
strength. The valuations are high in view of the fact that in Biblical times
the average wage of a worker was about one shekel per month. But the
priest was given the responsibility of applying the scale. (See Lev. 27:8.)
8. People's vows could be made in regard to little children. What
   vow did the childless Hannah make and with what results? Why
   was no money substituted for Samuel? 1 Sam. 1:11, 22, 25-28.


    Hannah's vow arose out of the great bitterness of her lot. In Biblical
times a childless wife often had to bear a good deal of reproach. Children
were earnestly desired. Hannah was faithful to her promise to give Samuel
to the service of the Lord at the sanctuary and to place on him the vow of
a lifelong Nazarite. (See 1 Sam. 1:11; Num. 6:1-21.) Hannah's vow
brought a spiritual revival to Israel through the long ministry of her priest-
prophet son, Samuel.
    Hannah fulfilled her vow. "Hannah's prayer was granted; she re-
ceived the gift for which she had so earnestly entreated. As she looked
upon the child, she called him Samuel—`asked of God.' As soon as the
little one was old enough to be separated from his mother, she fulfilled her
vow. She loved her child with all the devotion of a mother's heart; day by
day, as she watched his expanding powers and listened to his childish
prattle, her affections entwined about him more closely. He was her only
son, the special gift of Heaven; but she had received him as a treasure con-
secrated to God, and she would not withhold from the Giver His own."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 570, 571.
                                                                           85
     9. If an Israelite had second thoughts about his vow of giving to the
        Lord an animal used for sacrifice, could he "redeem" it by sub-
        stituting another for it? What if he had dedicated an animal that
        could not be sacrificed, or had dedicated his house? What was
        the procedure for exchange in these cases? Lev. 27:9-15.


    10. There are no examples in the Old Testament of persons who
        vowed to give their property to God—in part or in whole. But
        one striking example is recorded in the New Testament. What
        was the result? Acts 5:1-11.


       They broke their vow. "Deep conviction had rested upon all present,
    and under the direct influence of the Spirit of God, Ananias and Sapphira
    had made a pledge to give to the Lord the proceeds from the sale of certain
    ProPertY.
       "Afterward, Ananias and Sapphira grieved the Holy Spirit by yielding
    to feelings of covetousness. They began to regret their promise and soon
    lost the sweet influence of the blessing that had warmed their hearts with a
    desire to do large things in behalf of the cause of Christ. They thought they
    had been too hasty, that they ought to reconsider their decision."—The
    Acts of the Apostles, pp. 71, 72.
    11. If vows were not required, why was the failure to keep them
        regarded as such a serious matter? Deut. 23:21-23; Eccl. 5:4-6.


       "This is an age in which many consider their word as of little weight,
    and have small respect for their promises. While this may be expected of
    the world, there can be no excuse for any who bear the name of Christ to
    repudiate their promise. Yet how many unpaid pledges there are, how
    many broken vows!"—M. L. Andreasen, The Sanctuary Service, 2nd rev.
    (Washington, D. C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1947), p.
    121.
    Ponder this: When He returns will Christ fmd faith in me?
    M. HUMAN VOWS: TITHE (Lev. 27:30-33).
U
    12. In his distress as a fugitive from home and in response to the
        dream God gave him at Bethel, what vow did Jacob solemnly
        make? Gen. 28:20-22.




    86
   What shall we render unto the Lord? "Jacob was not here seeking to
make terms with God. The Lord had already promised him prosperity, and
this vow was the outflow of a heart filled with gratitude for the assurance
of God's love and mercy. Jacob felt that God had claims upon him which
he must acknowledge, and that the special tokens of divine favor granted
him demanded a return. So does every blessing bestowed upon us call for
a response to the Author of all our mercies."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
187.
13. How is the tithe described? What does that mean? Do these verses
    suggest that a person could borrow the Lord's tithes as long as they
    were repaid with an additional 20 percent? Lev. 27:30, 31.



   Just as holy people are separated from the world and dedicated to God,
so also is the tithe. It is intended to be separated from our increase and
dedicated to God. It is hallowed for His intended purposes.
    Withholding tithe. "The question has been raised whether it is legiti-
mate now to withhold the tithe if later a fifth is added to it. This question
reveals a misunderstanding of the words of Scripture. It was not a matter
of withholding tithe that demanded a fifth to be added. It was a question of
paying the tithe in kind, in wheat, barley, or whatever produce was tithed.
There might be cases in which a man needed wheat for sowing, and would
rather pay in money than in wheat. Under these conditions he might re-
deem the tithe by having the wheat appraised and paying this sum plus one
fifth. The withholding of tithe was never contemplated. . . . Only grain and
garden produce . . . could thus be redeemed. Cattle could not be redeemed
or exchanged."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 818.
14. How was the tithe figured on the lambs and calves of flocks and
    herds? Lev. 27:32, 33.


   The tithe reserved to God. "This law [Lev. 27:30] was not to pass
away with the ordinances and sacrificial offerings that typified Christ. As
long as God has a people upon the earth, His claims upon them will be the
same.
   "A tithe of all our increase is the Lord's. He has reserved it to Himself,
to be employed for religious purposes. It is holy. Nothing less than this has
He accepted in any dispensation. A neglect or postponement of this duty,
will provoke the divine displeasure. If all professed Christians would faith-
fully bring their tithes to God, His treasury would be full."—Counsels on
Stewardship, p. 67.
15. In Israel how was the tithe used? Why? Num. 18:20, 21, 26-28;
    compare Heb. 7:5.

                                                                          87
        We should distinguish between a "first" and a "second" tithe in the
    economy of Israel. Every third year a tithe was taken that was used by the
    individual to provide a feast for Levites, foreigners, widows, and orphans
    in his home town. (See Deut. 14:28, 29; 26:12, 13.) Although some
    scholars believe that this was the same tithe that was given for the support
    of the Levites and priests, which was diverted each third year for the care
    of these other persons, it is doubtful that it should be thought of that way.
    The tribe of Levi did not inherit territory as the other tribes; the "first"
    tithe was their inheritance. Thus, those tithes that were used to relieve the
    poor from time to time should be designated a "second" tithe. (See SDA
    Bible Commentary, vol. 1, on Deut. 14:29; 26:12.)
    16. How does the apostle Paul demonstrate that the tithing principle
        in support of the ancient priesthood is still valid to support the
        Gospel ministry in the Christian era? 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.


       "How changed the order of things in our day! The Lord's require-
    ments and claims, if they receive any attention, are left till the last. Yet our
    work needs tenfold more means now than was needed by the Jews.
       "The great commission given to the apostles was to go throughout the
    world and preach the gospel. This shows the extension of the work, and the
    increased responsibility resting upon the followers of Christ in our day. If
    the law required tithes and offerings thousands of years ago, how much
    more essential are they now!"—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 68.


n   SEARCHING QUESTIONS FOR TODAY:
      o Have I ever thought of Christianity as a covenant religion? What are
        my privileges and responsibilities as a believer in covenant relation-
        ship with God?
      o Have I broken or forgotten solemn vows I have made to God in the
        past? What shall I do about these broken promises?
    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Sacredness of
    Vows," Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 462-476.
    SUMMARY: Because our God is a covenant-keeping God, faithful in all
    His promises, His followers are called to be dependable people, absolutely
    trustworthy, faithful in keeping their promises both to God and to their fel-
    low beings.

Reverence for God
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 10:1-11; 20:1-5; 24:10-16, 23; 26:2.

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
PM     cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God
       acceptably with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a con-
       suming fire" (Hebrews 12:28, 29).
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD IS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE.
God's claim to reverence and worship is based upon the fact that He is the
Creator and to Him all other beings owe their existence. To know how to
come to God in reverence and how to serve Him with godly fear and love
should take first place in the lives of His people.

                OVERVIEW: REVERENCE FOR GOD

WITH ALL MY HEART, MY SOUL, MY MIND. When Jesus stated
the two principles on which "the law and the prophets" are based (Matt.
22:40) He selected a statement from Deuteronomy (6:5) as the first prin-
ciple and a statement from Leviticus (19:18) as the second. The statement
in the book of Deuteronomy reads: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." Al-
though this particular statement does not appear in Leviticus, the same
truth is taught there, as well.
    Reverence for God and for things that pertain to Him was strikingly
illustrated by two experiences that occurred during the Exodus. One of
these experiences involved two priests in high office, Nadab and Abihu,
the sons of Aaron. These men climbed Sinai with Moses, Aaron, and the
seventy elders after God had spoken the Ten Commandments. They saw
the glory of God and actually ate a covenant meal in His presence on the
mountain. (See Ex. 24:1, 8-11.) Later these two men died for their irrever-
ent actions in the sanctuary. God shows no partiality in His dealings with
people.
    The second experience involved an Israelite who was the son of a
 mixed marriage. We do not know his name. We are told that his father was

                                                                        89
      an Egyptian and his mother an Israelite. In a brawl he openly cursed and
      blasphemed the name of the Lord. The divine command was that he should
      be stoned to death.
         While God is love, He also is holy. Created beings should manifest
      awe and respect in His presence. As God is holy, so also is everything that
      is connected to His service: His Sabbath, His house of worship, and the
      worship services of the church. Our lesson this week encourages us to
      show a deeper reverence and respect for God and for things that are sacred
      to Him.

SUN   I. HOLY OFFICE (LEV. 10:1-11).
         The book of Leviticus records just two historical experiences, one in
      each half of the book. The first records the tragedy that befell the newly
      consecrated priestly family on their first day in holy office.
      1. What did Nadab and Abihu, the eldest sons of Aaron, do that
         brought an immediate response from God? Why was this judgment
         so sudden and apparently so harsh? Lev. 10:1, 2.


         Nadab and Abihu together with Aaron and their two brothers held
      the highest spiritual office in the nation. They functioned as mediators
      between a holy God and His people. They were to represent to the nation
      the kind of people God wanted them to be. Like Cain they chose to act
      contrary to God's instructions. They offered incense over coals from a
      common fire rather than from the consecrated fire on the altar of burnt of-
      fering. (See Lev. 16:12.) They also may have attempted to enter the Most
      Holy Place. (See Lev. 16:1, 2.)
      2. As God's spokesman, what explanation did Moses give for the direct
         divine judgment upon these priests? What significance does this
         have today for those who minister in holy office? Lev. 10:3.


          God's chosen should know better. "Moses' words may be loosely
      paraphrased, 'the closer a man is to God, the more attention he must pay to
      holiness and the glory of God.' The unspoken implication is that the sons
      of the high priest ought to have known better than to act so presumptuous-
      ly. . .. The greatest of all Israel's leaders, Moses, was denied the fulfilment
      of his lifelong ambition for slightly deviating from God's commands
      (Num. 20), 'because you did not believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes
      of the Israelites' (Num. 20:12)."—G. J. Wenham, The Book of Leviticus
      (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1979),
      p. 156.
         "There are men working in the capacity of teachers of the truth
      who need to learn their first lessons in the school of Christ. The con-
      90
 1 GeGGIGGiCIY                                                  IMMMI     ea
veiling power of God must come upon the hearts of the ministers, or they
should seek some other calling. If Christ's ambassadors realize the solem-
nity of presenting the truth to the people, they will be sober, thoughtful
men, workers together with God. If they have a true sense of the commis-
sion which Christ gave to His disciples, they will with reverence open the
word of God and listen for instruction from the Lord, asking for wisdom
from heaven that, as they stand between the living and the dead, they may
realize that they must render an account to God for the work coming forth
from their hands."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 142.

3. What evidently was the physical condition of the two priests when
   they carelessly began to minister at the hour of worship? Lev. 10:8-
   11.



   Rabbinic tradition indicates that Nadab and Abihu committed their
sacrilege under the influence of alcohol.

   "Nadab and Abihu would never have committed that fatal sin had
they not first become partially intoxicated by the free use of wine. They
understood that the most careful and solemn preparation was necessary
before presenting themselves in the sanctuary, where the divine Presence
was manifested; but by intemperance they were disqualified for their holy
office. Their minds became confused and their moral perceptions dulled so
that they could not discern the difference between the sacred and the com-
mon."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 361, 362.
4. Why were Aaron and his two remaining sons not permitted to show
   any signs of grief over the deaths of these members of their family?
   Lev. 10:6, 7.


5. When persons must be disciplined or reprimanded for wrongdoing,
   how do we injure them if we sympathize with their complaints?

    "The Lord would teach His people to acknowledge the justice of
His corrections, that others may fear. . . . The divine rebuke is upon that
false sympathy for the sinner which endeavors to excuse his sin. It is the
effect of sin to deaden the moral perceptions, so that the wrongdoer does
not realize the enormity of transgression, and without the convicting power
of the Holy Spirit he remains in partial blindness to his sin. It is the duty of
Christ's servants to show these erring ones their peril. Those who destroy
the effect of the warning by blinding the eyes of sinners to the real charac-
ter and results of sin often flatter themselves that they thus give evidence
of their charity; but they are working directly to oppose and hinder the
work of God's Holy Spirit; they are lulling the sinner to rest on the brink of
                                                                             91
       destruction; they are making themselves partakers in his guilt and incurring
       a fearful responsibility for his impenitence. Many, many, have gone down
       to ruin as the result of this false and deceptive sympathy."—Patriarchs
       and Prophets, p. 361.

          Stop and think: God punished Israel with death for taking lightly His
       laws and commands. What punishment can we expect if we fail to honor
       His laws today?

TRUE   11. SPIRITUAL WORSHIP (Lev. 20:1-5; 26:2).

       6. What temptation constantly confronted Israel throughout most of
          its history in Canaan? Does the temptation still bother Christians
          in the church today? Lev. 18:21; 20:1-5; compare 1 John 5:21.


          The practice of idolatry, even in its most brutal and degrading forms,
       was a constant enticement to Israel throughout the centuries from Sinai to
       the close of the Babylonian exile. The idolatry of the heart (see Eze. 14:3)
       has presented a temptation to every believer from Adam's time until now.
       The first commandment constantly calls for commitment and reaffirmation
       on the part of every believer: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me"
       (Ex. 20:3).
          First place in our affections. "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, un-
       created One, Himself the Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to
       supreme reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other ob-
       ject the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever we cherish that
       tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere with the service due Him,
       of that do we make a god. . . .
          " 'I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.' The close and sacred relation
       of God to His people is represented under the figure of marriage. Idolatry
       being spiritual adultery, the displeasure of God against it is fitly called
       jealousy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 305, 306.

       7. In addition to a repeated prohibition against idolatry, what two
          positive commands did God make that continue to have sig-
          nificance for Christians? Lev. 26:1, 2; compare 19:30.


          The Sabbath constantly points the believer to God as his Creator.
       The sanctuary, like the preaching of the Gospel in the church today, con-
       stantly points the believer to God as his Redeemer. Decay in Sabbath ob-
       servance and church attendance lead to forgetfulness of God.




       92
      8. What three important truths about the Sabbath does the Lord em-
         phasize in Exodus 31:13-17 that are still true for spiritual Israel
         (the church)?
        • Verses 13-14
         • Verses 15-16
         • Verse 17
         The Sabbath commandment a seal. The fourth commandment, the
      Sabbath command, closes the first table of the Ten Commandments. The
      first four commandments focus on our duty to the Creator. The fourth
      commandment functions like a seal to the ten precepts, inasmuch as it pre-
      sents the Creator of the heavens and the earth as the authority behind the
      Decalogue.
         Exodus 31 highlights three aspects of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a sign
      of: (1) God's power to sanctify or redeem from sin; (2) God's power to
      create; and (3) the covenant relationship between God and His people. To
      sanctify sinners—to separate them from sin—requires divine power to re-
      create a new life. (See Psalm 51:10; 2 Cor. 5:17.) The observance of the
      Sabbath by the believer points him to his Redeemer, and to the origins of
      the human family by the hand of God. Finally, the Sabbath recalls the
      covenant relationship: "I will . . . be your God, and ye shall be my
      people" (Lev. 26:12). The believer's covenant relationship with God is
      like the marital bond. It involves the warm and special love of a close heart
      union. (See Jer. 31:32, last part.)
          "The Sabbath is a sign of creative and redeeming power; it points to
      God as the source of life and knowledge; it recalls man's primeval glory,
      and thus witnesses to God's purpose to re-create us in His own image."
          "The Sabbath and the family were alike instituted in Eden, and in
      God's purpose they are indissolubly linked together.. . . God's love has set
      a limit to the demands of toil. Over the Sabbath He places His merciful
      hand. In His own day He preserves for the family opportunity for com-
      munion with Him, with nature, and with one another."—Education, pp.
      250, 251.

WED   9. How was the sanctuary to be treated by Israel? Lev. 26:2.


      10. Although a church building functions for Christians in a dif-
          ferent manner from that of the Israelite sanctuary, why should
          Christians guard their conduct in church as Israel did in the
          sanctuary? What counsel does Solomon give regarding a
          believer's conduct before God? Eccl. 5:1, 2.


                                                                                93
    "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is the
gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken by
Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agencies to prepare a people
for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there can enter
nothing that defileth...
    "Happy are those who have a sanctuary, be it high or low, in the city or
among the rugged mountain caves, in the lowly cabin or in the wilderness.
If it is the best they can secure for the Master, He will hallow the place
with His presence, and it will be holy unto the Lord of hosts."
    "It is too true that reverence for the house of God has become almost
extinct. Sacred things and places are not discerned; the holy and exalted
are not appreciated. . . . Would it not be well for us often to read the direc-
tions given by God Himself to the Hebrews, that we who have the light of
the glorious truth shining upon us may imitate their reverence for the house
of God? . . . We have reason even to be more thoughtful and reverential in
our worship than had the Jews."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp.
491, 492, 495, 496.
  Examine: Is my life such that God can accept my worship, wherever I
am? Can He accept my praise and prayers?
M. REVERENT SPEECH (Lev. 24:10-16, 23).
   The second experience recorded in the book of Leviticus describes a
brawl that took place between two men in the camp. One was a full-
blooded Israelite. The other man was part of the "mixed multitude" (Ex.
12:38) who had cast in their lot with Israel when the nation made its ex-
odus from slavery. The man's father was an Egyptian. His mother was an
Israelite of the tribe of Dan.
11. In the heat of the quarrel what did the man do? What was so
    serious about this sin that led the judges to seek direct counsel
    from God? Lev. 24:10-12.


12. What direction did God give? Explain why the judgment was so
    severe. Why were the witnesses to lay their hands on the head of
    the condemned man? Lev. 24:14-16, 23; 5:1.


   Directions had been given previously on how to deal with a person who
rebelled against his parents and cursed them. (See Ex. 21:17.) But no
guidance had been given for a situation in which a person would rebel
against God by blaspheming and cursing. Blasphemy is the act of insulting
or showing contempt for God. The angry, irreverent speech that boiled up
disclosed the man's real attitude. The punishment seems severe to us who
live in modern permissive societies. Yet the punishment of this man saved
others from falling into a state of rebellion and defiance.

       =Wile@                                                         rrigl
         Love and justice require retribution. "There are those who will ques-
      tion God's love and His justice in visiting so severe punishment for words
      spoken in the heat of passion. But both love and justice require it to be
      shown that utterances prompted by malice against God are a great sin. The
      retribution visited upon the first offender would be a warning to others,
      that God's name is to be held in reverence. But had this man's sin been
      permitted to pass unpunished, others would have been demoralized; and as
      the result many lives must eventually have been sacrificed."—Patriarchs
      and Prophets, p. 408.
         Blasphemy is a violation of the third commandment. "Thou shalt
      not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold
      him guiltless that taketh his name in vain" (Ex. 20:7). In the Bible the term
      name really denotes personhood and character.

16J   13. What character attributes are implied by God's name? Ex. 34:4-7.


      14. How do God's followers honor His "name"? How would they
          defame it? How is the name of God "hallowed" in answer to
          Jesus' prayer? Matt. 6:9; compare 1 Tim. 6:1.


         Taking the name of the Lord in vain relates not only to speech but to the
      whole of living. Christians are baptized "in the name" of the Father, and
      of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. (See Matt. 28:19.) Consequently we
      honor or mar God's holy name by the kind of lives we live, just as parents
      are "known" by the actions of their children. It is a privilege to be called
      by God's name, to be a child in His family. It is also a serious responsi-
      bility that we cannot take lightly.

         "This name is hallowed by the angels of heaven, by the inhabitants
      of unfallen worlds. When you pray, 'Hallowed be thy name,' you ask that
      it may be hallowed in this world, hallowed in you. God has acknowledged
      you before men and angels as His child; pray that you may do no dishonor
      to the 'worthy name by which ye are called.' James 2:7. God sends you
      into the world as His representative. In every act of life you are to make
      manifest the name of God. This petition calls upon you to possess His
      character. You cannot hallow His name, you cannot represent Him to the
      world, unless in life and character you represent the very life and character
      of God. This you can do only through the acceptance of the grace and
      righteousness of Christ."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 107.
      15. Where does the spirit of irreverence or blasphemy originate?
          Matt. 15:19.



                                                                                 95
16. Can a blasphemous person experience conversion and come to live
    a reverent life? 1 Tim. 1:12-15.


   "Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all who
come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we may come before
Him with confidence, but we must not approach Him with the boldness of
presumption, as though He were on a level with ourselves. There are those
who address the great and all-powerful and holy God, who dwelleth in
light unapproachable, as they would address an equal, or even an inferior.
There are those who conduct themselves in His house as they would not
presume to do in the audience chamber of an earthly ruler. These should
remember that they are in His sight whom seraphim adore, before whom
angels veil their faces. God is greatly to be reverenced; all who truly real-
ize His presence will bow in humility before Him.'' My Life Today,
p. 281.
APPLY TO MY LIFE:
  • What can I do to make the observance of the Sabbath in my home a
    greater spiritual benefit to me and the members of my family?
  o Does my present conduct in the home and in the work place reflect
    reverence for God?
  o How can I encourage others to love and reverence God?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Behavior in the
House of God," Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 491-500.
SUMMARY: The first table of the Ten Commandments defines our duty
to God. The experiences and counsels recorded in the book of Leviticus
clarify this aspect of the Decalogue by teaching us about the holiness and
awesomeness of the God we serve. Cheerful observance of the Sabbath
and faithful attendance at the services of the church will keep God at the
center of our experience. His divine presence in our lives will enable us to
serve Him reverently.

 ARE YOU GETTING READY
FOR MARRIAGE OR JUST FOR
THE WEDDING CEREMONY?     The dress. The flowers. The muss.
                        You want everything to be just right
                        for that special moment when the two
                        of you say, "I do!" But a marriage is
                        more than a wedding. Now is the time
                        to talk about what you want your
                        relationship to be like. What you
                        expect of the one you will marry. The
                        strengths you both possess that will
                        help make your marriage a lasting
                        one. Could there be some weaknesses?
                        Conflicts? How do you plan to deal
                        with these? What are you afraid of in
                        marriage? How will decisions be made?
                        What about a house? Kids? Your career?
                           Your church cares about your
                        marriage. That's why Home and
                        Family Service has produced a special
                        guide called "Togetherness, Oneness,
                        Joy." It's designed to be used by you
                        both with your pastor to explore your
                        attitudes on a number of topics that
                        are important to the development of a
                        healthy marriage. Ask your pastor
                        about this premarital program, contact
                        your Adventist Book Center, or use the
