    I have training as a pilot and a minister. My wife, who is a dentist, shares my
goals and interest in mission service. When the call came from the General
Conference to go to Brazil from our home in Mexico we didn't hesitate.
                         What Are We Doing?
     Primarily I am a pilot, but also a minister to isolated people groups. Our
amphibian plane reaches jungle areas that would require a three-week boat trip.
Already we've helped raise several new groups of believers who now worship the
true God. My wife cares for our three children, and gives me a lot of loving support.
Our financial, physical and human resources are not many, but we do our best and
try to be useful in God's work.

Would We Come Again? Yes, Without Any Doubt!
     Missionaries Still Needed: The General Conference Secretariat currently has
calls for over one hundred inter-division workers, primarily in health care,
teaching, and administrative professions. Applicants must have specific academic
qualifications, successful experience, and good recommendations. For details,
write to Secretariat Information Service, 6840 Eastern Avenue, N.W., Washington

       Meet the Author of This
  Quarter's Sabbath School Lessons
   Until his retirement in 1987, Elder
Carl Coffman chaired the Department
of Religion at Andrews University,
where he joined the staff in 1975. He
began his career as a pastor in North-
ern California Conference. Later he ac-
cepted a position as teacher in the
Department of Religion at Pacific Union
College before moving to Andrews
University.
   Elder Coffman has directed youth
camps, held many academy weeks of
prayer, and conducted workshops
throughout North America in soul-win-
ning dynamics, the Holy Spirit,
righteousness by faith, the mission of the church, and the three angels'
messages. Because of his inspirational and informative teaching stu-
dents have been brought closer to Christ, and many theology students
have received the much-needed training for the ministry. Elder
Coffman's instruction regarding pastoral-evangelistic work has
launched many a young person into a program of successful soul win-
ning.
   Elder Coffman received his BA. at Pacific Union College and his
M.A. and Master of Divinity degrees from Andrews University. He has
written numerous articles for Adventist publications, published three
books, and currently is working on three more. He teaches part time in
the Department of Religion at Pacific Union College. The Coffinans
have two adult daughters.
             Introduction to Revelation 12-22
    This quarter we study the second half of "the Revelation of Jesus Christ,
which God gave . . . by his angel unto his servant John," and which con-
tains many "things which must shortly come to pass" (Rev. 1:1). We begin
a new line of prophecy in chapter 12 that continues to the end of the book.
    We see in these chapters the church of God continually in conflict with
evil during the climactic days of the great controversy between Christ and
Satan. Our Lord also pictures the thrilling triumph of the church. In sym-
bolic language He describes the return of the King of kings to rescue His
people, the millennium, and the re-creation of the earth. He promises to live
with His people (Rev. 21:1-3) in an even closer relationship than He en-
joyed with earth's first parents in the garden of Eden.
    The Lord does not want us to treat these messages lightly. Through Ellen
White, He has said: "The solemn messages that have been given in their
order in the Revelation are to occupy the first place in the minds of God's
people. Nothing else is to be allowed to engross our attention."—Tes-
timonies, vol. 8, p. 302. (Italics supplied.) We are instructed: "When the
books of Daniel and Revelation are better understood, believers will have
 an entirely different religious experience. They will be given such glimpses
of the open gates of heaven that heart and mind will be impressed with the
character that all must develop in order to realize the blessedness which is
 to be the reward of the pure in heart."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 114.
    We surely need the "great revival" that will come when we understand
 the book of Revelation. (See Testimonies to Ministers, p. 113.) What a chal-
 lenge to each of us to dig this quarter as never before into chapters 12-22.
 Truly, the content merits seven study periods each week. If you have lost
 the daily study habit, what a critical time to renew it. In a very special sense
 "the time is at hand," for these "things . . . must shortly come to pass"
 (Rev. 1:3, 1). The messages of these chapters allow for no lukewarmness—
 time is too late for that. There are enough signs of Jesus' return exploding
 around us to emphasize the timeliness of these lessons.
    It is helpful to remind ourselves of the sections in the first part of Revela-
 tion, the historical section (chapters 1-14), that parallel the sections of the
 end-time or eschatological part (chapters 15-20). Comparing the emphases
 of these corresponding sections our understanding of the book is enhanced.

God's Church Pursued
and Protected
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 12:1-16

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "For I am jealous over you with godly
 PM   jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may
      present you as a chaste virgin to Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:2).
JESUS KNOWS OUR STRUGGLE. Using the symbol of a pure woman,
in contrast with the impure woman of chapter 17, Christ portrays the
struggles and stamina of the Christian church, particularly through the cen-
turies since His incarnation. Although the devil opposes us with great
wrath, we are to remember that Christ has defeated him. In Revelation 12
we are given the formula for victory over the evil one.

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 12:1-16

      12:1                12:2, 4, 5, 10, 11           12:3, 4, 6, 7-16

 The Woman of             The Child of the           The Dragon and the
     Light                    Woman                       Woman


CHRIST TRIUMPHS DESPITE SATAN'S EFFORTS. The history of
God's people, from the time when our first parents fell into sin until the
end of probationary time, is a scene of continual harassment by Satan
and his forces. The dragon, the serpent, the devil, Satan, has aimed at the
same goal throughout history: to oppose God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, His
church, His leaders, and His faithful people. History records blood
spilled, dungeons, prisons, beheadings, the stake, opposition from
without and from within. How tragic that the history of the church was
not always a fulfillment of Christ's prayer, "that they all may be one"
(John 17:21).
    God's power is greater than Satan's opposition. God's power
manifested through His people has moved the world in the past, is moving
it in many places today, and will move it mightily in the near future. Such
is predicted in the Word. God's Word will never fail!
    In this lesson the key point is that God has always triumphed de-
spite Satan's energetic but awful plottings. We will gather much courage
from this fact, and a renewed faith that His final triumph is indeed im-
minent.

I. THE WOMAN OF LIGHT (Rev. 12:1).

1. Describe the woman by whom Christ represents His church on
   this earth? Rev. 12:1, 2.


   Compare the "woman" symbol in Revelation 12:1 with the "woman"
symbol in Revelation 17:1--6. They are as opposite as human language can
portray them. Then read Jeremiah 6:2 and 2 Corinthians 11:2 and sum-
marize the Old and New Testament descriptions of the type of woman that
represents God's people. (Compare Isa. 54:5, 6; Hosea 2:19, 20.)
   The true church in every age. "Since she is presented as about to give
birth to Christ (see vs. 2, 4, 5) and later as being persecuted, following the
ascension of Christ (vs. 5, 13-17), she represents the church of both the OT
and the NT."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 807.
   Because the prophecy of Revelation 12 was given in the first century of
Christian church history, the primary emphasis is on the New Testament
period of the church.
2. What is symbolized by the sun that clothes the woman described
   in Revelation 12:1? Ps. 84:11; Matt. 13:43; John 8:12; Rom. 13:
   12-14.


   The righteousness of Christ is bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit
when we accept Jesus as Saviour and Lord. (See Eph. 3:16, 17; John
14:17, 20; Eze. 36:27.)
   Christ's light is for all. "God is light; and in the words, 'I am the light
of the world,' Christ declared His oneness with God, and His relation to
the whole human family. It was He who at the beginning had caused 'the
light to shine out of darkness.' 2 Cor. 4:6."—The Desire of Ages, p. 464.
3. What is represented by the moon upon which the woman of
   Revelation 12:1 is standing? Compare Eph. 2:19-22.


   Just as the moon reflects the glory of the sun, so the Scriptures, written
by "holy men of God . . . as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter
1:21), reflect the glory of Christ. (See John 5:39; Luke 24:27, 44.) To say
that the church is founded on the Word of God (the Bible) is just another
way of saying that it is founded on Jesus Christ. The church stands upon
the entire Word of God, both Old and New Testaments. It is not convinc-
ing to argue that, because the woman is about to give birth to Christ, the
moon represents only the Old Testament. As Revelation 12 indicates, the
woman represents the church throughout the Christian era. This church
                                                                             7
brings forth Christ to the world as He is presented in the Scriptures of both
Old and New Testaments.

4. What is symbolized by the crown of 12 stars worn by the virtuous
   woman of Revelation 12:1? Rev. 3:11; compare Heb. 11:12; Rev.
   21:12, 14.


        The crown represents the spiritual victory and eternal life given to
    believers in the here and now. (See John 3:36; 5:24; 1 John 5:4, 11-13.)
    Stars in Scripture quite often symbolize God's faithful people as a whole.
    (See Dan. 8:10; 12:3.) The number 12 usually has reference to either the 12
    tribes of Israel, or the 12 apostles who are representative of the Christian
    church. However, the number does not have exclusive reference to the 12
    patriarchs and 12 apostles. It is often used to include all of God's people
    who are symbolized by the patriarchs and apostles. (Compare Matt. 19:28
    with 1 Cor. 6:2; see also James 1:1.)
        The 12 stars of Revelation 12:1 are a symbol of the totality of God's
    faithful people who are following the divine principles given to Israel and
    the Christian Church, and who are allowing the light of truth to shine
    through them. "As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stood as
    representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles stand as representatives of
    the gospel church."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 19 (emphasis supplied).

    5. Why is it important that we walk in the light? 1 John 1:5-7; Matt.
       5:14-16.


        Christ is our light. "No other light ever has shone or ever will shine
    upon fallen man save that which emanates from Christ. . . . Humanity has
    in itself no light. Apart from Christ [born of the woman in Revelation 12:2]
    we are like an unkindled taper, like the moon when her face is turned away
    from the sun; we have not a single ray of brightness to shed into the dark-
    ness of the world. But when we turn toward the Sun of Righteousness,
    when we come in touch with Christ, the whole soul is aglow with the
    brightness of the divine presence."—Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,
    pp. 39, 40.
       Revelation 12:1 pictures the entire church "aglow" with God's pres-
    ence. It is that kind of church that will move the world, and stir the devil
    to wrath.
       The significant issue. Am I reflecting Christ's righteousness to others?
    Are my spiritual feet firmly planted on His Word? Am I wearing the crown
    of spiritual life and victory now?

®   11. THE CHILD OF THE WOMAN (Rev. 12:2, 4, 5, 10, 11).
        The woman's Child (Rev. 12:2) is the source of her light. As will be-
    8
come apparent, Revelation 12 makes a number of very significant points
about the Lord of the church.
6. To what experiences of the virtuous woman does John refer? Rev.
   12:2-4; compare John 16:20-22; Matt. 2:16-18.



  •Revelation 12:2 refers to the church travailing to bring forth the gospel •
message to the world. (See Gal. 4:19.) In every era Christian believers in
various places have faced spiritual and political opposition in their efforts
to bring forth Christ to those who do not know Him.
   The woman's son was God incarnate. The Son of God was willing to
"empty" Himself (Phil. 2:7), to lay aside for a time the use of His divine
attributes of omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, and glory. He be-
came a human like us, born of a woman. This is condescension beyond our
comprehension.
7. To what event, or events, does Revelation 12:10 refer? Compare
   Heb. 2:14; John 12:31-33.


    Revelation'12:10 does not refer exclusively to the original expulsion of
Satan from heaven. The Revelator is enthusiastically extolling the eternal
benefits of Calvary. The Lamb has won salvation by His death. (Compare
Rev. 5:9, 10.) The victory of the cross has resulted in "the accuser of our
brethren" being "cast down." Now eternal life can be bestowed upon all
repentant people whether they lived before or after the cross. (See 1 Cor.
15:17-23; Heb. 9:15). Calvary is not only central to our salvation but also
is the guarantee that the universe will be forever cleansed of the results of
Satan's rebellion.
8. To what does the last part of Revelation 12:5 refer?



   The three reasons for identifying the child as Christ are:
   • Christ was the One whom the devil attempted to destroy (Rev. 12:4;
     Matthew 2; John 18, 19).      •
   • Christ will "rule all nations with a rod of iron" (Rev. 19:15; 2:27;
     Psalms 2:9; 89:23).
   • Christ "was caught up unto God, and to his throne" (Mark 16:19;
     Luke 24:50, 51; Acts 1:6-11).
  What does Calvary mean to you? Christ suffered "the death which
was ours, that we might receive the life which was His."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 25. He ascended to minister the merits of His grace to all who
would accept Him. Have you accepted Him as Lord of your life? Do you
know Him as your best Friend?
                                                                            9
WED   DI. THE DRAGON AND THE WOMAN (Rev. 12:3, 4, 6, 7-16).

      9. Who is the red dragon of Revelation 12:3?


         In a primary sense the dragon is Satan. (Compare verse 9.) In a second-
      ary sense the dragon represents those earthly powers used by Satan to op-
      pose Christ, His truth, and His people. Satan worked through the Roman
      Empire to murder Christ and to attack the gospel and the early church
      (verse 4). Satan also used the medieval Papacy to drive the church into the
      wilderness, where she was pursued for 1260 years (A.D. 538-1798). (See
      verses 6, 13-16.) As we near the end of time, Satan will use an apostate
      religious-political union in an effort to destroy the remnant Christian
      church. (See verse 17; compare chapter 17.) Because the dragon of Revela-
      tion 12 has this fourfold application (Satan, the Roman Empire, the
      Papacy, and antitypical "Babylon"), it parallels the little horn powers
      mentioned in Daniel chapters 7 and 8.
      10. What powers are represented by the 7 heads and 10 horns of the
          dragon?
         "It seems reasonable to conclude that the seven heads of the dragon
      represent political powers that have championed the cause of the dragon,
      and through which the dragon has exercised his persecuting power.. . . The
      beast of ch. 13 and that of ch. 17 also had ten horns each. Some hold the
      ten horns of the dragon to be identical with those of these two beasts, and
      the latter to be identical with the ten horns of the fourth beast of
      Dan. 7 ."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 808.
         The same seven heads and ten horns are mentioned in three chapters of
      Revelation; chapters 12, 13, and 17. We know that five of the dragon's
      heads refer to kingdoms or nations that by John's time had fallen. (See
      Rev. 17:10.) The Old Testament brings to view five powers that before
      John's day successively attacked and subjugated the chosen people of God
      and attempted to destroy their religious belief. Some see those five nations
      as being Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece. The sixth
      head is thought to be the dragon, the political power that existed in John's
      day, the Roman Empire. The seventh head, thus, would be the most signif-
      icant world power that followed the Roman Empire, the medieval Papacy.
      As both Daniel and Revelation emphasize, the Roman Empire was divided
      into numerous political fragments, and the Papacy took its place as the
      major influence in the West.
         Whereas the heads are represented as successive world powers, the
      horns are spoken of as existing concurrently. (See Rev. 17:12-14; compare
      Dan. 7:7, 20, 24.) Because of the obvious relationship between Revelation
      12, 13, 17 and Daniel 2 and 7 we can conclude that the ten horns represent
      the parts into which the Roman Empire was finally divided. These parts
      became sovereign states, which at the end of time play a major role in
      supporting antitypical Babylon, "until the words of God shall be fulfilled"
      (Rev. 17:17).

ri 11. What part of the great controversy is dealt with in. Revelation
        12:7-13? See also Isa. 14:13, 14; Eze. 28:12-19; John 12:31.



         Satan's rebellion unexplained. Many have tried in vain to explain how
     a perfect and holy angel, "next to Christ," and "most honored of God"
     (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 35), could have turned against a perfect, holy,
     and loving God. Ellen White tells us clearly that "his disaffection was
     proved to be without cause" (p. 39), which marks it as beyond explana-
     tion. We do know that he was jealous of the position of Christ (p. 36), and
     that he introduced doubts about God's law (p. 37) which was a revelation
     of the very character of God (The Great Controversy, p. 467). He was
     "cast out" of heaven with all of the angels who agreed with him (2 Peter
     2:4).
         "At the time of the casting down of vs. 9, 10, 13 'the accuser of our
     brethren' had already been actively accusing 'them before our God day
     and night.' Obviously, the fall here referred to came after a period during
     which Satan had been accusing 'the brethren,' and it would therefore ap-
     pear that this cannot be the original casting out of Satan prior to the crea-
     tion of our earth."—USDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 810.
         We need to understand clearly the two occasions on which Satan was
     cast down: (a) before creation of the world; (b) when Christ conquered him
     at the cross. We live in the day of Satan's "great wrath" (Rev. 12:12), for
     he knows well his destiny and that he has left but "a short time." But his
      ultimate destruction is inevitable.
        The cross spelled Satan's doom. "Christ bowed His head and died,
     but He held fast His faith and His submission to God. . . . "Satan saw that
     his disguise was torn away. His administration was laid open before the
     unfallen angels and before the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself
     as a murderer. By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted
     himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth his work
     was restricted. Whatever attitude he might assume, he could no longer
     await the angels as they came from the heavenly courts, and before them
     accuse Christ's brethren of being clothed with the garments of blackness
     and the defilement of sin. The last link of sympathy between Satan and the
     heavenly world was broken."—The Desire of Ages, p. 761.
     12. To what period of Christian church history does Revelation
         12:14-16 refer? Compare Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:6, 14;
         13:5.


         In verse 14, the woman is nourished "for a time, and times, and half a
      time, from the face of the serpent." In verse 6, she is in the wilderness for
      1260 days. This same time period appears in Daniel and Revelation five
      more times. In Revelation 11:3, it also appears as 1260 days. In Daniel
      7:25 and 12:7 it appears as three and one-half times. In Revelation 11:2
      and 13:5 it appears as forty-two months. Using the year-day principle in
                                                                                11
     symbolic Bible prophecy, Adventists date this period as from A.D. 538 to
     A.D. 1798. Throughout this period of 1260 years the Papacy was ecclesi-
     astically supreme in some European countries. During the Middle Ages,
     western Europe gave homage to the Bishop of Rome. Those Christians
     who chose to follow God's Word were persecuted for their faith. Church
     and state combined to destroy them. God's hand was over His true church,
     preserving it from extinction.
        "Persecution opened upon the faithful with greater fury than ever
     before, and the world became a vast battlefield. For hundreds of years the
     church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity."—The Great
     Controversy, pp. 54, 55.
     WOULD I BE FAITHFUL IF ATTACKED FOR MY FAITH? List
     two occasions in your life on which you were attacked for your faith. Write
     down the Scriptures that were especially helpful in meeting the challenges.




        What can you do now to prepare for present or future challenges to your
     faith? List two approaches on the lines below.




In   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Review how Jesus acted
     when under attack. See 1 Peter 2:20-25; John 19:1-11. Read "Persecution

     SUMMARY: The devil has continually attacked Christ and His church.
     As Christ has triumphed in the past, so He will triumph in the future. There
     will be an army of the faithful ones whom He will take to His heavenly

The Remnant of Her Seed
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 12:17; 19:10.

SAB MEMORY TEXT: "And the dragon was wroth with the woman,
PM and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep
    the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
    Christ" (Revelation 12:17).
WHAT IT MEANS TO BELONG TO CHRIST. God has identified the
last-day phase of His true church on earth and has placed great responsi-
bilities on her shoulders. Christ claims as His those who allow His Spirit to
direct their lives. These are the ones who have the will, and receive the
power, to obey His law, and who joyfully receive the special messages He
has given through the prophets.


                 OVERVIEW: Revelation 12:17; 19:10

      Part 1                    Part 2                       Part 3

                               keepers                     of Jesus"


VITAL QUESTIONS FOR CHRISTIANS. In our first lesson, we iden-
tified the "woman" in Revelation 12 as God's true followers, His church
throughout history, particularly from the time when Christ lived here with
humanity. The first sixteen verses end with the date A.D. 1798, the closing
date of the 1260 years that the church spent in the "wilderness." In every
era to that point, God had true followers who suffered much for Him. At
times it appeared that they would be eliminated from the earth, but the
devil was not permitted to stamp them out.
    In the last verse of the chapter we are introduced to the "remnant" of
the woman's seed, who are bitterly opposed by the evil one. The vital
question is, Who are they? What does it mean that they "keep the com-
mandments of God?" Does God expect His people to keep all of His com-
mandments all the time? Or is His standard somewhat less strict than that?
What means does God provide to enable His people to reach the standard
stipulated in this verse?
    What is the "testimony of Jesus Christ?" Is it what His people say
 about Him, or what He says about Himself? There are many people in the
 world today who claim to be witnesses for Christ. Which of the many
 Christian groups should we identify as His remnant? If the "testimony of

                                                                           13
    Jesus" is what He says about Himself, to whom is He saying it, and what
    is He saying? Can we identify a Christian church that has received and is
    receiving special messages from Jesus? These are the pressing questions
    that are addressed in this lesson.
    I. THE FINAL REMNANT (Rev. 12:17).
®      Verses 1-16 of Revelation 12 repeatedly emphasize that the devil has
    angrily attacked Christ and His church throughout history. The context of
    verse 17 indicates that Satan's anger is displayed against the church after
    1798. The church of the "time of the end" (Dan. 12:7, 9) is the special
    mark of demonic attack.

    1. What does Daniel say about last-day attacks by Satan upon God's
       people? Dan. 11:44; 12:1.


       The little horns of Daniel 7 and 8 and the desolator of Daniel 9:26 and
    27, in their end-time applications, are designated the "king of the north"
    (Daniel 11:40-45). Satan uses this earthly power "to exterminate and ut-
    terly destroy many" (Dan. 11:44, RSV) before the end of the pre-Advent
    judgment. At the close of probation, when the righteous have been legally
    vindicated (Dan. 7:22), and the little horn power, or "king of the north,"
    has been condemned (Dan. 7:26), Christ arises to execute the decisions of
    the court. Then Satan's wrath finally boils over, for then "shall be a time
    of trouble, such as never has been since there was a nation till that time"
    (Dan. 12:1, RSV). But the dragon's anger, which threatens to exterminate
    God's people, is circumscribed by divine intervention.

    2. How does John reiterate Daniel's wonderful assurance that God's
       people will be sheltered from the dragon's wrath? Rev. 3:10; com-
       pare 7:14, 15.



    3. In past ages who were the "remnagt" spoken of by Bible writers?
       1 Kings 19:18 (compare Rom. 11:4, 5); Isa. 10:22.



       In the Old Testament a "remnant" is often referred 10. Members of
    Jacob's family who were preserved under Joseph's care in Egypt were
    called a "posterity," literally a "remnant" (Gen. 45:7). Elijah protested to
    God, "I, even I only,• am left; and they seek my life, to take it away"
    (1 Kings 19:14). God reassured him that a faithful remnant still remained
    (verse 18).
       When kings and generals of Assyria and Babylon invaded Palestine
    they left, or allowed to escape, remnants of Israel and Judah. (See 2 Chron.
    30:6; Isa. 10:20-22; 37:31; 2 Kings 19:4, 30, 31; Jer. 23:3; 50:28.)

    14
          The New Testament speaks of a "remnant" of Jewish people who, as
      individuals, had accepted Christ as the Messiah. They were Christian Jews
      in the first century. The majority of Jews did not accept Christ, but a "rem-
      nant" responded to God's provision of grace.
         God always preserves a faithful remnant. In every era of history when
      the majority have turned away from God, He has had a faithful "remnant."
      The remnant may be a minority, but it is not necessarily a small group.
      Sometimes in history it has been quite a large group. The remnant has con-
      sistently been given the special mission of carrying on God's work in the
      earth, preserving His truth and handing it on to those around them.

MON   4. What does the term remnant mean in Revelation 12:17? Reread
         verses 14-16 in contemplating the answer to this question.


         At least two points need to be understood here. First, we must explain
      the term in light of the context. Second, there is no evidence for suggest-
      ing that we can expect a number of "remnants" to arise in fulfillment of
      Revelation 12:17. There have been many "remnants" in history, but here
      is pictured a final remnant at the close of time. The Greek word translated
      "remnant" means "remaining ones." The corresponding verb means "to
      leave," "to leave behind." The "remnant" of Revelation 12:17 refers to
      those of Christ's true followers (His church) who would remain after the
      close of the 1260 years in 1798. According to Daniel 12:7, 9 this date
      marked the beginning of the "time of the end."
      5. Why do we Seventh-day Adventists believe our church to be the
         "remnant" church?
         "From the very first, Seventh-day Adventists have boldly proclaimed
      the three messages of ch. 14:6-12 as God's last appeal to sinners to accept
      Christ, and have humbly believed their movement to be the one here des-
      ignated as the 'remnant.' " No other religious body is proclaiming this
      composite message, and none other meets the specifications laid down in
      ch. 12:17. Hence none other has a valid, scriptural basis for claiming to be
      `the remnant' of v. 17.
          "However, Adventists repudiate emphatically and unequivocally any
      thought that they alone are children of God and have a claim upon heaven.
      They believe that all who worship God in full sincerity, that is, in terms of
      all the revealed will of God that they understand, are presently potential
      members of that final 'remnant' company mentioned in ch. 12:17."—SDA
      Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 815.

          Do you belong to God's "remnant?" The remnant people are sur-
       vivors. How about you? Do you find it difficult to resist the pull of the
       world? Check below some of the things that you can do to identify more
       closely with the survivors (remnant) in these dangerous times:
               Avoid worldly friends whose spiritual influence is negative.
               Identify more closely with people who help me spiritually.
                                                                                 15

            Spend more time alone with God in prayer and Bible study.


En   H. THE REMNANT COMMANDMENT KEEPERS (Rev. 12:17).

     6. In the book of Revelation, which is called "the revelation of Jesus
        Christ" (Rev. 1:1), what first piece of evidence does the Lord give
        that certain people are His last-day remnant? Rev. 12:17, second
        part.


        The remnant are here identified as commandment keepers long after the
     time claimed by so many that the law had been abolished. Many Christians
     date the doing away with the commandments from the time of Christ's
     crucifixion. The New Testament teaches that the Ten Commandments, as
     exemplified in the life of Christ, are the standard of righteousness for
     Christians. (See Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; James 2:10-12; 1 John 2:4.)

     7. What does Jesus say a person must have in order to keep His com-
        mandments? John 14:15; 1 John 4:7, 8.



     8. What is the secret of power to do God's will? John 15:5, 7; com-
        pare 1 John 5:2-5.


        Jesus emphasized, "Without Me ye can do nothing." To illustrate this
     mathematically this means that, without His help, we can do "0.00." We
     can never add our "1" at the end, to indicate that we can do "something"
     without Him. Most of us tend to feel that we can do a little obeying in our
     own strength. Quite the contrary, we are totally dependent on Him. Only
     when Christ's love reigns in our hearts can we keep His commandments.
        Christ is the Source of spiritual life and power. "You are just as de-
     pendent upon Christ, in order to live a holy life, as is the branch upon the
     parent stock for growth and fruitfulness. Apart from Him you have no life.
     You have no power to resist temptation or to grow in grace and holiness.
     Abiding in Him, you may flourish. Drawing your life from Him, you will
     not wither nor be fruitless. You will be like a tree planted by the rivers of
     water."—Steps to Christ, p. 69.

        Our wills are involved. "You cannot change your heart, you cannot of
     yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You
     can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do accord-
     ing to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be brought under the
     control of the Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him,
     your thoughts will be in harmony with Him."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.

     16
9. To what extent does Christ wish His people to keep His law? Rom.
   8:3, 4.


    Christ died "in order that the righteous requirements of the law might
be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but
according to the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4, NW). The word translated "righteous-
ness" in the KJV of this verse means "regulation, requirement, command-
ment." Sometimes it means "righteous deed." The verb "might be ful-
filled" (KJV) comes from the Greek word that means "complete, finish,
bring to an end." The same verb in Revelation 3:2 is translated "perfect"
(KJV, RSV). The force of Romans 8:4 is that Christ's sacrifice for us and
the work of His Spirit within us make it possible for the righteous require-
ments of His law to be perfectly fulfilled in our lives.
    In harmony with every precept as Jesus was. "He tells us to be per-
fect as he is, in the same manner. We are to be centers of light and bless-
ing to our little circle, even as He is to the universe. We have nothing of
ourselves, but the light of His love shines upon us, and we are to reflect its
brightness. 'In His borrowed goodness good,' we may be perfect in our
sphere, even as God is perfect in His.
    "Jesus said, Be perfect as your Father is perfect. If you are the children
of God you are partakers of His nature, and you cannot but be like Him.
Every child lives by the life of his father. If you are God's children, begot-
ten by His Spirit, you live by the life of God. In Christ dwells 'all the full-
ness of the Godhead bodily' (Colossians 2:9); and the life of Jesus is made
manifest 'in our mortal flesh' (2 Corinthians 4:11). That life in you will
produce the same character and manifest the same works as it did in Him.
Thus you will be in harmony with every precept of His law; for 'the law of
the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul.' Psalm 19:7, margin. Through love
 `the righteousness of the law' will be 'fulfilled in us, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.' Romans 8:4."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, pp. 77, 78.
10. What is the significance of the Sabbath commandment for God's
    remnant people? Rev. 14:6, 7, 12; compare Ex. 20:8-11.



   The "remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God"
(Rev. 12:17), do not attempt to exclude the Sabbath commandment from
the list of Christ's requirements. The phrase in the first angel's message,
"and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the foun-
tains of waters" (Rev. 14:7), is an allusion to Exodus 20:11, which is part
of the fourth commandment. The first angel's message invites us to wor-
ship the Creator by remembering His holy seventh-day Sabbath.
   Holiness includes Sabbathkeeping. "The Sabbath given to the world
as the sign of God as the Creator is also the sign of Him as the Sanctifier.
[See Ex. 31:13.] The power that created all things is the power that re-
                                                                            17
creates the soul in His own likeness. To those who keep holy the Sabbath
day it is the sign of sanctification. True sanctification is harmony with
God, oneness with Him in character."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.
   Are you keeping God's commandments? Obedience to God's com-
mandments is never presented in the Bible as a means of salvation. But it
is often presented as the result and evidence of God's saving grace in the
heart. Do you enjoy present salvation in Christ? If so, living by His com-
mandments is your joy and privilege.
I11. THE REMNANT HAVE THE "TESTIMONY OF JESUS"
     (Rev. 12:17).
11. What other point of identification does God give for His rem-
    nant? What do you understand this identifying point to mean?
    Rev. 12:17; 19:10.


   The Greek of the last phrase in Revelation 12:17 translates literally,
"having the testimony (or witness) of Jesus." Note the following possible
meanings:
   a. The phrase could mean that the remnant give witness to Jesus.
Some translations reflect this meaning. The New Testament often speaks of
Christ's people witnessing for Him. (See John 1:6-8; Acts 1:22; 1 Cor. 2:1.)
   b. The phrase could mean that the remnant have the truth as it is in
Jesus. They retain this witness in their hearts. Other translations reflect this
idea, which is also apparent in the New Testament. (See Rom. 2:15; 8:16;
1 John 5:10; 1 Cor. 1:6.)
   c. The prophetic gift. There is a very real sense in the New Testament
in which the testimony of Jesus refers to special divine revelation given by
Jesus personally and through the prophets. (See John 3:11, 31, 32; John
15:27; Acts 10:43.) John bore record of the "testimony of Jesus Christ"
which was given to him in vision on Patmos (Rev. 1:2, 9, 10).

   The spirit of prophecy. Revelation 19:10 specifically identifies the
"testimony of Jesus" as "the spirit of prophecy." What is meant by "the
spirit of prophecy?" It could refer to an understanding of the prophecies
by those who study them. In this verse it has reference to a special gift
possessed by the angel, by John, and other prophets. This conclusion is
supported by Revelation 22:8, 9, a parallel passage. Just as the angel was
given the necessary revelation to pass on Christ's testimony to the world,
so was John.
    Special revelation in the remnant church. The "testimony of Jesus"
in the book of Revelation refers to more than testimony about Christ
believed and witnessed to by Christians. The "testimony of Jesus" refers
to the work of inspired prophets who, like John, have received visions,
dreams, and verbal communications from God to be given to the people of
earth. Revelation 12:17 teaches that the prophetic gift is to be manifested
in the remnant church.
18
 12. What did other Bible writers indicate regarding the prophetic
     gift in the last-day church? Joel 2:28-32; Eph. 4:11-14.



    The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes the following in regard
 to the work of Ellen G. White (1827-1915): "One of the gifts of the Holy
 Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church
 and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White."—"Fundamental
 Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists," Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook,
1987, p. 7. The belief is based on the fact that Ellen White's work meas-
 ures up to the Bible tests of a true prophet. This evidence includes the con-
 sistency of her writings with Scripture, the fruitage of her work, her
 successful predictions, her exaltation of Christ, as well as the timeliness,
 practical nature, and certainty of her messages. Her physical state while in
 vision is also supporting evidence. (See Arthur L. White, Ellen G. White, 6
 vols., Review and Herald, 1981-1986.)
 WHERE DO I STAND? Agree/Disagree Exercise:
1. God's remnant people should be a saving community.

4. The majority of God's faithful ones are in other churches.
    Agree Disagree
5. The "testimony of Jesus" is the prophetic gift.
    Agree       Disagree
  FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: What tests of a true prophet
3are given in these passages: Isa. 8:20; Rev. 22:18, 19; Matt. 7:15-20; Deut.
  18:21, 22; Jer. 28:9; 1 John 4:1-3. Read the portion of the chapter entitled
  "It Is Finished," The Desire of Ages, pages 758-764. Also read "The Test
  of Discipleship," Steps to Christ, pp. 57-65.

  SUMMARY: In light of the truths taught in Revelation 12:17, God has a
  last-day remnant church. The members of this church keep God's com-
  mandments by faith in Jesus, and accept the voice of the Holy Spirit in the
  writings of the Spirit of Prophecy.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 13:1-10.
SA'S MEMORY VERSE: "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye
Lai    may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle
       not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
       powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
       spiritual wickedness in high places" (Ephesians 6:11, 12).
CHRIST IS YOUR PROTECTOR. Revelation 13 depicts Satanic forces
that are pressing for allegiance from every living being. Each person's
decision will determine his or her eternal destiny. Christ assures His people
of divine watchcare and approval. The faithfulness of Christ's followers in
resisting Satan's tyranny will be acknowledged and rewarded by Heaven.

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 13:1-10

       13:1-3                   13:4-7                      13:8-10
     A new beast         The beast's appeal             Not all yield to
      described        for the world's worship        the beast's demands

WHO WILL HAVE OUR ALLEGIANCE? Revelation 13 and 14 con-
front two great issues: (1) Chapter 13 depicts the devil working through
earthly powers to demand our "worship." Chapter 14 presents God's invi-
tation for us to "worship" Him alone. (2) The related issue in both chap-
ters 13 and 14 is to whom will mankind pledge total loyalty, even in the
face of death? Humanity will finally be divided over this simple question.
    The heart of Revelation. Chapters 13 and 14 are the very heart of the
book of Revelation. As we devote seven lessons to the study of these two
great chapters, keep in mind the two major issues: Whom will we worship,
and to whom will we pledge our total loyalty?
    A warning for all. Our lesson this week unmasks the error and
blasphemy that have been thrust upon humanity for most of the Christian
centuries. The purpose of our study is not to condemn or defame any per-
son or any religious organization. The aim is to warn all of the importance
of discovering truth and yielding to the Lord. We must be assured that our
names are in His "book of life." Our faith must become strong so that we
can escape blasphemy against God and the rule of tyranny that will soon
fill the earth.

®   I. A NEW BEAST DESCRIBED (Rev. 13:1-3).
       Chapter 13 begins with the words, "And I stood upon the sand of the
    sea, and saw . . . " This would mean that John was the one standing and
    looking. The Greek text favors the reading, "And he stood . . . " The sug-
    gestion is that the dragon who had just been pictured warring against the
    remnant, stood on the seashore, awaiting the rise of this new wild beast,
    which he would invest with his own power and authority (verse 2).

    1. What is represented by the sea out of which this new beast arises?
       Compare Rev. 17:15; Isa. 17:12, 13.


       The beast of verse 1 arises where there are multitudes of peoples. The
    lamblike beast, which we will consider next week, arises where population
    is more sparse.
    2. List seven additional symbols in John's description of this beast.
       Rev. 13:1, 2.




       Parallels in Revelation. Compare the description of other wild beasts
    brought to view in symbolic Bible prophecy. (See Rev. 12:3; 17:3; Dan.
    7:4-7.) Heads, horns, and crowns are familiar in these passages.
       The seven heads. We discovered in our study of chapter 12 that the
    dragon represents primarily Satan, and secondarily the Roman Empire,
    which was used by Satan to persecute Christ. (See Rev. 12:4, 9.) Some in-
    terpreters regard the seven heads as seven major powers that have opposed
    God's truth and people: Egypt (Ex. 5-14), Assyria (2 Kings 17:1-8), Baby-
    lon (Dan. 7:4), Medo-Persia (Dan. 7:5), Greece (Dan. 7:6), pagan Rome
    (Dan. 7:7), and papal Rome (Dan. 7:8, 21, 24, 25). These seven powers are
    thought to be symbolized by the seven heads of the beasts John describes.
    The suggestion is that the seven heads of the dragon (chapter 12) are the
    same seven heads of the leopardlike beast (chapter 13) and the scarlet
    beast of chapter 17.
       Because this leopardlike beast has characteristics similar to the first
    three beasts of Daniel 7 (the lion, the bear, and the leopard), the power rep-
    resented would possess characteristics "prominent in the kingdoms of
    Babylon, Persia, and Greece."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 817.
       The ten horns. The Roman Empire of John's day was later divided. A
     comparison with Daniel 7:7, 8, 24 suggests that the 10 horns of the three
                                                                            21
beasts of Revelation (12, 13, 17) represent the national divisions into
which the Roman Empire was divided.

3. In the light of Daniel 7:24, 25 and Revelation 12 what conclusions
   are possible in identifying the leopardlike beast of chapter 13?



    The successor to the Roman Empire. "In chapter 13 . . . is described
another beast, 'like unto a leopard,' to which the dragon gave 'his power,
and his seat, and great authority.' This symbol, as most Protestants have
believed, represents the papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat
and authority once held by the ancient Roman empire. . . . [Rev. 13:5-7
quoted] This prophecy, which is nearly identical with the description of the
little horn of Daniel 7, unquestionably points to the papacy."—The Great
Controversy, p. 439.
    "In the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established. Its seat
of power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was de-
clared to be the head over the entire church. Paganism had given place to
the papacy. The dragon had given to the beast 'his power, and his seat, and
great authority.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 54.
4. What is meant by the statement that this new beast has "upon his
   heads the name of blasphemy"? What is blasphemy? Rev. 13:1;
   John 10:33; Luke 5:21.


   John predicted that it would be the nature of this power to blaspheme
holy things; God, His name, His tabernacle, and beings in heaven (Rev.
13:5, 6). The Greek word blasphemia means "slander, defamation, abusive
speech." Jesus' opponents accused Him of blasphemy because He claimed
to be God (John 10:33). Because He was God, Jesus was not blaspheming.
(See John 10:30; 5:18; 8:58; Col. 2:9.) Anyone else claiming divine
powers and prerogatives would be blaspheming. The Pharisees also ac-
cused Jesus of blasphemy because He forgave sins (Luke 5:21). Again they
were wrong. As God, Jesus could forgive sins. However, the Pharisees de-
fined blasphemy correctly. Any individual, apart from God, who claims
the power and the right to forgive sins is a blasphemer.

   Papal claims. The historical claims of the popes and Roman Catholic
councils are still regarded as official. Pope Leo XIII wrote on June 20,
1894: "We [the pope] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty."—
"The Reunion of Christendom," trans. in The Great Encyclical Letters of
Pope Leo XIII (New York: Benziger, 1903), p. 304; quoted in SDA Bible
Students' Source Book, Commentary Reference Series, vol. 9, p. 684.
   The Vatican Council (1869-1870) decreed the following: "If anyone
thus speaks, that the Roman Pontiff has only the office of inspection or
direction, but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the uni-
versal Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but
also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the Church
22
spread over the whole world; or, that he possesses only the more important
parts, but not the whole plenitude of this supreme power, or that this power
of his is not ordinary and immediate, or over the churches altogether and
individually, and over the pastors and the faithful altogether and individu-
ally; let him be anathema [cursed]."—Henry Denzinger, The Sources of
Catholic Dogma, translated by Roy J. Deferrari from the thirtieth Edition
of Henry Denzinger's Enchiridion Symbolorum (St. Louis: Herder, 1957),
p. 455, sec. 1831.
    The same Vatican Council decreed: "And so We . . . teach and explain
that the dogma has been divinely revealed: that the Roman Pontiff, when
he speaks ex cathedra, that is, when carrying out the duty of the pastor and
teacher of all Christians in accord with his supreme apostolic authority he
explains a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the universal Church,
through the divine assistance promised him in blessed Peter, operates with
that infallibility with which the divine Redeemer wished that His church be
instructed in defining doctrine on faith and morals; and so such definitions
of the Roman Pontiff from himself, but not from the consensus of the
Church, are unalterable."—Denzinger, p. 457, sec. 1839.
    The Council of Trent (1545-1563) decreed: "Our Lord Jesus Christ,
when about to ascend from earth to heaven, left behind Him priests as His
own vicars . . . as rulers and judges, to whom all the mortal sins into which
the faithful of Christ may have fallen should be brought, so that they in
virtue of the power of the keys may pronounce the sentence of remission
or retention of sins. . . . It also teaches that even priests who are bound by
mortal sin exercise as ministers of Christ the office of forgiving sins by
 virtue of the Holy Spirit conferred in ordination, and that they are of
erroneous opinion who contend that this power does not exist in bad
 priests."—Denzinger, pp. 275, 277, secs. 899, 902.
5. What is the meaning of the wounding of one of the beast's heads?
   At the conclusion of what period was the beast to receive the dead-
   ly wound? Rev. 13:3, 5.


   The word wounded comes from a New Testament Greek word meaning
"to slay," or "to slaughter." We might thus say that the head was "smit-
ten unto death."
    The rise and decline of the papacy. The 42 months of Revelation 13:5
is the same period as the "time, two times, and half a time" of Daniel 7:25
(RSV). Revelation 13:2, 3, 5 identify the 42 months with 1260 days (or
years). Revelation 12:6 and 14 identify the 1260 days with a "time, and
times, and half a time." Therefore 42 months are equal to the 3 1/2 times.
This is the period of 1260 years of papal supremacy (A.D. 538-1798).
    In connection with this period some believe that in A.D. 538 the papacy
suddenly rose to power, and in 1798, it took a sudden fall. It is more his-
torically correct to see the papacy as achieving a dominant position by 538.
By that date it had uprooted the barbarian nations known as the Heruli,
Vandals, and Ostrogoths. "Not until the rule of the Goths was broken
could the papacy be free to develop fully its power. In 538, for the first
                                                                           23
   time since the end of the Western imperial line, the city of Rome was freed
   from the domination of an Arian kingdom. In that year the Ostrogothic
   kingdom received its deathblow (although the Ostrogoths survived some
   years longer as a people)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 827. After
   538, the papacy continued to gain power and popularity for centuries.
      With the coming of the sixteenth-century Reformation the power of the
   papacy was weakened greatly in many European countries. Some countries
   rejected the Reformation, retaining papal ecclesiastical dominance and
   political influence into the eighteenth century. France was one of those
   countries. One of the causes of the French Revolution (1789) was the
   mounting opposition to the power of the papal church. In 1798, Berthier
   dealt it a deadly blow by taking the Pope prisoner. The papacy continued
   after 1798, but with diminished power. In 1870, the Papal States were ab-
   sorbed into the united kingdom of Italy. The temporal power of the papacy
   came to an end.

   6. The last part of Revelation 13:3 predicted the healing of the dead-
      ly wound. How has this taken place since 1870?


      The complete healing of the deadly wound is still future. "There was
   a gradual revival in papal life in the years following the revolution in
   France. The papacy suffered a new setback when in 1870 the Papal States
   were taken from it. A significant event occurred in 1929 when the Lateran
   Treaty restored temporal power to the pope, who was given the rule of
   Vatican City, a section of the city of Rome about 108.7 acres in extent.
   However, the prophet envisioned a much greater restoration. He saw the
   wound completely healed, as the Greek implies. Following the healing he
   saw 'all that dwell upon the earth,' except a faithful few, worshiping the
   beast (v. 8; cf. The Great Controversy, p. 579). This is still future. Though
   the papacy receives homage from certain groups, vast populations show it
   no deference. But that is to change."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp.
   817, 818.
      The change is becoming increasingly apparent. The United States has
   established diplomatic relations with the Vatican. With the present pope's
   policies, the modem papacy has become the most popular moral voice in
   the world. Non-Christians, as well as Protestants, admire and give credence
   to the pope's declarations.

WED H. THE BEAST APPEALS FOR THE WORLD'S WORSHIP (Rev.
        13:4-7).

   7. After the initial picture of the greatness of the leopardlike beast in
      verses 1-3, what twofold response does the amazed world make?
      Rev. 13:4.



      How the beast can be overcome. Here is predicted a world-wide rev-
   erence for, and worship of, both the beast and the power behind it. Christ's
   24
followers who refuse this false worship will be under attack. Jesus' words
are very comforting. (See John 16:33.) The secret of victory over the beast
power is given in Revelation 12:11: "They overcame him by the blood of
the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their
lives unto the death."
8. Who and what in particular are blasphemed by this leopardlike
   beast power? What effect on worship does this blasphemy have?
   Rev. 13:5, 6; compare Dan. 7:25; 2 Thess. 2:4.


   Although verses 5 and 6 indicate that the blasphemous work of the beast
will continue for 42 months (or 1260 years), verses 3 and 4 establish that,
after the healing of the deadly wound, the blaspheming will be revived.
    The objects of Satan's attack.
    • God's name. The leopardlike beast power has itself assumed divine
titles. (Compare 2 Thess. 2:4.) Historically it was responsible for rejection
of the seventh-day Sabbath, which especially draws attention to God's
name and authority. (Compare Dan. 7:25.) From the second century Rome
has been the center of Sunday worship. As Creator, supreme Ruler, and
Sanctifier, God has the right to our worship as we honor His sacred day.
   • God's heavenly tabernacle. Since Christ's ascension, great attention
has been given to the ministry that God and Christ perform in the heavenly
sanctuary. (See Hebrews 7-10.) Critically important is the "priesthood of
all believers." (See Rev. 1:6.) It is the privilege of every human being to
go directly to God and, by faith in Christ's all-sufficient sacrifice, to re-
ceive forgiveness and full acceptance into the family of God.
    The leopardlike beast power of Revelation 13 has set up his own
"temple" on this earth, and through its services has attempted to draw the
attention of people away from the most vital things that God is doing in
heaven. "The heavenly ministry of the sacrifice of Christ is discounted,
and the sacrifice of the mass on earth is substituted."--SDA Bible Corn-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 818.
   • God's heavenly inhabitants. This doubtless refers to blasphemy
against members of the Trinity or the angels who minister to human
beings. In a sense it is blasphemy to say that certain beings are in heaven
who are not there. Saint worship is blasphemy because only God is to be
worshiped. (See Rev. 19:10.)
9. Will this Roman power always be successful in warring against
   God's saints? What events are said to put an end to it? Rev. 13:7,
   10; Dan. 7:21, 22, 25, 26; 2 Thess. 2:8.




                                                                          25
HI. NOT ALL YIELD TO THE BEAST'S DEMANDS (Rev. 13:8-
    10).
10. Who will be deceived, and who will not? Who will refuse to wor-
    ship, at any cost, this apostate power? Rev. 13:8; compare
    2 Thess. 2:10-12.


11. What are the conditions under which a person's name is placed
    in the heavenly book of life? Under what conditions is it kept
    there? Heb. 12:23; Luke 10:20; Rev. 3:5.


    Our relationship with Christ determines the issue. "The names of all
those who have once given themselves to God are written in the book of
life, and their characters are now passing in review before Him. Angels of
God are weighing moral worth. They are watching the development of
character in those now living, to see if their names can be retained in the
book of life. A probation is granted us in which to wash our robes of
character and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Who is doing
this work? Who is separating from himself sin and selfishness?"—Ellen
G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 960.
WHO WILL HAVE MY ALLEGIANCE?
 • In what ways am I seeking to avoid the satanic deceptions that we
   have been warned about?
 • What assurance do I have that the Lord is able to keep me close to
   Him, so that my name can be retained in the book of life? (See Phil.
   1:6.)
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: As a review, compare Rev-
elation 13:1-10 with Daniel 7, and 2 Thessalonians 2:4-9. Read the chap-
ter, "God's Law Immutable," in The Great Controversy, pp. 433-450.
SUMMARY: The power represented by the leopardlike beast of Revela-
tion 13 will be the great enemy of God's people until Jesus comes. But
those whose names are retained in the book of life will experience final
victory and witness Christ's long-promised return to gather them "home."

  Adult Lesson



A Lamb's Appearance,
a Dragon's Voice
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 13:11-18

S-Pi 13. MEMORY TEXT: "He shall dwell on high: his place of defence
WV! shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his
         waters shall be sure" (Isaiah 33:16).
THE FINAL TEST. The second half of Revelation 13 predicts the decep-
tion and persecution that will confront God's last-day people. For such to
be the work of a leopardlike beast would be expected. Wild animals attack.
But for a lamblike beast to do the same is unexpected and surprising.
Those who place their trust fully in Christ will be preserved from decep-
tion and enabled to endure the attack.


                   OVERVIEW: Revelation 13:11-18

     13:11, 12                 13:13, 14                 13:14-18
  A beast with two          Miracle-worker        Great accomplishments
   lamblike horns            and deceiver           for the lepardlike
                                                           beast


OUR SINISTER FOE REBUKED. The devil is assured of final destruc-
tion by virtue of Christ's successful sacrifice at Calvary. Revelation 12 re-
veals that, since the cross, the evil one has been operating with "great
wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time" (Rev. 12:12). We
know today that his time has almost run out. It is not strange that he would
operate in these last days through people, through political and religious
organizations, through any available means, to deceive and destroy God's
people. Satan hates Christ and all who have accepted His sacrifice for their
sins. They have been "plucked out of the fire" and Satan's temptations
and accusations are rebuked (Zech. 3:2).
    Satan's crowning work of deception is portrayed in the passage we are
studying this week. These verses reveal a sinister foe working much more
openly than ever before. His work through the kings of Babylon (Isa. 14:12-
14) and Tyre (Eze. 28:11-17) seems mild compared to the worldwide work
of spiritual ruin that he accomplishes through the lamblike beast.
    As we study this revelation, we are wise to claim the promise of John
16:13, that the Holy Spirit will guide us "into all truth," and show us
 "things to come." The Lord's wonderful promise is yours for the asking.
                                                                          27
     A BEAST WITH TWO LAMBLIKE HORNS (Rev. 13:11, 12).
1. Where does John say that this new beast comes from? What does
   this mean to you? Rev. 13:11.


   This second beast of Revelation 13 "rose out of the earth" (RSV). The
four beasts of Daniel 7 and the first beast of Revelation 13 rose "out of the
sea" (verse 1). In symbolic Bible prophecy the "sea" stands for a
populous region. (See Rev. 17:15.) Since the sea represents the peoples
and nations of the world, the earth must symbolize a region relatively free
from human population.
2. How is this second beast further described in verse 11?


  What conclusions can we draw from this description? Our conclusions
must include recognition of a few major points:
    • The place and time in which the beast rises. "But the beast with
lamblike horns was seen 'coming up out of the earth.' Instead of over-
throwing other powers to establish itself, the nation thus represented must
arise in territory previously unoccupied, and grow up gradually and peace-
fully. It could not, then, arise among the crowded and struggling nationali-
ties of the Old World—that turbulent sea of 'peoples, and multitudes, and
nations, and tongues.' It must be sought in the Western Continent."—The
Great Controversy, p. 440.
    Revelation 13:12 establishes that this second beast functioned after
1798, when the first beast received its deadly wound. What great nation
began its national existence in the late eighteenth century as a defender of
religious and political liberty? Because the healing of the deadly wound
occurs when papal religion is restored and the church-state union is estab-
lished again (verse 12), we can assume that this second beast will perform
its major prophetic role then.
   • The two lamblike horns. Often in Scripture horns are a symbol of
strength. (See Deut. 33:17; 1 Sam. 2:1.) In Daniel and Revelation horns
sometimes refer to nations that emerged from other nations. (See Daniel 7;
8; Rev. 12:3; 17:3.) In Revelation 13:11 they are evidently intended to
depict the two means through which the strength of the lamblike beast is
manifested. (Compare the horns of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.) We con-
clude that these two horns are not separate nations that grew out of the
beast, but prominent characteristics of the beast itself that render it a dis-
tinctive kind of nation. Because the horns are lamblike, we can assume that
they represent the strength that comes from religious and civil liberty. (See
The Great Controversy, p. 441.)
   o The voice of a dragon. What a strange contrast between how it looks
and how it speaks! "In appearance it is gentle and apparently harmless, but
28
    in action it is persecuting and cruel, as vs. 12-18 reveal."—SDA Bible
    Commentary, vol. 7, p. 820. It speaks like the dragon that Revelation 12:9
    identifies as Satan.
       • The United States of America. "What nation of the New World was
    rising into power in 1798, giving promise of strength and greatness, and
    attracting the attention of the world? The application of the symbol admits
    of no question. One nation, and only one, meets the specifications of this
    prophecy; it points unmistakably to the United States of America."—The
    Great Controversy, p. 440.

    3. What kind of power and pressure will this lamblike beast exert?
a      From whom does it get its power? Who is its victim? Rev. 13:12.


       "It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence . . ."
    (Rev. 13:12, RSV). The last four words of the verse establish the identity
    of the "first beast." It is the one whose deadly wound was healed. The
    lamblike beast power pressures people all over the earth to worship that
    beast (Rev. 13:1-10) whose power has now been restored. Because the
    leopardlike beast represents papal Rome, the lamblike beast must become
    deeply involved in religious activities. It enforces supreme respect for
    papal Rome and demands that all earth's inhabitants worship according to
    papal dictates.
       "Prophecy here points to the enactment of some religious measure the
    observance of which would be regarded as an act of worship, in that the
    worshiper, by observing it, acknowledges the authority of the first beast in
    matters of religion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 821.
    4. How could the United States, whose Constitution guarantees
       religious liberty to all of its inhabitants, ever do the work of the
       second beast of Revelation 13?


       Daniel 7:25 and Revelation 13:1-10 refer to the Papacy. The prophecy
    states that the papal power would "think to change the times and the law"
    (Dan. 7:25, RSV).
       The lamblike beast (Rev. 13:11-17) enforces the observance of these
    changed laws. God's law will be set aside, and a civil decree by the
    lamblike beast power will enforce religious practices that are man-made.
    The Ten Commandments will no longer be honored, for the lamblike beast
    power will decree that the world should accept the substitute religion of
    Rome. (Compare 2 Thess. 2:3-12.)
       Legally enforced intolerance. "The 'speaking' of the nation is the ac-
    tion of its legislative and judicial authorities. By such action it will give the
    lie to those liberal and peaceful principles which it has put forth as the
    foundation of its policy. The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon' and
    exercise 'all the power of the first beast' plainly foretells a development of
                                                                                  29
      the spirit of intolerance and persecution that was manifested by the nations
      represented by the dragon and the leopardlike beast."—The Great Con-
      troversy, p. 442.
         The devil pressures for total worship, total homage, total loyalty. A
      loving, offended God, in Revelation 14:7, calls loudly for an untainted,
      genuine, total worship of Himself.
         Will you follow the lamblike beast, or the "Lamb of God, which
      taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29)?

111   11. MIRACLE-WORKER AND DECEIVER (Rev. 13:13,14).

      5. What specific deceptions does Satan use in the last days to enhance
         his chances of success in leading, if possible, the entire world into
         his camp? Rev. 13:13, 14 (first part).


         We must remember first, that these attempted forms of deception are
      tied to John's discussion of the formation of an "image" to the beast
      (verse 14, last part). The second beast does not enforce papal-type worship
      until the "mortal" or "deadly" wound is healed (verse 12). The healing of
      the wound will result in the restoration of that church-state union that was
      the source of papal influence in the period 538-1798. We cannot expect the
      signs or miracles spoken of here to occur until the church-state power has
      been thus restored.
         Nevertheless, we are seeing events currently that are leading to that
      point. The New Age Movement, Eastern mysticism, and spiritualism are
      contributing to the prepartion of the world for deceptions of which Revela-
      tion 13 is speaking.
      6. Who will and who will not be deceived by Satan's last, and
         masterful, deceptions? 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.



         Miracles are not proof of Christian genuineness. "No mere impos-
      tures are here brought to view. Men are deceived by the miracles which
      Satan's agents have power to do, not which they pretend to do."—The
      Story of Redemption, p. 395.
         "Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and
      wonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying wonders,
      even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men. Thus the inhab-
      itants of the earth will be brought to take their stand."—The Great Con-
      troversy, p. 612 (italics supplied).
       7. How would you differentiate between knowing the truth, and
          loving the truth? Matt. 25:1-10.


       30
          Total commitment to God's will. A simple knowledge of the truth
       does not necessarily protect mankind from deception. According to
       2 Thessalonians 2:10, the protected ones "love" the truth.
          "The theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit, cannot
       quicken the soul or sanctify the heart. One may be familiar with the com-
       mands and promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit of God sets the truth
       home, the character will not be transformed. Without the enlightenment of
       the Spirit, men will not be able to distinguish truth from error, and they will
       fall under the masterful deceptions of Satan."—Christ's Object Lessons,
       pp. 408, 411 (emphasis supplied).
          Do you love the truth? What a challenge Revelation 13 gives us to
       come nearer to Christ and allow Him to impart to us a deep ,abiding love
       for Him and His truth.

WED'   HI. GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR THE LEOPARDLIKE
           BEAST (Rev. 13:14-18).
       8. What appeal does the lamblike beast make to all who dwell on the
          earth? Rev. 13:14 (last half).


          What is the image to the beast? "An image to the first beast would
       be an organization functioning on much the same principles as that
       beast's organization. Among the principles by which the first beast
       operated was the use of the secular arm to support religious institutions.
       In imitation the second beast will repudiate its principles of freedom.
       The church will prevail upon the state to enforce its dogmas. State and
       church will unite, and the result will be the loss of religious liberty and
       the persecution of dissenting minorities."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
       7, pp. 821, 822.
       9. Apart from the "beast," what other religious bodies are involved
          in setting up the "image?" Rev. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10.



          The book of Revelation consistently distinguishes between the wor-
       ship of the beast and the worship of the image of the beast. (See Rev.
       14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4.) The implication is that not only the
       papacy will be involved in establishing the "image" but also other
       professedly Christian bodies that, like the papacy, are in league with the
       government. Revelation 19:20 refers to the lamblike beast of chapter 13
       as the "false prophet." A false prophet is one who professes to speak
       for God but who has accepted the direction of an alien power. The
       "false prophet" is the religious power in the "image" that is allied
       with the political power. Because this "false prophet" is distinguished
       in Revelation from the first beast of chapter 13 (the papacy), and be-
       cause it is a false Christian system, we can conclude that it represents
       apostate Protestantism.
                                                                                    31
        United churches will influence the state. "The enforcement of Sun-
     daykeeping on the part of Protestant churches is an enforcement of the
     worship of the papacy—of the beast. . . . But in the very act of enforcing a
     religious duty by secular power, the churches would themselves form an
     image to the beast; hence the enforcement of Sundaykeeping in the United
     States would be an enforcement of the worship of the beast and his
     image."—The Great Controversy, pp. 448, 449.
        "When the churches of our land, uniting upon such points of faith as
     are held by them in common, shall influence the State to enforce their
     decrees and sustain their institutions, then will Protestant America have
     formed an image of the Roman hierarchy. Then the true church will be as-
     sailed by persecution, as were God's ancient people."—Ellen G. White,
     Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 4, p. 278.
     10. What will finally result when the image of the beast is formed?
         Rev. 13:15?


        It would be helpful to mark these promises in your Bible and memorize
     them: Ps. 46:1; 91:1-7; Dan. 3:16-18.
rn   11. What does the lamblike beast power cause all to receive? Rev.
         13:16.


     12. What restriction of freedom is then imposed upon those who
         refuse the "mark?" Rev. 13:17.


       These verses will be studied very carefully in lesson 8 where the third
     angel's message of Revelation 14:9-11 will be discussed.
     13. What is the meaning of the beast's number? Rev. 13:18.


         Since the early seventeenth century the usual interpretation has been
     that 666 stands for the numerical value of the letters in one of the pope's
     titles: Vicarius Filii Dei.
                    V        5      F         0      D      500

       "Latin is the official language of the Catholic Church. The pope, in
    Catholic theology, stands for the whole church. One of the pope's titles is
    said to be Vicarius Filii Dei, 'Vicar of the Son of God.' In response to a
    reader's question, the Catholic journal Our Sunday Visitor for April 18,
    1915, replied, 'The letters inscribed in the Pope's mitre [his priestly
    crown] are these, Vicarius Filii Dei, which is the Latin for Vicar of the Son
    of God. Catholics hold that the Church, which is a visible society, must
    have a visible head.' "—C. Mervyn Maxwell, God Cares (Boise, Idaho:
    Pacific Press, 1985), vol. 2, pp. 413, 414.
       Because the beast is the medieval papacy, revived in the last days, it is
    not unreasonable to assume that the number would be deduced from one of
    the titles given to the pope in the Middle Ages. One of these titles was,
    indeed, Vicarius Filii Dei, and the forged Donation of Constantine was one
    medieval document that used it. (See Henry Bettenson, ed., Documents of
    the Christian Church [London: Oxford University Press, 1943, 1963],
    p. 138.)
       "The number 666 is a 'human' number (RSV). The underlying Greek
    can be translated fairly as 'the number of a man' or as 'the number of man
    [mankind].' . . . Does 666 then, with its triple sixes, point to man focused
    inward on himself, on his own ways of doing things . . .?
       "In contrast, the crowning day of Creation is the seventh day, when
    God delights in His work (Exodus 31:17) and invites man to enter into His
    joy (Isaiah 58:13, 14)—when God rests (Genesis 2:2) and man enters into
    His rest (Hebrews 4:10)."—Maxwell, God Cares, vol. 2, p. 415.
    HAVE YOU ENTERED INTO GOD'S SPIRITUAL REST? Can you
    answer "Yes" to each of these questions?
      • Do I love God's truth sufficiently to be loyal to it when the majority
        are forsaking it?
      • Am I living for God totally, with no known reservations?
      • Am I aware of what is coming on the earth?
pal FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study Jesus' predictions and
Lj counsel in Matthew 10:16-42. Read "Aims of the Papacy," The Great
    Controversy, pp. 563-581. Also read, "The Impending Conflict," The
    Great Controversy, pp. 582-592.
    SUMMARY: Revelation chapter 13 provides a serious warning against
    deception and heresy in the last days. It clearly tells us what will come to
    pass, so that when it does, our faith will be stronger, and we will be able to
    endure faithfully.

Without Faun Before
the Throne
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14:1-5.
sea   MEMORY TEXT: "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul
PM    shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the gar-
      ments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of
      righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments,
      and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels" (Isaiah 61:10).
OUR SPIRITUAL GOAL. The focus of Revelation 14:1-5 is on victors,
not victims. After their earthly conflict the 144,000 stand before God free
from persecution, temptation, and sin. Their purity of character has re-
sulted from their wholehearted response to the three angel's messages.

                     OVERVIEW: Revelation 14:1-5

               14:1-3                               14:4, 5
       The 144,000 identified             The 144,000—their purity
           as victorious                      and Godlikeness

INCOMPARABLE JOY AWAITS THE FAITHFUL. In this present
life there is no delight comparable to that of loving the Lord Jesus Christ
and trusting Him fully. Speaking of Jesus, Peter said, "Whom having not
seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye re-
joice with joy unspeakable and full of glory" (1 Peter 1:8).
    Yet the Scriptures present the future joys awaiting the faithful Christian
as beyond reasonable comparison with any known before Jesus comes.
The passage of Scripture we are studying this week pictures as closely as
possible in human language just what lies beyond.
    Fellowship that produces character. T. H. Jemison once wrote, "If
love and trust in the Saviour and anticipation of the kingdom to come pro-
duce joy unspeakable—inexpressible, indescribable—the realization of
being one of that incomparably favored host who shall sing a song no
others can sing and who will 'follow the Lamb,' will occasion such re-
joicing that even immortal lips will be incapable of framing words ade-
quate to depict it. . . .
    "The members of the group standing on Mount Sion have reached
the climax of a fellowship with the Saviour that was begun during the
days of their earthly life. It is that fellowship which today leads to joy
36
unspeakable and which tomorrow permits us to sing the song of praise
which no others can know that is of particular interest to us now. What
kind of persons will this fellowship make of human beings 'conceived
in sin and born in iniquity'? Through what type of experience will they
pass? Why is special honor granted them in the kingdom of glory?"—
T. H. Jemison, "The Companions of the Lamb," Our Firm Foundation
(Washington, DC: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1953),
vol. 2, pp. 405, 406.

I. THE 144,000 IDENTIFIED AS VICTORIOUS (Rev. 14:1-3).
1. What is the first thing that John sees in vision after the scene of
   apostasy described in Revelation 13? Rev. 14:1.



    Mount Sion is heaven. "But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" (Heb. 12:22). With the
saved of all ages, the 144,000 will be in heaven, "before the throne of God
. . . in his temple" (Rev. 7:15), immediately after the second coming of
Jesus. In the book of Revelation the temple is always in heaven. (See Rev.
11:19; 15:5.)
2. Whom does John see with the Lamb on Mount Sion? Rev. 14:1;
   compare 15:2.


   Trial and victory. Compare the description of the 144,000 here with
that in Revelation 6:14-7:4. The text there pictures a terrible period just
before and during the time of their deliverance. (See Rev. 6:14-17.) John is
permitted to see "who shall be able to stand" (Rev. 6:17). Revelation 7:1-
8 reveals that, of those living when Jesus comes, the ones who will be able
to stand will be the 144,000. This number is symbolic because it is con-
tained in a prophecy that is distinctively symbolic. The "four angels,"
"four winds," "the east," and "the seal" are prophetic symbols (Rev.
7:1-3). The twelve tribes represent the last generation of faithful believers,
who have entered spiritually into the experience of righteousness by faith
in Jesus Christ. (Compare Gal. 3:27-29.) The literal tribes no longer exist,
and it is inconceivable that only 144,000 Jews will be "able to stand"
(Rev. 6:17) at the second coming of Jesus.
   Chapters 14 and 15 picture the throng represented by the 144,000 en-
joying final triumph in heaven after their end-time conflict with the beast
and his image.
   The real issue is the kind of people they are. "It is not His [God's]
will that they [the church] shall get into controversy over questions which
will not help them spiritually, such as, Who is to compose the hundred and
forty-four thousand. This those who are the elect of God will in a short
time know without question."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 978.
                                                                           37
M      3. What clue do we find in Revelation 14:1 as to what kind of people
1111      the 144,000 are, what character God expects them to possess, and
          which they must possess if they are to stand on Mount Sion? Com-
          pare Rev. 2:17; 3:12; 22:4; Isa. 62:2.



           Meaning of a name. "The Hebrews, like other ancient Near Eastern
       peoples, attached great significance to personal names. Their names had a
       literal meaning sometimes symbolic of the character and personality of the
       one it designated."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 752.
          God's name symbolizes His character. " 'The name of the Lord' is
       `merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and
       truth, . . . forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.' Exodus 34:5-7. Of
       the church of Christ it is written, 'This is the name wherewith she shall be
       called, The Lord our Righteousness.' Jeremiah 33:16. This name is put
       upon every follower of Christ. It is the heritage of the child of God. The
       family are called after the Father. . . . You cannot hallow His name, you
       cannot represent Him to the world, unless in life and character you repre-
       sent the very life and character of God. This you can do only through the
       acceptance of the grace and righteousness of Christ."—Thoughts From the
       Mount of Blessing, pp. 106, 107.
          Comparing the description in Revelation 14:1 ("having his Father's
       name written in their. foreheads") with the words in Revelation 7:3
       ("sealed . . . in their foreheads"), we reach the conclusion that the 144,000
       have permitted God to work out in their lives His lovely character. "His
       followers are to bear, as their credentials to the world, the ineffaceable
       characteristics of His immortal principles."—The Ministry of Healing,
       p. 37.
          The Name of the Father and the Mind of Christ. "The family is
       named after the Father. Those who enter the heavenly mansions will have
       the name of the Father and the name of the city of God written in their
       foreheads. They will bear the divine superscription, and be partakers of the
       divine nature, having escaped the corruptions that are in the world through
       lust."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, July 19, 1892.
          "The sinner unites his weakness to Christ's strength, his emptiness to
       Christ's fullness, his frailty to Christ's enduring might. Then he has the
       mind of Christ. The humanity of Christ has touched our humanity, and our
       humanity has touched divinity. Thus through the agency of the Holy Spirit
       man becomes a partaker of the divine nature. He is accepted in the
       Beloved."—The Desire of Ages, p. 675.

       4. In your own words describe the music John heard in heaven. Rev.
          14:2.


          One version reads, "And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of
       rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like
       38
      that of harpists playing their harps" (MV). John hears heavenly music
      when the redeemed and the angels meet to begin eternity together.

111   5. What kind of song do the 144,000 sing, and to whom? Why could
         not some others in heaven learn it? Rev. 14:3.



         The Song of Experience. The 144,000 sing out of their experience,
      which others have not had. "It is the song of their experience—an ex-
      perience such as no other company have ever had."—The Great Con-
      troversy, p. 649. They rejoiced at the deliverance when they saw the cloud
      in the east. Their last hours of horrible persecution, when death confronted
      them and the world was ranged against them have given place to inde-
      scribable exultation.
          Suffering for Christ. Jesus sets the 144,000 apart from all others of the
      redeemed host. They have received the seal of God, after their characters
      have been perfected under the most difficult circumstances. Satan was em-
      ploying his demonic arts to deceive every living human being. Interesting
      parallels between their lives and the life of Jesus when He was here on
      earth have been pointed out by T. H. Jemison, in Our Firm Foundation
      (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald, 1953), vol. 2, pp. 412-416.
          a. He had no intercessor. Of Christ in Gethsemane, Ellen White says:
      "Now He longed to have an intercessor for Himself."—The Desire of
      Ages, p. 686.
          Of the 144,000 after the close of probation she says: "In that fearful
      time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an interces-
      sor."—The Great Controversy, p. 614. While there is a time coming when
      the righteous must live without an intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary,
      how thankful we can be that there will never come a time when the right-
      eous must live without Christ dwelling within!
          b. He was without sin. Of Christ, it is said: "One stain upon His
      human life, one failure of His humanity to endure the terrible test, and the
      Lamb of God would have been an imperfect offering, and the redemption
      of man a failure."—The Desire of Ages, p. 734. The same is true of those
       who would enter heaven: "One defect, cultivated instead of being over-
      come, makes the man imperfect, and closes against him the gate of the
       Holy City."—Messages to Young People, p. 144.
          c. Satan fiercely opposed Christ. "Satan saw that he must either con-
       quer or be conquered. . . . All the energies of apostasy were rallied against
       the Son of God. Christ was made the mark of every weapon of hell."—
       The Desire of Ages, p. 116. So will it be with God's final remnant. "Satan
       summoned all his forces, and at every step contested the work of Christ.
          "So it will be in the great final conflict of the controversy between
       righteousness and sin."—The Desire of Ages, p. 257.
           d. At the cross, people maligned Jesus. "He trusted in God; let him
       deliver him now, if he will have him" (Matt. 27:43). In the last days of the
       agony of God's faithful: "The wicked exult, and the jeering cry is heard,
       `Where now is your faith? Why does not God deliver you out of our hands
       if you are indeed His people?' "—The Great Controversy, p. 630.
                                                                                 39
   e. Testing brought forth pure character. "All the efforts of Satan to
oppress and overcome Him only brought out in a purer light His spotless
character."—The Desire of Ages, p. 759. Satan's attacks against God's last
people accomplish the same results: "Let opposition arise, . . . let persecu-
tion be kindled, and the halfhearted and hypocritical will waver and yield
the faith; but the true Christian will stand firm as a rock, his faith stronger,
his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity."—The Great Controversy,
p. 602.
   f. He finished the work God gave Him to do. Through the long series
of tests and trials Christ's work for mankind was completed (John 17:4).
So, when the time comes for the deliverance of God's saints, they will,
through tests and trials, have accomplished the work that God entrusted
them to do.
   Are you enjoying spiritual victories now as a foretaste of the greater
victories to be experienced before Jesus comes?
H. THE 144,000—THEIR PURITY AND GODLIKENESS (Rev.
  14:4, 5).
    As the vision continues, John presents an even clearer picture of the pu-
rity of this honored group of the redeemed.
6. How would you interpret the first sentence of Revelation 14:4?


    "Not defiled," means not "stained," or "soiled."
    "With women." "A woman is often used in Scripture to represent a
church, a pure woman the true church and an immoral woman the apostate
church (see on ch. 12:1). In ch. 17:1-5 . .. the Church of Rome and various
apostate churches who follow in her footsteps are symbolized by an im-
pure woman and her daughters. It is to these churches that the prophet here
doubtless refers."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 826.
   The 144,000 are "virgins." "Because the whole passage is metaphori-
cal, literal virginity, whether of men or of women, is not the point under
consideration. If it were, this passage would contradict other scriptures that
commend marriage and the marriage relation (1 Cor. 7:1-5). The saints are
here called virgins because they have either kept themselves aloof from
Babylon or no longer have dealings with her. . . . They have refused any
connection with Babylon and her daughters at the time when these have
become the agents of Satan in his final effort to eradicate the saints."—
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 826.
7. What connection do you see between Revelation 14:4 and the
   parable of the ten virgins? Matt. 25:1-13.


  "They are called virgins because they possess a pure faith."—Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 406. Pure faith includes not only a knowledge of truth
40
    but also giving the Holy Spirit (symbolized by the oil) permission to turn
    the truth into a personal, Christlike, living experience in the things of God.
    Only five of the ten virgins had this living experience. The other five did
    not have the Holy Spirit. All the 144,000 are virgins. All have the truth and
    the Holy Spirit reigning in their hearts.
    8. In the last part of Revelation 14:4, what are the redeemed 144,000
       called?


       "These, having been translated from the earth, from among the
    living, are counted as 'the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.'.. .
    `These are they which came out of great tribulation;' they have passed
    through the time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation;
    they have endured the anguish of the time of Jacob's trouble; they have
    stood without an intercessor through the final outpouring of God's judg-
    ments. But they have been delivered, for they have 'washed their robes,
    and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.' "—The Great Con-
    troversy, p. 649.
       The idea of the 144,000 being "first fruits" is full of deep significance.
    The ancient Israelites offered the first fruits of their crops to the Lord. (See
    Deut. 26:1-11; Lev. 23:10, 17.) The offering acknowledged God's love in
    giving the harvest.
    9. What did Paul mean when he called Christ the "firstfruits of them
       that slept?" I Cor. 15:20, 23.


       Moses was raised before Christ's resurrection only because Christ
    would be resurrected. (See 1 Cor. 15:17, 18; Heb. 9:15.) In this sense,
    Christ is truly the first fruits of all who would ever be resurrected as
    "saints," whether they lived before or after the cross. The resurrections of
    Moses, the widow's son at Nain, Jairus' daughter, and Lazarus were all de-
    pendent upon the resurrection of Christ.
    10. Identify another group of those recognized as first fruits from the
®        grave who since have never tasted death? Matt. 27:52, 53; Eph.
         4:8.


    11. How are the 144,000 further described? Rev. 14:5 (first part).


        "The gospel of Jesus Christ changes sinful, erring man into one who
     has no pretense, no make-believe, no deceit, no sin."-- SDA Bible Com-
     mentary,vol.7, p. 827. We are reminded of the wonis of Zephaniah: "The
     remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a
                                                                          41
deceitful tongue be found in their mouth" (Zeph. 3:13). The 144,000 are
living examples of the ninth commandment (Ex. 20:16). Ellen White adds,
"[The seal of God] will never be placed upon the forehead of men or
women of false tongues or deceitful hearts."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 216.
12. How does John finally describe this translated group? Rev. 14:5
    (last part).


   The Greek word here is "faultless," "blameless," "without blemish."
The very same word is used in I Peter 1:19 to describe Jesus—" without
blemish and without spot." How could the characters of these "firstfruits
unto God and to the Lamb" be better portrayed than by describing them in
some of the identical terms ascribed to our Lord Himself? They have re-
ceived His righteousness and have reflected His glory of character.

   A spotless character. God's goals for the redeemed are high, and His
enabling grace is adequate to meet them. We must resist the trend to re-
duce the requirements of God to some lower level that people feel they can
attain. God has never promised the kingdom to those who meet less than
His stated requirements. Paul's assurance may be ours: "I can do all things
through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Phil. 4:13). By the tremendous
power of His indwelling grace we can be among those who enter heaven
with "a character that is without spot or wrinkle or any such thing."—
Messages to Young People, p. 144. This will be the experience of all the
redeemed. Those who die believing have present perfection in Christ at the
point of death. (See Col. 2:10.) The faithful who live till Jesus comes will
experience uninterrupted victory because of the perpetual indwelling of the
Holy Spirit in their hearts.
HOW DEEP IS MY COMMITMENT TO CHRIST?
  e Am I impressed that we live in the end-time? If so, how am I deal-
    ing with those things that keep me from daily readiness to meet my
    Lord and Saviour?
  e Do I feel that to be one of the 144,000 is just too much for me? (See
    Jude 24, 25.) How can I gain the spiritual power to be one of the
    144,000?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read carefully 1 Corinthians
chapter 15, noting especially verses 12-23. Also read, "To Meet the Bride-
groom," Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 405-421. Important lessons are con-
tained in the parable of the ten virgins.

SUMMARY: The verses of this week's lesson bring us the very "air" of
the kingdom, and light from the throne of Him who is Light itself. They set
before us exciting, very high levels of spiritual attainment. Should this
bring discouragement, frustration, the temptation to give up? Or should it
draw us to Him who willingly pours out all the power of heaven so that we
can be live victoriously?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14:6, 7.

SWB   MEMORY TEXT: "But ye shall receive power, after that the
PM    Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me
      both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto
      the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).
GOD'S LAST APPEAL. The new scene that begins with Revelation
14:6, takes us back to a time before the vision described in verses 1-5.
Verses 6-12 have special application to the period immediately preceding
the second coming of Christ. The three-part message contained in these
verses prepares the 144,000 for God's final seal. This message brings
about a final separation between those who accept and those who reject
God's call. The message of the first angel is the everlasting gospel in its
end-time application. It is an earnest appeal for worship of the true God
and reverence for His holy name, at a time when most of the world is ig-
noring His claims.

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 14:6, 7

                14:6                                14:7

       The everlasting gospel                A threefold call to
            to the world                     honor the Creator

MESSAGES FOR TODAY. Since the beginning of their history,
Seventh-day Adventists have proclaimed the three angels' messages.
   Chapter 14 begins with the encouraging scene of the 144,000 in heaven
immediately following the second coming of Christ (verses 1-5). This
scene is followed by a presentation of the messages to which the 144,000
responded immediately prior to the Second Advent (verses 6-13). The third
section of the chapter describes in symbolic terms the harvest of the right-
eous and the wicked at the coming of Jesus (verses 14-20).
   There can be no question as to the period in which the messages of the
three angels apply in a special way. Chapter 14 is preceded by the predic-
tion of a worldwide apostasy (chapter 13) and is followed by the descrip-
tion of seven last plagues (chapters 15 and 16). These plagues immediately
precede Christ's coming.
   It is critically important to know the time when the messages of Revela-
                                                                         43
tion 14:6-12 are to be proclaimed, the identity of those who will proclaim
them, and of those who need to hear them. It is also critically important to
gain a clear understanding of the contents of those messages.
   These messages are for our time. They focus on today's people, today's
problems, today's deceptions and needs. They result in separation from the
world—a final separation of the wheat and the tares (Matt. 13:24-30), of the
sheep and the goats (Matt. 25:31-46), of the righteous and the unrighteous.
   As we study the message of the first angel this week, notice how it deals
with issues of central concern to mankind. God is appealing for men's
hearts, at the time of final judgment. Note also the call for reverence, and
loyal worship at a time when the majority of the world's people have
turned to worship another power (Rev. 13:8).

I. THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL TO THE WORLD (Rev. 14:6).
1. In this new scene, what is the first thing John sees? What is meant
   by "another" angel? Rev. 14:6.


   To this point in the book of Revelation many angels have been men-
tioned. Here John sees another angel, the first of three mentioned in verses
6-12. This "angel," or "messenger," here represents "God's saints en-
gaged in the task of proclaiming the everlasting gospel."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, 827. Note that the Greek word for "angel" some-
times means a human messenger (Matt. 11:10; Luke 9:52). Undoubtedly
heaven's angels are closely involved in the same work, but the proclama-
tion of the gospel has been committed to Christian believers.
   The "first angel's message" is "the everlasting gospel" (verse 6). It is
an announcement of the pre-Advent judgment, and a worldwide call to
worship the true God. This message of salvation, warning, and worship is
to be given to all mankind in these last days.

   Initial fulfillment. "The prophecy of the first angel's message, brought
to view in Revelation 14, found its fulfillment in the advent movement of
1840-44. In both Europe and America, men of faith and prayer were
deeply moved as their attention was called to the prophecies, and, tracing
down the Inspired Record, they saw convincing evidence that the end of all
things was at hand."—The Story of Redemption, p. 356.

   Continuing proclamation. "In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists
have been set in the world as watchmen and light bearers. To them has
been entrusted the last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining
wonderful light from the word of God. They have been given a work of the
most solemn import—the proclamation of the first, second, and third an-
gels' messages. There is no other work of so great importance. They are to
allow nothing else to absorb their attention.' —Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 19
(emphasis supplied).

   Note three significant points. (1) The angel represents God's people
proclaiming the God-given truths of Revelation 14:6, 7 to the world in the
44
      last days. (2) After the time of the end began in 1798, William Miller and
      his colleagues proclaimed this message between 1840 and 1844. (3) God
      has entrusted the proclamation of these same truths to Seventh-day Adven-
      tists, as a last warning to a perishing world before the second coming of
      Christ.
      2. How is the gospel proclaimed by the first angel described? Rev.
         14:6.



MON   3. What is the "everlasting gospel?" Examine the following passages
         and briefly write what each one includes in the good news.
         Luke 4:18
         1 Cor. 15:1-4
         Titus 3:5-7
         Gal. 2:2, 16
         Acts 13:38, 39
         Rom. 15:16
      4. When did God first decide that salvation would be through the
         death of His Son? When was the plan made known to mankind?
         1 Peter 1:18-20; Gen. 3:15.


         God foresaw and planned. "The plan for our redemption was not an
      afterthought, a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation
      of 'the mystery which hath been kept in silende through times eternal.'
      Rom. 16:25, RV. It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal
      ages have been the foundation of God's throne. From the beginning, God
      and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through
      the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should
      exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible
      emergency."—The Desire of Ages, p. 22 (emphasis supplied).
      5. How widespread is to be the mission of those who teach this first
         angel's message? Rev. 14:6.


         You have a part in giving the first angel's message. God has always
      used His people to spread the gospel. Humble believers are invited to give
      the first angel's message to those with whom they come in contact. Are
      you involved in this thrilling work?
                                                                              45
   Every member an agent for Christ. "Christ has given to the church a
sacred charge. Every member should be a channel through which God can
communicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable
riches of Christ. There is nothing that the Saviour desires so much as
agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and His character. There
is nothing that the world needs so much as the manifestation through
humanity of the Saviour's love. All heaven is waiting for men and women
through whom God can reveal the power of Christianity."—The Acts of
the Apostles, p. 600.
6. Review briefly these New Testament "mission" texts and write
   down the specific situation in which they were given.

     Matt. 24:14
     Matt. 28:18-20
     Acts 1:8, 9
   The early Christians were zealous. The apostles carried out their mis-
sion in a marvelous way in the first century. Ellen White says that their
witness "shook . the world. To every nation was the gospel carried in a
single generation."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 593.
   "Filled with love for their Redeemer, they sought as their highest aim
to win souls to Him."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 421.
   Are we fulfilling our commission? After the great disappointment of
1844, God re-commissioned His early Advent people, "Thou must proph-
esy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings" (Rev.
10:11). What about our first love today? What about our zeal to reach mil-
lions who so desperately need salvation? What about our next-door neigh-
bor? Are we fulfilling the commission of the first angel to spread the
gospel—next door, and everywhere?
11. A THREEFOLD CALL TO HONOR THE CREATOR (Rev. 14:7).

7. What stirring admonition begins the first angel's message? Rev.
   14:7.


   What does it mean to "fear" God? The Greek word is phobeo. "Pho-
beo is used here not in the sense of being afraid of God, but in the sense of
coming to Him with reverence and awe. It conveys the thought of absolute
loyalty to God, of full surrender to His will."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 827. The Bible recognizes two kinds of fear of God. (See Ex.
20:20.) The timing for this particular invitation is critical.
   This admonition invites loyalty and full surrender to Christ in the last
days. "Be ye also ready" (Matt. 24:44), ready every day for the Lord's
second coming.

46
   8. Following the instruction of. Revelation 14:7, how can we "give
      glory to him?" How did Jesus give glory to His Father? John 17:4,
      22, 23.



    9. How does the second part of Revelation 14:7 make the time setting
       of the first angel's words even more specific?


       The verb here is "has come," or "came." The tense of the Greek verb
    indicates in this context that the judgment has commenced.
       A message for the last days. "The message of salvation has been
    preached in all ages; but this message is a part of the gospel which could
    be proclaimed only in the last days, for only then would it be true that the
    hour of judgment had come. . . . No such message has ever been given in
    past ages. Paul . . . did not preach it; he pointed his brethren into the then
    far-distant future for the coming of the Lord. The Reformers did not pro-
    claim it. Martin Luther placed the judgment about three hundred years in
    the future from his day."—The Great Controversy, p. 356.
       Two major facts about this judgment:
       • The announcement of the beginning of the judgment is part of the
    gospel message. We are told that the angel is proclaiming "the everlasting
    gospel" (verse 6).
       • This judgment occurs before the second coming of Jesus, because the
    gospel is preached in all the world before He comes. (See Matt. 24:14.)
    There are two other messages for the world that follow the announcement
    of the judgment. Hence, the judgment of Revelation 14:7 is pre-Advent.
    10. At the conclusion of what specific time period did the judgment
        begin? How was it explained back in the sixth century B.C.,
        when God first revealed it to Daniel? Dan. 8:13, 14, 27. (See also
        Dan. 9:24-27.)



    11. How does Daniel describe the pre-Advent judgment? Dan. 7:9-
        13.



    12. At what period of earth's history would the 2300-day (or year)
        prophecy come to an end? Dan. 8:17, 19.



El 13. What was Daniel told about the time of the end during which the
        2300-day prophecy would culminate? Dan. 12:4, 7.
                                                                                47
   Future Truth Becomes Present Truth. The "time of the end," as it is
included in Daniel's prophecies, began at the close of the 1260 year period
(Dan. 7:25; compare Rev. 12:6, 14; 13:5), or in A.D. 1798. After that,
"knowledge" would increase in relation to these vital parts of Daniel's
book. With the coming of the nineteenth century, it would then become
"present truth" for men to teach the fulfillment of the 2300-year prophecy
and the arrival of the judgment hour. These prophecies came to focus in
William Miller's day. Martin Luther's prediction was accurate.
    "We might think that Miller preached more judgment than gospel. But
we should remember two things. First, almost all the Millerites came from
grace-teaching churches, and the records reveal that they had a close rela-
tionship with Christ; they were looking for Him to come. Second—and in
connection with Daniel 8:14 and Revelation 14:7—if Christ was to come
in the latter part of 1844, theirs was a time of judgment. It was essential to
stress judgment, and stress it with vigor. A person who believed his proba-
tion was to close in a few months should have been deeply concerned
about judgment—for himself and for others."—Carl Coffman, In the Last
Days, Three Angels (Berrien Springs, Michigan: published by the author,
1985), p. 19.
    The Judgment Continues Today. We know that Miller was mistaken
in the nature of the event to take place on October 22, 1844. He believed
that the earth was to be cleansed in 1844 by the second coming of Christ.
He did not realize that Jesus was about to begin His second-apartment min-
istry in the heavenly sanctuary. Miller did not understand that the inves-
tigative judgment would be completed before Jesus' return to earth.
    Today we still have the judgment-hour message, part of the everlasting
gospel, to be proclaimed with an even louder voice. Bible prophecy in re-
lation to events in the world and the church reveal that the judgment soon
will close; and when it does, all mankind will be marked as eternally saved
or eternally lost. Our question is Shouldn't we be proclaiming the first
angel's message today, as a church and as individuals, with all the fer-
vency of our first love?
14. What is the final appeal of the first angel? Rev. 14:7 (last part);
    compare Ex. 20:11.



   The call to observe God's Sabbath is part of the loud call of the first
angel. We are invited to worship the Creator on the day that is a memorial
of His creative work. This too is part of the everlasting gospel.
    Of those who have "professed" to worship Christ, and to be His loyal
followers, whose profession is genuine? The worship and loyalty of many
is only superficial. As taught by the parable of the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-
13), the genuine and the true must be made clear.

     Both Christ and Satan seek our full worship and loyalty.
     "That the law which was spoken by God's own voice is faulty, that
48
some specification has been set aside, is the claim which Satan now puts
forward. It is the last great deception that he will bring upon the world. He
needs not to assail the whole law; if he can lead men to disregard one pre-
cept, his purpose is gained. . . . By consenting to break one precept, men
are brought under Satan's power."—The Desire of Ages, p. 763.
IS MY SERVICE WHERE MY HEART IS?
   • I plan to participate in the proclamation of the gospel by sharing the
     message with: (Circle the appropriate ones.) 1. my spouse. 2. my
     children. 3. my relatives. 4. my neighbors. 5. my work associates
     and colleagues.
   • Check below those aspects of the gospel that have special relevance
     for you:
          It gives me the assurance of salvation.
          It takes away my fear of death.
          It frees me from the guilt of sin.
          It provides me with Jesus' presence in my life.
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: What does worship on the
Sabbath day have to do with holiness? Study Ex. 31:13; Eze. 20:12; com-
pare Rom. 2:13. Three reading selections relate especially to this week's
lesson. (1) The chapter, "The First Angel's Message," in The Story of Re-
demption, pp. 356-363; (2) "A Great Religious Awakening," in The Great
Controversy, pp. 355-374; and (3) "The Home Missionary Work," in Tes-
timonies, vol. 6, pp. 421-428.
SUMMARY: The first angel's message includes redemption, faithful obe-
dience, right standing in the judgment, loyalty in worship, and zealous wit-
nessing. It is the message that opens the door for each believer to be one of
144,000.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14:8
 AB   MEMORY TEXT: "Teach me, 0 Lord, the way of thy statutes;
PM    and I shall keep it unto the end" (Psalm 119:33).
GOD'S WARNINGS DEMONSTRATE HIS LOVE. When someone
rejects the message of the gospel the Lord's pleadings do not immediately
cease. Warnings are sent to awaken the individual to his or her great need
and Christ's ability to supply it. The second angel's message is a world-
wide warning to those who have not responded to the first angel's mes-
sage. The greatest enemy of last-day mankind is mystical or antitypical
"Babylon." Because He loves us infinitely our Lord unmasks the wicked-
ness of this false religious system and appeals to us to have nothing to do
with it.

                     OVERVIEW: Revelation 14:8
  Ancient Babylon           The first giving          Babylon's final
  used as a symbol          of the message                 fall

LITERAL AND SYMBOLIC BABYLON. To grasp the full import of
the second angel's message requires a three-column parallelism. Column
one discusses literal Babylon, as it existed in Old Testament times, with its
aims and claims. Column two contains the message of the second angel as
understood and proclaimed by William Miller in 1844. Column three con-
tains a picture of the final fulfillment of the second angel's message just
before the Lord returns. In this lesson we will develop this parallelism, so
that the import of the message will stand out clearly as it relates specifi-
cally to us and our day.
   The Scriptures contain many final warnings and appeals. Immediately
prior to the Flood, God warned a wicked and perverse generation (Gen.
6:3). The people of ancient Israel were given 490 years of warning and ap-
peal (Dan. 9:24-27). The period ended in A.D. 34. They, too, rejected the
rule of the Spirit.
   The second angel's message (Revelation 14) emphasizes final warning
and appeal. How does the message relate to the final events of earth's his-
tory? When can it be said that "Babylon is fallen"? What does it mean to
come out of Babylon?

50
®   I. ANCIENT BABYLON USED AS A SYMBOL
    1. As you read the first part of Revelation 14:8, what is your under-
       standing of the term Babylon in the context of the book of Revela-
       tion, and in connection with the time to which it must apply?



       Revelation was written near the end of the first century A.D. The appli-
    cations of its many prophecies stretch into the future from John's day.
    There was no literal city of Babylon in John's time, nor would there be one
    in the future. Thus, we must see John's use of the term Babylon as sym-
    bolic. In the context in which he uses the term it applies to the end of time.
    (See Revelation 17; 18.)
    2. Who founded ancient Babylon? Why did God destroy it? Gen.
       10:9, 10; 11:1-9.


       The earliest Bible reference to Babylon goes back to Nimrod (see Gen.
    10:10, and 11:1-9) and to the tower of Babel. "In Babylonian the name
    Bab-ilu (Babel, or Babylon) meant 'gate of the gods.' . . . From the very
    beginning the city was emblematic of disbelief in the true God and defi-
    ance of His will, . . . and its tower a monument to apostasy, a citadel of re-
    bellion against Him."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 828, 829.
       Genesis 11:9 indicates that the name Babel means "confusion." To the
    Hebrews the name evidently derived from the Hebrew verb bola!, which
    means "to confuse." It is possible that originally the name Babel derived
    from the Babylonian verb babalu, meaning "to scatter," or "to disap-
    pear." (See SDA Bible Dictionary, Commentary Reference Series, vol. 8,
    pp. 108, 109.)

    3. Why did God destroy the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the sixth cen-
       tury B.C.? Isa. 13:19, 20; 14:4-6, 12-14; Jer. 25:12.



       A Proud City Humbled. Babylon kept the Jewish people as captives
    for seventy years, from 605 to 536 B.C. Shortly before the end of that
    period, in 539 B.C., the Persians captured Babylon. Following the taking
    of the city and the establishment of his empire, Cyrus issued a decree for
    the return of the Jews to their own land (Ezra 1). This is why in Scripture
    Cyrus and his armies (kings from the East) are used as a symbol of Christ
    and His angels, the antitypical kings from the "east." As Cyrus freed the
    people of God from ancient Babylon, so at the Second Advent Christ and
    the angels will finally deliver the faithful of earth from the persecutions of
    antitypical Babylon. (Compare Isa. 41:2; 44:28; with Rev. 16:12; 17:14;
    19:11-16.)
        Even though the Persians left the city of Babylon intact, after several re-
    bellions against Persian rule under Darius I and Xerxes, about 480 B.C. the
                                                                                51
Persians destroyed its palaces, temples, and wall. In modem times, "the
city has served as a quarry of bricks."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 111.
4. How did the apostle Peter use the term "Babylon?" 1 Peter 5:13.


   "Babylon is also mentioned in the NT. Peter sent greetings from the
church in 'Babylon' (1 Peter 5:13), by which, commentators generally
agree, he meant Rome, not the unimportant village that was all that re-
mained of literal Babylon. . . . In the Revelation, Babylon stands as a sym-
bol of opposition against Christ and His followers (Rev. 14:8; 16:19;
17:18)."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 113.
11. THE FIRST GIVING OF THE MESSAGE
5. What power is the mystical, antitypical Babylon of the last days?
   Rev. 17:1-6; 13:1, 11, 14-17.


    In the book of Revelation "Babylon" is the religious union (the
papacy, apostate protestantism, and spiritism; Rev. 16:13, 14) that estab-
lishes the image to the beast, enforces the mark of the beast, and persecutes
the faithful people of God (Rev. 13:15-17; 17:6). This religious union that
is in opposition to Christ and His truth is supported by secular government.
In Revelation 17 the great scarlet beast may be viewed as the secular
power controlled by Satan, and the woman sitting on the beast as the re-
ligious union, "Babylon."
6. What is meant by the statement that Babylon is "fallen?" Rev.
   14:8; compare Isa. 21:9.


   "Babylon is a comprehensive term that John employs to describe all re-
ligious bodies and movements that have fallen away from the truth. This
fact requires us to view this 'fall' as progressive and cumulative."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 830.
7. How did William Miller apply this second angel's message in his
   preaching in 1844?
   Remember that Miller had been proclaiming the message of the first
angel, particularly the arrival of the judgment hour, since 184.0. Two points
regarding the churches of 1844 are very significant:
   a. Spiritual Apathy. "At a meeting of the presbytery of Philadelphia,
Mr. Barnes, author of a cominentary widely used and pastor of one of the
leading churches in that city, 'stated that he had been in the ministry for
twenty years, and never, till the last communion, had he administered the
52
 Escape From Gram P1tasy                                            1;2
                                                             August 1;2
ordinance without receiving more or less into the church. But now there
are no awakenings, no conversions, not much apparent growth in grace in
professors, and none come to his study to converse about the salvation of
their souls. With the increase of business, and the brightening prospects of
commerce and manufacture, there is an increase in worldly-mindedness.
Thus it is with all the denominations.'—Congregational Journal, May 23,
1844."—The Great Controversy, pp. 376, 377 (italics E. G. White).

   b. First Angel's Message Rejected. Most professing Christians re-
jected the warning of the first angel as given by Miller. Witnessing their
moral fall, he turned to the second angel's message in 1844.
   William Miller recognized that, in rejecting the first angel's message,
the churches were rejecting light from heaven. Believing that the end of all
things was at hand, he combined the parable of the ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-
13) with the call to leave Babylon. Thus the tarrying time and the Midnight
Cry became part of his message.
   The churches mocked, but many who responded to the message ex-
perienced deep spirituality. Those who responded in heart to the voices of
the first and second angel's messages made ready to meet their Loni.

ILL BABYLON'S FINAL FALL
8. What does the fall of "Babylon" mean in connection with our own
   immediate future? Review Rev. 14:4 (first part); 17:1-6.


   A Falling Away. Ellen White describes the reaction of the multitudes
who near the end of time hear the preaching of the second angel's mes-
sage. "In amazement they hear the testimony that Babylon is the church,
fallen because of her errors and sins, because of her rejection of the truth
sent to her from heaven."—The Great Controversy, pp. 606, 607.
    Satan is working to deceive all nations, all professed Christians, and all
churches. " 'Babylon the great,' in the book of Revelation designates, in a
special sense, the united apostate religions at the close of time."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 851, 852.
    When religious bodies "fall away" from God's truth, when they substi-
tute the doctrines of men for the doctrines of the Word of God, when they
resist the corrections of the Holy Spirit, and join hands to promulgate their
errors, using civil authority to enforce their views, they are in the process
of becoming Babylon.
   Has Babylon Fallen? The message of the second angel has been with
us for nearly a century and a half. We are told that "the message of the
second angel did not reach its complete fulfillment in 1844."—The Great
Controversy, p. 389. When will it reach its complete fulfillment? When
can we say that Babylon is fully fallen? Has it happened yet? The last part
of Revelation 14:8 will help us answer these questions.

9. What does the word made mean to you in connection with the
    drinking of the wine? Rev. 14:8.
                                                                           53
   When someone makes us do something, they use force, coercion, com-
pulsion. We rise up with a feeling of rebellion. Yet most of the world will
accept the mark of the beast when force is applied (Rev. 13:16, 17). The
mystery in connection with Babylon's compelling all nations to comply is
the fact that all nations seem pleased to drink her wine! This leads us to
two conclusions: First, that the devil is very successful in putting his plans
into operation; and second, the nations' drinking of Babylon's wine is the
result of deception. They do not seem to know that the wine is the wine of
final wrath. It is not good wine. But they drink it anyway.
10. Because people are deceived into accepting "Babylon's" wine,
    why are they held responsible for their misplaced loyalty?
    2 Thess. 2:10-12.


  "As truth is spurned, error is received and cherished."—The Story of
Redemption, p. 366.
11. What does John mean by the words, "the wine of the wrath of
    her fornication?" Rev. 14:8 (last part).


   "Fornication. A figure of the illicit connection between the church and
the world or between the church and the state. The church should be
married to her Lord, but when she seeks the support of the state, she leaves
her lawful spouse. By her new connection she commits spiritual fornica-
tion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 831.
   The term would include any illicit relationship that Babylon might have
with the world, with false doctrines, with idolatry, with civil power. It
seems clear that she finally will be involved in all of these.
   Loyalty to God rejected. Babylon "has disregarded the only com-
mandment which points out the true God, and has torn down the Sabbath,
God's memorial of creation. . . . In the Word of God this is called her for-
nication."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
979.
12. Can you think of some Old Testament parallels to the modern
    acceptance of "Babylon's" errors? 2 Chron. 21:5, 11; Eze. 16:26.


   The Old Testament repeatedly speaks of Israel's apostasy from God, her
bridegroom or husband. She sought other gods, practiced idolatry, and
formed forbidden relations with other nations. All of this God called "for-
nication." The same term applies to acceptance of "Babylon's" errors by
modern nations.
13. What is the "wrath" of Babylon's fornication? Rev. 14:8.
54
        Wrath is not Babylon's object in offering the nations its wine. Herein is
     one of her major deceptions—to make people think that she is offering
     them peace and blessing. It reminds us of the warning of Jeremiah when
     Israel offended God by dealing falsely, and saying, "Peace, peace; when
     there is no peace" (Jer. 8:11).
        The wrath is God's displeasure. The drinking of Babylon's cup will
     bring upon mankind, not peace, but the wrath of God. The wrath of Baby-
     lon's fornication will be God's wrath upon all who received Babylon's
     substitute religion. (See Rev. 14:10.)
in 14. What would you say is in the wine cup that Babylon offers to the
       world? Rev. 14:8; 17:4.



        "This cup of intoxication which she presents to the world represents the
     false doctrines that she has accepted as the result of her unlawful connec-
     tion with the great ones of the earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her
     faith, and in her turn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by
     teaching doctrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of Holy
     Writ."—The Great Controversy, p. 388.
     15. When does the fall of Babylon reach its complete fulfillment?
         Rev. 13:12-14.


        "Not yet, however, can it be said that 'Babylon is fallen, . . . because
     she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.' She
     has not yet made all nations do this. . . .
        "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan will
     work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceiva-
     bleness of unrighteousness;' and they that 'received not the love of the
     truth, that they might be saved,' will be left to receive 'strong delusion,
     that they should believe a lie' (2 Thessalonians 2:9-11). Not until this con-
     dition shall be reached, and the union of the church with the world shall be
     fully accomplished throughout Christendom, will the fall of Babylon be
     complete. The change is a progressive one, and the perfect fulfillment of
     Revelation 14:8 is yet future."—The Great Controversy, pp. 389, 390
     (italics hers).
     16. What is the final message from God to the inhabitants of our
         world? Rev. 18:1-5.


          "Revelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of rejecting the
      threefold warning of Revelation 14:6-12, the church will have fully
      reached the condition foretold by the second angel, and the people of God
      still in Babylon will be called upon to separate from her communion. This
      message is the last that will ever be given to the world; and it will accom-
                                                                                55
plish its work. When those that 'believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness' (2 Thessalonians 1:12), shall be left to receive strong
delusion and to believe a lie, then the light of truth will shine upon all
whose hearts are open to receive it, and all the children of the Lord that re-
main in Babylon will heed the call: 'Come out of her, my people' (Revela-
tion 18:4)."—The Great Controversy, p. 390.
HOW CAN WE WARN OTHERS TO LEAVE "BABYLON"? Check
the suggestions below, marking those which you think are best with a plus
(+) and those of which you disapprove with a zero (0).
       Show by example that God's way is superior.
       Criticize the ministers of "false churches."
       In loving ways demonstrate the caring ministry of Jesus.
       Humbly share my faith when there is an interest in it.
       Denounce the errors of the Papacy.
       Tell my Sunday-keeping friends that they are preparing for the
       mark of the beast.
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: The Jewish leaders knew the
Old Testament prophecies. Why did they not know that Jesus was the
Messiah? (See Matt. 2:1-6.) "To those who are seeking for light, and who
accept it with gladness, the bright rays from the throne of God will
shine."—The Desire of Ages, p. 47.
   Read the chapter, "A Warning Rejected," in The Great Controversy,
pp. 375-390. The two chapters, "The Second Angel's Message," and
"The Midnight Cry" in The Story of Redemption, pp. 364-374, provide
much insight into the Millerite experience in connection with the 1844
movement.

SUMMARY: Mystical Babylon figures very prominently in our study of
last day events. Early Adventists in the 1844 movement saw the workings
of those elements that are characteristic of end-time "Babylon." Today we
see far more than they, as worldwide doctrinal apostasy slowly but surely
rears its frightful head on all sides. Today all nations are drinking from
Babylon's cup. The point of total intoxication will signal Babylon's total
fall.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14:9-12.
SA-B   MEMORY TEXT: "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not
ULI
F VI   his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But
       whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God per-

CHOOSE WHOM YOU WILL SERVE. We find in the message of the
third angel two totally different groups of "worshipers." One group con-
sists of those who worship the beast, receive his mark, and are destroyed.
The other group consists of those who worship God with patient en-
durance, have faith in Christ, by His grace keep His commandments, and
receive the label of "saints" and the gift of eternal life. Our passage this
week is undoubtedly the most sobering in all the Bible. The question is: To
which group of worshipers do you plan to belong?

ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE PROPHETIC PICTURE. Early adven-
tists continued to proclaim the first two angels' messages after the disap-
pointment of October 22, 1844, with some changes in interpretation. An
understanding of the significance of the heavenly sanctuary and the pre-
advent judgment changed their explanation of the judgment hour referred
to in the first angel's message. Slowly they came to grasp the sobering
content of the third angel's message. That understanding could come only
as the truth of the seventh-day Sabbath dawned upon their minds. They
identified the Sabbath command as the center of the decalogue enshrined
in the second apartment of the heavenly sanctuary. Thus the Sabbath truth
and the judgment message were recognized to be interrelated.
    There were only about fifty Sabbathkeeping Adventists by 1850. As
their convictions regarding the Sabbath deepened, these pioneers began to
 understand the meaning of the mark of the beast (Rev. 14:9-11).
    Seventh-day Adventists organized in 1863. Since then they have come
to be known as those who proclaim the "third angel's message." When
                                                                          57
    they speak of the "third angel's message" they usually mean all three
    messages. Because of its special relevance to people today, the third mes-
    sage is given great emphasis.
       Revelation chapters 12-14 contain the piedes of a jigsaw puzzle, which,
    when put together, provide us the clearest painting that God could give of
    earth's final events. The picture contains the destinies of both the wicked
    and the righteous, and might appropriately be captioned, "Everyone Will
    Worship Someone."
       This week we will put in place another piece of the puzzle, and note
    how God's last-day drama is portrayed.
    I. DESCRIPTION OF THE DISLOYAL (Rev. 14:9).
®      Like the first and second angels' messages, the third is set in the book
    of Revelation in the context of final events before Jesus comes. The final
    "harvest" immediately follows.
       As we open our Bibles this week, we need to spend a moment looking
    back to the last Scripture verse of last quarter's lessons.
    1. What is the significance of the events described in Revelation
       11:19? When do these events occur in history? Rev. 11:15-19.


        The beginning of the pre-Advent judgment. "As foretold in the Scrip-
    tures, the ministration of Christ in the most holy place began at the termina-
    tion of the prophetic days in 1844. To this time apply the words of the
    Revelator, 'The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in
    His temple the ark of His testament.' Rev. 11:19. The ark of God's testament
    is in the second apartment of the sanctuary. As Christ entered there, to min-
    ister in the sinner's behalf, the inner temple was opened, and the ark of God
    was brought to view."—The Story of Redemption, p. 379 (italics supplied).

        The third angel's message. "As the ministration of Jesus closed in the
    holy place, and He passed into the holiest [1844], and stood before the ark
    containing the law of God, He sent another mighty angel with a third mes-
    sage to the world. . . . This message was designed to put the children of
    God upon their guard, by showing them the hour of temptation and an-
    guish that was before them. Said the angel, 'They will be brought into
    close combat with the beast and his image. Their only hope of eternal life
    is to remain steadfast.' "—Early Writings, p. 254.
       The third angel's message and the Sabbath. The beginning and
    ending of the third angel's message lie within the time span covered by
    Revelation 11:15-19. The scene develops following the disappointment of
    October 22, 1844, and climaxes at the close of probation when the wicked
    and righteous are forever separated (Rev. 22:11).
       As God opened the Most Holy Place in heaven in 1844, the ark was
    brought to view. It contains the law including the fourth-commandment
    Sabbath. This prophetic picture was fulfilled in the emphasis placed on the
    law and the Sabbath following 1844. The issue of the true versus the false
    58
sabbath is central to an understanding of this section of Revelation. (See
Rev. 11:19; 12:17; 13:14-17; 14:9-11; 14:12.) All of these passages refer
to the same period of time. History fulfills prophecy, revealing the re-
covery of the Sabbath truth after 1844. A further fulfillment will involve
the exaltation of Sunday, in the establishment of the image to the beast and
the mark of the beast. The climax will be the worldwide demand that Sun-
day sacredness be honored. This will require earth's inhabitants to make a
decision that will have life-and-death significance.
2. Against what three instruments of evil does the third angel warn?
   Rev. 14:9.



   What power does the beast represent? (Review Lesson 3.) This is the
beast described in Revelation 13:1-10. "By this first beast is represented
the Roman Church, an ecclesiastical body clothed with civil power, having
authority to punish all dissenters."—The Story of Redemption, p. 381. The
second beast of Revelation 13:11-18 commands mankind to worship the
first, leopardlike beast.
    Seven points of identification enable us to identify the first beast of
Revelation 13 as the papacy:
    a. It is a blasphemous power (13:1, 5, 6).
    b. Its rise was dependent upon another power (13:2).
    c. It had a set time in history during which God allowed it to function
        as the supreme power ecclesiastically (13:5).
    d. Supported by civil power, it established a system of worship that is
        opposed to Bible Christianity (13:4, 7, 8).
    e. It is a persecuting power (13:7).
    f. It has worldwide influence and effectiveness (13:7).
    g. Its number is 666 (13:18).
    What is the image to the beast? The fulfillment of Revelation 14:9
can take place only when the image to the first beast has been formed, and
when the mark of the beast is enforced. These are issues for the near fu-
ture. When the fulfillment of these steps occurs, and multitudes worship
the beast and its image, and receive its mark, then probation's close will be
at the door.
    In Revelation 13 the second power makes an image to the first power.
"The formation of this image is the work of that beast whose peaceful rise
and mild professions render it so striking a symbol of the United States.
Here is to be found an image of the Papacy. When the churches of our land,
uniting upon such points of faith as are held by them in common, shall in-
fluence the State to enforce their decrees and sustain their institutions, then
will Protestant America have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy.
Then the true church will be assailed by persecution, as were God's ancient
people.'' The Story of Redemption, pp. 381, 382 (italics supplied).

   What is the mark of the beast? This is the mark of the first beast of
 chapter 13, enforced by the second beast. "What then is the change of the
 Sabbath, but the sign, or mark, of the authority of the Roman Church—`the
                                                                            59
mark of the beast'?"—The Great Controversy, p. 448. The pioneers of the
1840s slowly came to these correct conclusions.
   The mark of papal authority. The Roman Catholic Church "has
made non-observance of Sunday a mortal sin. In the early Middle Ages
priests 'discovered' letters from heaven to frighten people into observing
Sunday rather than the Sabbath. In 1054 Pope Leo IX excommunicated
the entire Eastern Orthodox Church partly because the Orthodox cele-
brated the Sabbath. Of all the major branches of Christendom the
Catholic Church became the one most opposed to the seventh-day Sab-
bath.
   " 'The pope can modify divine law,' said Petrus de Ancharano.
   " 'The Sabbath, the most glorious day in the law, has been changed into
the Lord's day . . . by the authority of the church,' declared the archbishop
of Reggio at the crucial Council of Trent.
   " 'We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the Catholic Church
transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday,' says The Convert's
Catechism.
   "God didn't change His law even to excuse Jesus from Gethsemane
and crucifixion. . . . But a body of Christian leaders felt free to change it,
and to harrass, persecute, and excommunicate millions of Christians who
chose to obey it. The charge is serious indeed."—C. Mervyn Maxwell,
God Cares (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press, 1985), pp. 379, 380.
   When is this mark to be received? "It is not until the issue is thus
plainly set before the people, and they are brought to choose between the
commandments of God and the commandments of men, that those who
continue in transgression will receive 'the mark of the beast.' "—The
Great Controversy, p. 449.
   The enforcement of the mark of the beast by law has not yet occurred.
In the future some will observe Sunday because, despite the adequate evi-
dence to the contrary, they are convinced that this is what they should do.
Many interpreters of the prophecy have concluded that these are the ones
who will receive the symbolic mark in their foreheads. Others accept Sun-
day observance only because of the civil penalties that they would have to
suffer if they did not. It is thought that these are the ones who will have the
mark in their right hands.
11. THE RESULT OF DISLOYALTY (Rev. 14:10,11).
3. What do you understand by the drinking of "the wine of the
   wrath of God?" Rev. 14:10.


   The New International Version reads, "the wine of God's fury, which
has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath." Awful punish-
ment will be given for worshiping the beast and his image, and receiving
of his mark.

60
WED   4. How will God's wrath be manifested immediately after the close of
a        probation? Rev. 15:1, 7.



      5. Upon whom is the first plague poured out? Rev. 16:2.


         The Bible depicts our loving God (1 John 4:8) standing at the door of
      the human heart pleading for entry (Rev. 3:20). There will come a time
      when those who have refused all of His invitations and have rejected His
      truth will be the subjects of "his strange act" (Isa. 28:21). With the
      greatest love and sadness, He will rid the universe of sin, and of those who
      have identified themselves with the evil one who introduced it.
      6. What kind of torment will the lost suffer? Rev. 14:10, 11.



         Those who reject God and receive the mark of the beast will be tor-
      mented. They will suffer the plagues. When Jesus returns at the close of
      the plagues, those of the wicked who are still living will suffer death. They
      will then remain dead for 1,000 years (Rev. 20:5, 6). After this they will be
      raised for a short time. With the devil and his angels, they will be cast into
      the lake of fire. This is the "second death." (See Rev. 20:9, 10, 14.)
         The devil's two deceptions. "Satan led them on to believe that the sin-
      ner would live in eternal misery. . . . Another extreme which Satan has led
      the people to adopt is entirely to overlook the justice of God and the
      threatenings of His Word, and to represent Him as being all mercy, so that
      not one will perish, but that all, both saint and sinner, will at last be saved
      in His kingdom."—The Story of Redemption, p. 389.
         What about the fire and brimstone? This is how God described the
      destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19:24. Jude says that these
      two cities suffered "the vengeance of eternal fire" (Jude 7). The wicked in
      these cities were burned up, but they were not tormented beyond death.
      Our God is always a consuming fire to wickedness and sin. It is true that
      the wicked never have rest in their wickedness. They will have no rest
      "day nor night" as they suffer the plagues and as they suffer the lake of
      fire at the close of the 1,000 years. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 107, 763,
      764.)
      7. What is meant by "for ever and ever"? Rev. 14:11.


         The Greek phrase translated "forever and ever" (eis aionas aionon)
      could be translated literally, "unto ages of ages." It means as long as the
      nature of the subject allows. God lives forever and ever (endlessly) be-
                                                                                  61
    cause He is immortal (1 Tim. 6:16). The eternal life of the righteous is
    forever and ever (endless) because they are given immortality at the sec-
    ond coming of Jesus (1 Cor. 15:51-54).
       The word aion ("age") used in Revelation 14:11 is often used in Scrip-
    ture for periods of limited duration. For example, Matthew 13:39 speaks of
    "the end of the world [aion]." (Compare Eph. 1:21; 2 Tim. 4:10; 1 Cor.
    2:7.) Because the wicked are mortal, they are entirely consumed in the
    fires of the last great day. The aion, or age, of the righteous and wicked
    will be different because their natures will be different. As lost mortal
    beings the wicked will be burned up and reduced to ashes (Mal. 4:1-3;
    compare Psalms 37:10, 20; 68:1, 2).


®   I11. DESCRIPTION OF THE LOYAL (Rev. 14:12).
    8. What three identifying points describe the saints? Rev. 14:12?


        The people who are taken to be with Jesus at the Second Coming in-
    clude those symbolized by the number 144,000, and those who are raised
    in the first resurrection. (See John 5:28, 29; 1 Cor. 15:51-53; 1 Thess. 4:16;
    Rev. 20:6, first part.) Those who endure patiently the trials of this life,
    keep the commandments of God, and have the faith of Jesus will be
    "saints" for eternity.
        The New International Version translates Revelation 14:12: "This calls
    for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's command-
    ments and remain faithful to Jesus." Our study of the three angels' mes-
    sages of Revelation 14 emphasizes that, in view of all that is coming in the
    future, our only security is patient trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, and strict
    obedience to His will, as we live daily by faith in Him.
    9. What is the relationship between justification by faith and the
       three angels' messages? Compare Titus 3:5-7 with Rev. 14:6.


       "The Third Angel's Message in Verity.—Several have written to me,
    inquiring if the message of justification by faith is the third angel's mes-
    sage, and I have answered, 'It is the third angel's message in verity.' "—
    Evangelism, p. 190.
        This statement does not apply only to the warning of Revelation 14:9-11.
    It applies to all three angels' messages. The statement comes from an article
    in the Review and Herald, dated April 1, 1890, entitled, "Repentance the
    Gift of God." God has given the three angels' messages to prepare a people
    to meet their Lord in the clouds of heaven. A knowledge of these messages
    alone will not save anyone. Salvation is ours as we enter into the "everlast-
    ing gospel" experience described in Revelation 14:6. This is the personal
    relationship with Christ to which the three messages lead. As Jesus becomes
    our personal Friend and Saviour we are given His enabling grace to love and
    obey the truth. This is the road to the eternal kingdom.
    62
       The same in purpose. "The message of justification by faith and the
    third angel's message are the same in purpose, in scope, and in results. . . .
    Justification by faith is God's way of saving sinners; His way of convict-
    ing sinners of their guilt, their condemnation, and their utterly undone and
    lost condition. It is also God's way of canceling their guilt, delivering them
    from the condemnation of His divine law, and giving them a new and right
    standing before Him and His holy law. Justification by faith is God's way
    of changing weak, sinful, defeated men and women into strong, righteous,
    victorious Christians."—A. G. Daniells, Christ Our Righteousness (Wash-
    ington, DC: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1941), pp. 64, 65.

    briefly in the space that follows:




     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study Romans 3:19-31 in
MA connection with the messages of Revelation 14:9-12. Read the chapter
     "The Third Angel's Message," in Early Writings, pp. 254-258. Also read
     "The Third Angel's Message," "A Firm Platform," and "Satan's Delu-
     sions," in The Story of Redemption, pp. 379-392.
     SUMMARY: There will be two classes of people on the earth at the end
     of time: (1) those who worship the beast and his image and receive his
     mark; and (2) those who, by faith in Jesus, endure patiently and keep His
     commandments.

Thrust in Thy Slickie9
and Reap
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14:13-20.
      MEMORY TEXT: "Then shall the King say unto them on his
PM    right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
      prepared for you from the foundation of the world" (Matthew
      25:34).
OF WHICH HARVEST WILL YOU BE A PART? The Son of man is
on center stage in our lesson this week. During His ministry on earth He
told the parable of the wheat and the tares (Matt. 13:36-43). In that parable
He taught that the "harvest" would take place at the end of the world. In
Revelation 14:13-20, harvest time has come, wheat and tares are separated,
eternal salvation is given to believers and eternal rejection for nonbeliev-
ers. The central question in this lesson is: Will you be involved in the
harvest of the saved or of the lost? Christ's earnest desire is to save every-
one (2 Peter 3:9). Are you willing to be saved?

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 14:13-20
              14:13-16                             14:17-20
     "Reaping" of the righteous           "Reaping" of the wicked

ARE WE PREPARING TO MEET OUR LORD? Earth's history
rushes on toward its great climax. Immersed in their earthly activities,
many are unaware that the final reckoning for all is in the immediate fu-
ture.
   Sadly, even in the Christian church, there is much unawareness of the
events about to take'place in our world. The church has the Scriptures in
which every major event of the future is unveiled. In addition, the Seventh-
day Adventist Church has been abundantly blessed with a modem fulfill-
ment of the gift of prophecy, a precious gift of the Spirit (Eph. 4:11-13).
The thousands of additional pages of guidance and counsel leave no ex-
cuse for ignorance of God's program of events. The Conflict of the Ages
Series, undoubtedly the finest body of spiritual literature outside the Bible,
paints a picture of the future that unmasks Satan's deceptions and clearly
reveals God's plan of saving His people.
   We need to ask ourselves: Are we awake, listening, and preparing? Are
we free from the spiritual blindness of which Laodicea has been warned?
                                                                           65
    Are we busy searching our Bibles? Are we daily getting ready to meet our
    Lord? Are we ready now?
       In our lesson this week we are given a preview of the end-time harvest.
    Let us keep these important questions in mind.


®   I. THE REAPING OF THE RIGHTEOUS (Rev. 14:13-16).
    1. After God describes His "saints," what strong commendation does
       He make of those who die in Christ? Rev. 14:12, 13.


       Revelation 14:13 is one of the seven "beatitudes" in the book of Rev-
    elation. (See Rev. 1:3; 14:13; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7, 14.) Revelation
    14:13 refers to the saints described in verse 12, and points also to the
    harvest in the verses that follow.
       Those who die in Christ before His second coming experience a tem-
    porary rest. Even in death, their good lives and deeds continue to testify to
    their faith. As they sleep peacefully in the grave, their past lives witness to
    many still living that they should decide now for Christ and eternity.
       The righteous shall be an everlasting remembrance. "When a.man
    dies, his influence does not die with him; but it lives on, reproducing itself.
    The influence of the man who is good and pure and holy lives on after his
    death, like the glow of the descending sun, casting its glories athwart the
    heavens, lighting up the mountain peaks long after the sun has sunk behind
    the hill. . . .
       "But what a contrast to this is the life of those who are earthly, sensual,
    devilish! The sensual pleasure was indulged. In the light of the judgment,
    the man appears as he is, stripped of the livery of heaven. He stands before
    others as he is in the sight of a holy God. Let every one of us think seri-
    ously whether the works following us will be the mellow light of heaven
    or the shadows of darkness, and whether the legacies we bequeath are
    those of blessings or curses."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 429.
       "From henceforth." These words identify the general time period
    during which these saints die. It is the same span of time covered by the
    three angels' messages, or from 1844 onwards. They rest until the time of
    trouble is past.
    2. What classes of people will be raised in the special resurrection
       just prior to the general resurrection of the righteous? Rev. 1:7;
       Matt. 26:64; Dan. 12:2.


       "Graves are opened, and 'many of them that sleep in the dust of the
    earth.— awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlast-
    ing contempt.' Daniel 12:2. All who have died in the faith of the third
    angel's message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's
    covenant of peace with those who have kept His law. 'They also which
    66
pierced him' (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked and derided Christ's
dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His truth and His people,
are raised to behold Him in His glory and to see the honor placed upon the
loyal and obedient."—The Great Controversy, p. 637.
3. What symbolic vision of Christ's coming was John given? What
   significance do you see in the manner in which Christ's coming is
   described? Rev. 14:14; compare 1:7; Luke 21:27; Acts 1:9-11.


   Faithful believers will look up to see Jesus coming with clouds. Acts
1:11 gives the significance of the expression more clearly. The clouds at
His ascension consisted of a "cloudy chariot of angels" (The Desire of
Ages, p. 831). Two of those angels lingered briefly to tell the upward-
gazing disciples that Jesus would come back "in like manner."

   Jesus' coming described. "Soon there appears in the east a small black
cloud, about half the size of a man's hand. It is the cloud which surrounds
the Saviour. . . . The people of God know this to be the sign of the Son of
man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it draws nearer the earth, be-
coming lighter and more glorious, until it is a great white cloud. . . . Jesus
rides forth as a mighty conqueror.. . . He comes . . . to judge the living and
the dead. . . . With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast, un-
numbered throng, attend Him on His way."—The Great Controversy, pp.
640, 641.
4. How is the One who comes upon the great white cloud described?
   Rev. 14:14.


  • "The Son of man." Even though He now has a glorified body,
Christ still is recognized as a member of the human race.
   • "Having on his head a golden crown." This is a crown of victory.
What a contrast to the crown of thorns He wore on the day He died for us.
That crown represented the cruelty of those who reject Him. The crown
that He wears at the Advent represents the spiritual victory so dearly won
for humanity on Calvary's cross. (See Rev. 5:5, 9, 10.)

   • "In his hand a sharp sickle." This is the time when the Judge (John
5:22, 23) executes judgment. First He saves those faithful to Him, who
loved the truth (2 Thess. 2:10), and whose love motivated and enabled
them to keep His commandments (John 14:15). They are so transformed
by grace that they are said to be "like Him" (1 John 3:2). The passage
next portrays Christ's judgment on those who refuse to demonstrate their
loyalty by worshiping Him alone.
5. Another angel comes with a message for Christ. Where does he
   come from? Rev. 14:15.
                                                                           67
in 6. What terrible and glorious moment of time has come in earth's
       history? Verse 15, last part.


        From here to the end of the chapter, two distinctive events are de-
     scribed. First, the gathering of the righteous, who are likened to ripened
     grain. Verse 15 portrays the harvest of the earth as fully ripe. The second
     event (verses 17-20) refers to the gathering of the wicked, who are symbol-
     ized by clusters of ripe grapes.
     7. What causes the spiritual maturing of the righteous prior to the
        coming of Christ? Joel 2:23, 28, 29; Hosea 6:3; compare 2 Cor.
        3:18.


        In Bible lands an early rain fell in seed-sowing time, so that the seed
     might germinate. The latter rain fell near the close of the growing season,
     to ripen the grain and prepare it for the sickle.
        The work of the Holy Spirit. "The Lord employs these operations of
     nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit. As the dew and the rain are
     given first to cause the seed to germinate, and then to ripen the harvest, so
     the Holy Spirit is given to can)' forward, from one stage to another, the
     process of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain represents the com-
     pletion of the work of God's grace in the soul. . . .
        "The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the spiritual grace
     that prepares the church for the coming of the Son of man."—Testimonies
     to Ministers, p. 506.
     8. The Scriptures speak of a harvest of people symbolized by a har-
        vest of crops. Study these passages, and note the figurative lan-
        guage in each.
          • Jer. 8:19, 20
          • Joel 3:12, 13
          • John 4:28-30, 35
          • Matt. 13:30, 39
        These and other passages point to a final harvest of people, with reward
     for the good and punishment for the evil. Revelation 19 focuses on the
     same theme.
        Are you praying for the latter rain? Jesus instructed His first dis-
     ciples to wait and pray for the special outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Luke
     24:49; Acts 1:4, 5). The answer came as the Spirit descended upon the
     believers on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4). When the Spirit is poured
     68
upon Christ's waiting, praying people today, the whole earth will be
"lightened with his glory" (Rev. 18:1). Never has the church needed this
blessing more than now. God is waiting to bestow the Holy Spirit upon us.

11. THE REAPING OF THE WICKED (Rev. 14:17-20).
9. As the scene changed to the wicked, what special power was given
   to an angel? What is the meaning? Rev. 14:18.


   Some are troubled by the thought of a God of wrath and punishment.
We recall the Flood (Gen. 6:5-7, 17), the 185,000 Assyrians slain in one
night by an angel (2 Kings 19:35), the story of Uzzah touching the ark
(1 Chron. 13:10), the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira for lying (Acts 5:1-
11). And 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10 speaks of retribution upon the wicked in
connection with the final harvest of the earth.
  God's wrath explained. How are we to relate to these examples of
wrath, and destruction on the God's part? We know several key facts about
our God:
    a. He "is love" (1 John 4:8). We say He has love. The fact is that He
is love. He acts always and only out of love. God is "fairness" itself. (See
Neh. 9:33; Isa. 45:21.) The great controversy was started by a once-perfect
angel who accused a fair God of being unfair.
   b. God has given every human being opportunity to be on the right side
of the harvest. (See John 3:16.) He cannot give eternal life to those who
have rejected the Source of life. The redeemed sing, "Just and true are thy
ways, thou King of saints" (Rev. 15:3).

   c. There are factors leading to destruction for which God is not re-
sponsible:
   • God does not arbitrarily cause anyone to be lost. Each person, using
     his free will, chooses for himself whether he will serve and love
     God or disobey and be lost eternally. This is Ellen White's meaning
     when she says, "God destroys no man. Everyone who is destroyed
     will have destroyed himself."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 84.
   • God is not responsible for the consequences of a sinful lifestyle. We
     reap what we sow (Gal. 6:7). "The sinner brings the punishment
     upon himself. His own actions start a train of circumstances that
     bring the sure result."—Selected Messages, vol. 1, p. 235.
   • God is not responsible for the destruction caused by Satan and his
     followers. When people turn away from God, He withdraws His
     protection and they become victims of the evil one. King Saul is an
     example.

                                                                         69
        d. After the close of probation, "God's strange act" (Isa. 28:21) in-
     volves judicial punishment of Satan and the wicked. The seven last plagues
     are by God's direct action ("in them is filled up the wrath of God"—Rev.
     15:1; compare 16:5-7). Likewise the destruction of the living wicked at the
     Second Advent and the final punishment of Satan and all his followers at
     the end of the millennium is by God's direct action. We must not liken His
     wrath to human anger. God's wrath is His just and holy reaction to sin.
        God metes out destruction upon Satan and his followers. "Satan
     rushes into the midst of his followers and tries to stir up the multitude to
     action. But fire from God out of heaven is rained upon them, and the great
     men, and mighty men, the noble, the poor and miserable, are all consumed
     together. I saw that some were quickly destroyed, while others suffered
     longer. They were punished according to the deeds done in the body. Some
     were many days consuming, and just as long as there was a portion of them
     unconsumed, all the sense of suffering remained. Said the angel, 'The
     worm of life shall not die; their fire shall not be quenched as long as there
     is the least particle for it to prey upon.' "—Early Writings, p. 294. (See
     also p. 291; The Great Controversy, pp. 661, 672, 673.)
     10. Why are the wicked likened to "the clusters of the vine of the
         earth?" Rev. 14:18 (last part).


        "The figure of the two harvests is borrowed from the ancient Palestin-
     ian agricultural year, which consists of two main harvests, the grain harvest
     [in the spring], and the vintage [in the autumn]. . . . Here the vintage rep-
     resents the wicked gathered for destruction."—SDA Bible Commentary,
     vol. 7, p. 834.
     11. Where are the clusters of ripe grapes said to be cast? Rev. 14:19.
El
        Our next lesson will establish that this winepress of God's wrath begins
     before the Second Coming, when the seven last plagues are poured out.

     12. Where are the grapes in God's winepress trodden? Rev. 14:20
         (first part).


        The allusion here is to the destruction of God's enemies pictured by
     Old Testament prophets. It was to take place outside the city of Jerusalem.
     (See Joel 3:12, 13.)
     13. As the picture of destruction comes to an end, note the sym-
         bolism John uses. Rev. 14:20 (last part).


     70
       "The main thought is that the enemies of the church of God are to be
    completely and finally overthrown. Therefore the church can look forward
    to full and complete deliverance from all her enemies, and to joyful tri-
    umph in the kingdom of God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 835.
    SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS 12-14. The time period covered is largely
    the years from 1798 to Christ's second coming. The events from 1844 to
    the close of probation are vitally important. John pictures Christ's church
    persecuted before 1798, and "the remnant" pursued since then. He de-
    scribes the papal apostasy of the Middle Ages as the predecessor to the de-
    ceptive, miracle-working, last-day religious union (Papacy, apostate Prot-
    estantism, spiritism). The spiritual characteristics of end-time believers and
    the messages designed to prepare them for heaven are clearly spelled out.
    Finally we are reminded of God's purpose of redeeming those who believe
    and destroying those who do not.
    WHERE DO I FIT INTO THE FINAL SCENE? In the light of Revela-
    tion 12-14 write a list of the qualifications you must have to be among
    those taken to heaven when Jesus comes.




       How can you gain these qualifications?


    FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: In connection with Revela-
®   tion 14:14-20 study chapter 6:14-17 and 19:11-21. Read the chapters en-
    titled "First the Blade, Then the Ear," and "Tares" in Christ's Object
    Lessons, pp. 62-75.
    SUMMARY: Harvesttime for our world is the second coming of Jesus,
    when He will take His faithful ones to heaven and destroy those who have
    refused His love.

The Seven Last Naves
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 15:1-16:21.

sae   MEMORY TEXT: "Because thou hast made the Lord, which is
PM    my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil
      befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling"
      (Psalm 91:9, 10).

GOD'S PUNISHMENT OR PROTECTION? Never has there been
such a marked separation between the righteous and the wicked, as will be
seen after the close of probation when the seven last plagues are poured
out. Great will be the suffering of the wicked, and great the privation of the
righteous. The righteous will praise God for His mercy, and the wicked
will blaspheme because of His judgments. God promises: "Blessed is he
that watcheth, and keepeth his garments" (Rev. 16:15).

                  OVERVIEW: Revelation 15:1-16:21

            15:1-16:1                               16:2-21

         Seven angels with                       The plagues
         seven last plagues                      poured out


JUDGMENTS Alrl ER PROBATION'S CLOSE. The events of Revela-
tion 15 and 16 occur just before the harvest, which we studied last week.
These chapters paint a picture of tribulation, which takes place between the
close of probation (Rev. 22:11) and the second coming of our Lord. The
"close of probation" is the term used to refer to the point at which Christ
ceases to intercede in the heavenly sanctuary. The seven last plagues are
poured out on the earth between the close of probation and the second
coming of Christ.
   Fearful judgments. These seven plagues are the most fearful judg-
ments ever poured out on the human race. They fall upon those who have
declared final loyalty to the religious powers that defy God in the last days.
Those who have turned their backs on God's Bible truths and His many
calls to repent and follow Him will begin to suffer divine retribution after
probation closes. God has done all He can for them, and His judgments
will then be poured out.
   The faithful sustained. As we study this week, note carefully the refer-
ences that are made to God's care for the righteous. The Lord has gra-
ciously revealed not only that His faithful people will be sustained both

72
    spiritually and physically through these most difficult times, but also that
    their trials will help them eliminate all earthly dependencies.


®   I. SEVEN ANGELS WITH THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES (Rev.
       15:1-16:1).
       Chapter 15 informs us concerning the overall nature of the plagues, who
    brings them, and from where. We are given the reassurance that not every-
    one will suffer them.
    1. What basic facts are given us concerning the plagues? Why are
       these plagues said to be "great and marvellous?" Rev. 15:1.


       Judgments, punishments, and "plagues" have occurred before in the
    history of the human race. These plagues are the last, there will be no
    more. However, the lost of all ages still must face their final punishment at
    the close of the 1,000 years. (See Revelation 20.)
       The plagues have far-reaching effects. They fall on sinners the world
    around, and conclude with the glorious coming of Christ, which to the
    wicked is as a consuming fire. (See 2 Thess. 2:8; 2 Peter 3:7, 10, 12.)
    2. How do you harmonize the beautiful fact that God is love, with
       this picture in Revelation 15 and 16 of His terrible wrath?


       Note the following facts regarding God's wrath:
       a. Christ suffered God's wrath. "The sword of justice was un-
    sheathed, and the wrath of God against iniquity rested upon man's substi-
    tute, Jesus Christ, the only begotten of the Father."—Ellen G. White Com-
    ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1103 (italics supplied).
       b. Our choice is important. "The wrath of God will not fall upon one
    soul that seeks refuge in Him. God Himself has declared, 'When I see the
    blood, I will pass over you.' "—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 157.
       c. Rejecting Christ is the greatest sin. "The death of Christ brings to
    the rejecter of His mercy the wrath and judgments of God, unmixed with
    mercy. This is the wrath of the Lamb. But the death of Christ is hope and
    eternal life to all who receive Him and believe in Him."—Ellen G. White
    Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1107.

        d. Sinners need not suffer. Justice demands that the breaking of God's
     law must meet its due punishment, as it did in our Substitute, the innocent
     Christ. But God's marvelous mercy offers undeserving men and women
     forgiveness. By accepting Christ's suffering, they may be free from the
     ultimate consequences of their sin (Rom. 8:1).

                                                                               73
     3. What beautiful example of the thoughtfulness of God are we
        given? Before further unveiling the specifics of the plagues, what
        note of hope does He first give? Rev. 15:2-4.



        Final victory for the faithful. "While John was shown the last great
     struggles of the church with earthly powers, he was also permitted to be-
     hold the final victory and deliverance of the faithful. . . . Looking beyond
     the smoke and din of the battle, he beheld a company upon Mount Zion
     with the Lamb, having, instead of the mark of the beast, the `Father's name
     written in their foreheads.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 752.

rid FA 4. What is the significance of the two parts of the song of the vic-
OM        torious ones? Rev. 15:3.


        The song of Moses is a reference to the song of deliverance that Israel
     sang after they had crossed the Red Sea and were safe from Egyptian op-
     pression. (See Ex. 15:1-21.) Standing on the sea of glass, the redeemed
     will sing of deliverance from the tyranny of "Babylon."
        The song of the Lamb is the song of praise the redeemed sing to Christ
     for His deliverance from sin. They exalt both the Son and the Father.

     5. What attributes of God do the redeemed extol? Rev. 15:4.


     6. What is the significance of the place from which come the angels
        who have the plagues? Rev. 15:5, 6.



     7. Who gave these vials or bowls, full of the wrath of God, to the
        seven angels? Rev. 15:7.



     8. What conclusive proof does John give that probation's hour will
        be over at this crucial point in history? Rev. 15:8; compare 7:3;
        8:5; 22:11.


        The end of mediation. "Then I saw that Jesus would not leave the
     most holy place until every case was decided either for salvation or de-
     struction, and that the wrath of God could not come until Jesus had
     finished His work in the most holy place, laid off His priestly attire, and
     clothed Himself with the garments of vengeance. Then Jesus will step out
    74
     from between the Father and man, and God will keep silence no longer,
     but pour out His wrath on those who have rejected His truth. . . .
        "I saw that the four angels would hold the four winds until Jesus' work
     was done in the sanctuary, and then will come the seven last plagues."—
     Early Writings, p. 36.
        "When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the
     earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God
     without an intercessor."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.
TI   11. THE PLAGUES POURED OUT (Rev. 16:2-21).
        Analyze the following parallels between the seven trumpets, and the
     seven last plagues.

            The Seven Trumpets                  The Seven Last Plagues
              Rev. 8:7-11:19                      Rev. 15:1-16:21
        1. Hail, fire, and blood on earth    1. On earth, sores on all with
           (8:7)                                the mark (16:2)
        2. Great mountain burning with .     2. Sea becomes blood (16:3)
           fire cast into sea (8:8)
        3. Burning star falls on one         3. Rivers become blood (16:4)
           third of rivers (8:10, 11)
        4. One third of sun, moon, and       4. Sun scorches men (16:8, 9)
           stars smitten (8:12)
        5. Smoke from pit, locusts with      5. Darkness on seat of beast
           scorpion's tails (9:1-11)            (16:10)
        6. Four angels loosed who were       6. Euphrates dried up; three
           bound in Euphrates (9:14-21)         unclean spirits lead to
                                                Armageddon (16:12-16)
        7. Temple opened, judgment,          7. "It is done"; then thunders,
           then Christ's coming                 lightnings, earthquake, and
           (11:15-19)                            hail (16:17-21)

        Take a pen or red pencil and tie together with lines all the similarities
     that exist between these two lists.
     9. Where was the first plague poured out, what was its nature, and
        upon whom did it fall? Rev. 16:2.


        Are we to understand these plagues as literal or symbolic? The
     plagues on Egypt were literal. (See Ex. 7:20-12:31.) People suffered from
     boils, and were "plagued" with frogs, lice, flies, locusts, and all the rest.
     However, the prophecy of the trumpets employs many symbols. The
     plagues of Revelation 16 may be regarded as literal events with symbolic
     significance.

                                                                                75
    "The language of Revelation is usually symbolic, often impresSionistic.
The language describing the plagues may well be nonliteral. But it loses
little of its force if taken as it reads. 'Foul and evil sores,' blood of a
dead man,' men gnawed their tongues in anguish,' great hailstones,
heavy as a hundredweight' are serious enough taken literally. The 'dark-
ness' on the throne of the beast' and the 'foul spirits like frogs' that
come out of the mouths of `dragon,' beast,' and 'false prophet' require
some interpretation, but they are scarcely mysterious at this stage in our
study of Revelation."—C. Mervyn Maxwell, God Cares, vol. 2, p. 430
(italics his).
   Are the righteous free from suffering during the plagues? "The
people of God will not be free from suffering; but while persecuted and
distressed, while they endure privation and suffer for want of food they
will not be left to perish. . . . While the wicked are dying from hunger and
pestilence, angels will shield the righteous and supply their wants."—The
Great Controversy, p. 629. (See Isa. 33:15, 16; 41:17.)
   Will the plagues cover the entire earth? "These plagues are not uni-
versal, or the inhabitants of the earth would be wholly cut off."—The
Great Controversy, p. 628. It seems clear that some of the plagues will be
here, some there. But all the world will suffer from some of them. "The
whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which came
upon Jerusalem of old."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.

10. What effect will the second plague have on international rela-
    tions? Rev. 16:3.


11. Upon what is the third plague poured? What do you think the
    result will be? Rev. 16:4.


   Pure water is essential for the continuance of life. It is assuring to recall
the promise of the prophet Isaiah, to the righteous, "His waters shall be
sure" (Isa. 33:16).
   Note why God gives the wicked blood to drink (Rev. 16:6).

12. Against what is the fourth plague directed, and what are the
    results? Rev. 16:8, 9.



     "The prophets thus describe the condition of the earth at this fearful
time: 'The land mourneth; . . . because the harvest of the field is perished.
. . . All the trees of the field are withered: because joy is withered away
from the sons of men.' . . . 'How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle
are perplexed, because they have no pasture.' "—The Great Controversy,
p. 628. (See Amos 8:11.)
76
    13. The fifth plague is poured out where, and with what results?
        Rev. 16:10, 11.


       "Seat" here means "throne." " 'The beast' here represents primarily
    the papacy in its revived state, not so much in its religious aspect as in its
    assumed role of a world power dominant over other world powers."—SDA
    Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 841, 842.
®   14. The interpretation of the sixth plague has been the subject of
        much discussion. Upon what is this plague poured out? Rev.
        16:12-16.


       Throughout their history, Adventists have suggested one of two differ-
    ing interpretations of these verses. Note the following review.

      Rev. 16:12-16           Literal Approach            Symbolic Approach

       The SDA Bible Commentary, volume 7, pages 842-846, presents a
    detailed discussion of these views and verses.

                                                                               77
    15. Who are the blessed ones? Rev. 16:15.


       Because Christ comes like a thief He is unexpected by the world. But
    the happy ones during the final judgments are those who have made prep-
    aration and are ready and waiting. They are clothed with Christ's right-
    eousness. They are "steadfast in faith and character and wholly loyal to
    God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 845. (See 1 Thess. 5:2-4; Rev.
    3:5.)

   Adult Lesson




Come Out of He,
My Pewlle
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 17:1-18:24.
Sitr   MEMORY TEXT: "And I heard another voice from heaven,
PM
       saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of
       her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues" (Revelation 18:4).
GOD'S LAST CALL. Apostasy reaches its climax in the time period
studied in this week's lesson. Satan marshals every evil force, both political
and religious, against God and His people. God's fmal call (Rev. 18:4),
which takes place before probation closes, gathers His people into a unified
body. When the fall of Babylon is complete Christ makes ready to come.


                  OVERVIEW: Revelation 17:1-18:24

       17:1-6                   17:8-18     •                18:1-24

     the beast                the vision                   and lament


THE JUDGMENT OF THE WHORE. This week we take a closer look
at the political and religious conditions that will exist at the time when
Satan works through the united efforts of kings and religions in an attempt
to bring about the annihilation of God's people. The entire world will be
arrayed against them.
    Revelation 17 divides into two sections. First, there is the symbolic vi-
sion that John saw, in verses 3-6. Second, verses 8-18 record the explana-
tion. The vision itself is mostly about the judgment of the impure woman
who is seen sitting on a beast. The explanation includes ten verses about
the beast, and only one verse about the woman.
    Even though detailed interpretation of the chapter has its difficulties,
the overall picture is clear. The vision is of critical importance to our un-
derstanding of the confederacy of evil that will exist at the end of time.
The final deliverance of God's people results from their faithfulness
despite the forces ranged against them.

I. THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST (Rev. 17:1-6).
1. What is unique about the way in which this new vision is revealed
   to John? Rev. 17:1.
                                                                            79
        "The identification of this angel as one of the seven plague-bearing an-
     gels of chs. 15 and 16 implies that the information about to be imparted to
     John is related to the seven last plagues. This relationship is confirmed by
     the fact that the announced topic of this chapter—`the judgment of the
     great whore'—takes place under the seventh plague."—SDA Bible Com-
     mentary, vol. 7, p. 849.


In   2. Who is the subject of "judgment" in this chapter? Rev. 17:1.


        The judgment against the harlot is mentioned in Revelation 17:1, 16.
     The judgment against the beast is the subject of verses 8 and 11. Judgment
     upon the seven heads and ten horns of the beast is referred to in verses 10,
     12, and 14. Thus God's judgment against apostasy is a major theme in the
     chapter. Sentence is passed against any course of action that is opposed to
     God's will.
     3. Describe the differences between the woman of Revelation 12:1
        and the woman pictured in Revelation 17:1, 5. What kind of in-
        stitution is represented by each woman?



        The woman of Revelation 17 represents "prostituted" beliefs, organ-
     ized and open opposition to God's truths, and to God's people. Revelation
     12:1 depicts the true Christian church as a virtuous woman. Revelation 17
     symbolizes the ugliness and disloyalty of end-time "Babylon" by the vi-
     sion of a harlot.
     4. How widespread is the evil influence of the harlot woman? Rev.
        17:1 (last part), 2, 3, 15.


        In Revelation 17:1 the woman is pictured as seated on "many waters."
     Verse 15 explains that the waters represent the masses of humanity in the
     nations of earth. Verse 2 states that kings place their authority and re-
     sources at her disposal. Verse 3 shows the woman seated on a beast—
     Satan and his earthly representatives. The picture of her worldwide power
     and the source from which it is derived leaves us marveling as it did the
     apostle John (verse 6).
     5. With what have the kings of earth and its inhabitants been made
        drunk? Rev. 17:2.



        Compare Revelation 14:8 and 18:3. "Babylon has been fostering poi-
     sonous doctrines, the wine of error. This wine of error is made up of false
     doctrines."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 61. Man's power of reason and
     80
judgment in spiritual things is benumbed; he walks into the harlot's errors,
no longer able to discern between right and wrong. He is bewitched by
both the woman and the devil.
6. Where does John see the woman, and what is the significance of
   the beast's color? Rev. 17:3.


   Wilderness. The true church was pictured as in the wilderness for 1260
years (Rev. 12:6, 14). During the period from A.D. 538 to 1798 the church
of God was in the wilderness. Through the forces of apostasy, the devil
sought to destroy God's people.
   The whole earth will become a literal wilderness as the result of the
seven last plagues. The "wilderness" of Revelation 17:3 represents very
difficult times and conditions for God's people.
   A scarlet-colored beast. "The chief difference between the beast of ch.
13 and that of ch. 17 is that in the former, which is identified with the
papacy, no distinction is made between the religious and political aspects
of papal power, whereas in the latter the two are distinct—the beast repre-
senting political powers and the woman, religious power."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 851.
   The color of the beast is a representation of sin. (See Isa. 1:18; Rev.
12:3.)
7. What is implied by the symbolism of the woman's golden cup?
   Rev. 17:4.


   The cup is beautiful, but full of false doctrine and deception. The sug-
gestion is that it represents the overpowering attractiveness of the false-
hoods that the woman presents to the world. Her seductiveness and moral
impurity are represented by the purple and scarlet clothes she is wearing.
She has assumed the colors of royalty, but in actuality she is a prostitute.
What a constrast to the picture of the bride of the Lamb described in Rev-
elation 19:7, 8!
8. If the woman of Revelation 12:1 has a name, it must be, "the
   faithful church of the Lamb of God." How does this contrast with
   the name of the harlot woman in Revelation 17:5?


   " 'Babylon the great' in the book of Revelation designates, in a special
sense, the united apostate religions at the close of time. . . . Babylon is
referred to as 'great' in view of the fact that this chapter deals most par-
ticularly with Satan's great final effort to secure the allegiance of the human
race through religion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 851, 852.
                                                                            81
       "The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching
    their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach
    over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power."—The Great Con-
    troversy, p. 588.
       "The daughters of this 'mother' thus represent the various religious
    bodies that constitute apostate Protestantism."—SDA Bible Commentary,
    vol. 7, p. 852.
    9. Who are the special objects of the wrath of this great religious
       apostasy? Verse 6.


       The cries and songs of the martyrs. Read Revelation 6:9-11, and 20:4.
    The cries of the souls under the altar have never died out. But the reward
    of martyrs for God is beyond our imagination. They will sit on thrones
    with Christ.
®   11. EXPLANATION OF THE VISION (Rev. 17:8-18).

    10. What are we told regarding the history of this mysterious beast?
        Rev. 17:3, 8, 11.


      Consider several views that Seventh-day Adventist expositors have
    presented:


         "The beast              "and is not"                  "and yet is
          that was"                                             [to be]"

     Pagan Rome            Interval between end of          Papal Rome
                           pagan persecution and
                           beginning of papal
                           persecution

     Period of beast       Interval between the             Revival of the
     and its seven         wounding of seventh head         beast when it
     heads                 and revival of the beast as      becomes the eighth

     the ages              Revelation 20                    brief work of
                                                            Satan, then his
                                                            destruction


    11. Compare the work of the leopardlike beast (Rev. 13:2, 3, 8) with
        the work of the beast and the harlot. Rev. 17:8 (second part).

    82
         "In certain respects this beast resembles the great red dragon of ch.
      12:3, and in others the leopardlike beast of ch. 13:1, 2 . . . . The context
      makes the latter relationship appear to be closer."--SDA Bible Commen-
      tary, vol. 7, p. 851.

         Who have their names retained in the book of life? We must com-
      mit ourselves to a deep, personal relationship with Christ to have our
      names in the book of life. (See Heb. 12:23.) By His grace we must be
      overcomers of temptation, sin, and deception, to have our names re-
      tained in that wonderful book of God. (See Rev. 3:5.) A knowledge of
      Bible truth is vital (2 Tim. 3:15-17). A love of the truth must be
      developed and maintained (2 Thess. 2:10). Our "first love" experience
      cannot be allowed to fade (Rev. 2:4, 5). We must have adequate "oil"
      always at hand, to keep our "lamps" burning brightly (Matt. 25:1-13).
      Then no deception can enter, and we can rest assuredly on the promises
      of our Lord for eternal salvation.

WED   12. What are we told about the heads of the beast? Rev. 17:9, 10.
a



          "These apparently represent seven major political powers through
      ' which Satan has sought to destroy the people and work of God on
       earth."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 854.

          What major views have been advanced as to their identity?
          a. Some see the heads as representing opposition to God and His people
      throughout history, without any identification of specific political powers.
          b. Others identify seven specific nations that are mentioned in the books
      of Daniel and Revelation. The first four are the nations of Daniel 2 and 7:
      Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The fifth head is said to repre-
      sent the same power as represented by the little horn of Daniel 7 and 8, and
      the leopardlike beast of Revelation 13 (the papacy). The sixth head is
      thought to be revolutionary France (Rev. 11:7). The seventh head is iden-
      tified as the second beast of Revelation 13, the United States of America.
          c. Another view considers the heads from the perspective of John's day
      (A.D. 96). The five fallen nations are identified as Egypt, Assyria, Baby-
      lon, Medo-Persia, and Greece. The "one is" refers to Pagan Rome. The
      nation to come is the Papacy.
          d. Another view identifies the heads with the beasts of prophecy. Five
      are fallen (passed off the stage of action): lion, bear, leopard, non-descript,
      dragon. The dragon (Rev. 12), who is primarily Satan, still functions, of
      course, but not in his capacity as a direct antogonist against the person of
      Jesus Christ. The "one is" refers to the leopardlike beast of Revelation 13
      (the papacy). The one who "is not yet come" is the lamblike beast of Rev-
      elation 13:11-17.
       13. With the above in mind, how do we interpret the statement that
           the beast itself is the "eighth," "is of the seven," and "goeth
           into perdition"? Rev. 17:11.

                                                                                  83
   "Even he is the eighth. Literally, 'also himself is an eighth.' This is the
beast in its revived state, in the 'yet is' period following its ascent out of
the 'bottomless pit' . . . . Some consider the eighth power to be the papacy
alone; others suggest that it represents Satan. Those who take the latter
view point out that at the time here indicated Satan attempts to impersonate
Christ . . . .
   "Of the seven. Literally, 'out of the seven.' The beast itself—`the
eighth'—was, it would seem, the same beast to which the seven heads had
been attached. . . . Absence in the Greek of the definite article before the
word 'eighth' suggests that the beast itself was the real authority back of
the seven heads, and that it is therefore more than merely another head, the
eighth in a series. It is their summation and climax—the beast itself."—
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 856.
14. How should we interpret the ten horns? Rev. 17:12-14, 16, 17?


   Ten Kingdoms United Against God. Uriah Smith saw the horns as the
same ten kingdoms of Daniel 7:24, the divisions of the Roman Empire
which became the modern nations of the West. (See Uriah Smith, The
Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation [Mountain View, CA.: Pacific
Press Publishing Association, 1944], p. 712.)
   The indications are that they represent modern nations that give their
political support to the religious demands of "Babylon" (verse 13). Verse
16 indicates that ultimately the nations represented by the ten horns turn
against the harlot because they recognize that she has deceived them. (See
The Great Controversy, pp. 654-656.)
HI. DELIVERANCE AND LAMENT (Rev. 18:1-24).
   The timing of Revelation 18 is very important. In verse 1, John says,
"And after these things." After the description of what he saw in chapter
17 he continues with more information from the Lord. Revelation 18:1-4
must focus on the period just prior to the close of probation, for people are
invited to respond to the call of God.
   Verse 1 speaks of "another angel." This angel unites his voice with the
three angels of Revelation 14:6-12. The relationship between this passage
and Revelation 14:8 is immediately apparent.
15. What hints do you see here that this message is connected with
    the time of the loud cry and the latter rain? Rev. 18:1.


   Pentecost repeated. "The angel who unites in the proclamation of the
third angel's message is to lighten the whole earth with his glory. A work
of worldwide extent and unwonted power is here foretold. . . . The work
will be similar to that of the Day of Pentecost. As the 'former rain' was
given, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to
cause the upspringing of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given
84
at its close, for the ripening of the harvest."—The Great Controversy,
p. 611.
    "The work of this angel comes in at the right time to join in the last
great work of the third angel's message as it swells to a loud cry."—Early
Writings, p. 277. (Compare Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 118.)
16. How complete is Babylon's final fall? Rev. 18:2, 3.



17. Specifically, to whom is God's final call made? Rev. 18:4.


   Compare God's call for Israel to come out of literal Babylon. (Isa.
48:20; Jer. 51:45.) "As God's people formerly came out of literal Babylon
in order that they might return to Jerusalem, so His people today are called
out of mystical Babylon in order that they may be accounted worthy to
enter the New Jerusalem."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 861.
   "God still has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of His
judgments these faithful ones must be called out."—The Great Con-
troversy. 604. (Compare p. 606.)
   "As the time comes for it to be given with greatest power [the third
angel's message], the Lord will work through humble instruments . . . .
Thousands upon thousands will listen who have never heard words like
these."—The Great Controversy, p. 606.
   "God will use ways and means by which it will be seen that He is
taking the reins in His own hands."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 300.
18. As God thus makes His final call and completes His work, what
    great lament does the world make over fallen Babylon? How
    does God look at her and what does He do to her? Rev. 18:5-19.


19. Why are holy apostles and prophets invited to rejoice over
    Babylon's final and complete fall? Rev. 18:20-24; compare Jer.
    51:48, 49.


FALSE VALUES are intoxicating people everywhere. Circle the three
false philosophies or doctrines that you consider to be the most damaging.
Can you list others?
   1. True freedom is doing what comes naturally.
   2. All laws are relative—nothing is absolute.
   3. Humans are each a little part of God. We are God.
   4. The Bible is largely myth and folklore.
    5. There is no theological unity in the Scriptures.
   6. If my good deeds outweigh my bad deeds, I'll be saved.
                                                                          85
g170 FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: As a review, compare the
     dragon of Revelation 12 with the first beast of chapter 13, and the scarlet
     beast of chapter 17. Read "The Final Warning," in The Great Con-
     troversy, pp. 603-612. Also read the short chapters, "The Sins of Baby-
     lon," "The Loud Cry," and "The Third Message Closed," in Early Writ-
     ings, pp. 273-282.
     SUMMARY: Revelation 17 and 18 both give us, not only a clear picture
     of what must happen in terms of world events and movements but also

The Two Suppers
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 19:1-21.

sae MEMORY TEXT: "And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are
PM they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.
    And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God"
    (Revelation 19:9).
YOU ARE INVITED TO DINE. The two suppers of Revelation 19 rep-
resent the final destinies of earth's two classes of people. Every human
being has the choice in this life of dining with Christ or being eternally re-
jected.

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 19:1-21

              19:1-10                              19:11-21

            Rejoicing and                   Christ's return and the
          the supper of the                  supper of the birds
                Lamb

THE KING ESTABLISHES HIS KINGDOM. In Revelation 19 the
books of Daniel and Revelation, with their many lines of prophecy, reach
their climax. The hopes of God's people, which have been feeble at times,
now are rewarded. For instance, Daniel's promise, "In the days of these
kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be de-
stroyed" (Dan. 2:44), finally is fulfilled. The kingdom is "given to the
people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom" (Dan. 7:27). When Christ comes to establish this kingdom
"every eye shall see him . . . and all kindreds of the earth shall wail be-
cause of him" (Rev. 1:7).
   Revelation 19 records singing and wailing. Angels and saints, even a
voice from the throne, rejoice as the pre-Advent judgment comes to a close
and the decisions of the heavenly court are carried out. All last-day apos-
tasy and apostatizers are destroyed. God is vindicated as He executes His
final decisions, based on the choices people have made in regard to loyalty
and worship. God has done everything possible to save every person who
has ever lived. He sent His Son, the Lamb of God, who now returns as
KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

119 I. REJOICING IN HEAVEN AND THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF
        THE LAMB (Rev. 19:1-10).
      Chapter 19 begins with the words "And after these things." After wit-
   nessing the vision of the two previous chapters, John heard singing and re-
   joicing in heaven following the judgment of the harlot and those who had
   joined her deceptions and accepted her false doctrines. This first part of the
   chapter is the climax of what John had just seen. He too must have broken
   out in song on that lonely island of Patmos, as he heard heaven's glorious
   anthem of praise.
   1. Study the following verses of Revelation 19, and make a list of
      those whom John hears singing and rejoicing in heaven.
      Verse 1

      Verse 4
      Verse 5
      Verse 6

   2. What special term is used in the expression of praise? Rev. 19: 1, 3,
      4, 6.


      The English term here Alleluia, originates from the Hebrew, halelu-
   Yah, a combination of two words; one meaning, "to praise," the other
   being a shortened form of "Yahweh." This is the only place where this
   word appears in the New Testament. "The entire universe unites in ac-
   claiming the right of God to universal sovereignty."—SDA Bible Com-
   mentary, vol. 7, p. 871. "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended."—The
   Great Controversy, p. 673.
    3. How is God described in this anthem of praise and tribute? Rev.
       19:1, 2.


        At the Second Coming, God's true and righteous judgments will be
    seen clearly by all the universe. They will be seen even more clearly fol-
    lowing the examination of the records of the wicked during the millen-
    nium, and after Satan makes his personal testimony of God's fairness out-
    side the New Jerusalem at the close of the millennium. (See The Great
    Controversy, p. 670.) Anthems of praise to God will be sung throughout all
    eternity. All will be fully satisfied that God is everything that His Word de-
    clares Him to be.

MOW 4. What work that had been requested for centuries has now come to
    ' an end? Rev. 19:2.
                                                                               89
    The pre-Advent judgment. The metaphorical cry of the martyrs was,
"How long, 0 Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our
blood?" (Rev. 6:10). Their judgment then took place in heaven. While
they were still in their graves, "white robes were given unto every one of
them" (verse 11). White robes can be given to dead people only in the
sense that they are declared righteous by virtue of their relationship with
Christ at the time of their death. The giving of the robes to the dead mar-
tyrs many years after their deaths represents the pre-Advent judgment of
the dead.
    The second half of the martyrs' prayer was not answered until God had
avenged their deaths. By judging and punishing "Babylon" (Revelation
17; 18), the Lord avenged the deaths of the martyrs. For this reason the re-
joicing recorded in Revelation 19:2 specifically mentions the complete ful-
fillment of the martyrs' prayer: "For he hath judged the great whore . . .
and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand."
    Revelation 19 is written from the perspective of the conclusion of the
pre-Advent judgment. Looking back, saints and angels praise the Lord for
the decisions of the heavenly court and for executing those decisions by
punishing spiritual Babylon.
5. What other reason is given for the great rejoicing in heaven? Rev.
   19:7-9?


   The marriage of the Lamb is the pre-advent judgment. These verses
(Rev. 19:7, 8) enable us to determine the time and the nature of "the
marriage of the Lamb." A literal translation reads: ". . . the marriage of
the Lamb came, and His bride made herself ready [or "His bride prepared
herself"]. It was given to her so that she might be clothed with pure, shin-
ing linen, for the linen is the righteous deeds of the saints."
   The making ready occupied a period of time, the same period occupied
by the marriage of the Lamb. The tense of the Greek verb translated
"made ready" may refer to the process of making ready as a whole, or to
the end result of that process. The gift of the fine linen came as the result
of the process of making ready. Character purity at the end of a process of
making ready is the intention of the passage. The "righteous deeds" of the
saints are the result of their reception of the gift of Christ's righteousness.
(See 1 John 2:29; 3:7; Rom. 8:28, 29.)
    The "marriage of the Lamb" during which the "bride" made ready
was the pre-Advent judgment of the martyrs (Rev. 6:10) and of Babylon,
which culminated in the destruction of Babylon and the final avenging of
God's servants (Rev. 19:2).
   Righteous acts reveal character. "The righteous acts . . . of the saints
are regarded by our author as the manifestation of the inner life and as
practically identical with character—the character a man takes with him
when he leaves this life."—R. H. Charles, The Revelation of St. John
(Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1920, 1970), p. 128.

90
     Dictionary of the New Testament, (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerd-
     mans, 1964), p. 222.
        "The white linen represents the good deeds of God's dedicated people.
     That is to say, it is character which forms the robe which arrays the Bride
     of Christ." William Barclay, The Revelation of John (Philadelphia:
     Westminster Press, 1960), vol. 2, p. 224.
        "While the wedding garment is a divine gift, this is no arbitrary or for-
     mal matter but a dynamic one. The saints who are summoned to the
     Lamb's feast are those who have exercised steadfast endurance, who have
     kept the commandments of God, and have persevered in their faith in Jesus
     (Rev. 14:12).—G. E. Ladd, A Commentary on the Revelation of John
     (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1972), p. 249.


19   6. Who is the heavenly Bridegroom? Rev. 19:7; Matt. 25:6.


     7. Who is Christ's bride? Rev. 21:2, 9, 10; Eph. 5:23, 25; 2 Cor.
        11:2?


        The bride is pictured as the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, because it is
     the home of the redeemed saints. The idea of a "city," or a "church," can
     be meaningful only as we consider the people who comprise it. The
     "wife" of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7) is the "saints" who receive the fine linen
     (verse 8).
      • In Scripture the bride/wife symbol is used in more than one sense. Usu-
     ally the symbol depicts God's church. In Revelation 21 the city is repre-
     sented as the bride to make possible the imagery of a marriage with God's
     people as the guests. However, the glory of the city is the righteousness of
     the saints who are represented elsewhere as the wife of the Lamb (Rev.
     19:7, 8; compare Isa. 52:1).
        The pre-Advent marriage. "The proclamation, 'Behold, the Bride-
     groom cometh,' in the summer of 1844, led thousands to expect the imme-
     diate advent of the Lord. At the appointed time the Bridegroom came, not
     to the earth, as the people expected, but to the Ancient of Days in heaven,
     to the marriage, the reception of His kingdom. 'They that were ready went
     in with Him to the marriage: and the door was shut.' They were not to be
     present in person at the marriage; for it takes place in heaven, while they
     are upon the earth. The followers of Christ are to 'wait for their Lord,
     when He will return from the wedding.' Luke 12:36. But they are to under-
     stand His work, and to follow Him by faith as He goes in before God. It is
     in this sense that they are said to go in to the marriage."—The Great Con-
     troversy, p. 427.
        The dual meaning of "marriage." The Greek word for "marriage"
     (gamos) used in Matthew 25:10 may mean "marriage ceremony," or
     "marriage banquet." In 1844 those represented by the five wise virgins
     entered by faith with Christ to the marriage ceremony, the pre-Advent
                                                                               91
judgment. The same parable applies to the second coming of Jesus, when
those who are ready (the five wise virgins) will be taken to the Bride-
groom's home for the marriage supper of the Lamb.
8. Christ has made clear that there is a very special requirement for
   all who would attend His final wedding ceremony. What do you
   understand the wedding garment to be? Matt. 22:10-13.


  First, Christ supplies to all a wedding garment; and second, it must be
worn by every guest. (Review Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:3, 4; Rev. 3:5, 18.)
  The honor of your presence. "By the marriage is represented the
union of humanity with divinity; the wedding garment represents the
character which all must possess who shall be accounted fit guests for the
wedding."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 307. (See also p. 310.)
   This parable introduces us to the fact that not only is there need for true
Christian character but also there is an investigation of each guest before
the wedding. Acceptance or rejection is on the basis of the quality of
character possessed by each. Then comes "the rejoicing of that day when
He shall bring home His bride to the Father's house, and the redeemed
with the Redeemer shall sit down to the marriage supper of the Lamb."—
The Desire of Ages, p. 151.
9. Who will be present at the marriage supper of the Lamb? Rev.
   19:9.


   Since there will be a resurrection of the just (John 5:29) at Jesus' com-
ing, and the living righteous will be caught up with them to meet the Lord
(1 Thess. 4:16, 17), the marriage supper guests will come from all ages
since the time of Adam and Eve.
10. How did this marvelous news affect John? How did the angel
    react? What did the angel's statement mean? Rev. 19:10?


   The term fellowservant suggests that human beings have the privilege
of being co-workers, companions, on earth with holy angels. (See Zech.
3:7; compare Heb. 1:14.)
   The spirit of prophecy. The angel stated, "I am . .. of thy brethren that
have the testimony of Jesus" (Rev. 19:10). The parallel passage, Revela-
tion 22:9, records the angel as saying, "I am . . . of thy brethren the proph-
ets." John was a prophet. Throughout history, his "brethren the prophets"
were those who had received special revelations from God to be given to
the world. Christ has spoken through His chosen agents in both Old and
92
   New Testament times. They gave to mankind Christ's "testimony,"
   which, by various direct means, Heaven had communicated to them. (See
   1 Peter 1:10, 11; 2 Peter 1:21.) The term spirit of prophecy refers to special
   divine revelation, regardless of when it is manifested in earth's history.
   (See 1 Cor. 12:10.) The Lord has seen fit to give this gift to His "rem-
   nant" as an additional voice to call present-day people to the supper that is
   waiting in heaven.
      The reason why John was to worship God rather than the angel is that
   the angel in testifying to Jesus was only a spokesman for God, not God
   Himself.
     Are you following the Spirit of Prophecy counsels given through
   Bible prophets and through the Lord's chosen messenger in the last
   days?
irn 11. CHRIST'S RETURN AND THE SUPPER OF THE BIRDS (Rev.
         19:11-21).
   11. Read John's dramatic symbolic picture of the second coming of
       Christ. Rev. 19:11-16. List two Bible references that describe the
       same event:


       John sees heaven opened. Jesus comes, and the battle of Armageddon
    takes place. This is the "great day of God Almighty" (Rev. 16:14; corn-
    pare verse 19; 14:17-20).

       Elements Awaken to Battle. "Providence has a part to act in the battle
    of Armageddon. When the earth is lighted with the glory of the angel of
    Revelation eighteen, the religious elements, good and evil, will awake
    from slumber, and the armies of the living God will take the field."—Ellen
    White manuscript 175, 1890.
       "The battle of Armageddon is soon to be fought. He on whose vesture is
    written the name, King of kings and Lord of lords is soon to lead forth the
    armies of heaven on white horses, clothed in fine linen, clean and white. . . .
    [Revelation 19:11-21 quoted]."—Ellen White manuscript 172, 1899.
    12. Make a list of the descriptive titles and attributes of Christ given
        in Revelation 19:11-16.




       Our coming King deserves every name and tribute in this passage. Sin-
    ful men, even church leaders, have blasphemed Him. Revelation 1:7 says
    that some of them will be raised to see His coming.

    13. In what symbolic terms does John describe the destruction of the
        wicked at the second coming of Jesus? Rev. 19:17-21.
                                                                                93
14. What classes of people are destroyed at Jesus' coming? Who is
    not destroyed? Rev. 19:20, 21; 20:2.


   Review such Scriptures as 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2:8; 2 Peter 3:10,
along with Revelation 19:20. James White suggested that there will be
"two lakes of fire" (Review and Herald, Jan. 21, 1862), one at the Second
Coming, the other at the close of the millennium. At the Second Coming
the earthly forces of evil are consumed. At the close of the millennium,
Satan and his demons are also included (Rev. 20:10).
   "At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the face of the
whole earth—consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and destroyed by the
brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the City of God, and the
earth is emptied of its inhabitants."—The Great Controversy, p. 657.
MEDITATE AND APPLY:
 • Am I letting the sounds of this world drown out the sound of the
   soon coming of Christ? If so, how can I change that by the way I
   live this week? What aspects of my lifestyle must go? What must I
   put in their place?
 o What positive steps can I take to find relief from my temptation to
   blame God for the problems in my life? Because Jesus quoted Scrip-
   ture to answer arguments against the character of God, what Bible
   statements can I memorize to remind myself of God's infinite con-
   cern for me? (Some suggestions, Isa. 54:9, 10; Jer. 31:3.)
 o Where do I fit in God's plan of enlightening people regarding His
   willingness to save?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: In connection with Revela-
tion 19:7, 8, study the "white robes" passages in the book of Revelation:
3:2-5, 18; 4:4; 6:11; 7:9; 12:1; 15:6; 22:14. Read the chapter, "In the Holy
of Holies," in The Great Controversy, pp. 423-432, and note the clear har-
monizing of several scriptures in connection with the marriage supper of
the Lamb. Also read, "The Third Message Closed," in Early Writings, pp.
279-282.

SUMMARY: Revelation 19 presents two possible destinies open to
earth's inhabitants. If the destiny of the lost seems severe, we must remem-
ber that they choose it. Opposition to God cannot go unchecked forever.
Noah's flood tells us that. In love God saves; in love He destroys. Because
"God is love," all still have an open invitation to His marriage supper.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 20:1-15.
 B' MEMORY TEXT: "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge
WV! the world? and if the world shall be judgid by you, are ye un-
    worthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall
    judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?"
    (1 Corinthians 6:2, 3).

WHY IS THE. MILLENNIUM IMPORTANT? A careful study of the
one thousand years of Revelation 20 is essential for several reasons: (1) It
enhances our understanding of the final vindication of God's character at
the end of the great controversy; (2) indicates the reward of the righteous,
and their work after the second coming of Jesus; and (3) correct under-
standing of the millenniurri keeps us from unscriptural teachings, such as
the doctrine of a premillennial rapture, and the theory of a "second
chance" during the millennium.

                    OVERVIEW: Revelation 20:1-15

      20:1-3, 6                   20:4-6                    20:7-15
   The millennium              During the              The millennium
       begins                  millennium                  closes


FOUR VIEWS OF THE MILLENNIUM. Since the time of Christ four
major views of the millennium have been taught.
   Historic premillennialism, accepted by many since the time of the
early Christian church, is the view that Christ's coming will occur before
the millennium. Seventh-day Adventists are historic premillennialists, with
the exception that they believe that the righteous will spend the millennium
in heaven. The vast majority of historic premillennialists have believed
that the righteous will spend the millennium on this earth.
   Dispensationalist premillennialism agrees that the coming of Christ is
prior to the millennium, but teaches that the Christian saints are "rap-
tured" secretly seven years before the glorious coming of Christ. In the
seven years that follow, the great tribulation occurs, during which 144,000
converted Jews preach the gospel. During the millennium, Christ will reign
over the earth from Jerusalem, and the Old Testament prophecies regard-
ing the complete restoration of Israel as a nation will be fulfilled literally.
                                                                            95
The present-day revival of Israel as a nation is seen as a prelude to the su-
premacy of the Jews as the chosen nation during the millennium. This
view, often called pretribulationism, or Darbyism, is widely accepted
today. It was originated by J. N. Darby and the Plymouth Brethren in Eng-
land in the period 1825-1827.
   Amillennialism is the view popularized by Augustine (A.D. 354-430),
the famous Bishop of Hippo Regius in North Africa. In general this view
states that there is no millennium immediately before or after the second
coming of Christ. The millennium is seen as symbolic of the period of Chris-
tian church history, during which Christ reigns with the saints whose spirits
went to heaven at death and with the leaders of the church on earth. Satan is
thought to be bound since the cross. The first resurrection is spiritual, the
resurrection of the soul at the new birth. The second resurrection is the
general resurrection of all the righteous and wicked at the second coming.
   Postmillennialism teaches that conditions on earth spiritually, morally,
and ethically will improve so dramatically that eventually the world will
enjoy a "millennium" of peace and prosperity before the second coming
of Jesus. The millennium will not be a literal thousand years, but an inde-
finite period of unprecendented international good will and unity. It will
come to an end at the second advent of Christ when the general resurrec-
tion of both righteous and wicked will take place. This view has been dis-
credited by the tumultuous events of the twentieth century.
    We need to restudy the subject in Revelation 20, so that we are doubly
sure of where we stand.

      1. What happens to the living wicked at the second coming of Jesus?
         Rev. 19:20, 21; compare 2 Thess. 1:7, 8; 2:8.


         There is no record in Scripture of a general resurrection of the wicked
      at the second coming of Jesus. There will be a very limited special resur-
      rection of some wicked and some righteous a little before the second
      coming of Jesus. (See Dan. 12:2; Rev. 1:7; Mark 14:62; The Great
      Controversy, p. 637; Early Writings, p. 285.) Because the living wicked
      will be destroyed at His coming, we must conclude that throughout the
      millennium there will be no wicked inhabitants on this earth. (See also
      Rev. 6:14-17.)
      2. Who are raised from the dead at the second coming of Jesus?
         1 Thess. 4:16-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54.


         "The dead in Christ" (1 Thess. 4:16) include the righteous who have
      died from the time of Abel to the end of time. "For as in Adam all die,
      even so in Christ shall all be made alive. . . . They that are Christ's [are
      raised] at his coming" (1 Cor. 15:22, 23). That "all" includes the Old
      Testament saints, as well as the New Testament ones.

      3. Where are the resurrected righteous and the living righteous taken
         at the second coming of Jesus? John 14:1-3; Rev. 7:9-17.


         Jesus identified the home of the saved after His return as "my Father's
      house" to which He was going "to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2).
      He said that He was coming back to take us to the place to which He was
      about to ascend.
         John saw the redeemed immediately after their redemption was
      complete standing "before the throne of God," and serving "him day and
      night in his temple" (Rev. 7:15). The throne of God within His temple is
      in heaven. (See Rev. 4:1, 2; 11:19; 15:5). Not until the end of the millen-
      nium is God's throne established on earth. That fact will be established
      later in this lesson.
MON   4. Because the wicked are dead, and the righteous are in heaven, how
         many human beings are on this earth during the millennium?
         What is the state of the earth at that time? Rev. 16:18, 20; 2 Peter
         3:10; Jer. 4:23-27.



         The great, final, unprecendented earthquake undoubtedly will leave the
      world in a state of chaos and destruction. Jeremiah was predicting the com-
      ing of the Babylonians to destroy apostate Israel and their land. But his vi-
                                                                                97
    sion obviously applies to the end of time, when the events of his day were
    to be repeated on a cosmic scale.
       Throughout the writings of the Old Testament prophets there are many
    passages that speak of destruction because of sin on the day of the Lord,
    followed by a period of desolation, followed by a time of restoration. Al-
    though there is no passage in the Bible apart from Revelation 20 that
    speaks of a period of 1,000 years during which the earth will lie desolate,
    there are many passages that describe the desolation of the earth. Notice a
    few such passages:


      Day of the Lord         Desolation of Earth            Restoration

         Isa. 64:1-3           Isa. 64:10-12            Isa. 65:9, 10, 17-25
         Isa. 66:14-16         Isa. 66:24               Isa. 66:22, 23
         Eze. 33:21, 27        Eze. 33:28, 29           Eze. 34:11-16, 22-24
         Zeph. 1:2-18          Zeph. 2:4-7, 9, 11,      Zeph. 2:9; 3:9-20
                                13-15; 3:6, 8

       The above passages have a historical application that was a type of the
    situation that will exist at the end of time. Not every feature of the primary
    setting applies to the secondary situation. But the similarities are consider-
    able. Local, historical days of the Lord pointed to the end-time day of the
    Lord.
    5. What will happen to Satan at the second coming of Jesus? Rev.
       20:1-3.


       Note that it is the angel of God who has the key. Thus there is no way
    that Satan can avoid being cast into the bottomless pit and being confined
    there.
    6. What do you understand to be the meaning of the "bottomless
M      pit," or abyss, in which Satan will be confined? Rev. 20:1, 3.



        Desolate Prison. As we have seen, the earth will be completely deso-
    late, with no human inhabitants. When the Hebrew word referring to the
    earth as "the deep" used in Genesis 1:2, was translated into Greek (the
    Septuagint), the word, abussos ("abyss," "deep," "depth"), was used.
    The same word was used in Revelation 20:1. The earth will be reduced to
    its former state of desolation.
        In the book of Revelation, the devil is identified as the king of the
    "abyss" or "bottomless pit" (Rev. 9:1, 2, 11; 11:7; 17:8). The devil and
    his demons dwell in the "abyss." It is the place from which Satanic decep-
    tions emerge. Because this earth is the domain of the devil's operations, we
    conclude that the earth is the "abyss" to which he will be confined during
    98
 crlizTeanjtae aga 'twat'Iv                              September
the millennium. The devil and his demons will be "bound" in the sense
that they have no one to tempt for 1,000 years.

   The fruitage of his work. "The earth looked like a desolate wilder-
ness. Cities and villages, shaken down by the earthquake, lay in heaps. . . .
Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years.
Here he will be confined, to wander up and down over the broken surface
of the earth and see the effects of his rebellion against God's law."—The
Story of Redemption, p. 415.
7. What Old Testament parallel pictures the millennial binding of
   Satan? Lev. 16:7-10, 20-22.


   Remission for sin and the removal from the sanctuary of the records of
sin was accomplished in the daily and yearly sanctuary services by virture
of the shedding of blood. Responsibility for sin was placed on the head of
the scapegoat, representing Satan. He was banished to the wilderness.

   For Crimes Against God and Humanity. "Now the event takes place
foreshadowed in the last solemn service of the Day of Atonement. When
the ministration in the holy of holies had been completed, and the sins of
Israel had been removed from the sanctuary by virtue of the blood of the
sin offering, then the scapegoat was presented alive before the Lord; and in
the presence of the congregation the high priest confessed over him 'all the
iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.' In like manner, when the
work of atonement in the heavenly sanctuary has been completed, then in
the presence of God and heavenly angels and the host of the redeemed the
sins of God's people will be placed upon Satan; he will be declared guilty
of all the evil which he has caused them to commit. And as the scapegoat
was sent away into a land not inhabited, so Satan will be banished to the
desolate earth, an uninhabited and dreary wildemess."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 658, (italics supplied).

11. DURING THE MILLENNIUM (Rev. 20:4-6).
8. What exciting scene of heaven during the millennium was John
   shown? Who is involved, what are they doing, and why? Rev. 20:4.


   The second phase of judgment. From 1844 to the close of probation,
the judgment in heaven involves an investigation of the records of people
who have professed Christ at any time in history. All who are found to be
genuine in their profession are taken to heaven at the Second Coming.
During the millennium the second phase of judgment will investigate the
records of those who rejected Christ. This is the judgment of the wicked
dead. Verse 4 tells us that those who become judges are with Christ for one
thousand years.
                                                                            99
    Who are the people who judge? Two specific groups are mentioned in
Revelation 20:4. First, there are martyrs of all ages. Second, there are those
who accepted the third angel's message, and who refused the last-day
image to the beast and the mark of the beast (Revelation 13). Both groups
have valiantly demonstrated their total loyalty to God, in face of terrible
trials and at times of threatened death. Revelation 20:6 indicates that the
redeemed of all ages "shall reign" with Christ during the millennium.

   Whom do they judge? Paul says that the saints "shall judge the
world" and "angels." (See 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; compare Jude 6.) The work of
the saved during the millennium is to judge the wicked of all ages, includ-
ing the wicked angels.
   "In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with
the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds
done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer is meted
out, according to their works; and it is recorded against their names in the
book of death. Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and his
people."—The Great Controversy, p. 661.
   What is the deeper purpose of this second phase of judgment? At
the beginning of the great controversy, Satan accused God of being unfair.
Throughout the years of the great controversy on earth, many times
mankind has voiced the devil's accusations. This second phase of judg-
ment is of vital importance to the saints. As each case is examined, it will
become crystal clear, that God has given each one every opportunity to be
saved. It will be seen that they have rejected His invitations, and that He is
entirely just in leaving them out of the eternal kingdom. In the eternal ages
beyond, no one will have any doubt about the mercy and justice of God.
No one will ever wish to rebel against Him; the records of the great con-
troversy will have proved ultimately that He is a God of infinite love.
9. How do you understand the timing of the first and second resur-
   rections? Rev. 20:5, 6; compare John 5:28, 29.


   The first part of Revelation 20:5 should be regarded as in parenthesis.
The last part of verse 5, and all of verse 6, belong with verse 4. The resur-
rection of life, which Jesus predicted in John 5:29, is the resurrection of the
"blessed and holy" at the beginning of the thousand years. The resurrec-
tion of damnation is the resurrection of the "rest of the dead" at the close
of the thousand years.
HI. THE MILLENNIUM CLOSES (Rev. 20:7-15).

10. What event enables Satan to be "loosed" from the bottomless pit
    at the close of the one thousand years? Rev. 20:3, 5, 7.



   For a thousand years Satan will have no one to tempt, or deceive. With
100
 &IN aiCl Vim Da; VW Etim                               September
the resurrection of the wicked (verse 5), which is the second resurrection
of both Revelation 20 and John 5, Satan is "back in business." His "little
season" will surely be limited: "Those who have done evil will rise to be
condemned" (John 5:29, NIV).

   The second resurrection. "Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus
called forth the wicked dead; and they came up with the same feeble,
sickly bodies that went into the grave. What a spectacle! what a scene! At
the first resurrection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second
the marks of the curse, are visible on all. The kings and noblemen of the
earth, the mean and low, the learned and unlearned, come forth together.
All behold the Son of man."-- 2Early Writings, p. 292.

11. What does Satan do with his wicked forces? Rev. 20:8, 9 (first
    part).


   What Satan does at the close of the millennium when he seeks to take
the holy city and wrest it from God is no different from what he has done
previously. His history is one of warring against and accusing God, attack-
ing Christ, and deceiving people into worshiping himself and the evil
powers through whom he has worked.
12. What final judgment scene takes place just before the destruction
    of the wicked? Rev. 20:11-13; compare Zech. 14:9.


   The Reward of the Just. "Jesus and all the angelic host and all the
saints, with the glittering crowns upon their heads, ascend to the top of the
wall of the city. Jesus speaks with majesty, saying, 'Behold, ye sinners, the
reward of the just! And behold, My redeemed, the reward of the
wicked!' "—Early Writings, pp. 293, 294.
   The King is Crowned: "In the presence of the assembled inhabitants
of earth and heaven the final coronation of the Son of God takes place."—
The Great Controversy, p. 666.
13. What amazing event will then take place? Rom. 14:11; Phil. 2:9-11.


   Every Knee Shall Bow: "As if entranced, the wicked have looked
upon the coronation of the Son of God. . . . Falling prostrate, they worship
the Prince of life. . . . And now Satan bows down and confesses the justice
of his sentence."—The Great Controversy, pp. 668-670.

14. Why is there no resurrection from the "second death?" Rev.
    20:9, 10, 14, 15.

                                                                         101
        The assurance given to Christians in all ages is that Satan's defeat is in-
     evitable. Calvary spelled his doom. By casting in our lot with Christ we are
     assured of deliverance and eternal life. (See Rev. 12:10; Heb. 2:14; John
     12:31.)
     HOW DO THESE FUTURE SCENES INFLUENCE MY LIFE
     TODAY? As I consider Christ's sacrifice and the events of the future, my
     life is influenced in the following ways:




Wu FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Schedule time this week to
    read the last three chapters of The Great Controversy: "God's People
    Delivered," ages 635-652; "Desolation of the Earth," pages 653-661; and
    "The Controversy Ended," pages 662-678.

     SUMMARY: Revelation 20 describes the judgment of the wicked during
     the millennium by the righteous, who are in heaven. Satan and his demons
     are bound to the desolate earth. At the end of the millennium sin and sin-
     ners are eliminated from the universe.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 21:1-22:21.

sari MEMORY TEXT: "And I heard a great voice out of heaven
PM saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
     dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself
     shall be with them, and be their God" (Revelation 21:3).
YOUR FUTURE LIFE OF JOY. The book of Revelation, and the Bible,
conclude in the way that we would expect—with sin gone from the uni-
verse and the earth restored to its edenic beauty. The difficulties of this
life, however severe, are minor compared with the total joy and fulfillment
of the afterlife. "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us"
(Rom. 8:18).

                 OVERVIEW: Revelation 21:1-22:21

       21:1-4                    21:5-8                 21:9-22:5

 A new heaven and          Jesus completes          The New Jerusalem
    a new earth          His work of salvation          described

              EPILOGUE: Jesus is Coming (Rev. 22:7-21)


EYE HAS NOT SEEN. An elderly Christian had been confined to a
wheel chair for forty-three years. His Seventh-day Adventist Christianity
had a powerful influence on those around him, and especially on his grand-
son. The old man never complained, he loved to read his Bible, study his
Sabbath School lesson daily, and sing. His favorite song was "Revive Us
Again." His favorite chapter was Isaiah 35, a great chapter on the new
earth. His favorite verses were 6 and 10: "Then shall the lame man leap as
an hart," "And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion
with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away." This man's hope and
trust in Christ were constantly renewed by daily study of his Sabbath
School lesson.
   Writing of the end of the world, Isaiah exclaimed: "For since the begin-
ning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither
hath the eye seen, 0 God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that
                                                                        103
waiteth for him" (Isa. 64:4). Has the world blurred the vision of the new
earth for some of us? Have we been blinded to a degree by the things of
this life—our work, our friendships, our cares, our busyness, our televi-
sion, and other things? Have the studies of this quarter revealed to you the
climactic events of the near future, and the blessed things so soon to come?
If so, you will study this lesson with great anticipation. It will bring you re-
newed hope.
    "A fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has led
many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look upon it as
our home."—The Great Controversy, pp. 674, 675. Pause a moment to
pray that the Holy Spirit will open your eyes to see all that God has for you
this week.
I. JOHN SEES A NEW HEAVEN AND A NEW EARTH (Rev.
   21:1-4).

1. As John's closing vision of the book opens, what are we to under-
   stand by the words new and first? Rev. 21:1.


   "The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of
the curse is swept away."—The Great Controversy, p. 674. We under-
stand that the Word that spoke all things into existence in the past (John
1:3), speaks again to make all things new. There is a purification and re-
creation.
   In Revelation 21:2, the Holy City is also called "new." Old Jerusalem
and its Temple fell into such a state that Jesus called the Temple, a "den
of thieves" (Matt. 21:13). Both fell to the Romans in A.D. 70 (Luke 19:43,
44). The New Jerusalem has now been prepared, the pure bride of the holy
Christ. Revelation 21:2, 10, pictures the Holy City coming down to this
earth.
2. Where will God be when the Holy City descends? For how long
   will He be there? Rev. 21:3.



   Adam and Eve walked with their Creator in the garden. Abraham met
with the Lord under the oak tree (Gen. 18:1, 2). Moses was in God's pres-
ence on Mt. Sinai (Exodus 20). Multitudes walked with Jesus during the
thirty-three years He was on earth. But in the new earth the redeemed host
communicate with the Creator face to face. The terms "with men" or
"with them" are repeated three times (Rev. 21:3). God's throne will be on
His new earth (Rev. 22:3, 4).

   We Shall See God. "The people of God are privileged to hold open
communion with the Father and the Son. 'Now we see through a glass,
darkly.' We behold the image of God reflected, as in a mirror, in the works
of nature and in His dealings with men; but then we shall see Him face to
face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His presence and
104
    behold the glory of His countenance."—The Great Controversy, pp. 676,
    677.
    3. What are the things that God says His redeemed will no longer ex-
       perience in the new earth? Rev. 21:4.


       God will take the sorrow, and pain, and sadness away for His saved
    people. With perfect bodies and minds, possessing immortality, and living
    in a world in which no source of hurt or destruction exists, the redeemed
    will have fulfillment unlimited.

    4. What are some of the sins that bar people from entering the Holy
       City and having a part in the new earth? Rev. 21:8, 27; 22:15.



       Only God's way will do. Rationalization leads to the downfall of many
    people. In terms of inheriting the new earth, God is specific as to who will
    and who will not enter. How many of the Ten Commandment principles do
    you find in the above verses? Study 1 John 2:1-6 in this respect. Basic to
    the hope of being in the new earth is the simple statement of John 3:16,
    "whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
    Eternal life is the reward of those who are saved by grace, through faith
    (Eph. 2:8), and who, by His indwelling power, walk in His steps (1 Peter
    2:21). We should take God seriously in that we can inherit His kingdom
    only in His way. Anything less is deception and will bring eternal disap-
    pointment.
    11. JESUS COMPLETES HIS WORK OF SALVATION (Rev.
a        21:5-8).
    5. People often say that the promises of Revelation 21 and 22 are
       "too good to be true." How does God set the record straight? Rev.
       21:5; 22:6.



        Christ's assurance is plain. He makes it clear that His words are true,
    that we can count on what He is promising. His word has never failed, and
    it never will. All of us undoubtedly have thought of the "impossibility" of
    everything that now is, coming to an end. Millions do not believe that God
    started things here, and they do not believe that there will be an "utter
    end" (Nahum 1:8). Eve doubted God's unfailing words. We must not.
    6. How does the Lord express His close relationship with the
       redeemed? Rev. 21:6, 7.



                                                                            105
   In the teaching of justification by faith is the idea of adoption, of be-
coming sons and daughters of God. In the Lord's prayer, Jesus instructed
us to call His Father, our Father. (See Matt. 6:9.)

7. What can you learn from the following passages about God's
   adopting men and women, youth, boys, and girls, into His family?
   John 1:12

   Gal. 4:5
   As the result of sin, we are separated from God, parentless by nature.
But as the result of receiving Christ as our personal Saviour, we are
justified, treated as righteous because Christ's righteousness is given to us
by the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:9, 10). We are adopted as sons and daughters by
God. In Revelation 21:7 we are assured that if we meet His conditions we
will be His sons and daughters forever. The condition is that we retain our
genuine faith in Him, until He comes to give us immortality. (See Matt.
24:13; John 15:9; Gal. 6:9; Heb. 12:1.)
I11. THE NEW JERUSALEM DESCRIBED (Rev. 21:9-22:5).
    One of the seven angels who had the seven last plagues now comes to
John to show him God's glorious Holy City (Rev. 21:9). That angel is in
an ideal position to see the end of sin and the beginning of God's eternity.

8. John was placed (in vision) on a high vantage point, so that he
   could see the Holy City well. Review John's inspired description of
   the city. Rev. 21:10-21. What impresses you most?


   Brightness Beyond Imagination. "Eye hath not seen" (1 Cor. 2:9).
After Ellen White saw heaven and the city in vision, and the angel bore her
"down to this dark world," she remarked, "Sometimes I think I can stay
here no longer, all things of earth look so dreary. I feel very lonely here,
for I have seen a better land."—Early Writings, p. 20. If only this last les-
son of the quarter could give us such a vision, so that the things of earth
would not be so attractive to us! Why do we tend to cling to earthly things,
when God is waiting to give us what He showed to His servant?

   Review what Revelation 21:10-21 tells us:
   o The city is brilliant, lighted by the glory of God.
   o The names of the twelve tribes of Israel are on the twelve gates in the
massive wall. Ancient cities were protected by high walls. Thus John
would understand the description.
   o There were three gates on each side of Ezekiel's Temple, on which
were the names of the tribes of Israel (Ezekiel 48:31-34). The twelve tribes
were listed in Revelation 7:4-8. The three gates on each side of the Holy
City also contain the names of the tribes (Rev. 21:13). These facts suggest
that both literal and spiritual Israel are reckoned as "tribes" in the Bible.
106
   • The heavenly angels are the gatekeepers.
   • The names of the twelve apostles on the twelve foundations represent
the fact that the New Testament church was built on the foundation of
Christ and His apostles. (See Eph. 2:20.)
   • God's people of all ages are among the inhabitants of the new earth.
   • What about the size of the city? Revelation 21:15-17 does not say
whether the approximate 1,378.4 miles (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
7, p. 892) are the measure of one side, or the total miles around the four
sides. The important fact is that there is room enough there for everyone.
   • The magnificence of the city is represented by gold and precious
stones (verses 18-21).
9. What will not be included in the Holy City? Rev. 21:22?


   "When sin has been removed, the church will again be able to dwell in
His presence, and no structure [as the Old Testament sanctuary and
Temple] will be required to symbolize the dwelling of God."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 893. "The people of God are privileged to hold
open communion with the Father and the Son."—The Great Controversy,
p. 676.
10. What is meant by the "nations" and the "kings" spoken of by
    John? How does Isaiah clarify the type of people who will walk
    there? Rev. 21:24-26; Isa. 35:8-10.


   The "redeemed" will be from all nations, and kindreds, and people,
and tongues. (See Isa. 60:3, 5; Rev. 1:6; 7:9.) All others will have been de-
stroyed in the lake of fire. The figure of "kings" is drawn from the Old
Testament. (See Isa. 60:11.)
11. What added information about the New Jerusalem is given? Rev.
    22:1, 2, 5.



   Eden restored. All that Adam and Eve lost when they sinned (Genesis
3) is to be restored in the new earth. Note these parallels:
   o Adam and Eve lost the privilege of face-to-face communion with
God. In the new earth, "they shall see his face" (Rev. 22:4).
   o Adam and Eve lost their purity, their robe of innocence. The re-
deemed receive Christ's robe of righteousness, His fine linen (Rev. 19:8).
   o Adam and Eve lost their Eden home. God's saints are restored to
their new Eden. "Adam had themes for contemplation in the works of God
in Eden, which was heaven in miniature."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol.1, p. 1082.
    o Adam and Eve could no longer eat of the tree of life. All the saved
forever eat of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2).
                                                                         107
    • Adam and Eve lost their perfect family happiness. In the new earth
the original purposes of God will be carried out.
    • Adam and Eve lost their dominion over other created things. In the
new earth, the lions, lambs, leopards, and calves are tame, "and a little
child shall lead them" (Isa. 11:6).
    • Stress, fear, confusion, tension—all that came with sin—are gone. In
their place is the peace that passes understanding. (See Phil. 4:7; Isa. 26:3,
4.)
   How can we cherish the things of this earth when our eternal heri-
tage is so rich?
IV. EPILOGUE: JESUS IS COMING (Rev. 22:7-21).
    The message of the entire book of Revelation revolves around a con-
cern for daily readiness to meet the Lord at the end of time. In Revelation
1:1, 3, the idea of immediacy is introduced. There John was shown things
that "must shortly come to pass," which were urgent, "for the time is at
hand." Let us note several final points of emphasis.

12. What is the chief point of emphasis regarding the second coming
    of Jesus? Rev. 22:7, 10, 12, 20?


13. Innocently, what did John do when he had heard from the angel
    these marvelous truths concerning the new earth? What are the
    last two words of kindly admonition that the angel gave him?
    Rev. 22:8, 9.


   Review the warnings concerning false worship in Revelation 13:8 and
the appeal of the first angel in Revelation 14:7. The final contest focuses
on the simple but crucial question, Whom will we worship?

14. Why do we need all of the light that the book of Revelation
    gives? Rev. 22:10.


   Parts of the book of Daniel were "sealed" until the time of the end
(Dan. 12:4). However, the book of Revelation is an unsealed book, an open
book, to be proclaimed to the ends of the earth. After 1798 the sealed sec-
tions of Daniel were unsealed and have been proclaimed along with the
book of Revelation. These two books reveal that the time for Christ's re-
turn is "at hand."

   An Open Book. "The book of Revelation must be opened to the
people. Many have been taught that it is a sealed book; but it is sealed only
to those who reject light and truth. The truth it contains must be pro-
108
      @Xi GUlualll MEW lab VailiArCaa                       September
    claimed, that people may have an opportunity to prepare for the events
    which are so soon to transpire. The third angel's message must be pre-
    sented as the only hope for the salvation of a perishing world."—Evan-
    gelisrn, pp. 195, 196.

    15. How did the angel describe to John the finality of the close of
        man's probation?.What does the word still mean? Rev. 22:11.



       The sense of the verse is that those doing unrighteousness will continue
    to do unrighteousness, and those who do right will continue forever to do
    right. After the close of probation no one will ever change his or her course
    of action. "The One who has stood as our intercessor . . . is soon to cease
    His work in the heavenly sanctuary."—Efien G. White Comments, SDA
    Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 989. "There is not a second probation for'
    anyone."—Ellen G. White Comments SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
    989.

El 16. When Jesus comes, what does He bring with Him? And what is
        the basis upon which eternal life is given? Rev. 22:12, 14.



        Some have wondered about the differing translations of verse 14:
     "Blessed are they that do his commandments" (KJV). " 'Blessed are
     those who wash their robes' " (NIV). Which is right? The Greek manu-
     scripts are quite evenly divided on the two readings, and it would be easy
     for a scribe to make a mistake in copying words that differ very little from
     each other. Both ideas are taught in Scripture.

        The "remnant" people are characterized by commandment keep-
     ing (Rev. 12:17). God's "saints" are those who keep the commandments.
     (See Rev. 14:12.) Jesus Himself left no doubts about the significance of the
     commandments. (See John 14:15; 15:10). The commandments reveal the
     character of God, and the saved will have His character reproduced in their
     lives. (See Christ's Object Lessons, p. 69.)
        The redeemed are pictured in "white robes" (Rev. 7:9), and as having
     "washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb"
     (verse 14). God gives His final and just rewards to those who have ac-
     cepted Him, have been forgiven, and who have been motivated and em-
     powered by His indwelling love and enabling grace. They keep His ten
     commandments, the transcript of His character.

     17. What is the final call of the Spirit and the bride? Rev. 22:17.



        Compare Christ's daily call (Rev. 3:20), His call to the thirsty (John
     4:14, 15), and His call to the hungry (John 6:32-35). Here in Revelation
     22, Scripture's last call is made. It is Christ's call to humanity.
                                                                             109
18. Christ has promised many times to return. What benediction
    does He give to those who accept His call and live in readiness?
    Rev. 22:20, 21.


    What a challenging conclusion to the Bible! An invitation to eternity is
extended to "whosoever will" accept His forgiveness and power. "Yet to
all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right
to become children of God" (John 1:12, NIV).
HEART-SEARCHING QUESTIONS:
  • Has my personal experience with the Lord deepened as the result of
    my restudy of the book of Revelation?
  • Is the appeal to be a permanent resident of the new earth genuinely
    impressive to me?
  • Am I ready to join God's people around the world in making a new
    commitment to Christ and to the work of making Him known to
    others?
  • Am I willing to live today and every day in a state of preparedness
    to meet the Lord?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Take your favorite transla-
tion or paraphrase and read all twenty-two chapters of Revelation. Grasp
afresh each line of prophecy as it points toward the time of our Lord's
coming.
   Also, read Ellen White's first vision, given in December, 1844, in Early
Writings, pp. 13-20.

SUMMARY: Revelation 21 and 22 reach backwards in time urging us to
renew our vows to the Lord while there is yet time. These chapters clearly
reveal who will be saved and who will not. They are a plea that we awaken
out of our spiritual sleep. They picture eternity for everyone who is
enlighted by the Spirit.

   Lessons For Fourth Quarter, 1989
   Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult
Lessons for the fourth quarter of 1989 will be helped by the following out-
line in studying the first two lessons. The title of this series is "Visions of
Victory."

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Zechariah 1:1, 7, 18; 2:1; 5:1, 5, 9; 6:1.

MEMORY TEXT: Psalm 121:1, 2.
CENTRAL THOUGHT: The Hebrew name Zechariah means "God re-
members." Often in the hustle and bustle of life we foget that God remem-
bers us; we need to stop, turn, lift up our eyes, and see Him.
OUTLINE:
   I. Zechariah—God Remembers (Zech. 1:1, 7).
  11. Zechariah Lifted up His Eyes and Saw (Zech. 1:18; 2:1; 5:1; 6:1).
 I11. Understand, Apply, and Live (Zech. 4:4-6; 6:4, 5).

SECOND LESSON:

"RETURN TO ME"
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Zechariah 1:1-6, 12-17.
MEMORY TEXT: Isaiah 44:22.
CENTRAL THOUGHT: In His love God wants to reestablish His
covenant relationship with His people. He wants them to return to Him
with all their hearts so that He may live within them and dwell among
them.
OUTLINE:
  I. God's Return to His People (Zech. 1:1-3, 13-15).
 11. Israel's Return to God (Zech. 1:3-6, 17).
LESSONS IN BRAILLE:
