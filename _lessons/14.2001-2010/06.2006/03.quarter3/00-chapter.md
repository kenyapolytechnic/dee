     The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
     Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
     preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
     Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
     Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
     reflects the input of a worldwide evaluation committee and the approval of the
     Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
     sent the intent of the author(s).

                                                                                    1
THE
          Gospel,1844,
The 1844 judgment As Adventists, many of our “unique”
                    doctrines are not, really, unique. After all,
brings the Cross    other Christians (not many, admittedly)
into greater focus. keep the seventh-day Sabbath, as well.
                              Though a majority of the Christian
world believes in the immortality of the soul, other Christians
understand that the dead sleep in the grave until the resurrection,
either the first or second. Various “Adventist” teachings, i.e., eternal
destruction (as opposed to eternal torment) or the nature of the mil-
lennium, can be found elsewhere too. In fact, almost all our doc-
trines are scattered throughout Christendom.
   Except one: the 1844 pre-Advent judgment.
   For some, this fact is worrisome; Why don’t more Christians see it,
as well? For others, the uniqueness of the doctrine points even more
powerfully to the special calling of the Seventh-day Adventist
Church. It’s precisely because no one else teaches this judgment that
we have been raised to do so. From this doctrine, perhaps more than
any other, our distinct identity as Seventh-day Adventists arises.
   This quarter we will study the 1844 pre-Advent judgment. But
not in isolation. As the title suggests, we’re going to look at the judg-
ment in the context of the gospel, because judgment without the
gospel is like law without grace: It leads only to fear, condemnation,
and death. On the other hand, judgment with the gospel (like law
with grace) leads to faith, assurance, and hope.
   Perhaps the clearest link between the gospel and judgment is the
first angel’s message: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of
heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach. . . . Saying with a
loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judg-
ment is come” (Rev. 14:6, 7). As far as God is concerned, the “ever-
lasting gospel” includes judgment; how foolish for us to make it any
less inclusive.
   Our study this quarter will be divided into various parts. First,
we’ll let Scripture fill in the background for the judgment and the
whole plan of salvation.
2
and Judgment
  Next, in the bulk of the quarter, we’ll establish the biblical basis
for the 1844 judgment, seeing for ourselves just what a solid basis
we have for this teaching, rooted in the Cross. For those whose
knowledge of the doctrine began and ended with an evangelistic
series, this study will help firmly ground you in this key truth. For
those who have already studied it in depth, this quarter will rein-
force what you already know and, perhaps, help you understand it
even better.
  We’ll then look at some questions the teaching faces, using them
as a vehicle to better grasp the biblical basis for the pre-Advent judg-
ment.
  Most important, we’ll look at the judgment in the context of the
gospel, of Christ’s death in our behalf, with the understanding that
because of His death we can have assurance in the judgment.
“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit” (Rom.
8:1). No condemnation now, and especially in the judgment.
  Finally, we seek to answer such questions as: What does a judg-
ment whose beginning was dated in the nineteenth century mean
for us in the twenty-first? What does it tell us about ourselves, our
church, and, most important, about the God who promises to
return and take us home?
  In the end, a proper understanding of the 1844 judgment will
bring out Christ’s death for us in greater clarity and depth, especially
as we await the Second Coming. Perhaps that’s why we, as Seventh-
day Adventists, have been called to preach it, because it does bring
the Cross into greater focus, and as we near the consummation of
all things, how important that the Cross be understood with all pos-
sible clarity. Thus, more than wanting you to come away from these
lessons with a better understanding of charts, dates, and numbers,
we want you to come away with a greater understanding of Jesus, of
the Cross, and of His ministry in heaven for us. If so, then our work
together this quarter will have been—through the grace of God—
richly rewarded and more than worth the effort.
                                                                      3

      ies are being discovered every day, the latest estimates are at about 125
      billion . . . and counting. When one considers that each galaxy contains
      billions of stars and that these stars could have planets revolving around
      them, it’s not hard to understand why some people believe that life must
      exist elsewhere in the universe.
         Thus, using elaborate and sensitive radio telescopes, people are
      engaged in a search for extraterrestrial life. Given the size of the uni-
      verse and the number of stars scattered through it, surely we’re not
      alone.
         As Christians, though, we don’t need radio telescopes to learn about
      the existence of life beyond our earthly borders. Through the Bible (and
      the Spirit of Prophecy) we know not only that other beings exist but that
      they’re interested in what’s happening here, on earth. In fact, the entire
      universe is involved in the great controversy between Christ and Satan,
      a struggle with implications that go far beyond our little planet.
         This week we’ll go where the greatest telescopes can’t: into the heart
      of the great moral issues facing not only humanity but all of God’s cre-
      ation.

     “When the Morning Stars Sang”
        Scripture mentions inhabitants from other worlds; that is, the exis-
     tence of intelligent entities, not of earthly origin, is attested to all
     through the Bible. In the first chapter of Genesis, in which God
     Himself creates the world and in which He utters the famous words,
     “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness” (Gen. 1:26, NIV),
     we’re shown immediately not only the existence of something else
     other than us, we’re shown it predating us, prior to us. We are, rela-
     tively speaking, latecomers.
        And though, of course, we know that the Godhead had to precede
     us in order to create us, the Bible talks about other cosmic entities, as
     well.

Read the following texts (Job 1:6; 38:7, 8; Dan. 9:21; Acts 12:7;
     1 Cor. 4:9; Eph. 3:10; Heb. 13:2). What do they tell us about these
     nonhuman entities?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        As said yesterday, while scientists are busy trying to find out
     whether other life even exists elsewhere, the Bible shows not only that
     it does but that it’s involved with us here on earth, sometimes in a
     rather intimate way. Some of the above texts show these beings inter-
     acting with humans, rescuing them, giving them knowledge, etc.
     These texts reveal just a small sampling of the intense interaction
     between humans and these nonhuman beings from another part of the
     creation. That we can’t always see them means nothing, because we
     know that all sorts of things exist that we can’t see.
        The crucial points in all this are simple and yet, at the same time,
     deep. First, we are not alone in the universe; other intelligent beings
     exist. Second, these beings are not isolated from us; instead, some, at
     least, are involved with humans here.
        Thus, Scripture clearly paints a picture of reality not generally
     accepted by modern thinking: the existence of supernatural beings
     who are, indeed, closely tied with humanity.

      What are some of your favorite angel stories from the Bible? If
      you’ve had some personal encounters with angels, be prepared
      to share your story with the class. What kind of comfort does
      the reality of angels give you?


                                                                             7

     The Devil’s Wrath
       “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
     against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and
     prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
     And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
     devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out
     into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him” (Rev. 12:7-
     9; see also vss. 10-13).

       As we saw yesterday, the Bible is clear on the existence of extra-
     terrestrial life. As we know, though, not all of this life is friendly
     toward us. On the contrary.

Based on Revelation 12:7-13, answer the following questions:

     ●
     1 Where does the strife begin?




     ●
     2 Where does this battle wind up being fought?




     ●
     3 What are the three specific things the devil is depicted as doing
     against us?


     ●
     4 The devil is angry because he has “but a short time” (vs. 12).
     What does that mean? See Matt. 25:41.



     ●
     5 How do God’s people overcome the attacks of the enemy?




       These texts reveal the background and reality of the great contro-
     versy between Christ and Satan. Though begun in heaven, the battle is
     now unfolding here on earth. What’s more, these texts show that we
     are involved in this battle, in which the devil, unable to prevail against
     Michael and His angels in heaven (Rev. 12:8), is now waging war on
     us here.

      In what ways do you experience the reality of this great contro-
      versy every day? How does your understanding of the reality of
      this controversy help you cope with personal trials?

     “The Accuser of Our Brethren”
       Yesterday we looked at the foundations of the great controversy
     between Christ and Satan and how we, as human beings, are involved.
     We saw, too, that among the things that Satan does against us, he is
     also “the accuser of our brethren . . . which accused them before our
     God day and night” (Rev. 12:10).

Though the text doesn’t say just what it was Satan accused the
     brethren of doing, given what we know about the condition of
     humanity, what’s the logical answer? What texts can you find to
     back up your answer? See, for example, Rom. 3:10-19.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Whatever else is going on in the great controversy between Christ
     and Satan, we, as human beings, are in the middle of it. Satan, obvi-
     ously, in his attack on God is attacking us, as well. This idea is
     brought out in the book of Genesis, where the serpent, Satan (Rev.
     12:9), cast out of heaven to earth, brought about the fall of our earthly
     parents (Gen. 3:1-7), which, in turn, led to the fall of the whole
     human race, along with all its horrible consequences (Rom. 5:12). It’s
     clear, too, that Satan is now taking advantage of what happened to us,
     and among the things he does is to accuse us regarding our sins and
     fallen condition. After all, if we were perfect, what would Satan have
     to accuse us of? It’s because we’re flawed that he has so much to say
     against us.

Read Zechariah 3:1-4. The Hebrew verb translated in verse 1 as
     “resist” or “oppose” or “accuse” (in the context of what Satan is
     saying directly to Joshua) comes from the same root word for
     “Satan.” What is going on here, and how does this fit in with what
     we understand about the great controversy?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      Though we can see here in Zechariah the work of Satan against
      us, we also see the work of God for us. What hope and promise
      can you find from these verses that God is working in our
      behalf, even though we are sinners?



                                                                            9

      “The Lord Rebuke Thee, O Satan”
        As we saw yesterday, though Satan accused Joshua, who had been
      dressed in filthy garments, it was Satan—not Joshua—who had been
      rebuked. How could that be? It’s only because of the plan of salvation,
      in which Christ defeats Satan and his accusations. The language of
      Zechariah itself, with filthy garments and change of garments, is
      gospel language; that is, it’s pointing to the plan of salvation and what
      Christ does for His fallen people.

Read the following texts (Isa. 61:10; Matt. 22:11, 12; Rev. 3:18). How
      do they help us understand the gospel imagery in Zechariah 3?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Though fallen from heaven, Satan had brought the great contro-
      versy to the earth. Through the fall of Adam and Eve, Satan brought
      all humanity into the fray; through the plan of salvation, not only does
      the Lord save us from the final consequences of that fall; He also
      defeats Satan in the whole great controversy.

Read Hebrews 2:14. How does it help us understand the inseparable
      link between what Christ did here on earth and the ultimate
      defeat of Satan?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Though this text doesn’t specify why, the death of Jesus is the
      means through which, ultimately, Satan (and thus his rebellion) will
      be defeated. There are bigger issues in the plan of salvation than just
      saving us from sin. We need to remember—sin didn’t begin here; it
      began somewhere else in the universe (Isa. 14:12, Ezek. 28:15, Rev.
      12:7). Though we are in the midst of the great controversy, the issues
      in it go beyond us. They are, literally, universal.

       What are some local issues in your community that are small
       parts of much grander themes? How do these relationships
       (that is, local issues contrasted against the grander themes
       behind them) help you understand how the issues in the great
       controversy could go beyond our personal salvation?

      The “Justification” of God
        “God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith
      in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his
      forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpun-
      ished—he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so
      as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in
      Jesus” (Rom. 3:25, 26, NIV).

         If you read carefully the above verses, they reveal the idea that what-
      ever else Christ accomplished at the Cross, it was also a demonstration
      of God’s justice. “He did this to demonstrate his justice,” the text says.
         This leads to a fancy theological term important for Adventists to
      understand. The term is theodicy, and it means, basically, “the justifi-
      cation of God.” It’s not justification in the sense that humans are justi-
      fied (pardoned from sin) but justification in the sense of vindication.
      Theodicy is the vindication of God’s goodness and justice, despite the
      existence of evil. Here is the foundation of the great controversy: God’s
      goodness and His justice will be revealed not just before human beings
      but before all the onlooking universe.

Besides the texts for today, how do these additional texts bring out
      the idea of theodicy? Ps. 51:1-4; Rom. 3:4; Eph. 3:10; Rev. 19:1, 2.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The whole idea of the great controversy and the ultimate vindica-
      tion of God and His ways forms a wonderful background to the plan
      of salvation. Though it doesn’t answer everything, it helps form a
      template in which many issues, such as (1) Why did Jesus have to die?
      (2) Why are we still here so long after the Cross? (3) Why does evil
      still exist? can be answered. The concept of theodicy, too, as we’ll see
      later, helps us understand the background for the pre-Advent judg-
      ment; that is, it helps us understand why God even has the judgment.
         In short, we are not alone in the universe; other beings exist, and it’s
      before these other “principalities and powers in heavenly places”
      (Eph. 3:10) that issues in the great controversy will be resolved in a
      way so that, as the psalmist said of God: “You are proved right when
      you speak and justified when you judge” (Ps. 51:4, NIV).




                                                                              11

Further Study: “The Great Controversy” in Handbook of Seventh-
     day Adventist Theology (SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 12),
     pp. 980–1009; Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 498, 499;
     The Desire of Ages, pp. 22, 116; Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 68, 69.

       “But the plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose
     than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came to
     the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world
     might regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to vin-
     dicate the character of God before the universe. To this result of His
     great sacrifice—its influence upon the intelligences of other worlds,
     as well as upon man—the Saviour looked forward when just before
     His crucifixion He said: ‘Now is the judgment of this world: now
     shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from
     the earth, will draw all unto Me.’ John 12:31, 32. The act of Christ in
     dying for the salvation of man would not only make heaven acces-
     sible to men, but before all the universe it would justify God and His
     Son in their dealing with the rebellion of Satan. It would establish the
     perpetuity of the law of God and would reveal the nature and the
     results of sin.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 68, 69.

Discussion Questions:

      1 Talk about the ministry of angels in your own experience.


      ●
      2 For many people, the idea of a literal battle between unseen
      forces going on around us is a bit hard to believe. What other
      examples, though, are there of unseen realities around us (e.g.,
      germs, radio waves)? How could you use some of these to help
      someone who is skeptical about the reality of the great contro-
      versy?

      ●
      3 As a class, talk about the idea of theodicy, using also the Ellen
      White quote above. Why is the idea so important? How does it
      help us answer questions such as, Why are we still here so long
      after the Cross?

      ●
      4 Does anyone in the class know someone who’s taking a bad
      beating in the great controversy right now? If so, what can you
      do as a group to bring that person some comfort and hope?

Labor of Love
Valerie Fidelia
   Jane lives in northern Uganda. Like many others, she fled her home in
southern Sudan during heavy fighting. It is still too dangerous for her to
return. Jane is a displaced person, but she does not live in a tent and
receive food from charities. She lives in a thatched-roof mud hut that she
helped build. Every morning she rises before dawn and walks four kilo-
meters to her garden, where she tends her cassava and peanut crops, which
will feed her family. Then she returns home, showers, and walks another
six kilometers to teach sewing to displaced persons in another village.
   Because there is no electricity, Jane uses two treadle sewing machines
to teach her students. They learn the principles of cutting and sewing using
brown paper rather than cloth. Once they are proficient using their paper
garments, Jane gives them cotton cloth to cut and sew.
   Jane could get a job teaching sewing in a city, but she prefers to help
others who can’t afford to pay. Her sewing-school ministry will improve
the lives of many who have no other source of income. Jane also dreams
of teaching women to read and write in their own language and in English,
but she has no resources to start a literacy project.
   Sewing and teaching are not Jane’s only ministries. Several evenings a
week she directs the church choir and works with the youth. Often she
arrives home after dark to prepare food and wash and iron her clothes.
   When Jane dreams of the future, she does not dream of an easier life.
She dreams of using her skills and knowledge to help others. Jane receives
no income from the sewing students. Her work is her ministry for God,
                                 teaching and leading them to the feet of
                                 Jesus. With willing hands such as Jane’s,
                                 the work of God is moving forward rap-
                                 idly in southern Sudan and northern
                                 Uganda. Our mission offerings provide
                                 resources to lay men and women such as
                                 Jane to share God’s love with others.

         LESSON             2       *July 1-7



      Judgment Must Begin




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Eccles. 12:14; Dan. 12:1,
      2; Matt. 8:12; 22:1-13; 25:31-33, 46; John 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:10.

Memory Text: “In the day when God shall judge the secrets of
      men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel” (Romans 2:16).

               raffiti written on a wall by an Italian atheist reads: “There is

      G        no God—and Mary is His mother!” However funny, the point
               is important: As human beings, we are subjective creatures.
      However much we might try to be objective—to look at things hon-
      estly, fairly, logically, without preconceived notions—we inevitably
      bring our own ideas, culture, moods, and experiences into whatever
      subject we approach. Even the idea of not having a preconceived
      notion about something is, indeed, to have a preconceived notion
      about something.
         This week, while realizing our inherent limitations, we’re going to
      be as objective as we can as we look at what the Bible says about
      judgment. Let’s forget for the moment about 1844, the pre-Advent
      judgment, Ellen White, Hiram Edson in the cornfield, etc. Instead,
      let’s just let the Bible speak for itself on this important topic. And, as
      it does, let’s see what answers it gives to the following questions: How
      are judgment and the gospel linked? What are the final results of
      judgment? Are Christians judged? What role do works play in judg-
      ment? When is the judgment?
         Though none of these answers contains all that we need to know on
      the subject, woven together they form a nice tapestry that will enable
      us to grasp better the concept of judgment, regardless of whatever
      preconceptions we already have about it.

      Hour of His Judgment
         As Adventist Christians, we say that the gospel of Jesus Christ is
      “good news.” In fact, the Greek word translated “gospel” means just
      that, “good news.”
         But if it’s good news, it’s good news about what? It’s the good news
      that Jesus died as our Substitute (1 Pet. 2:24); that at the Cross He
      paid the penalty for our sins (Isa. 53:6); that through faith in Him we
      stand perfect in God now because we are covered with perfect right-
      eousness (Rom. 3:22); and that because of what He has done for us,
      we have the promise of eternal life (1 John 5:11, 12).
         So, the good news is that we have eternal life, as opposed to—what?

Read the following texts. What’s the option for those who, in the end,
      don’t have eternal life? Dan. 12:2, Matt. 8:12, 25:46, John 3:18,
      2 Thess. 1:9, Rev. 14:11.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Look at some of the images and phrases from these texts: “ever-
      lasting punishment,” “smoke of their torment,” “condemned,” “ever-
      lasting destruction,” “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” If this isn’t
      talking about judgment, what is?
         Thus, the good news of the gospel is that we are spared condem-
      nation in judgment. In other words, inherent in the gospel itself is the
      promise that those who have accepted Jesus aren’t condemned as are
      those who have rejected Him. There is, then, no such thing as the
      gospel without judgment because “the good news” of the gospel is
      that we are spared condemnation. In short, the gospel without judg-
      ment is like a circle without roundness: By its very definition, the
      gospel includes judgment.

       Read Romans 2:16 and Revelation 14:6-8. How do these verses
       show the link between the gospel and judgment? How does
       what we’ve read today help you to understand even better what
       we have to thank the Lord for because of the sacrifice of Jesus?

     Life or Damnation?
Look up the texts below. Who are the two ultimate classes of people
     depicted here?

     Dan. 12:2
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Matt. 12:37
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 3:16
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 5:29
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Whatever else judgment involves, it results in only two classes of
     people: those who are saved eternally and those who are lost eternally.
     These texts don’t show any kind of happy medium or middle ground.
     In the end, the ultimate fate of all of us is either eternal life or eternal
     destruction.
       Thus, it’s clear from even these texts that some sort of judgment
     divides the righteous from the wicked. A final separation occurs, a
     judgment in which the final fate of everyone is, forever, decided.

Read the following text: “When the Son of man shall come in his
     glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the
     throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations:
     and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
     divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his
     right hand, but the goats on the left” (Matt. 25:31-33). What more
     do they teach us about the nature of judgment?

        A number of fascinating points are brought out here. First of all,
     who is being judged? It says that “all nations” shall be gathered before
     Him. Thus, this seems to be some sort of universal judgment; all
     nations come under scrutiny, which means that everyone does because,
     after all, is not the Lord “the Judge of all the earth” (Gen. 18:25)?
        Here, too, we are faced with the same clear division: the sheep and
     the goats, the lost and the saved, those who shall, in Christ’s own
     words, “go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into
     life eternal” (Matt. 25:46).
        It doesn’t get much plainer than that.

      Dwell on the sober implications of the texts for today’s study.
      How much more earnest should you be in caring not only for
      your own soul but in working prayerfully and faithfully for the
      salvation of others?

       Yesterday’s study revealed the idea of some sort of universal, end-
     time judgment that involved all people. But what about the church?
     What about those who have professed the name of Jesus and, from all
     outward appearances, are living the Christian life in sincerity and
     faithfulness? Are they, too, judged?
       As Christians, we understand that Jesus was judged and con-
     demned at the Cross in our stead. He faced the condemnation for sin
     that we, otherwise, would have to face ourselves (see Isa. 53:4-6,
     Matt. 20:28, Rom. 5:8, 2 Cor. 5:14, Eph. 5:2, 1 Thess. 5:10). As Ellen
     White expressed it: “Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid
     the iniquity of us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might
     redeem us from the condemnation of the law. The guilt of every
     descendant of Adam was pressing upon His heart.”—The Desire of
     Ages, p. 753. Does this mean, then, that because Christ was con-
     demned in our stead, Christians don’t face judgment?

Look up the following texts. How do they answer the question Are
     Christians judged?

     Matt. 7:21-23
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rom. 14:10
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Heb. 10:30
     ____________________________________________________________________

     1 Pet. 4:17
     ____________________________________________________________________

       These few texts, along with many others, make it abundantly clear
     that God’s people, His church, do face judgment. When Jesus in
     Matthew chided those who claimed that they did many wonderful
     things “in thy name,” He wasn’t talking to atheists, Hindus, or
     Wiccans because they don’t do things in His name. Christians do.
     Paul’s words that “we shall all” stand before the judgment seat
     includes himself in those who will be judged.
       There’s no question that, according to the Word of God, those who
     profess to be followers of Christ, those who are indeed “his people”
     (Heb. 10:30) will face some sort of judgment at the end of time.

      When was the last time you were judged, either rightfully or
      wrongfully? What difference does it make for you knowing
      that, in the end, God will judge both with mercy and with jus-
      tice? Why do you want mercy more than justice? Why will you
      need it?

                                                                       17

      “Every Secret Thing”
        “For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
      thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil” (Eccles. 12:14).

         Solomon writes the whole book of Ecclesiastes and ends with the
      above text, which is about as clear and unambiguous a statement one
      could find in Scripture regarding not only the reality of judgment but
      that judgment involves our works, even “every secret thing.”
         Of course, Solomon wasn’t the only one to tell us about a judgment
      by works. Jesus was pretty explicit in Matthew 12:36, 37 when He
      said that “every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give
      account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be
      justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” Peter makes it
      plain also: “And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of per-
      sons judgeth according to every man’s work, pass the time of your
      sojourning here in fear” (1 Pet. 1:17). Paul, too, understands the real-
      ity of a judgment by works: “For we must all appear before the judg-
      ment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his
      body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad”
      (2 Cor. 5:10). John, in Revelation, writes also of a judgment by works:
      “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books
      were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life:
      and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in
      the books, according to their works” (Rev. 20:12).

What other Bible texts can you find, such as in the parables, that talk
      very clearly about a judgment by works?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       Why does it make sense for there to be a judgment by works?
       When you think about all the evil that has been done in this
       world, how could God be just if there weren’t such a judgment?
       On the lines below write out why it’s important, especially in the
       context of theodicy (see last week’s lesson), for there to be a
       judgment by works. Be prepared to compare your answers in
       class on Sabbath.

     His Reward Is With Him
Read Matthew 22:1-13 and then answer the following questions:

      ●
      1 What is the wedding imagery all about? See also Isa. 62:5,
      Hos. 2:19, Matt. 9:15, Rev. 21:2.

     ____________________________________________________________________

      ●
      2 What significance is there to the fact that a person who had
      accepted the invitation faced judgment?

     ____________________________________________________________________

      ●
      3 What was the fate of the man who, after scrutiny, was found
      without a garment?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       What this parable also teaches is that there is some sort of judgment
     prior to execution of the sentence. After all, even in human courts,
     how often is a sentence executed before an inquiry that leads to judg-
     ment? Revelation 22:12, in which the Lord says that when He returns,
     His “reward is with me,” also implies a prior judgment. (Why would
     the reward already be with Him if there were not something before-
     hand that determined who should get it?) Second Corinthians 5:10
     implies a reckoning prior to a final reward or punishment, so that
     “each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in
     the body” (NIV). This idea is found also in Daniel 12:1, where those
     found in the book of life are delivered.
       Any kind of judgment according to works implies a reckoning of
     those works before the execution of the reward or punishment that
     those works have deserved, be that judgment a hundred years or a
     hundred seconds before the punishment or vindication is carried out.
     And because, according to many of the texts we’ve seen this week, the
     reward or punishment comes at the Second Coming, there must be
     some sort of reckoning or judgment prior to that event itself.

      How would you like to be judged, even punished, prior to some
      sort of fair scrutiny of the facts? Why, then, is the idea of a
      prior judgment so fair and logical? Think, too, about the ques-
      tion of theodicy, of God being vindicated in His whole dealing
      with Satan, sin, and evil. How does the idea of theodicy help us
      understand the need for a scrutiny prior to execution of a sen-
      tence?


                                                                         19

Further Study: “Judgment deserves careful attention, since it is
     involved in the issues of (a) divine justice in an unjust world (theod-
     icy), (b) retribution for wrong done, (c) the suffering of the innocent,
     (d) the resolution of the conflict of good and evil, and (e) the end of
     sin and suffering. But above all, final judgment vindicates the Creator—
     His character, law, and governance—in the minds of all created intel-
     ligences, whether loyal or lost, thereby obtaining eternal security and
     peace for the universe. Judgment is thus portrayed in Scripture as an
     essential part of the ‘eternal gospel’ (Rev. 14:6, 7).”—Handbook of
     Seventh-day Adventist Theology, vol. 12, p. 815.
        This week we’ve seen that Scripture teaches the following points
     about judgment: (1) Judgment and the gospel are linked, even in-
     separable; (2) there is some sort of final judgment near the end of time;
     (3) among those judged are the professed followers of Christ; (4) works
     are clearly part of this judgment; (5) only two final outcomes are pre-
     sented, eternal life or eternal destruction; and (6) some sort of judgment
     takes place prior to the execution of the sentence.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, go over your answers to the question at the end of
      Wednesday’s study. What can you learn from one another? How,
      too, does the question of theodicy play in with your answers?

      ●
      2 Go around the class and have each person who is willing
      answer this question: How do you feel about the prospect of
      being judged by your works?

      ●
      3 Ask different people in the class whether they have ever been
      in a position in which they had to execute some sort of judgment
      upon another person. What was the process like? How important
      was it to be fair? How seriously did they take their responsibil-
      ity? Why was it important to get all the facts before coming to a
      conclusion? What can the class learn from what was said that
      could help us better understand the idea of God’s judgment?

Seeking the Faith
of Jesus
Nixon Noel
   When I realized that the church I had grown up in did not follow all of
God’s teachings, I began searching for a church that kept all of God’s com-
mandments, a church whose members loved one another. I asked my
friends for suggestions, and I prayed for God’s guidance. I was sure that
somewhere I would find a church that stood faithful to God’s Word.
   One Sunday I heard a radio program amplified by a loud speaker out-
side my home. The speaker’s message captured my attention. After the
program ended, the radio announcer identified the station as the Voice of
Hope, broadcasting from Haitian Adventist University in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti. The announcer invited listeners to a week-long series of meetings
starting the next day.
   I went to the meetings and arrived early so I would not miss a thing. The
speaker’s messages filled my spirit and refreshed my soul. I returned every
night and drank up the wonderful truths I was hearing. On Friday evening,
the last night of the meetings, I wondered where I could go to continue
feasting on the truths I had heard all week.
   As I walked out of the hall, a woman invited me to church the next day.
Eagerly I accepted her invitation. I hurried home to polish my only pair of
shoes and press my threadbare shirt and trousers. My parents urged me to
wait to go until I had better clothes. But I was determined. If the people in
this church treated me badly because of my clothes, then I would know it
was not God’s church.
   As I entered the church, I was welcomed warmly and shown to a seat.
The sermon touched my heart. During the closing song the pastor invited
those present to give their hearts to God. As the pastor repeated his invi-
tation, I walked forward.
   The people prayed for me, and I knew I had found the church I was
searching for, the church that shows God’s love to everyone regardless of
status or clothes, the church that teaches the truth without fear of others. I
accepted each Bible truth as it was revealed to me, and I joined the
Adventist Church.
   I thank God for the Voice of Hope in Haiti, the voice that led me to
Jesus.
   The Voice of Hope radio station recently received part of a Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering, which will allow the station to increase its output and
reach even more people in Haiti for Christ.

                                Daniel 2




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 2.

Memory Text: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of
      heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the
      kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
      pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
      ever” (Daniel 2:44).

               young man, struggling with questions about God, confronted a

      A        Christian and said, “I’ll give you an hour to prove to me that
               God exists!” The Christian, without hesitation, took him
      through Daniel 2. When he was finished, the young man confessed,
      “Now I know there is a God in heaven!”
         Those who know Daniel 2 can understand what happened. Here was
      this book, written in the sixth century B.C., laying out the history of the
      world from Daniel’s time through ours, and even beyond. It’s hard to see
      how any rational person, after studying Daniel 2, could come away
      unimpressed by the prophecy and the God who has revealed Himself in
      it. In fact, so powerful is Daniel 2 (as well as other parts of the book) as
      a witness for the Christian faith that, in early centuries of the church,
      opponents already argued that Daniel was written in the middle of the
      second century B.C., after the events it talked about, a view still held by
      many today. This theory, though, is not only unsubstantiated but doesn’t
      explain how the chapter could predict events long centuries beyond the
      supposed second-century B.C. date of its composition.
         This week we’ll look at this fascinating prophecy, which helps form
      the foundation for our study this quarter on the judgment and the gospel.

     The Big Picture

     ●
     1 Why did the king’s servants want him to tell them the dream?

     ●
     2 What were the only two possible fates all the wise men of

     3 How did Daniel’s actions reveal the utter helplessness of his sit-
     uation from a human standpoint alone?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ●
     4 Why was Daniel so confident (vs. 24) that he could reveal to the
     king this secret?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Daniel’s prayer of thanksgiving in many ways reveals the main mes-
     sage of the whole book: Despite outward appearances, the Lord is
     Sovereign, even to the point of removing or setting up kings. Though
     we, with our limited view of things (1 Cor. 13:12), may feel over-
     whelmed by events, we can have the assurance that God is ultimately
     in control.
       Even more important, what this first section of the chapter shows is
     that not only is God in control of the big picture, He’s close to us as
     individuals. Look at how He came to Daniel in a “night vision” and
     revealed to him what he needed to know. Talk about intimate contact!
     Though Daniel was only a foreign captive in a massive world empire,
     the Lord of all the earth (Josh. 3:11), the Creator of the heavens and
     the earth (Gen. 1:1), the One who holds the stars in their paths (Job
     38:31), manifested His power and His care to this simple Hebrew lad.
       And, lest we forget—this is the same God whom we worship and
     serve today.

      When was the last time you were in a “hopeless” situation? In
      what way did the Lord manifest His power and care to you at
      that time? If willing, share your answer with the class.

        Here’s Daniel, six centuries before the birth of Christ, laying out the
     history of the world. The head of gold, of course, is named as Babylon
     (vs. 38). The next kingdom, the one depicted by the breast and arms of
     silver (vss. 32, 39), was the Medo-Persian Empire. The next one, sym-
     bolized by the belly and thighs of brass (vss. 32, 39), was Greece; and
     the fourth kingdom, symbolized by the iron in the legs (vss. 33, 40),
     was the Roman Empire, which eventually led into the nations of mod-
     ern Europe, symbolized by the feet, part of iron and part of clay (vss.
     33, 41-43).
        This is not some Adventist scenario: Jewish and Christian Bible stu-
     dents for many centuries have long interpreted Daniel 2 in this manner.

How does the prophecy end? What kingdom is ultimately estab-
     lished? And what does that answer reveal about the whole range
     and sweep of this chapter?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Daniel 2 unfolds a sweeping panorama of history, an unbroken suc-
     cession of world powers beginning more than five centuries before
     Christ and ending sometime in the future, when God’s eternal king-
     dom will be established after Christ’s return. Thus, Daniel 2 takes us
     to the end of the world as we now know it. Those who limit it and its
     prophecies to events prior even to the first advent of Christ are
     severely misinterpreting a foundational teaching of the chapter, not to
     mention (as we’ll see) the entire book. Daniel, without question, is a
     book that unfolds events right up to the second coming of Christ, and
     beyond. It truly is, as it says in other places, dealing with the time of
     “the end” (Dan. 8:17, 19; 12:4, 9, 13).

      The Roman Empire
        When you read Daniel 2, you’ll notice something:

        What metal was used for Babylon?____________ What metal was
      used for Media-Persia?____________ What metal was used for
      Greece?____________ What metal was used for Rome?____________

        Babylon is compared to a metal, Media-Persia is compared to a
      metal, and Greece is compared to a metal. In contrast, in verses 33, 34
      the iron that comes up after Greece (representing Rome) stays there
      until the stone cut out “without hands” (vs. 34) destroys everything.
      The iron that arises after Greece remains until the end, though in the
      feet it becomes mixed with clay. In the interpretation of that part of
      the vision, the metal representing the fourth power, iron, remains until
      the end, as well, though it’s depicted as mixed with miry clay (vss. 40-
      44). The point is unmistakable: The fourth power arises after Greece
      and remains until the end, even though it is manifested in a different
      form. In Daniel, the fourth power, the power rising after Greece, stays
      the same power (for it’s iron all the way through, unlike the previous
      powers whose metal disappeared when a whole new empire arose),
      though at some point it changed form. Thus, it’s Rome from the time
      of Greece until the end of the world. Amazingly enough, Rome still
      exists today as a worldwide power, though its form is radically differ-
      ent from when it first arose after Greece.

Many centuries ago, one of England’s greatest political thinkers wrote:
      “If a man considers the origin of this great ecclesiastical dominion,
      he will easily perceive that the papacy is no other than the ghost of
      the deceased Roman empire, sitting crowned on the grave
      thereof.”— Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan. How does that quote help
      us understand what Daniel 2 teaches about the Roman Empire?

       Think for a few moments about how amazing this prophecy is,
       how so many centuries ago such an accurate prediction could be
       made. How should this give you more confidence to trust in the
       Bible and the promises made in it to us?

      Multiple Fulfillment?
        In Daniel 2, five kingdoms are depicted, though the chapter itself
      specifically identifies only two: the first, Babylon (vss. 37, 38), and
      the last, God’s kingdom (vs. 44). However, as we’ll see in greater
      detail later, Daniel 7 and Daniel 8 cover much of the same ground,
      only from different perspectives. Also, in those two chapters, two
      more of the five kingdoms are named.

Read Daniel 8:20, 21. What two kingdoms, already discussed in yester-
      day’s study, are specifically named?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        If we were to chart the kingdoms depicted, and specifically named,
      in Daniel, the outline would look like this:

                            Babylon (Dan. 2:37, 38)
                           Media-Persia (Dan. 8:20)
                              Greece (Dan. 8:21)
                                Fourth kingdom
                       God’s eternal kingdom (Dan. 2:44)

Read Daniel’s own interpretation of the vision (Dan. 2:37-45). Do you
      see anything there indicating that these prophecies can have dif-
      ferent meanings in different times? Defend your answer.

         Though the fourth kingdom is not named, only one power can pos-
      sibly fit (more on this later). However, of the five kingdoms depicted,
      four are named. The prophecy says absolutely nothing about their hav-
      ing multiple fulfillment; that is, the kingdoms symbolizing one thing
      in one era, another thing in another. Considering what’s named—mas-
      sive empires immovably and immutably rooted in world history
      itself—the idea that we can somehow give these specific prophecies
      here in Daniel different fulfillment in different eras certainly doesn’t
      arise from anything in the texts themselves. In short, there is
      absolutely no justification for the idea that this prophecy is open to
      different fulfillment in different times in history.

       We live in a world in which things are, inherently, unstable. The
       ground, in an instant, can crumble beneath our feet. The past,
       though, is unchangeable, immovable. Look at how solid a foun-
       dation God has given us with this prophecy. How can you use
       what’s been depicted here to strengthen your own faith?

      Antiquity to Eternity
         One point should, by now, be very clear regarding our study of
      Daniel 2, and that is—it is, in many ways, a historical study. Though
      some of the prophecy leads into our time and beyond, its foundation
      is based in history.

Read again Daniel 2:37-45. Summarize, on just two lines, the basic
      message of this text.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        This prophecy begins in antiquity and follows a continuous sweep
      of world history that extends unto “the time of the end” (Dan. 12:9);
      that is, beyond us and into the future world of God’s eternal kingdom.
        More than anything else, these verses reveal, too, the method for
      how we should interpret the prophecies in Daniel. Daniel 2:37-44, by
      interpreting the dream, contains the key to understanding the proph-
      ecies, because the texts themselves interpret the prophecies. This
      proves that the historicist approach to interpretation (of which
      Adventists remain almost alone in still adhering to) is what the text
      demands. The historicist approach teaches what Daniel 2 teaches, that
      these prophecies follow the sweep of human history from antiquity to
      eternity and that they are not focused solely on events in the far past
      or solely on events in the future but cover the scope of world history
      from the past into the future. Thus, in the first prophetic section of
      Daniel, we are given the key to understanding its prophecies.

Read Daniel 2:34, 35 and its interpretation in verses 44, 45. What do
      they tell us about the nature of this last kingdom in contrast to the
      fate of all the kingdoms before it? What do we find in these texts
      that proves this kingdom has not yet been established?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       As we can see, Daniel was correct about all the kingdoms he
       predicted would rise and fall. His predictions about Europe
       have come true with painful accuracy. How much reason, then,
       do you have to trust him on the promise of the establishment of
       God’s final kingdom?

Further Study: “Some will take the truth applicable to their time,
     and place it in the future. Events in the train of prophecy that had their
     fulfillment away in the past are made future, and thus by these theo-
     ries the faith of some is undermined.”—Ellen G. White, Selected
     Messages, vol. 2, p. 102.

        As we’ve seen this week, Daniel 2 presents a powerful case for our
     trust in the inspiration of the Word. How someone six centuries before
     Christ could have outlined world history as accurately as he did is
     something that defies a purely natural explanation. That point is so
     obvious, in fact, that some people have claimed that the prophecy is
     vaticinium ex eventu (prophecy after the event), that the book of
     Daniel was written in the second century before Christ and that it was
     about only past events, events prior to it being written.
        This view falls apart on a number of counts.
        First of all, Christ’s words in Matthew 24:15 prove that Jesus
     believed some of Daniel’s prophecies were yet future.
        Second, even if one were to reject Daniel’s own words about when
     he lived (Dan. 1:1, 2:1, 7:1, 9:1) and date the book in the second cen-
     tury before Christ, how does this explain the amazing accuracy with
     which he predicted not only the world dominion of the Roman Empire
     (which hadn’t happened yet) but its breakup into what became the
     nations of modern Europe, which—in its present state—is exactly as
     Daniel had written? Not bad for a man writing centuries before some
     of these events unfolded. In short, there is no reason whatsoever that
     we should accept the second century B.C. date for Daniel, especially
     when the idea was originated by people who wanted to discredit
     Christianity to begin with. As Christians, we must take the Word for
     what it says, as opposed to what humans say instead.

The Greatest Physician
Elvie Velasco
   Felix was too busy enjoying life to think about God. Then he got sick.
We helped him get from his mountain home in southern Philippines to the
hospital several hours away. After examining him, the doctors told Felix
that he had cirrhosis of the liver and probably would die within the month.
“Go home,” they urged.
   Back home Felix lay on his mat, too weak even to sit up. Every day my
student-missionary partner and I visited him and prayed for him. Felix
could hear the village children singing songs during morning worship. He
heard us tell Bible stories. One day Felix said, “I heard you tell the chil-
dren that your Jesus healed a man who could not walk. Can your Jesus
heal me too?”
   We assured Felix that Jesus can heal if it is His will.
   “How do I ask God to heal me?” Felix asked. We explained that he must
believe that Jesus could heal him and be willing to give his life to God and
follow Him.
   “But how do I keep the Sabbath?” Felix asked. “I am too weak to attend
church or even to sit up,” he said, his voice choked with tears.
   We explained that God had set aside the Sabbath as a day to worship,
and Felix could worship God on his sick bed by praying and by listening
to God’s Word spoken from the church.
   “I will do that!” he promised. We prayed with Felix and encouraged him
to trust in God.
   On Sabbath we were surprised to find Felix sitting in the church long
before services started. “How did you get here?” we asked.
   “Every day I prayed to Jesus to heal me. I promised to keep His Word
and obey His commandments. Today my wife helped me sit up. It was
painful, but I made it. Then she helped me stand and slowly walk to
church.”
   We praised God for healing Felix in body and in soul. Today Felix walks
around the village without help, stopping to tell people how his friend
Jesus, the greatest Physician, healed him. Felix and his wife will be bap-
tized as soon as a minister can climb the mountain to their village.
   Our mission offerings help support Mountain View College and the
student-missionary program there that has reached thousands of people in

Elvie Velasco was a student missionary (SULAD) from Mountain View College, in southern
Philippines.

                               Daniel 7




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 7.

Memory Text: “Until the Ancient of Days came and pro-
      nounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the
      time came when they possessed the kingdom” (Daniel 7:22, NIV).

          f Daniel 2 provides powerful, rational evidence not only for God’s

      I   existence but for His power to control the future, Daniel 7 pro-
          vides even more. Daniel 7 covers the same ground as does Daniel
      2, as well as provides a key element not explicitly expressed in Daniel
      2: the great judgment in heaven that leads directly to the second com-
      ing of Jesus and the end of this world as we know it. In short, in
      Daniel 7 we are shown the pre-Advent judgment.
         The key to understanding Daniel 7 is found in Daniel 2. “In fact, the
      two visions [Daniel 2 and 7] follow a parallel development. They cover
      the same time span, from Babylon to the end of human time, and
      evoke the same four kingdoms represented symbolically by metals in
      chapter 2, and by beasts in chapter 7. Such a parallel is more than a
      unifying factor—it is the key to our method of interpretation. We must
      read chapter 7 in the light of chapter 2.”—Jacques Doukhan, Secrets
      of Daniel (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Publishing Assoc.,
      2000), p. 100.
         There’s so much in Daniel 7 (we will return to it later); for now, we
      will get a quick overview of this amazing prophecy, with an empha-
      sis on its climactic scene: the heavenly judgment, which leads to the
      return of Christ and the fulfillment of our great hopes as believers in
      Jesus.

      Daniel’s Dream
Read Daniel 7:1-14. On the lines below, summarize in your own
      words the essence of Daniel’s dream.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        As you read, you’ve probably noticed a few parallels with Daniel 2,
      such as (1) the same number of different entities appear, (2) there is
      emphasis on the last entity (in Daniel 2 it was the iron), and (3) both
      end with God establishing His eternal kingdom.
        Are there any other parallels?

In verses 16 and 17, Daniel is immediately given the basic interpreta-
      tion of his dream. What is the interpretation, and how does it par-
      allel Daniel 2?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It’s obvious that what we have in Daniel 7 is a more detailed depic-
      tion of what was revealed in Daniel 2. Though more details are given
      about these powers, the four beasts in Daniel 7 represent the same
      four kingdoms as in Daniel 2. Scholars have long recognized them as
      the following:

                                Babylon (lion)
                              Media-Persia (bear)
                               Greece (leopard)
                              Rome (fourth beast)
                              God’s final kingdom

        Here, again, we are shown that the foundation of the prophecies in
      Daniel is based on history. Daniel sweeps over world history from
      ancient times right through to ours and beyond. If that point wasn’t
      made clear enough in Daniel 2, it’s repeated in Daniel 7.
        How blessed we are to know not only that our God is in control but
      that, regardless of what happens here and now, in the end, He will set
      up His eternal kingdom.

       The establishment of God’s final kingdom is assured. What
       assurance do you have that you will be there when it is? What
       is your assurance based on?

                                                                          31
               M ONDAY July 17

     The Fourth Beast
       There’s an important parallel between Daniel 2 and Daniel 7 that
     we don’t want to miss. In Daniel 2, the iron, the fourth power, arises
     after Greece (vss. 32, 33, 39-45), and, though taking another form, it
     remains until the end. It was destroyed only when God set up His
     kingdom.
       In Daniel 7, with the fourth beast, the fourth power, the same thing
     happens. The fourth beast, which arose after Greece (vss. 6, 7),
     remains until the end of time (though taking another form), when it is
     destroyed at the establishment of God’s eternal kingdom (vss. 19-27).
       Thus, in both Daniel 2 and Daniel 7, the fourth power, the one aris-
     ing after Greece, remains until the end of the world.

Read Daniel 7:19-27 and then answer the following questions:

       What parallels do you see between the description of the fourth
     beast (Dan. 7:19) and that of the fourth power in Daniel 2 (vs. 40)?

        What ultimately brings about the demise of the little-horn
     power in Daniel 7?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In Daniel 7, more time is spent dealing with this little-horn power
     than with any of the other powers. Obviously, this little horn, which
     arose out of the fourth beast, and thus remains part of it, is deemed
     very serious by the Lord, for so much time is spent on it. This power,
     though arising out of the fourth beast, exists until the end of time,
     when—after the judgment in heaven—God sets up His earthly king-
     dom. Only then is it destroyed.

      People have often talked about trying to build a kingdom of
      God on earth here and now. Inevitably, all these have failed.
      Why? Why is our ultimate hope only in God’s supernatural
      intervention in our behalf, as depicted in this chapter?

32
               T UESDAY July 18

     The Little Horn
       Daniel 7 goes from Babylon, Media-Persia, and Greece to pagan
     Rome, the phase of Rome that arose right after the downfall of Greece.
     Then, while depicting this Roman power, Daniel 7 describes the rise of
     the little horn, which is still part of the fourth beast, though another
     phase of it. Who is this little horn? The Protestant Reformers almost
     unanimously saw it as papal Rome. Indeed, even before the
     Reformation, some Jewish scholars also identified the little horn as the
     papal phase of the fourth beast. It’s hard to see how it could be any-
     thing else. In fact, it can’t be anything else. You might need faith to
     believe in the Second Coming or the resurrection of the dead, but you
     don’t need much faith to see papal Rome as the power depicted here.

Below are some traits of the little horn. Given however much you
     know about the papacy, how do these descriptions match it?

      ●
      1 The little horn arises from pagan Rome (Dan. 7:19, 20).




      ●
      2 The little horn makes war with the saints and prevails
       against them (Dan. 7:21, 25).




      ●
      3 The little horn thinks to change “times and laws” (Dan. 7:25).




      ●
      4 The little-horn power is blasphemous (Dan. 7:25).




      All these attributes have been powerfully and graphically
      recorded in history. There’s no question here regarding the
      identity of this little-horn power. Though we have to be diplo-
      matic in how we deal with these prophecies, and seek to teach
      them in a way that doesn’t hurt other people, we would be
      unfaithful to our biblical mandate (see Rev. 13:1-9, 14:6-12)
      were we, in the interest of political correctness, to abandon this
      position in favor of something less controversial.

                                                                          33
          W EDNESDAY July 19

      Time, Times, and Dividing of Time
Read Daniel 7:25. What is the time prophecy given there?


        Even non-Adventists have recognized that the time, times, and divid-
      ing of time here means three and a half years. One study Bible by
      Thomas Nelson says: “A time, times and the dividing of time . . . is an
      expression used in Daniel and in Revelation to refer to three and a half
      years, or 1,260 days, or 42 months (12:7; Rev 11:2; 12:6, 14; 13:5).”

How do the texts in the above quote help you understand why the time
      prophecy in Daniel 7:25 is the same as 1,260 days?


        As others have done, Adventists apply the day-year principle to this
      prophecy, which means it’s dealing with 1,260 years, not 1,260 literal
      days. Later we will spend a whole week on the day-year principle. For
      now, we can see that Daniel 7 is full of symbols: a lion with wings, a beast
      with iron teeth, a little horn that has eyes. Why would a time prophecy,
      imbedded among these symbols, be anything but symbolic itself?
        Thus, we’re given a 1,260-year period delineating an aspect of papal
      Rome, in this case, a period of persecution.
        If we date the beginning of papal Rome to the late fifth, early sixth
      century, 1,260 years later brings us to the late eighteenth, or early nine-
      teenth, century. Again, history bears out that the long period of papal
      political dominion, which included massive persecution, petered out in
      the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

What happens in the prophecy after the 1,260-year period is
      depicted? Dan. 7:25-27 (see also Dan. 7:8-10, 21, 22).


        After the rise of the little horn, which came after all the preceding
      beasts, the prophecy depicts a great judgment in heaven that leads to
      the Second Coming.
        The crucial point here is that, according to this prophecy, the judg-
      ment in heaven comes after the 1,260-day prophetic period, sometime
      after that phase of persecution that ended in the late eighteenth, or
      early nineteenth, century yet before the Second Coming.
        Thus, within the interpretation, we are given historical evidence to
      help us understand the timing of this judgment, which leads to the
      demise of the little horn and to the end of this world.
       One thousand two hundred and sixty years is a long time. What
       message is there for us, who might die before seeing all our
       hopes and dreams realized in this life?
34
             T HURSDAY July 20

      Horn, Judgment, Kingdom
        Yesterday we saw that Daniel 7 presented a specific sequence of
      events: There was the little-horn power, followed by a judgment in
      heaven, which ended in the establishment of God’s kingdom. This
      sequence is so important it’s found three times in the chapter itself.

Read Daniel 7:7-10, 14. How is this specific order—little horn, judg-
      ment, God’s kingdom—shown there?

Read Daniel 7:19-22. How, again, is that same sequence depicted?

Read Daniel 7:24-27. How, again, is that sequence presented?

        Three times in Daniel we are given this sequence:

                                     Little horn
                                 Judgment in heaven
                                   God’s kingdom

        Obviously, this sequence must be of major importance; otherwise,
      why would the Lord have given it three times in the prophecy? What’s
      fascinating, too, is that with the little horn, we are given our first
      apocalyptic time prophecy (apocalyptic simply means dealing with
      end-time events), a time prophecy that helps us understand the timing
      of this judgment, which occurs after the 1,260 years and yet before
      God’s eternal kingdom is established.
        Thus, we can express the prophecy like this:

               Little horn (late eighteenth, early nineteenth, century)
                                 Judgment in heaven
                                God’s eternal kingdom

        What’s crucial to understand about this judgment, too, is that
      though it results in the demise of the little-horn power, it also results
      in the end of this world. As Daniel 2 showed, everything is going to
      be swept away and replaced by God’s kingdom.

       Daniel doesn’t depict the end of the world as some sort of com-
       promise: It culminates, instead, in the total victory of good over
       evil. What lesson is there for us in how we deal with evil in our
       own lives on a day-by-day basis? Are you compromising with
       evil now, in any way?

                                                                            35
                  F RIDAY July 21

Further Study: Below is all of Daniel 7, with the first apocalyptic
     time prophecy imbedded in the sequence. What we’ve added, too, are
     the approximate times that each of the empires collapsed. Though his-
     torians often put specific dates on these events, centering often around
     decisive military battles, the collapse of one empire and the rise of
     another usually occurs over many years, not just one (remember, too,
     that the fourth beast and the little horn that comes out of it are
     depicted in Scripture as one power):
                                     Babylon
                        (Ends early mid-sixth century B.C.)

                                Media-Persia
        (From early mid-sixth century to early mid-fourth century B.C.)

                                   Greece
          (From early mid-fourth century to mid-second century B.C.)
                               Pagan Rome
               (From mid-second B.C. to fifth–sixth century A.D.)

                                 Papal Rome
         (Persecution from sixth century A.D. to eighteenth–nineteenth
                                 century A.D.)

                               Judgment in heaven

                                 Second Coming
       Sure, the papacy didn’t end in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth
     century, but that’s not what the prophecy says. Instead, it says only that
     persecution would last for this length of time, or at least that phase of
     that persecution (Revelation 13, of course, talks about a resurgence of
     papal persecution, but that’s another issue).
       Thus, what’s clear so far from Daniel 7 is that this massive judg-
     ment scene in heaven leads to the establishment of God’s kingdom and
     occurs sometime after the 1,260 years of papal persecution, sometime
     after the late eighteenth, or early nineteenth, century but before the
     Second Coming.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Daniel 7:22 says that judgment was given in “favor of the
      saints” (NIV). As a class, discuss what that means. What else in
      Daniel 7 shows us that the judgment is such good news?

      ●2 Review the evidence that helps give us a positive identification
      of the little horn. How can we present this teaching in a way that’s
      as least offensive as possible and yet, at the same time, doesn’t
      compromise what the Scripture teaches?

New Church in the
Neighborhood
Altanundral
   Two years ago a new church was built in our neighborhood in Mongolia.
It was big news in our town, and people visited the church out of curios-
ity. I went too, just to see what it was about. I had no religion; I did not
even know whether there was a God.
   The simple wooden church felt like a peaceful refuge, and the music,
prayers, and sermons fed me. I decided to return.
   I realized that my life was full of bad things, and I needed some peace.
My husband is an alcoholic, and when he drank too much, he beat me. I
worked in a factory, cared for my three sons, and kept house for my fam-
ily. Church became a place of refuge for me. The pastor’s sermons were
practical and related to my life and experience. Once I started attending, I
did not want to stop.
   At first my husband objected to my church attendance. But I persisted,
and I took my sons with me. I taught them to pray. One day my youngest
son picked a tiny potato in our garden. He asked me to cook it for him.
Then he put it on a plate and prayed, thanking God for that one small
pota10. It touched my heart.
   Then I learned that I was pregnant. The baby was breech, and I needed
to have a caesarian section. While I awaited surgery, I prayed, and the
prayers brought me peace. I healed much more quickly than the doctor
thought possible. I think that is because I entrusted my life to God.
   Because of this experience, I realized how relevant God is in our lives.
When my son was two months old, I returned to church and asked to be
baptized.
   My husband’s attitude toward God continues to change. We invite him
                                 to join us when we pray. He is praying
                                 more and drinking less. I have learned that
                                 prayer really works.
                                    If this little church had not been built in
                                 our neighborhood, I might never have
                                 experienced God’s love in such a personal
                                 and powerful way.
                                    Your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings in
                                 2001 helped make this church a reality.
                                 Thank you.

         LESSON              5       *July 22-28


                                Daniel 8




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 8.
Memory Text: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
      hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed” (Daniel 8:14).

              aniel 8, as we’ll soon see, covers much of the same ground as

      D       Daniel 2 and Daniel 7: It shows a flow of history, beginning in
              antiquity and going up through the “time of the end” (Dan.
      8:17), the first time the phrase appears in the book of Daniel (but not
      the last). Along with the overwhelming evidence from previous chap-
      ters that Daniel deals with end-time events, Daniel 8 comes right out
      and says it, a problem for those who want to limit the events of Daniel
      8 to a historical period in Israelite history that ended in the second cen-
      tury before Christ—a view that for this reason (and others) is untenable.
         Also, like Daniel 2 and 7, Daniel 8 is divided into two sections: a
      dream/vision and then an explanation of that dream/vision. In Daniel
      8, the first 14 verses deal with his vision, in which Daniel sees a ram,
      a goat, and a little horn, followed by the cleansing of the sanctuary.
      The rest of the chapter is the explanation given him regarding the ram,
      the goat, and the little horn. Interestingly enough, the part about the
      sanctuary being cleansed is not explained here. And, as we’ll see—
      though specifically told that the vision of the sanctuary being
      cleansed “is true” (vs. 26)—Daniel says that he doesn’t understand it
      (vs. 27). That’s because it wasn’t explained, as were the other elements
      in the vision. This point becomes important later, when we study the
      next chapter, in which an explanation is finally given.

      Animals, Again
Read Daniel 8:1-14. On the lines below, give a summary of the vision.
      Concentrate especially on the sequence of events as presented to
      Daniel.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        After Daniel is given this vision of the ram, the goat, the little horn, and
      the sanctuary being cleansed, notice what happens in verses 15 through
      18. Daniel says that he sought for the meaning of what passed before him
      in vision. A “man’s voice” then calls out and tells the angel Gabriel to
      “make this man understand the vision.” Gabriel then approaches
      Daniel. Notice, too, how the angel prefaces his words. Twice (vss. 17,
      19) he tells Daniel that the vision deals with “the end.”

Read the rest of the chapter. What interpretation does Gabriel give
      Daniel?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In reference to both Daniel 2 and Daniel 7, we said that Media-Persia
      and Greece were depicted as some of the great powers that would arise
      in world history. Here, now, there’s no guess: Gabriel comes right out
      and names them. (Unlike the other two visions, Babylon is not depicted
      here in Daniel 8; in a later week we will look at one reason why.)
        After naming Media-Persia and Greece (vss. 20, 21), he gives an
      explanation of the little-horn power that arises next. Though we will look
      at it in more detail tomorrow, notice how this little-horn power is
      destroyed (vs. 25)—language very similar to how Daniel 2 described
      God’s supernatural intervention that brings the end of the world (vs. 34).
        Thus, the events of Daniel 8 could be summarized like this:
                                    Media-Persia
                                       Greece
                                     Little horn
                                  Sanctuary cleansed

       Daniel 8 is another place in the Bible that shows us that God
       ultimately is in control. How does this reality give you some
       hope amid whatever trials you are now facing?


                                                                                 39

      The Little Horn
        In our survey of Daniel, we’ve seen that it has dealt with five king-
      doms, four of which have been named for us: Babylon (Dan. 2:38),
      Media-Persia (Dan. 8:20), Greece (Dan. 8:21), God’s eternal king-
      dom (Dan. 2:44; 7:14, 18, 22, 27). The only one not specifically
      named is the one that, in all three visions, arises after Greece and
      exists until the time of the end. Below is a chart with all the earthly
      kingdoms depicted, those named and the one not named:

      Daniel 2                    Daniel 7                    Daniel 8
      Babylon                     Babylon                     ——
      Media-Persia                Media-Persia                Media-Persia

      at end                      at end                      at end

From what you have studied so far, what is the identity of that little-horn
      power in Daniel 8? What reasons can you give for your conclusion?


         The obvious answer, of course, is Rome (both pagan and papal). Here
      are just a few of many reasons why:
         Looking at the parallels between the visions, one can see it was Rome
      in Daniel 2, Rome in Daniel 7; thus, obviously, it’s Rome in Daniel 8.
         The little-horn power comes up after Greece and extends to the time
      of the end, when it is supernaturally destroyed. What power, rising after
      Greece, still exists today?
         Notice, too, that Media-Persia is depicted as “great” (vs. 4), and that
      Greece is depicted as “very great” (vs. 8). In contrast, the little- horn
      power is depicted as “exceeding great” (vs. 9). Though people can
      argue over whether “exceeding” great is more than “very” great,
      “exceeding great” is certainly more than just “great.” Thus, this little-
      horn power is, at least, greater than the Medo-Persian Empire. Again,
      what power, coming up after Greece, existing until the end, could be
      depicted as greater than Media-Persia other than Rome?
         We saw last week how that little-horn power in Daniel 7 was, clearly,
      papal Rome. We have here the same symbol in Daniel 8. Both, too, are
      described as persecuting powers, as well.

       Study some of the attributes of the little horn. In what ways can
       we, as individuals, manifest the same spirit as the little horn?

40
                T UESDAY July 25

      The Little Horn (Cont.)
         The evidence we’ve seen so far is overwhelming that the little-horn
      power arising after Greece in Daniel 8 is the same power that arises
      after Greece in both Daniel 2 and Daniel 7, and that’s Rome, begin-
      ning as pagan Rome and then changing into papal Rome.
         The two phases are seen in the imagery of all three chapters. In
      Daniel 2, as we saw, the iron that arises after Greece (the brass)
      extends to the end, though the form changes in the feet, when it
      becomes mixed with clay. While the emphasis here is political more
      than religious and the focus is on the various nations themselves, this
      change in Rome coincided with the rise of the papacy, both in time
      and location. If nothing else, in Daniel 2 we see the idea of Rome
      changing form at some point in history.
         In Daniel 7, as we saw, the fourth beast came first, followed by the
      little horn, another phase of the same power.

Review the details of the little horn in Daniel 7. What are the reli-
      gious elements that are revealed there in this phase of Rome?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In verse 8, after describing the breakup of Greece into various king-
      doms, the little horn is depicted as coming from “ ‘up among them’ ”;
      that is, one of “ ‘the four winds of heaven’ ” (vs. 2, NIV), its immedi-
      ate antecedent. Right after this, the two phases of the little-horn’s
      activity are revealed, as well.

What is the directional activity of the little horn as depicted in Daniel
      8:9? Contrast that directional activity with what the little horn
      does in verses 10-12. What difference do you see?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In verse 9, the little horn moves horizontally across the face of the
      earth, depicting military or political expansion (compare with Dan.
      8:4). In the next few verses, the activity is depicted as vertical, heaven-
      ward, in an attack on the “host of heaven,” on the “Prince of the host,”
      even against the sanctuary itself. Though, obviously, the little horn
      does not reach literally into heaven itself, what this does depict is the
      religious nature of its attack. Thus, here in Daniel 8, as well, we are
      given two phases of the same power: first the pagan phase then the
      distinctly religious activity of the papal phase.

                                                                             41
          W EDNESDAY July 26

      Sanctuary Cleansed
       In review, what we have studied in Daniel 8, so far, could be sum-
      marized like this:
                                Media-Persia
                                   Greece
                                   Rome
                             Sanctuary cleansed

        As shown earlier, everything in Daniel 8 had been interpreted by
      Gabriel except for the cleansing of the sanctuary. Though no specific
      explanation was given, a powerful hint is found in the chapter.

The vision of Daniel 8:14 ends with the sanctuary being cleansed after
      a depiction of the little-horn’s activity in a certain historical
      period; after the depiction of the little horn (vss. 22-25), the expla-
      nation ends with a specific event (vs. 25, final clause). What is that
      event, and how does it help us come to some understanding about
      what the cleansing of the sanctuary involves?


       If we were to parallel the vision of Daniel 8 with its explanation, it
      would look like this:

      Vision                             Explanation
      Ram                                Media-Persia
      Goat                               Greece
      Little horn                        Rome
      Sanctuary cleansed                 Supernatural demise
                                         of little horn

        Whatever else the cleansing of the sanctuary involves, it results in
      the supernatural destruction of this last earthly empire, which is what
      happened in both Daniel 2 and 7, when God sets up His eternal king-
      dom. Thus, the idea that limits the cleansing of the sanctuary to some
      mere human event, such as the removing of enemies from the temple
      precincts in the second century B.C., falls apart. It’s obvious from the
      context, especially when viewed in parallel to Daniel 2 and Daniel 7,
      that this cleansing of the sanctuary is an event of major importance.
      Indeed, the mere fact that it’s linked with the rise and fall of three of
      what the Bible depicts as major world powers in and of itself testifies
      to the importance of the cleansing of the sanctuary.

       What things in your own life need to be cleansed? What’s the
       only way that can happen?

     Judgment in Heaven
       Below is a chart summarizing what we have looked at so far in the
     past few weeks. What does this tell us that the cleansing of the sanc-
     tuary is?

     Daniel 2            Daniel 7                  Daniel 8
     Babylon             Babylon                   ——————
     Media-Persia        Media-Persia              Media-Persia

     Pagan Rome          Pagan Rome                Pagan Rome

     ——————              Judgment in heaven        Cleansing of sanctuary
     Second Coming       Second Coming             ——————

        As we see all the way through here, there are parallels between the
     chapters. And not only are the nations depicted in parallel to one
     another, the judgment scene in Daniel 7—which transpires after a dis-
     tinct time period regarding Rome (the 1,260 years)—directly parallels
     the cleansing of the sanctuary, which in Daniel 8 occurs after Rome,
     as well. In short, this heavenly judgment in Daniel 7—the judgment
     that leads to the end of the world—is the same thing as the cleansing
     of the sanctuary in Daniel 8. We are given here two different depic-
     tions of the same thing: the judgment, also known as the cleansing of
     the sanctuary in Daniel 8.

According to this chart, where is this judgment, time wise, in
     relationship to the Second Coming?


       The crucial point is the parallel between this massive judgment
     scene in Daniel 7 and the cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8. The
     judgment scene in Daniel 7 is simply another way of expressing the
     cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8, just as the depiction of the bear
     in Daniel 7 is another way of expressing the ram in Daniel 8. Each
     depiction adds to the other, elaborating on each other, together giving
     us a lot of information about the specific event. What’s undeniably
     clear is that it is a pre-Advent event; that is, this is a judgment that
     occurs before the Second Coming. Indeed, it’s this judgment itself that
     leads directly to the Second Coming.

      What things in your life can be solved only by the second com-
      ing of Jesus; what things can be solved here and now? Why is it
      so important to know the difference between the two?

                                                                           43

Further Study: Look at the parallels here between Daniel 7 and 8,
     this time with the approximate dates for the events depicted in the two
     chapters:

     Daniel 7                                  Daniel 8
     Babylon                                   _____________
     (Ends early mid-sixth century B.C.)
     Media-Persia                              Media-Persia
     (From early mid-sixth century to early mid-fourth century B.C.)
     Greece                                    Greece
     (From early mid-fourth century to mid-second century B.C.)
     Pagan Rome                                Pagan Rome
     (From mid-second century B.C. to fifth–sixth century A.D.)
     Papal Rome                                Papal Rome
     (Phase of depicted persecution: From sixth century A.D. to eighteenth–
     nineteenth century A.D.)

     Judgment in heaven                        Cleansing of sanctuary
     Second Coming                             Destroyed without hands

       What’s clear from the chart is that because the judgment in Daniel
     7, which occurred after the 1,260 years, is the same as the cleansing
     of the sanctuary in Daniel 8, then the cleansing of the sanctuary in
     Daniel 8 occurred after the 1,260 years, as well. This fact, then, puts
     the cleansing of the sanctuary sometime after the late eighteenth to
     early nineteenth century, yet before the second coming of Christ.
     Though these points help narrow down the time of the pre-Advent
     judgment, they still don’t give us an exact date. More information is
     needed; that’s why, as we’ll see, more information is given.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, go over the main points of this week’s lesson. Be
      sure everyone understands the parallels between the chapters.
      Try to answer whatever questions that arise as best as you are
      able.

      ●
      2 The last verse of Daniel 8 teaches that certain aspects of the
      vision were unknown to Daniel. What lesson is there for us
      regarding the need to press on ahead in faith despite there being
      things we don’t yet understand?

The Raised Spear
J. H. Zachary
   John Kiok is a Masai, a member of a semi-nomadic cattle-herding cul-
ture in eastern Africa. Several years ago when Kiok accepted Jesus as his
Savior, he dedicated his life to sharing his faith with other Masai. When a
small group of believers from the village of Nchoroi [n’CHO-roy] invited
him to come and teach in their village, Kiok went.
   Each evening 200 people gathered to hear the message of Jesus.
However, the paramount chief of the region did not want a new religion in
his territory. One night during the meeting the chief angrily confronted the
pastor, waving his large spear menacingly over his head as he approached
the crowd of listeners who were seated on the ground. Most of the listen-
ers fled into the darkness when they saw the chief approaching. The chief,
still brandishing his spear over his head, stared at Kiok and demanded,
“Who are you and what are you telling my people?”
   Kiok prayed for wisdom and protection, and then he calmly answered
the chief’s question. “I am a Masai. I am telling these people about the liv-
ing God, the God who made the mountains, the trees, your animals—even
you and your family.”
   “You have just one chance,” the chief threatened. “Leave now. If you
preach one more time, I will kill you with my spear.”
   “Sir,” Kiok said quietly, “the people have come every day this week to
hear about God. They want to know about the God who created them. I
still have a week of meetings, and I want to invite you to come to listen
and learn about this God too.”
   “I promise you, I will kill you if you preach another night!” the chief
said. Then he turned and strode away.
   The village elders told the chief that they had given Kiok permission to
speak to the people about God. They told him that many who were listen-
ing were changing their lives for the better. They urged the chief to go see
for himself.
   The chief allowed the meetings to continue, and the chief saw the posi-
tive changes among his people. He listened to their testimonies of what
Jesus was doing in their lives. In time the angry chief asked Kiok to study
the Bible with him as well, and in time he and his family were baptized
into God’s family. Today the chief and his people worship in a small chapel
in their village.

Until his death, J. H. Zachary was coordinator for outreach among Jewish and Muslim
people in the North American Division.

Memory Text: “We have sinned, and have committed iniquity,
      and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing
      from thy precepts and from thy judgments” (Daniel 9:5).

              efore continuing here, make sure you understand the charts

      B       we’ve looked at the past few weeks. They form an immovable
              foundation for where we are going next. The crucial point that
      should be understood now is that the judgment scene in Daniel 7 and
      the cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8 are the same event and that
      this event takes place sometime after the 1,260-year period that
      depicted a phase of papal persecution of the saints.
        Meanwhile, considering the time frame for this event, the late eight-
      eenth or early nineteenth century, what’s the only possible sanctuary
      that’s being cleansed here, the one on earth or the one in heaven (see
      Matt. 24:2; Luke 21:6; Heb. 8:1, 2)? The answer is obvious.
        Finally, look at what the Lord has used to frame the important
      teaching of the cleansing of the sanctuary—and that’s massive world
      empires, things as immovable, unchangeable, and verifiable as are
      possible in this world. The Lord isn’t asking us to base our faith on
      sketchy, shadowy things; instead, He’s framing these great truths
      around world history, as firm a foundation as possible. God, obvi-
      ously, wants us to believe these truths; that’s why He makes it easy for
      us to do just that.
        This week we now move to Daniel 9, the final link in this amazing
      sequence of prophecy and history.

     Unfinished Business
Read Daniel 9:1. What major difference appears here in contrast to
     the three previous chapters we have studied so far?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The answer, to some degree, also helps explain what we noticed
     in Daniel 8: that unlike the previous two chapters, Babylon was not
     depicted. Daniel began, instead, with Media-Persia. It seems that already,
     in Daniel 8, the Lord was pointing toward the future, toward the next
     kingdom that would arise, which was Media-Persia.
       It’s also important to notice something about the previous chapters.
     As we saw, Daniel 2 was a dream/vision and an explanation of that
     dream/vision. Everything was explained.
       In Daniel 7, the same thing: a dream/vision and an explanation of
     everything that he was shown.
       In Daniel 8, however, a difference arises: There was a dream/vision
     and an explanation. However, as we saw, not everything was explained.

Review Daniel 8. Again, what was the one thing not explained to
     Daniel in chapter 8?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Unlike the sister visions that preceded it, Daniel 8 ends with Daniel
     saying that he didn’t understand the “vision.” What vision? Obviously,
     it was the part of the vision that dealt with the 2,300 evenings and
     mornings of verse 14. After all, everything else was explained; in
     some cases some of the powers depicted in Daniel 8 were even named
     (vss. 20, 21). In none of the previous visions did Daniel come away
     saying that he didn’t understand something, even though in some
     cases the explanations weren’t as precise as in parts of Daniel 8. Only
     in Daniel 8 does he say there was something that he didn’t understand,
     and that’s obviously the “vision” of the 2,300 days, the only part of
     the chapter not specifically explained.
        Thus, we leave Daniel 8 and enter Daniel 9, with only one thing not
     clear to Daniel at this point: the vision of the 2,300 days in Daniel 8:14.

      A prophet not understanding everything given in a prophetic
      dream or vision? Does this teach us anything that could help us
      better understand the nature of Ellen G. White’s prophetic gift?

                                                                            47

     The Exile of the Jews
       As we see, Daniel is now under the reign of the Medes and the
     Persians, a direct fulfillment of the earlier prophecies of Daniel 2, 7,
     and 8.
       There is, however, a great problem for Daniel. His people are still
     in captivity, the temple is still in ruins, and his nation has not been
     restored.

Read Daniel 9:2. What promise and prophecy is Daniel getting some
     hope from?


       Despite all the hopes of national greatness, the Jewish nation was
     taken into captivity by a pagan power. From a logical perspective, it
     should have been the end of the Jews, and Judah, forever. However,
     the Lord wasn’t through with His people. Though the prophets
     warned about judgment, doom, and destruction, they also gave the
     Jews the great hope of redemption and restoration.

Read Jeremiah 29:10-12. What hope do you believe Daniel derives
     from this prophecy? See also Jer. 25:11, 12.


       According to His promise, the Lord did, indeed, restore His people
     to the land when He said He would. This is recorded most clearly in
     2 Chronicles 36:18-23.

Read those verses in Chronicles. What do they tell us about God and
     His promises?


        The fulfillment of those promises was still a few years off when the
     events of Daniel 9 happened. The 70 years, beginning in 605 B.C. with
     the conquest of Jerusalem and the exile of Daniel and of the other cap-
     tives, almost were completed. Yet, nothing was happening. His people
     were still exiled, Jerusalem was still in ruins, and the temple was not
     even close to being rebuilt. Though Daniel witnessed the rise of the
     Medo-Persians, as predicted, more needed to happen, great events that
     from a human perspective would seem impossible. In this context, we
     can understand better the prayer that follows.

      Daniel was deriving hope from a promise of God. Which prom-
      ises of God are the most meaningful to you? How does prayer
      sustain you as you wait for these promises to be fulfilled?

     “We Have Sinned”
Read Daniel’s prayer in Daniel 9:3-19. On the lines below, summa-
     rize the essence of what Daniel was praying for.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

Numerous points jump out from Daniel’s prayer:
       ●1 Daniel acknowledges the sins of his people; there was no
     excuse on his part to justify their actions. What can we learn from
     this for ourselves?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       ●
       2 Daniel makes it clear that his people’s sin involved turning
     away from God’s Word. What lesson is here for us, as well?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       ●
       3 Even amid all the punishment, sorrow, and judgment, all of
     which was deserved, Daniel appeals to God for mercy, grace, and
     restoration. What hope does this offer us regarding our own mis-
     takes?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        If you read Daniel’s prayer, you’ll notice that one thing is not there.
     You’ll notice that Daniel isn’t asking the Lord one simple question: Why
     did all this happen to us? And that’s because he knows why all this hap-
     pened: The people disobeyed the Lord. Daniel asked no questions in his
     prayer. He is not seeking for light, wisdom, or understanding. In the
     context of what he is talking about, he understands the issues: Israel
     sinned, was punished, and now he pleads for the promised restoration.
        The point is that nowhere in this prayer is Daniel seeking for under-
     standing. The last time, at least as recorded in Scripture, that Daniel
     needed understanding was in regard to the 2,300-day prophecy of
     Daniel 8:14, what he specifically said he didn’t understand at the end
     of the last chapter (Dan. 8:27).
      What, if anything, stands out in Daniel’s prayer that has special
      significance for you in your own walk with the Lord?

                                                                            49

       “Skill and Understanding”
Read Daniel 9:20-22 and look at what happens. After Daniel prayed,
      the angel Gabriel appeared to him. This, however, wasn’t
      Gabriel’s first appearance to Daniel.

When was the last time Gabriel was seen in the book of Daniel? See
      Dan. 8:16.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Remember, too, that in Daniel 8 Gabriel was commanded to make
      Daniel understand what he had seen in vision. And, as we saw, he did
      just that, with the exception of the vision of the 2,300 days.
        Now, however, Gabriel appears again to Daniel, who refers to him
      as the one he had seen “in the vision at the beginning” (vs. 21).
      Though he doesn’t say which specific vision that was, the only other
      time Gabriel appears in Daniel is in chapter 8, so it’s certainly logical
      to assume that’s the vision Daniel is referring 10.

In Daniel 9:20-23, what does Gabriel say to Daniel that he came to do?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         As we saw yesterday, nowhere in Daniel’s prayer did he ask for
      “understanding.” The last time he needed understanding was about
      the 2,300 days. Now, the same angel interpreter appears and specifi-
      cally says that he has come to give him “understanding.”
      Understanding about what? The 2,300 days obviously, the last time
      Daniel needed any understanding.
         In fact, the Hebrew root verb (bin), translated “understood” (Dan.
      8:27), is the same root word that appears in Daniel 9:22, wherein
      Gabriel says that he came to give him skill and “understanding” (from
      bin). Thus, Gabriel comes to Daniel and gives him the “understand-
      ing” (bin) that he didn’t have at the end of Daniel 8!
         Also, notice what kind of prophecy Daniel 8:14 was; it was a time
      prophecy. Right after Gabriel comes to Daniel and offers to give him
      understanding, what kind of prophecy does he give him (see Dan.
      9:24)? Of course, a time prophecy. Clearly, the vision of Daniel 9 is
      linked to part of the vision in Daniel 8, the 2,300 days. While Daniel
      2 and 7 had a vision and complete explanation, Daniel 8 had a vision
      and a partial explanation. In Daniel 9, there was no vision but only an
      explanation—an explanation of what wasn’t explained in Daniel 8.

 “Understand the Vision”
   As if the information from the previous few days weren’t enough to
link Daniel 9:24-27 with Daniel 8:14, the Lord has given us even
more evidence to make that link.
   In Daniel 8:1, 2, Daniel three times makes reference to the “vision”
of the chapter; each time it comes from the same Hebrew word,
hazon: “In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
[hazon] appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
appeared unto me at the first. And I saw in a vision [hazon]; and it
came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which
is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision [hazon], and I was
by the river of Ulai” (Dan. 8:1, 2).
   Daniel then describes what he sees in the hazon: the ram, the goat,
the little horn, and so forth. Hazon, therefore, refers to the general
vision of chapter 8.
   In contrast, when he talks specifically about the 2,300 days, Daniel
uses a different word for vision, mareh. “And the vision [mareh] of
the evening and the morning which was told is true. . . . And I Daniel
fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the
king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision [mareh], but none
understood it” (Dan. 8:26, 27).
   Thus, we have two words for “vision” in Daniel 8: hazon for the
whole vision, mareh for Daniel 8:14, the vision about the 2,300 days
and the sanctuary being cleansed, the part that Daniel didn’t under-
stand (Dan. 8:27).
   Now these two words appear again, in Daniel 9, when Gabriel
appears to Daniel. “Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the
man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision [hazon] at the begin-
ning . . . touched me. . . . At the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art
greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
vision [mareh]” (Dan. 9:21-23).
   Consider what mareh? There’s only one: the mareh of the 2,300 days
that Daniel specifically said he didn’t understand. In fact, the word
translated “consider” comes from bin, which also links this to the
mareh of Daniel 8:26, which Daniel needed understanding (bin)
about.
   Clearly, the explanation of Daniel 9:24-27 is linked to the 2,300
days of the previous chapter. Gabriel came to give Daniel under-
standing about the mareh of the 2,300 days!

 Review the links between Daniel 8 and Daniel 9. Be able to
 defend the position that these two chapters are indeed tied
 together with each other.


                                                                    51

Further Study: Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 345–
     347; Prophets and Kings, pp. 553–556.

        Daniel 8 ends with the mareh of the 2,300 days not explained.
     Gabriel, the same angel interpreter in Daniel 8, appears in Daniel 9
     and tells him to understand the mareh. The only mareh Daniel didn’t
     understand was the mareh of 8:14 and 8:26, which was a time
     prophecy. Then, immediately after telling him to understand the
     mareh, a time prophecy, what does Gabriel give Daniel? Another time
     prophecy.
        No wonder Adventists see a powerful link between the two chap-
     ters and two prophecies. We’re not alone either. The following quote
     comes from an Orthodox Jewish commentary on the book of Daniel.
     Below is the extract on the phrase “consider the mareh” in Daniel
     9:23, though this commentary translates it “gain understanding of the
     vision.” What do these Jews do with the 70-week prophecy?

       “This refers to Daniel’s vision in chapter 8 in which the part which
     disturbed him so (v. 14) is characterized in vs. 16-26 as a mareh.”
     —Daniel, Art Scroll Tanach Series (Brooklyn, New York: Mesorah
     Publications, Ltd., 1988), p. 258.
       Thus, these Orthodox Jews do with the 70-week prophecy exactly
     what we do: that is, they link it to the 2,300 days of Daniel 8:14.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 As a class, review the material studied this week. Make sure
      that everyone understands the links between the two chapters.

      ●2 If you read Daniel’s prayer, you’ll notice that time and again
      he prays in the first person plural, “we” have done this, “we”
      have done that. Why do you think Daniel, who is depicted in
      Scripture as such a faithful, holy character, includes himself as
      one of those who brought this calamity upon his own people?
      What message is there for us, as well?

One Powerful God
Sarah Lovett
   My family worshiped several gods, offering flowers and incense, then
praying to their pictures. But these gods did not hear our prayers.
   My brother became possessed by a spirit and did many cruel and dread-
ful things. Everyone feared him. One day he burned my clothes and
books—everything I owned. When I discovered what he had done, he
struck me repeatedly with a hammer until I lost consciousness. After
spending weeks in the hospital, I went to live with my sister.
   I yearned to find a god who could help my family. Then one day a man
stopped to give us a pamphlet and urge us to try Jesus, the living God who
can hear and answer our prayers. Hope burned in my heart that this Jesus
might be the true and all-powerful God.
   Later an evangelist visited our village. I invited him to come to our
house to study the Bible. I invited our neighbors to hear what he said, and
soon I began worshiping with this evangelist’s followers. I went with the
believers to other villages to pray and preach.
   After some time the evangelist asked me to marry him. We then contin-
ued to work together for God.
   One day we met an Adventist pastor who shared his faith with us. What
he said and the Bible verses he read to us made so much sense that we
wondered why we had not realized these things before. We studied the
Bible with him and could not deny the truths we were learning.
   Alfred and I were baptized, joined the Adventist Church and began
working as Global Mission pioneers. We returned to the people we had led
to Christ and shared our new light with them. Many have accepted these
                             truths and followed us in baptism. In just three
                             years some 250 people have joined us in the
                             Adventist Church.
                                Alfred works with the men, and I work with
                             the women. What a joy to work for the true,
                             the living, the all-powerful God!
                                Thank you for your mission offerings that
                             support lay evangelism around the world.

                             70 Weeks




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Dan. 9:24-27; Ezra 4:7-
      16; 7:6, 7, 11-17.

Memory Text: “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people
      and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an
      end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring
      in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
      prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy”(Daniel 9:24).

            o far, these few points should be clear: The judgment in Daniel

      S     7 and cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8 are the same event,
            and it occurs after the 1,260 years.
        Second, Daniel 8 ended with the vision of the 2,300 days not
      explained. Daniel 9 picks up with the end of Daniel 8: Gabriel offers
      Daniel the explanation he lacked in the previous chapter. Thus, Daniel
      8 and Daniel 9 are one: a vision and a partial explanation (Daniel 8)
      and then the rest of the explanation (Daniel 9).
        This week we continue with Daniel 9, focusing on the amazing 70-
      week prophecy, which provides powerful evidence not only for the
      inspiration of Scripture but for the Messiahship of Jesus, “the
      Messiah the Prince” (Dan. 9:25), who—as the center of the prophecy,
      forms the foundation for the 2,300-day prophecy, as well.

      70 Weeks
        As we saw last week, the vision of Daniel 8:14 was a time prophecy,
      the 2,300 days. Now, in Daniel 9, Gabriel returns and gives him
      another time prophecy, this time of 70 weeks (Dan. 9:24).

Do a little math. Which prophecy is longer, 2,300 days or 70 weeks?


        We are presented with two time prophecies juxtaposed with each
      other, the 2,300 days and the 70 weeks, the 70 weeks being the
      smaller of the two.
                                  70 weeks
                               _____________

                              2,300 days
            ________________________________________________

Read the beginning of Daniel 9:24. How does Gabriel first introduce
      the 70 weeks? What verb does he use?



         Though various translations are used for the verb (root is chatchak),
      such as “determined,” or “decreed,” the basic meaning is that of “cut
      off,” which is how most Hebrew lexicons define it (unfortunately, the
      word doesn’t appear anywhere else in the Bible, so we can’t see how
      it is used elsewhere in Scripture). In Ugaritic, a language similar to
      Hebrew, scholars have noted that the parallel word in that language
      for chatchak means “cut off,” as well. Thus, the basic rendering of the
      text is “70 weeks are cut off.”
         Cut off from what? What else other than from another time
      prophecy? What other time prophecy? Obviously, the mareh, the 2,300
      days of Daniel 8:14, the longer of the two prophecies.
         Thus, we are given two time prophecies: 2,300 days and 70 weeks,
      and the 70 weeks is to be “cut off ” from the 2,300 days.

       Suppose you mention to a neighbor that you have five free
       hours on Sunday. On Sunday the neighbor, after making a
       direct reference to your five free hours, says that he needs some
       help to paint a room. “It will take only an hour,” he adds.
       What’s the immediate implication, and how does that help us
       understand the link between the two time prophecies of Daniel
       8:14 and 9:24?


                                                                           57

      The Messiah the Prince
Read carefully and prayerfully Daniel 9:25. What two specific events
      are directly related to the time element given there? Of those two
      events, which comes at the beginning of that time element, and
      which comes at the end?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Here, in this one verse, 69 of the 70 weeks are accounted for. The
      prophecy begins with the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem,
      and 69 weeks later it ends with “the Messiah the Prince.” Thus, we
      have two historical events to work with: the command to restore and
      rebuild Jerusalem (which would have been of obvious import to
      Daniel) and “the Messiah the Prince.”

When you understand that the Hebrew word for “Messiah” is trans-
      lated in Greek as “Christos,” or Christ, to whom then is this
      prophecy referring to? See Matt. 1:1, 16; 16:16; Acts 3:13-15, 18;
      5:30, 31.

         Thus, we can see here a crucial point: This prophecy is centered on
      Jesus. The first 69 weeks of the prophecy are used to bring us to
      Jesus, “the Messiah the Prince.” We can say, then, that the prophecy
      has its foundation in Christ Himself. To the degree, then, that we can
      have confidence in the messiahship of Jesus, is the degree that we can
      trust the prophecy itself.
         What’s crucial to remember, too, is that Seventh-day Adventists
      hardly are alone in seeing this as a prophecy of Christ. Christians of
      many denominations have long understood this prophecy as being
      one of the most powerful evidences for the messiahship of Jesus
      Christ. After all, we have Daniel, living 500 years before Christ, giv-
      ing us a time prophecy concerning Christ.
       Review other Old Testament prophecies that point to Christ.

      The Decree
        Daniel 9:25 begins with the command to restore and to rebuild
      Jerusalem and ends with the Messiah, 69 weeks later. And though
      people might disagree on exact dates, we know for sure that the com-
      mand to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem was in the sixth or fifth cen-
      tury B.C. and that Jesus lived and died in the first century A.D.

                                    69 weeks

What immediate evidence do you see here for the day-year principle?
      Why can the 69 weeks not be taken as literal time?



        The crucial issue facing us now is, What is that starting date, the
      date of the command to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem? Fortunately,
      as long as we believe that the 69 weeks end with Jesus, we can nar-
      row down the known decrees to only one, the one given in 457 B.C.,
      which was the command by Artaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign
      (see following daily sections).

Look up these texts (Matt. 2:1, 19-22; 27:1, 2; Luke 2:1-7; 3:1-3; 23:1-7).
      Notice all the historical figures tied in with events surrounding
      Jesus; through these (and others) we can reconstruct the dates of
      Christ’s life and ministry.



        With this in mind, let’s look at some of the common dates used for
      the decree in Daniel 9:25.
        Take, for example, 538 B.C. Applying the day-year principle to the
      69 weeks (483 years) would bring “the Messiah the Prince,” Jesus, to
      55 B.C., an impossible date for Jesus.
        The same with another common date, 520 B.C. That starting date
      would bring Jesus to about 37 B.C., an impossible conclusion.
        Finally, the only other common date is 444 B.C., which, if used,
      would place the beginning of Jesus’ ministry about A.D. 39 or 40 and
      His death sometime in the early A.D. 40s. And though that’s much
      closer than the other two options, New Testament scholars know that
      those dates don’t work for Jesus.



                                                                          59

     “Building the Rebellious and Bad City”
       Daniel 9 gives us a prophecy of “the Messiah the Prince,” who we
     know is Jesus. Yet, it ties this important prophecy with a specific his-
     torical date: the command to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem. Would
     Scripture give us such an important prophecy without also providing
     the key to understanding it? Obviously not.

Read Ezra 4:7-16, which deals with events after the end of the
     Babylonian exile of the Hebrew nation. As you read, ask yourself
     these questions:

     ●
     1 To whom is the letter being addressed?




     ●
     2 What is the specific complaint against the Jews?




     ●
     3 According to the letter, who sent, or allowed, the Jews to return
     to Jerusalem in order to do what they were doing?



       Look at what’s happening. Sometime after the Jews returned to
     Jerusalem, a group of Persian officers wrote to King Artaxerxes, com-
     plaining about the Jews rebuilding Jerusalem. In the letter they stated
     two important points: (1) that the city was being rebuilt (Ezra 4:12)
     and (2) that the Jews who were rebuilding had come there because of
     the king. Said the letter, “Be it known unto the king, that the Jews
     which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the
     rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
     joined the foundations” (vs. 12, emphasis supplied). In other words,
     the Jews who were rebuilding the city had come there because of King
     Artaxerxes. He must have issued the decree that allowed them to
     rebuild their city. The question is, What decree was that?

      Despite rebellion and apostasy, God granted mercy and grace to
      the Hebrew nation, though from a human perspective all
      seemed lost. What should this tell us about never giving up on
      anyone, no matter how far he or she has fallen (including our-
      selves)?

      457 B.C.
        Yesterday we saw that the Jews who had returned to Jerusalem were
      rebuilding it. We saw, too, that it was because of King Artaxerxes that
      they had returned to the city. He must have been the one who issued
      the decree “to restore and to build Jerusalem” (Dan. 9:25), for that’s
      exactly what they were doing.
        Interestingly enough, the Bible mentions only one decree issued by
      Artaxerxes that could fit these specifications, and that’s in the seventh
      year of his reign, which can be dated firmly to 457 B.C.

Read Ezra 7:6, 7, 11-17. What is going on here in this decree issued by
      Artaxerxes in regard to what the Jews are doing in Jerusalem?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The book of Ezra is not in chronological order, so the events in
      Ezra 4 came later than what was in chapter 7. And though nothing in
      this decree specifically talks about rebuilding the city, it was obvi-
      ously understood to entail that, because, according to what we read
      yesterday, that’s exactly what the Jews were doing. Both they and their
      enemies understood that the decree, issued by Artaxerxes in his sev-
      enth year, by which the Jews “which came up from thee to us” (Ezra
      4:12), must have included the command “to restore and to build
      Jerusalem.” This is even more obvious because nothing in their letter
      expressed any idea that rebuilding of the city by the Jews was some-
      how in contradiction with the decree of the king.
        Thus, taken together, Ezra 4 and 7 make it clear that the decree,
      dated in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:7, 8) is
      indeed the “commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem” (Dan.
      9:25).
        This, too, can be firmly dated at 457 B.C. (and though some argue
      for 458, the difference entails only a six-month discrepancy).
        Also, if one believed that Jesus were “the Messiah the Prince,” this
      date would work perfectly. In other words, Jesus is our Surety in
      regard to this prophecy.

       Why should Jesus be our Surety in everything regarding our
       faith?


                                                                            61

Further Study: Look at this quote from a famous biography of
     scientist Isaac Newton, a fervent student of the book of Daniel: “Who
     cares whether Newton was correct in maintaining that the prophecy of
     the seventy weeks in the Book of Daniel referred to the interval of 490
     years after Ezra’s leading the Jews from Babylon back to Jerusalem
     (457 BC) to the Crucifixion in AD 33/34?”—A. Rupert Hall, Isaac
     Newton: Adventurer in Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University
     Press, 1992), p. 372.
       “It would seem, therefore, that the rebuilding activity of the city of
     Jerusalem proper (Ezra 4:12) which occurred in the wake of these
     favors, suggests that the royal consent was implied in this decree to
     permit Judah to have a visible center from which the newly granted
     civil and judicial privileges of the state could be administered.
     Consequently, Artaxerxes’ ‘word’ or decree of 457 B.C. provides the
     best commencement date for Daniel’s 70 weeks prophecy and the
     longer time span of the 2300 day-years (Dan 8–9).”—The Seventy
     Weeks, Leviticus, and the Nature of Prophecy, Frank B. Holbrook, edi-
     tor (Washington, D.C.: Biblical Research Institute, 1986), p. 74.
       See also LeRoy E. Froom, The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers, for
     scores of quotes from scholars, using the 457 B.C. starting date. For
     why we choose 457 over 458, see Siegfried H. Horn and Lynn H.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, review everything that we’ve studied so far until
      everyone in the class understands the material.

      ●
      2 Have people in the class talk about how this 70-week
      prophecy, or any other prophecy, has made a significant impact
      in their lives. What can we learn from what they say on how God
      can use prophecy to reach us? How much of a role do you think
      prophecy should play in our witnessing efforts? Is it possible to
      put too much emphasis on prophecy?

Blind, But He Can See
Tiago da Silva
   Tiago had known since childhood that a genetic disorder would eventu-
ally rob him of his eyesight. But he refused to believe that day would
come. However, when he was 12 years old his vision began to cloud. He
could see colors and shapes but could not read letters. Within a few
months his eyesight was gone completely.
   His mother had repeatedly urged him to study Braille in preparation for
his blindness, but he had resisted, feeling that somehow learning Braille
would hasten the day when he would not be able to see. But when his class-
mates grew tired of reading his lessons to him, he could put off learning
Braille no longer. Tiago fought discouragement and trusted in God to get
him through the difficult transition from a sighted world to a sightless one.
   When his classmates ignored him or avoided him, he cried to God for help.
Tiago was especially thankful for a few close friends who never left him.
   When Tiago was 15, a family who lived across the street invited his
mother to attend a stop-smoking clinic in the Adventist church. Tiago’s
mother smoked, and Tiago urged her to stop. She told Tiago that she would
go to the stop-smoking class if he went with her. Although they missed
some meetings, she was able to stop smoking.
   The neighbors then invited Tiago and his mother to attend evangelistic
meetings that followed the stop-smoking seminar. Tiago knew nothing about
Adventists, but he decided to go. They took the Bible study lessons offered
at the meetings, and a teacher came to their house to correct them every day.
   Tiago told his closest friend what he was learning at the evangelistic meet-
ings and invited her to attend with him. Although she hesitated at first, she
went, and afterward she enrolled in a Revelation seminar. After the meetings
ended, Tiago and his mother began attending the Adventist church. Tiago’s
                               father goes with them when he is not working.
                                  Recently Tiago decided to accept Jesus. He
                               shares his testimony: “Young people have
                               many barriers; my barrier is my blindness. But
                               my faith is bringing me a new way of seeing
                               life. If young people would study the Bible
                               and accept the truths they find there, they
                               would have a new way of seeing things too.”

         LESSON             8      *August 12-18



             1844 Made Simple




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Lev. 7:27; 17:10; Luke 3:1-
      22; Rom. 5:8; Gal. 3:13; 1 Thess. 5:9, 10; 1 Pet. 2:24.

Memory Text: “And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in
      twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and
      the rocks rent” (Matthew 27:51).

             o far, we’ve seen that Daniel 8 ended with Daniel needing more

      S      explanation about the 2,300 days. Daniel 9 provides that expla-
             nation. Gabriel, the same angel interpreter in Daniel 8, points
      him directly back to the mareh of Daniel 8, the only part of the vision
      that he didn’t understand. Gabriel immediately gives him another
      time prophecy, the 70 weeks, which is “cut off,” obviously from the
      larger time prophecy of the 2,300 days.
         Unlike the 2,300 days, which doesn’t mention a specific starting
      point, Daniel 9 does have one: the “commandment to restore and
      build Jerusalem,” which we saw last week was issued in 457 B.C.
         Meanwhile, 69 of the 70 weeks of this prophecy reach to “the
      Messiah the Prince,” Jesus. Thus, Jesus Himself forms the center of
      this prophecy; He’s the foundation, the focal point of the 70 weeks. It
      all rests on Jesus, “the chief corner stone” (Eph. 2:20).
         So far, then, the 70 weeks look like this:
                             70 weeks are “cut off”
      457 B.C.                69 weeks                          70th week

     Doing the Math
        Last week we saw that the “commandment to restore and build
     Jerusalem” occurred in the reign of the Persian King Artaxerxes. That
     is, it was issued not during the time of Babylon but after, in the next
     kingdom of Media-Persia.

What kingdom did the prophecy of Daniel 8 start with? How does
     that answer provide another link between Daniel 8 and 9?


       Daniel 9 gives us the exact starting point of the 70-week prophecy,
     457 B.C. It then says that from that point, there will be 69 weeks until
     “the Messiah the Prince.” Sixty-nine weeks comes to 483 days; apply-
     ing, then, the day-year principle means that, from the command to
     restore and rebuild Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince, 483 years
     would pass.

Do the math, counting 483 years from 457 B.C. What date do you get?


        To get at the date, you need to subtract 457 from 483. That comes
     to 26, which would mean A.D. 26. However, we are dealing with a cal-
     ender here and not a straight number line, which goes like this: -2 -1
     0 1 2 3. The calendar, of course, doesn’t have a slot for zero (there’s
     no zero year). The calendar, instead, goes like this: -2, -1, 1, 2, or,
     more specifically, 2 B.C., 1 B.C., A.D. 1, A.D. 2. Thus, with the zero year
     missing on the calendar, 483 years would extend one more year on the
     calendar, coming to A.D. 27 instead of 26.

Read Luke 3:1-22. What major event is portrayed here, and how does
     this help us understand the meaning of the prophecy of Daniel 9?


        The prophecy doesn’t talk about the birth of Jesus; instead, it talks
     about Him as the “Messiah,” the “Anointed,” the Christ; that is, Jesus
     in His official capacity. Luke puts John’s ministry in the fifteenth year
     of the reign of Tiberius, which can be dated to A.D. 27. Seeing that
     John baptized Jesus shortly after John’s own ministry began, we have
     this incredible prophecy, given more than five hundred years earlier,
     pointing to the ministry of Jesus.

      What does the baptism of Jesus say to you about how closely
      Christ relates to humanity? What hope does His close tie to us
      offer us in our daily struggles?

                                                                             65

       Messiah Cut Off
         So far, in our study of the 70-week prophecy (490 years), we’ve cov-
      ered 69 weeks (or 483 of those 490 years). We’ve also looked at two dis-
      tinct historical events that can be accurately dated. See the chart below:

                                    of Jesus)
Study the above chart until the events depicted on it are clear to you.

        Read Daniel 9:26. It says that after the 62 weeks the Messiah will
      be “cut off ”; that’s the 62 weeks that come after the first 7 (see vs.
      25), which means that after this 69th week (A.D. 27) the Messiah will
      be cut off, but “not for himself.”

Look up these following texts (Isa. 53:5; Rom. 5:8; Gal. 3:13; 1 Thess.
      5:9, 10; 1 Pet. 2:24). How do they help us understand what this
      prophecy is talking about?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Up until now, the prophecy covered the first 69 weeks. Verse 26
      now introduces the last week, the final seven years of the prophecy—
      and it does so with an image of Christ’s atoning death. Not only was
      He “cut off ” (a different verb from that used in 9:24), but He was cut
      off “not for himself,” giving the idea that His death was in behalf of
      others. We see here the substitutionary aspect of Christ’s sacrifice:
      His death wasn’t for Himself; it was for us.
         It’s interesting, too, that the verb (krt) used for “cut off ” is directly
      linked with the Levitical sacrificial system, with those who violated
      the covenant being “cut off ” from the people. (See Lev. 7:27; 17:10,
      14; 20:6, 17.) In Daniel 9:26 we see an image of the innocent Jesus
      being “cut off ” for the sins of others.

       What does it mean that no matter what you have ever done, no
       matter how bad you have been, the penalty for those actions has
       been paid by the One who was “cut off,” not for Himself—but
       for you?

               T UESDAY August 15

     In the Midst of the Week
Read Daniel 9:27. Twice it talks about the “week.” What week is it
     referring to?


       So far, we know that the prophecy is talking about Jesus, and that
     69th week brought us to His baptism in A.D. 27. We saw, too, a direct
     reference in verse 26 to His atoning death. After all, that was the rea-
     son He came (Mark 10:45, John 3:14).
       All that’s left of the 70-week prophecy is the final week, the 70th,
     the last 7 years.

What happens in the middle of the last week? What time period is it
     talking about?


        Though verse 26 talked about Jesus’ death somewhat directly, verse
     27 talks about it in the sense of what it accomplished: the end of the
     earthly sacrificial system, at least in the sense that they were of any
     more value (after all, some people today still offer sacrifices). This
     point was made clear in Mark 15:34-39, with the veil of the sanctu-
     ary rent in half, signaling the end of the earthly sanctuary service as
     a legitimate symbol of the ministry of Christ. The real sacrifice was,
     finally, offered; the old system had to give way for a new and better
     one. All that was equated with the old system—the sacrifice, the
     priesthood, and the sanctuary—have been replaced (see Heb. 9:1-15).
        This occurred in the “midst of the week.” That would be three and
     a half years (half of seven). Through counting Passovers in John, we
     can show that it was three and a half years later, in the spring of A.D.
     31, that Jesus was crucified. Thus, our chart now looks like this:
                                70 weeks (490 years)

      What a powerful prophecy for the messiahship of Jesus! Take
      whatever time you need until you understand what this

     The 70th Week
       The last thing we need to look at in the 70-week prophecy is found
     again in Daniel 9:27: “He shall confirm the covenant with many for
     one week.” What week is that? Obviously, it’s the 70th week, the last
     one in the prophecy. If we begin with 457 B.C., then 490 years later
     bring the end of the 70-week prophecy to A.D. 34. Thus, the last week,
     the 70th week, ends at that date.

Daniel 9:27 talks about the “covenant.” What covenant could
     that be referring to? Exod. 19:5, 34:10, Lev. 26:45, 1 Kings 19:10,
     Isa. 59:21, Jer. 50:5.

        Thus, the 70-week prophecy talks about an affirmation of the
     covenant that God made with Israel. He will “confirm the covenant
     with many” during that specific period, obviously referring specifically
     to the Jews who accepted Jesus at that time. Though the prophecy itself
     doesn’t give a specific event for that last year, A.D. 34, many believe it
     was the year that the apostle Paul accepted the gospel and became the
     great preacher to the Gentiles (Acts 9). In other words, Israel’s exclu-
     sivity came to a close, and a new era in salvation history was inaugu-
     rated at the end of the 490 years as the gospel went to all the world.

                               70 weeks (490 years)

Review the above chart until you understand it well enough to

        However fascinating the above prophecy, we must remember that
     it’s just part of a larger prophecy, the 2,300 days. That is, this 70th
     week was, as we saw, “cut off ” from the larger mareh of Daniel 8.
     Thus, we have here two time prophecies, the 2,300 days, which didn’t
     have a specified starting point, and the 70 weeks, which did. We have,
     therefore, the following two time periods:
                                     70 weeks
                     457 B.C.       (490 years)    A.D. 34

      1844 Made Simple
         As we’ve seen, the grounding of the 70-week prophecy is in Jesus,
      and because the 70-week prophecy is just part of the 2,300-day
      prophecy, that prophecy is grounded in Jesus, as well. The next step is
      obvious. The 70 weeks, which have a definite starting point, are “cut
      off ” from the 2,300 days (see tomorrow on why it has to be “cut off ”
      at the beginning as opposed to the end of the 2,300 days).
                                    70 weeks
                     457 B.C.      (490 years)      A.D. 34



                           2,300 days (2,300 years)

Do the math. If you use the 70 weeks as the starting point of the 2,300
      years, what date do you come to?

        If you count 2,300 years from 457 B.C. (remembering to delete the
      nonexistent zero year), you get 1844; or, if you count the remaining
      1810 years from A.D. 34 (2,300 minus the first 490 years), you come
      to 1844, as well. Thus, the cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8:14
      can be shown to start in 1844.

                             2,300 days (2,300 years)
          490 years                        1,810 years
      457 B.C.     A.D. 34                                            1844


Go back to week 5, Friday’s study. We saw from the parallels between
      Daniel 7 and Daniel 8 that the cleansing of the sanctuary (the
      same event as the judgment scene in Daniel 7) had to occur after
      the 1,260-year period in Daniel 7 and yet before the Second
      Coming. How does the calculation done today fit in with that
      study?

         What’s so crucial, too, about the 2,300-day prophecy is that, being
      undeniably linked to the 70-week prophecy, it is inseparably tied in
      with Jesus. Again, one can’t tamper with those dates in any substan-
      tial way without tampering with the dates of Jesus. Jesus Himself is
      the Surety of this prophecy. Obviously, then, the Lord deemed the
      2,300-day prophecy important enough to, in a very real sense, base it
      on Jesus, on the greatest and most precise prophecy concerning His
      earthly mission, the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9.
       Review what we’ve studied this week. Be prepared to talk about
       it in class on Sabbath.
                                                                          69

        However clear it is that the 70 weeks are cut off from the 2,300 days,
     why do we cut them off from the beginning and not the end? The
     answer is because that’s the only way it works logically. If we cut the
     70 weeks off at the end, the 2,300 days would terminate in A.D. 34, an
     impossible conclusion, given the context of Daniel 8, which—paral-
     lel to Daniel 7—links the 2,300 days to the time of the end, and that
     hardly happened in A.D. 34. Plus, too, if you cut them off from the end,
     the beginning of the prophecy would start about sixteen hundred years
     before Babylon, the first kingdom depicted in these prophecies. In
     other words, cutting them off from the end doesn’t work at all, given
     the context in which they appear. Meanwhile, cutting them off at the
     beginning places the start of the prophecy in the reign of Media-Persia,
     which fits the context of the vision (Daniel 8 began with Media-Persia)
     and places their end after the 1,260 years yet before the Second
     Coming, which also fits perfectly with the context of the vision.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, go over what has been studied in the past few
      weeks. Make sure, as much as possible, that everyone under-
      stands what has been covered.

      ●
      2 Why does the date 1844 for Daniel 8:14 show why the sanctu-
      ary being cleansed is the heavenly one, not the earthly?

      ●3 Why do you think is it important for us, as Adventists, to
      understand this prophecy, considering that the event depicted in
      it, the cleansing of the sanctuary, occurred so long ago? What
      does it mean to us as a church today?

      ●
      4 As a class, talk about the implications of the phrase, he was
      “cut off but not for himself.” What hope does that offer to us?
      For whom was He cut off, why, and what does that mean? Talk
      about this too: The 70-week prophecy, a prophecy of the gospel,
      is linked with the 2,300-day prophecy. What does that tell us
      about why the gospel should form the foundation of our under-
      standing of the meaning of the 2,300-day prophecy?

The Empty Pantry
Charlotte Ishkanian
   Worry lines etched Alberto’s forehead. He had a family to feed, but he
had no money. He was a brick maker, but no one was buying bricks. And
those who had ordered bricks had not paid him. One day Alberto’s wife
told him that they would eat the last of their rice that evening. All day
Alberto prayed that God would send buyers for bricks, but no one came.
At dinner the family ate their rice and then asked God to provide food for
the next day.
   The next morning the family again prayed for food. Alberto decided to
ride his bike 12 miles to ask his brother for a loan. Just over a mile from
home, Alberto saw some money lying in the road. He stopped and looked
around. No one seemed to be looking for it, so he picked it up. It was a
50,000 meticais bill (about US$2.00). Rejoicing, he started back home.
On the way he saw another 50,000 meticais bill on the ground.
   His wife was surprised when he returned so soon and even more sur-
prised when he gave her the 100,000 meticais. “Did God send you a cus-
tomer?” she asked.
   “No, God sent us the money. I found it lying on the road.” The couple
called the children, and they thanked God for this gift. Alberto’s wife set
aside a tenth for God’s tithe. Then she went to the market to buy corn, the
cheapest grain available. She pounded it into flour and made porridge for
dinner.
   On Sabbath the family took their tithe to church. During a testimony
time, Alberto shared what God had done for his family, and the church
rejoiced over God’s providence.
                                The following week some people who owed
                              Alberto money for bricks came to pay their
                              debts. With that money the family was able to
                              buy the food and necessities they needed.
                                Alberto and his family love to tell others
                              how God cared for them. Our mission offer-
                              ings help spread the news that there is a God
                              who cares.

         LESSON            9      *August 19-25



            Day-Year Principle




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 34:22; Lev. 12:5;
      Num. 14:34; Deut. 16:10; Ezek. 4:5, 6; Dan. 8:17, 19, 26; 10:2, 3.

Memory Text: “And when thou hast accomplished them, lie
      again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the
      house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a
      year” (Ezekiel 4:6).

              s we saw, the parallel between Daniel 2, 7, and 8 shows how

      A       the judgment in Daniel 7, which leads to the second coming
              of Christ, is the same event as the cleansing of the sanctuary
      (obviously, the heavenly one) in Daniel 8:14. Also this event occurs
      sometime after the 1,260-year period of persecution (late eighteenth
      to early nineteenth century) yet before the Second Coming.
         We saw, too, that the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 was the only
      part of the vision not explained and that Gabriel came to Daniel in
      chapter 9 with that explanation, the 70-week prophecy, which was
      “cut off ” from 2,300 days. This 70-week prophecy, rooted in Jesus,
      formed the basis for the 2,300-day prophecy; it also provided the
      starting date for the 2,300 days, which brought that prophecy to 1844,
      a date that fits perfectly with what we were shown in Daniel 7 and 8.
         Thus, we have the essence of the 1844 prophecy, firmly rooted not
      only in massive world historical empires but in the cross.
         For the next few weeks we’ll look more closely at some of the top-
      ics we only touched on regarding 1844; as we do, we’ll seek to answer
      the most obvious questions that could arise as we study this prophecy
      so crucial to Seventh-day Adventists.

                 S UNDAY August 20

     Prophetic Time
        Over the past few weeks, we looked at three time prophecies: the
     “time, times, and the dividing of time” (Dan. 7:25); the “two thou-
     sand and three hundred days” (Dan. 8:14); and the “seventy weeks”
     (Dan. 9:24). We have worked on the premise that these were not to be
     taken as literal time but as prophetic time and that in each of these
     cases the days were to be interpreted as years.
        Thus we were dealing with periods of hundreds, even thousands, of
     years rather than just periods of a few years if they were understood
     as literal time.
        The question is, What justification do we have in making this
     assumption that these were not literal but prophetic times and that we
     should use the day-year principle while interpreting them?

In   Daniel 8:17, 19, 26, Daniel is told in one way or another that the
     prophetic vision he was given was for the “end.” In fact, he was
     specifically told that the vision concerning “the evening and the
     morning” (the 2,300 days) would be “for many days” (Dan. 8:26).
     Why do these facts help prove that the time prophecy in Daniel 8
     isn’t literal?


Read Daniel 7:24-27. The little-horn power, which arises from pagan
     Rome (a power that ended more than fifteen hundred years ago),
     will exist until the end of the final judgment that brings the end
     of the world. What evidence do we have here that the time
     prophecy in verse 25 should not be taken literally, as well?


        Clearly within both Daniel 7 and Daniel 8 themselves, given the
     context in which they operate (massive world empires that, beginning
     in antiquity and culminating in the end of the world, cover thousands
     of years of history), it hardly makes sense that the major time proph-
     ecies in them would be literal; that is, in the case of Daniel 7 cover-
     ing only three and a half years and in Daniel 8 about six years and
     three months (or 2,300 literal days). These time frames hardly do jus-
     tice to the magnitude of the events depicted in the visions.
        Once, though, the day-year principle is applied, the time prophecies
     make more sense, fitting in much better with the scale of events in
     which they are depicted.

      What evidence do you see that we are living in “the end” that
      Daniel talked about? How should this realization impact how
      we live? What in our lives, if anything, reveals that we truly
      believe we are living in the “end”?

                                                                         73
                M ONDAY August 21

     Daniel 9 and Prophetic Time
Review the 70-week prophecy of Daniel 9:24-27. What internal evi-
     dence do we have that this can’t be taken as literal time?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        As we saw in an earlier lesson, regardless of the dates one used for
     the command to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem and for the ministry
     of Jesus, there were clearly more than seventy literal weeks between
     the two events. Taken literally, the prophecy becomes meaningless.
     How interesting, however, that if the day-year principle is applied, the
     prophecy works perfectly, bringing us right to Jesus. Thus, in a real
     sense, the ministry of Jesus, as revealed in Daniel 9, proves the valid-
     ity of the day-year principle.
        Some people, however, argue that the word for “weeks” in Daniel
     9:24 means “weeks of years,” thus each of those weeks are seven years.
     Therefore, we have 70 “weeks of years,” which comes to 490 years.
        The only problem, however, is that the word translated “weeks” in
     Daniel 9:24 never appears anywhere else in the Bible other than as
     “weeks.” It never means “weeks of years.”

Look up Exodus 34:22; Leviticus 12:5; Deuteronomy 16:10; and
     Daniel 10:2, 3, a few places in the Bible where that basic word
     translated “weeks” appears. What evidence within the texts them-
     selves shows that a week, or weeks, was meant, as opposed to
     “weeks of years”?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In Daniel 10:2, 3 the same word appears as in Daniel 9:24, and it
     obviously doesn’t mean “weeks of years.” (Daniel fasted 3 weeks of
     years, or 21 years?) Also, even if one accepted the error that the word
     in Daniel 9:24 means “weeks of years,” a week of years is still seven
     years, the same number of years as if you used the day-year principle.
     Thus, the day-year principle is so ingrained in the prophecy that a schol-
     arly concoction devised to get rid of the principle only affirms it instead!

      Notice how long the time periods we’re dealing with are: 490
      years, 1,260 years, 2,300 years. How should these long time peri-
      ods help us understand what patience means and how we need to
      trust God when things don’t happen as quickly as we would like?

                T UESDAY August 22

      Seventy Weeks and 2,300 Days
        As we’ve seen, the 70-week prophecy makes no sense if taken lit-
      erally. Once the day-year principle is applied, it brings us right to
      Jesus. Thus, the prophecy itself demands the day-year principle.

Daniel 9:24-27 demands the day-year principle. Now, because
      this prophecy was “cut off” from the 2,300-day prophecy, what
      does that tell us about the day-year principle and the 2,300 days?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The 70-week prophecy comes to 490 years. The 2,300 days, if lit-
      eral, come to a little more than six years. Could 490 years be “cut off ”
      from a little more than six years? Of course not. From 2,300 years?
      Of course. Hence here’s more evidence that the day-year principle
      must be applied to the 2,300-day prophecy, as well. It makes no sense
      to apply the principle to the 70 weeks, which is only part of the 2,300
      days, and not apply it to the 2,300 days, as well.
        No wonder Adventists haven’t been the only ones to use the day-
      year principle for the 2,300 days. One of the greatest Jewish scholars,
      Rashi (A.D. 1040–1105), translated Daniel 8:14 as, “And he said
      unto me, Unto 2,300 years . . .” Not only is this idea not an Adventist
      innovation, it has been used by other scholars on these same proph-
      ecies long before us.

Look up Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:5, 6. Though in and of them-
      selves not proving the day-year principle, what evidence do they
      give for it?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

Look up these texts, all found early in the Bible (Gen. 5:14, 5:23, 9:29).
      What link do they show between days and years in the Bible?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       As we look at all these time prophecies, great prophetic periods
       that have all come and gone, what should this tell us about how
       we use the few precious moments allotted to us in life? What
       changes might you need to make in your own use of time?

                                                                            75
         W EDNESDAY August 23

     More Proof
        Read the question in Daniel 8:13 again. When you do, you realize
     that the word concerning does not appear in the Hebrew, nor does
     Hebrew grammar allow for it. Thus, the question isn’t just about the
     activity of the little horn. Instead, the question is about everything
     depicted in the chapter, which includes the vision about the ram and
     the goat (Media-Persia and Greece), as well as the activity of the little
     horn (pagan and papal Rome). A literal translation would read, “How
     long the vision, the daily, and the transgression of desolation to give
     the sanctuary and the host a trampling.” In other words, the question
     lists everything that happened in the vision. In fact, the word for
     “vision” in verse 13 is hazon, which, as we saw earlier, deals with the
     ram and the goat and the little horn; that is, Media-Persia, Greece, and
     Rome.
        The question, then, could be paraphrased like this, How long will
     all these things, from the rise of Media-Persia, the rise of Greece, and
     finally to Rome’s attack on Christ’s heavenly ministry, be allowed to
     go on?

Read the literal translation of the text given above. Why does this
     show that the 2,300 days cannot be taken as literal time? If literal,
     how could it cover all the events depicted in the question?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The point should be obvious: The 2,300 days must cover all the
     events depicted in the vision of Daniel 8; that is, Media-Persia,
     Greece, Rome, and the sanctuary cleansed. A literal 2,300-day period
     of time does not even begin to cover one of those kingdoms, much
     less all. On the other hand, with the day-year principle, the problem is
     instantly solved. Twenty-three hundred years, rather than a little more
     than six, cover the events in question.

      If you read again the question in Daniel 8, it deals with long
      periods of history that involve persecution, apostasy, suffering,
      all within a long time frame (see vss. 23-25). In the end, though,
      what happens? And not only are we told what happens, through
      these prophecies we are told when they will happen. Why should
      these texts give us the hope that regardless of present circum-
      stances, God will end it all and bring all things to His glory?
      How should this realization give you strength and courage to
      remain faithful regardless of your circumstances?

     Day-Year Principle
Skim over the vision and the interpretation in Daniel 7. Why do all
     those symbols help us understand why the time element in the
     vision should be symbolic, as well?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Daniel 7 is a chapter filled with all sorts of symbols, or images, that
     are not to be taken literally. Thus, why should we take the prophetic
     time given in it as literal, when almost everything else is symbolic?

Read Daniel 8. In the same vein as the last question, what evidence
     do we have that the time period here should be viewed as sym-
     bolic, not literal, as well?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Daniel 8 is no more about flying goats (vs. 5) than Daniel 7 was
     about beasts with iron teeth (vs. 7). Instead, these were symbolic; in
     the same way, the time periods given were symbolic, as well.
       In fact, of the three time periods we’ve been looking at—the “time,
     times, and the dividing of time” (Dan. 7:25); the “two thousand and
     three hundred days” (Dan. 8:14); and the “seventy weeks” (Dan.
     9:24)—none is written in the common way that time is expressed. For
     example, instead of saying 2,300 days, why didn’t Gabriel say that the
     sanctuary would be cleansed in “six years, three months, and twenty
     days”? In 2 Samuel 5:5, the text says that the king “reigned over
     Judah seven years and six months” as opposed to 2,700 days. It’s the
     same with the two other time prophecies: None is expressed in the
     common way that time is expressed.

Read Luke 4:25 and James 5:17. Compare them with Daniel 7:25.
     Which ones were dealing with literal time, and how was that literal
     time expressed in contrast with the one expressing prophetic time?

      Given what we’ve studied, why is the day-year principle so
      important to us as Adventists? What would happen to our
      whole prophetic foundation were this principle thrown out?

                                                                           77

Further Study: Scholars also have shown evidence for the link
     between days and years in Hebrew poetry, where days are used in par-
     allel to years, showing a semantic link between the two time periods:

                      “Are thy days as the days of man?
                    Are thy years as man’s days.” —Job 10:5

                  “Days should speak, and multitude of years
                     should teach wisdom.” —Job 32:7

                     “I have considered the days of old, the
                     years of ancient times.”—Psalm 77:5

       In each of these cases, days and years were saying basically the
     same thing; that is, they were different words used to convey the same
     idea. Though these parallels don’t prove, in and of themselves, the
     day-year principle, they do show that in the Hebrew mind, days and
     years were linked.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, go over this week’s lesson until everyone is
      grounded in the validity of the day-year principle.

      ●
      2 As a class, answer this question: Why does the Bible employ so
      many symbols? What might be the reason for the use of symbols?

      ●
      3 What other evidence can one find in the Bible for the day-year
      principle?

      ●4 Think about this: We have been here almost two thousand
      years since the death of Christ. How do these time prophecies, as
      understood through the day-year principle, help us realize that
      we are indeed living near the end and that we shouldn’t expect
      another two thousand years to pass before Christ returns? That
      is, how do these prophecies help us understand where we are in
      the history of the world and why we should know that Christ’s
      coming is near?

  Jeofelo’s Change of Plans
Jeane Zachary
   Jeofelo was determined to lead a better life than his parents. They had
worked hard to feed their five children, and life in the Philippines was dif-
ficult for them. Jeofelo studied hard and did well in school. While in high
school he joined a Christian youth group. A visiting church leader noticed
his energy and alertness and invited him to participate in church services
and to consider training to become a clergy.
   Jeofelo accepted the invitation and enrolled in a seminary. When he
finally graduated, he basked in the pride of his family. Over the next four
years he served several congregations.
   One day he visited an optometrist to get a new pair of glasses. The
young optometrist impressed him with her kindness. He wanted to get to
know her better.
   Jeofelo learned that the young optometrist was a Seventh-day Adventist
Christian, but he did not care. He was determined to marry her. Finally she
accepted, provided she would be free to retain her faith. The couple agreed
that they each would retain their beliefs; their children would worship with
their mother.
   A friend gave Jeofelo a book called From Sabbath to Sunday. But he
was determined not to read it.
   One day while riding his motorcycle, he collided with a farm vehicle
and was seriously injured. He spent weeks in the hospital and two months
at home. While recovering, he saw the book lying on a shelf. With little
else to do, he began reading it. He was impressed with the careful schol-
arship and began to check each point with the Bible. Finally he had to
admit that Saturday was truly the Sabbath of the Lord. But he refused to
follow what he had learned. He had worked too long and too hard to earn
his clergy title.
   Within the next two years Jeofelo wrecked two more vehicles. After the
third accident he concluded that God was protecting him for a reason. He
picked up his Bible and let it fall open. His eyes fell on Matthew 16:26:
“What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits
his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?” (NIV).
   Convinced that God was speaking to him, he asked his wife to call her
pastor and invite him to study with him. Within a few months he gave up
his title and accepted his position as a child of God.

Jeofelo is studying to become a Bible teacher; Jeanne Zachary lives in California.

        LESSON           10 *August 26–September 1
      Rome and Antiochus




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 55:11; Matt. 13:10-
      13; Luke 2:1; Luke 21:20, 21; John 11:48; John 16:12; 2 Pet. 1:19.
Memory Text: “And it came to pass in those days, that there
      went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should
      be taxed” (Luke 2:1).
             he subject of the sanctuary was the key that unlocked the mys-

      T      tery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete
             system of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God’s
      hand had directed the great advent movement and revealing present
      duty as it brought to light the position and work of His people. As the
      disciples of Jesus after the terrible night of their anguish and disap-
      pointment were ‘glad when they saw the Lord,’ so did those now
      rejoice who had looked in faith for His second coming.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Great Controversy, p. 423.
         Indeed, the 1844 pre-Advent judgment is a crucial doctrine of the
      Adventist Church; not only does it explain the disappointment of 1844,
      it helps us understand who we are today and why we exist as a move-
      ment. With so much at stake, our enemy is constantly at work to under-
      mine us, and if he can undo our belief in 1844, he will greatly succeed.
      Thus, it is important that we as Adventists be firmly rooted in this
      teaching, as well as be prepared to answer challenges against it.
         This week we’ll continue to look at more Bible texts that will help
      solidify us in our understanding of this key teaching, which, when
      properly understood, reveals to us in grander light the wonderful sav-
      ing grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in view of what He has done for us
      at the Cross and is doing for us now in heaven.

      Rome in the New Testament
        So far, we’ve been dealing with a span of empires, beginning with
      Babylon and ending with God’s kingdom. We noticed that of the five
      kingdoms revealed, four were named. The only one not named was
      Rome, both in its pagan and papal stages, even though in most of the
      prophecies more time was spent describing Rome than any other
      kingdom.
        Though Rome itself might not have been mentioned by name in the
      Old Testament, its existence and power dominated the New. The
      Gospels, the book of Acts, and the Epistles all unfold in a Roman
      environment. Daniel mentions by name Babylon, Media-Persia,
      Greece, and God’s final kingdom, while the New Testament openly
      names Rome, the power that arises after Greece and dominates the
      world during the time of Christ and afterward.

Look up these texts (Matt. 22:17, Luke 2:1, Luke 3:1, John 11:48, Acts
      25:21). Which empire is clearly depicted as the dominant power?


        Notice in Luke 2:1 that “all the world” should be taxed. Only a
      world power could tax all the world. How interesting, too, that Daniel
      7:23 says that the fourth beast will “devour the whole earth”; that is,
      the fourth beast is obviously a world empire, such as Rome.

Read Matthew 24:15 and Luke 21:20, 21. What event is Jesus talk-
      ing about here?


         In the context of the destruction of Jerusalem, by the Romans, Jesus
      linked the Roman Empire to the book of Daniel. Jesus, therefore, not
      only points to Rome but places it within Daniel itself. Phrasing linked
      to “the abomination of desolation” spoken of by Jesus, in reference to
      Daniel, occurs three times in Daniel (Dan. 9:27, 11:31, 12:11). Thus,
      Jesus links the Roman Empire to Daniel, making it even more obvi-
      ous that Rome is that great power that arises in Daniel 2, 7, and 8,
      after Greece and extends to “the end.”
         Though Daniel doesn’t name Rome, the New Testament does. Thus,
      following the Protestant formula of the Bible being its own inter-
      preter, we find all four empires depicted in Daniel named in the Bible.

       Look at how clear and unambiguous these prophecies are. How
       could the Lord have made it any easier for us to believe? And
       yet, we so often struggle with faith. Why is that so, and what
       things can you do on a daily basis to help keep away doubt?


                                                                          81

     The Two Little Horns
       In both Daniel 7 and Daniel 8, a little-horn power figures promi-
     nently. A comparison of their characteristics not only shows that they
     are the same power but helps fortify our position on just what that
     power is. A lot of information is given about these little horns, more
     details about them than any of the other major kingdoms depicted.
     This should tell us two things: (1) These little horns obviously sym-
     bolize an important power in the prophetic history of the world, and (2)
     the Lord wants us to know for sure just what power these represent.

Below we will look at similarities between the two little horns. As
     you study these characteristics and similarities, think about how
     these characteristics help affirm us in our interpretation of this
     power:

       1. Both are depicted by the same symbol, a horn (Daniel 7:8, 20;
     8:9).

       2. Both are persecuting powers (Dan. 7:21, 25; 8:10, 24).

       3. Both are self-exalting and blasphemous (Dan. 7:8, 20, 25;
     8:10, 11, 25).

       4. Both target God’s people (Dan. 7:25, 8:24).

       5. Both have aspects of their activity delineated by prophetic
     time (Dan. 7:25; 8:13, 14).

       6. Both extend until the time of the end (Dan. 7:25, 26; 8:17, 19).

       7. Both will be supernaturally destroyed (Dan. 7:11, 26; 8:25).

       When you have two powers represented by the same prophetic sym-
     bol and who carry out the same basic actions in the same time slot in
     the flow of visions, it seems more than obvious that we are talking
     about the same power. Also, considering the descriptions of this
     power, the burden of proof lies heavily on those who interpret this
     power as anything other than Rome.

      What Bible prophecies have been especially helpful in estab-
      lishing your faith? Why not review them again? The more you
      go through them, the more they will encourage you. Why not
      share them with someone who might need some encouragement
      now?

     The Rome Factor
        However obvious the identification of that final earthly power, the
     question arises, Why wasn’t it named? How much easier it would be
     and how much futile and false speculation would have been saved had
     it simply been named as were Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and
     God’s final kingdom. As mentioned earlier (see lesson 3), some claim
     that Rome wasn’t named because Daniel simply recounted history
     that already happened as opposed to predicting it before it unfolded.
     In other words, the accounts of the lions’ den, the fiery furnace, and
     the dreams and visions were fables. As we’ve already seen, that’s a
     false and bankrupt idea.

Read the following texts (Dan. 12:4, 9; Matt. 13:10-13; Luke 10:24;
     John 16:12; 2 Pet. 1:19). What idea is conveyed here about the tim-
     ing in which the Lord reveals certain truths to His people?

     __________________________________________________________________

     __________________________________________________________________

        As the above texts show, God doesn’t reveal all truth to all people at
     once. Light is often given in a progressive manner; more and more
     truth unfolds in accordance with God’s perfect timetable.
        Maybe, then, Rome isn’t directly named not because Daniel wasn’t
     able to tell the future but because the Lord knew that Rome would be
     in sole control of the Scriptures for centuries and that had the leaders
     in Rome seen the empire distinctly named, particularly in such a bad
     light, they could have destroyed the Scriptures or the book of Daniel.
     As it was, not sure what it was talking about, they could give the text
     identities other than itself. Meanwhile, the Lord kept that identity hid-
     den, knowing that He would at the right time raise up people, the
     Protestant Reformers, who would discover the true identity of the
     little-horn power. (Daniel does say that his words would be “closed up
     and sealed till the time of the end” [Dan. 12:9].) Many of the
     Reformers did, indeed, see Rome in that role!
        In fact, Jews who lived during the time of the Roman Empire would
     often interpret these same prophecies like this: Babylon, Media-Persia,
     Greece, and—Edom. Why Edom? Because, afraid of the Romans, the
     Jews hid the interpretation, something that the Lord in His divine prov-
     idence and foresight did hundreds of years earlier in Daniel itself.

      What lessons can we learn here about how we need to deal deli-
      cately with people? In our zeal to be honest, how can we also be
      prudent and not say things, though perhaps true, that others
      might not yet be ready to hear?

                                                                           83

      The Date of Daniel
        “In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
      appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
      appeared unto me at the first” (Dan. 8:1).

According to the above text, at what time in history did the
      prophet Daniel live?

      __________________________________________________________________

      __________________________________________________________________

        As we’ve seen, the prophecies in Daniel provide powerful evidence
      not only for the existence of God but for the validity of the Scriptures
      as God’s Word. Thus, from the earliest days of the Christian church,
      opponents have sought to undermine, even destroy, confidence in the
      Scriptures, especially the prophecies. As we said earlier, one attempt
      was to claim that Daniel was not written in the time frame in which it
      places itself but many centuries later, a position we as Seventh-day
      Adventists emphatically reject. Unfortunately, we are among a small
      number of Christians who do so.

Read the following texts: Daniel 1:1, 2:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1. In what time
      frame does the book of Daniel date itself? What conclusion can one
      draw about the position of those who, despite this clear testimony,
      nevertheless insist that the book of Daniel was written many cen-
      turies later? See also Isa. 55:11, Mark 15:28, John 17:17, Acts 1:16.
      __________________________________________________________________

      __________________________________________________________________

         Directly tied with this attempt to date the book of Daniel centuries
      after it dates itself is the attempt to link the identity of the little horn
      in Daniel 8 with an ancient Greek ruler named Antiochus Epiphanes.
      Most students today accept this interpretation; almost any modern
      commentary will use that interpretation. As we’ll see, it cannot pos-
      sibly be correct. Many who accept this interpretation do so not realiz-
      ing the rationale behind it, which is that Daniel was not written when
      it says it was but much later. Either way, because this view is preva-
      lent, we need to look at it.

       What are other ways in which our faith in the Scriptures can be
       undermined, either overtly or subtly? More important, what steps
       can you take to defend yourself against anything that can, bit by
       bit, weaken your trust in the veracity and inspiration of the Bible?

             T HURSDAY August 31

      Antiochus
Read Daniel 8:5-8, the vision of the he-goat, and then Daniel 8:21, 22,
      Gabriel’s interpretation of the he-goat. According to the
      prophecy, what was the fate of the he-goat?


        History bears testimony to the amazing accuracy of this prophecy.
      The he-goat, of course, was ancient Greece, and after the death of
      Alexander the Great, the empire split apart, for a time, into “four king-
      doms” (Dan. 8:22) under four generals. One of the kingdoms was the
      Selecuid, which lasted from about 301 B.C. until about 146 B.C. Among
      these kings, one was named Antiochus Epiphanes. He was the eighth
      Selecuid king (175–164 B.C.); twenty more followed after him. Through
      the conquests of his predecessors, he, for a short while attained control
      of Judea, defiled the temple in Jerusalem for about three years, and per-
      secuted the Jews. He died, apparently from natural causes, in a later
      campaign (164 B.C.) after being driven out of Jerusalem. He is the one
      who most interpreters believe is the little horn.

        1. The Medo-Persian ram became “great” (vs. 4); the Grecian
      goat “very great” (vs. 8); the little horn became “exceeding great”
      (vs. 9). How does this description and comparison of empires
      automatically disqualify Antiochus as the little horn?


         2. According to Daniel 8:17, 19, 26, the prophecy dealt with end-
      time things, and the little horn was the last power presented in the
      vision. Because he died in 164 B.C., why can Antiochus not be the
      little horn?


        3. According to Daniel 8:25, the little horn would be “broken
      without hand,” a phrase we saw earlier that—through parallelism
      with Daniel 2:34, 45—depicted a supernatural, cataclysmic
      destruction. Why, given what’s written above about his demise,
      does Antiochus not fit again?


       Despite the evidence (and there’s more) against Antiochus,
       Adventists are almost alone in the Christian world in our posi-
       tion opposed to that interpretation. What does this tell us about
       our need to stand firm in our beliefs, despite a majority of
       voices against our position? In what other ways do you have to
       stand firm for a position that is not popular?

                                                                            85
                  F RIDAY September 1

Further Study: Another attempt to make the impossible fit of
     Antiochus centers around the argument concerning the origin of the
     little horn in Daniel 8:8, 9. “Therefore the he goat waxed very great:
     and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came
     up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. And out of one
     of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward
     the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.” Arguing
     for Antiochus, some say that the little horn arose from one of the “four
     notable ones,” meaning the nations that arose after the death of
     Alexander the Great. That would be, they claim, Antiochus, not
     Rome.
        The argument falls apart on a few grounds. First, the word them in
     the last phrase of verse 8 refers not to “four notable ones” but “four
     winds of heaven.” Immediately after, the text says that out of “one of
     them” came forth a little horn. One of what? The closest phrase is “the
     four winds of heaven,” the obvious choice. (Some argue that horns
     grow out of horns, not winds, though when was the last time anyone
     ever saw a horn grow out of another horn?)
        Second, Hebrew grammar, with feminine and masculine nouns,
     works very well linking the “one of them” with the “four winds of
     heaven”; it doesn’t work at all linking it with the “notable ones.”
        Finally, even if that argument about origins had some validity, the other
     factors would show the impossibility of the Antiochus interpretation.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Why are these issues so important? What difference does it
      make? As a class, discuss this point: If, for instance, the little-
      horn power were Antiochus, then the whole prophecy of Daniel 8

Standing for God
Charlotte Ishkanian
   In some parts of western Africa, choosing to convert to Christianity in
these areas can be, literally, a matter of life and death. Amo* is a Fulani,
part of a semi-nomadic tribe of cattle herders. One evening as he walked
through his village, he heard someone speaking through a loud speaker.
Curious, he approached the source of the broadcast and found a few peo-
ple listening to a man talking about Jesus. Amo kept his distance, know-
ing that even being seen near a Christian could mean trouble. But the
speaker’s message drew him to listen, so he stood a safe distance away and
absorbed the speaker’s message. That message touched off a battle for
Amo’s heart.
    Every night the Global Mission pioneer presented a message of God’s
love. When he spoke about the Sabbath, Amo was surprised, for he had
discovered references to the Sabbath in his religion’s holy book. He
wanted to ask a religious teacher about it, but he feared the consequences.
However when he listened to the pioneer describe the Sabbath, he was
thrown into turmoil. He remembered that his holy book pronounces a
curse on Sabbath breakers. But he knew of no faithful follower of his reli-
gion who kept the Sabbath. What should he do?
   When the pioneer invited those who would follow God and keep His
Sabbath to come forward, Amo stepped out of his hiding place and walked
to the front of the crowd. He knew that his decision could cost his life, but
he felt an unspeakable inner peace.
    Your mission offerings help share the good news about Jesus in diffi-
cult areas such as Amo’s country.

        LESSON            11 *September 2-8
             The Sanctuary and the
                     Little Horn


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 27:20; 29:42;
      Num. 4:7; 28:6; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:24-27; 8:1-5; 9:1-14, 24.

Memory Text: “Now of the things which we have spoken this is
      the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand
      of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanc-
      tuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not
      man” (Hebrews 8:1, 2).

          n the past few weeks, we have seen the emphasis that Daniel 8 has

      I   placed on the little horn. Obviously, it’s an issue of great impor-
          tance, considering the prominence given not only to its description
      but also to its explanation later in the chapter.
         This week we’re going to look even more closely at the little horn,
      focusing specifically on its attack against the “prince of the host,” the
      “daily,” and “the place of his sanctuary.”
         We’re going to see, too, how central the idea of the heavenly sanc-
      tuary is to the chapter, for it’s only in the context of the heavenly sanc-
      tuary and its services that we can get a better understanding of the lit-
      tle horn’s assault.
         This week’s study also will help set the foundation for what will
      come later: a deeper look at the role of the sanctuary, and particularly
      its cleansing, in the context of the gospel and the entire plan of salva-
      tion, which, of course, leads into the great hope for all Christians
      everywhere: the second coming of Jesus.

      “Even to the Prince of the Host”
Read Daniel 8:9-12, which focuses on the activity of the little horn.
      What are the specific things, according to the text, that the little-
      horn power does?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         In an earlier lesson (week 5), we noticed how the direction of the
      little horn’s activity had shifted, first from a horizontal direction
      (vs. 9), which depicted a military or political expansion, to a vertical
      one (vss. 10-12), which revealed a religious dimension. This, we said,
      showed the two phases of Rome, first pagan, then papal.

Look again at the description of the little horn’s activities in verses
      10-12. These actions, obviously, aren’t to be taken literally but
      symbolically. Without attempting to understand each symbol,
      what kind of action is being portrayed here? What kind of attack
      is the little horn launching?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Look at some of the key words seen in this attack: “host” (Neh. 9:6,
      Luke 2:13); “heaven” (Matt. 6:1, Heb. 9:24); “prince” (Isa. 9:6, Dan.
      12:1, Acts 3:15, 5:31); “daily” (Num. 4:16, 28:24, 29:6); “sanctuary”
      (Exod. 25:8; Heb. 8:1, 2); “truth” (Job 9:2, John 14:6, 1 Tim. 2:4,
      James 5:19). All these words, filled with religious and spiritual mean-
      ing, are what come under attack by the little horn. Thus, more than
      anything else, it’s the religious attack by the little horn that plays great
      prominence here, and that’s the focus of the vision. The Lord wants us
      to see the religious dimension of the little horn and that its activities
      are in a religious sphere. This activity is seen again in the explanation
      in Daniel 8:23-25, in which the little horn specifically is said to
      persecute “the mighty and the holy people,” as well as to stand up
      against “the Prince of princes.”

       In your own experience, what are the ways that your faith and
       beliefs have come under attack? Which has been the greatest
       challenge to you? What has been your most effective means of
       defense?



                                                                               89

      The Sanctuary
Compare the kind of beast-symbols found in Daniel 7 and in
      Daniel 8. What great difference do you see between them?


        Not only are the beasts in Daniel 8 sanctuary animals, they are
      among the animals used on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). This
      provides the first link to the book of Leviticus, which spends more
      time dealing with the sanctuary service than any other book in the Old
      Testament.

Read again Daniel 8:10-12 (see also vss. 13, 14). What is the center of
      the little horn’s attack?


         It’s clear that the sanctuary is under attack.
         First, the little horn takes away the “daily.” The Hebrew word trans-
      lated “daily” (tamid) also means “continual,” or “perpetual,” and it is
      used numerous times in direct reference to the day-by-day ministry of
      the priests in the first apartment of the earthly sanctuary service. This,
      then, is an unmistakable reference, not only to the sanctuary service
      but to the daily ministry in that service (see Exod. 27:20, 29:42, Num.
      4:7, 28:6).
         In Daniel 8:11, it said that the “place” or the “foundation” of His
      sanctuary was cast down. That word place is found in numerous texts,
      all in reference to the sanctuary, or to God’s dwelling place, which
      also has a link to the sanctuary (Exod. 15:17, 1 Kings 8:13, 2 Chron.
      6:2, Isa. 18:4).
         Then there are, of course, the references to the “sanctuary” itself,
      found not only in verse 11 but also in verses 13 and 14. These verses
      alone show clearly how the sanctuary, which was the earthly model of
      the plan of salvation, was under attack.

Given the time frame of this phase of the little horn, which arose
      around the fifth century A.D., why can this not be an attack on the
      earthly sanctuary?


        Because the earthly sanctuary had been destroyed in A.D. 70, this
      was an attack on the heavenly sanctuary. The little horn, of course,
      would not get into heaven, so this, instead, would have been an attack
      on all that was symbolized by the sanctuary, which is the plan of sal-
      vation. Thus, the little horn attacks not only God’s people but the plan
      of salvation, as well.

     The Attack
       Daniel, more than five hundred years before Christ, is shown in
     vision the essence of Rome’s later attack on “the truth,” which it cast
     “to the ground” (Dan. 8:12). Among other things, the little horn
     waxes great, even against the “Prince of the host,” Jesus.

At the time of Rome’s attack, where was Christ, and what was He
     doing? Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:24-27; 8:1-5; 9:11-14, 24.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The little horn, as we saw, waxed great, even to the “Prince of the
     host,” who is obviously Christ. Its attack, too, centered against not just
     the people of God but against the sanctuary and its foundation and
     services, in this case, specifically, the “daily” service.
        It’s very important to keep in mind that Christ, “the Prince of the
     host,” is now ministering for us in the heavenly sanctuary, which is
     under attack by the little horn. Again, the language was symbolic; the
     little horn didn’t actually get into heaven, any more than it physically
     cast the “truth” or the “place of his sanctuary” to the ground.
        Thus, this attack by the little horn was also an attack on the plan of
     salvation, which began with the death of Christ (symbolized by the
     death of the animals in the sanctuary service), and which was fol-
     lowed by Christ’s high-priestly ministry (symbolized by the ministry
     of the priesthood in the earthly service). Everything symbolized by
     that sanctuary has come under attack by the little horn.
        How did it do this?
        Christ is now our High Priest, interceding for us in the heavenly
     sanctuary. A careful study of the Roman system shows how the entire
     structure of the church, with its priesthood, mediation, and mass,
     usurps everything that Christ has done for us or is doing for us now.
     Everything that we as believers would attribute directly to God and
     Christ has been commandeered by the Roman Church itself, which
     according to the text “magnified itself ” (Dan. 8:11, RSV), even to
     Christ Himself (see Friday’s lesson).

      What is the role of the organized church in the plan of salva-
      tion? How can you be an active participant in helping the
      church fulfill its role? At the same time, what are the limits of
      what the church can do for you in your walk with the Lord?




                                                                            91

      The “Daily”: Part 1
        As you read about the little horn’s attack in Daniel 8:10-12 on the
      sanctuary, it says specifically that the little horn took away “the daily.”
      Though many translations in English supply the word “sacrifice” or
      “burnt offerings,” the text does not say that. Though this addition
      shows that translators were able to see the clear link with the sanctu-
      ary, the added word is not warranted. The word “daily” (see Monday’s
      lesson) dealt not just with the daily sacrifices but with the entire daily
      operations of the earthly sanctuary.

What part of the “daily” service (translated as “always,” “continual,”
      “perpetual”) is depicted in each of these texts? Also, in what part
      of the sanctuary are most of these activities taking place?

      Exod. 25:30
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Exod. 27:20
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Exod. 30:8
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Lev. 6:13
      ____________________________________________________________________

        In these texts, the word tamid (translated “daily” or “the daily” in
      Daniel 8:11) modified each of these activities. Thus, though the tamid
      included the sacrifices, it included the day-by-day ministrations of the
      priesthood, which, according to the book of Hebrews, was just an
      “example and shadow of heavenly things” (Heb. 8:5). Those heavenly
      things, of course, were the spiritual realities of Christ’s high-priestly
      ministry; all these earthly activities, these shadows, were simply sym-
      bols of Christ ministering in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf.
      Again, this is what has come under attack by the little horn.
        Also notice, too, that these activities centered around the first apart-
      ment of the earthly sanctuary. The bread, the lampstand, and the
      incense were all in the first apartment; the sacrifice, of course, was at
      the altar outside it.
        The important point, which will be seen later, is that none of the
      activities had anything to do with the Most Holy Place, the second
      apartment, which the high priest entered only once a year, when the
      sanctuary was cleansed.

       What kind of “daily,” or “continual” activities are so important
       for your own spiritual growth? Why is the fact that they are
       done “daily” so important for that growth?


92
              T HURSDAY September 7

      “The Daily”: Part 2
         The earthly sanctuary service was a model of the heavenly; the sac-
      rifices and the ministry of the priesthood were types, figures, mini-
      prophecies, as it were, of the death and high-priestly ministry of Jesus.

What does Hebrews 9:1-14 teach about the relationship between the
      earthly service and the heavenly one?


         Students of the sanctuary service know that besides the daily min-
      istration in the first apartment, once a year the high priest entered into
      the Most Holy Place to perform the “cleansing of the sanctuary” (see
      Leviticus 16). Because this happened only once a year, it’s often
      called “the yearly,” to contrast it with “the daily.” Hence, the entire
      sanctuary service could be placed broadly in two categories: the daily,
      first-apartment ministry, and the yearly, second-apartment ministry,
      during which the sanctuary was cleansed.
         We’ve seen, too, that the little horn attacks the heavenly sanctuary,
      which was an attack on the plan of salvation itself. This, we believe,
      refers to the entire Roman Catholic system, which has usurped the
      role and prerogatives of God and Christ in the plan of salvation (see
      Friday’s lesson).
         Now, an important question: Why was just the daily service, the
      tamid, specified as the object of the little horn’s attack? Why did the
      vision emphasize only one aspect of the sanctuary service, as opposed
      to both?

Read Daniel 8:14. How does this text help answer the above questions?

        The little horn was able to attack only the “daily” because the
      “yearly,” the second-apartment ministry, which occurred when the
      sanctuary was cleansed, wasn’t in operation then. Not until the end of
      the 2,300 years, 1844, was the sanctuary to be cleansed and the
      “yearly” began.
        Thus, in Daniel 8, both phases of Christ’s high-priestly ministry
      appear: “the daily,” which comes under attack by the little horn, and
      “the yearly,” which commences at the end of the 2,300 days. Both are
      brought to view in this chapter.

       Imagine if every time you sinned, you had to sacrifice an inno-
       cent animal. What kind of lessons would that teach you about
       sin? Contrast the death of a goat to the death of the Son of God.
       What does His death tell us about the cost of sin? How seriously
       do you take sin in your own life?

                                                                             93

Further Study: Below are quotes, all taken from the Catechism of
     the Catholic Church (New York: Doubleday, 1995). As you read, keep
     in mind Daniel 8:11, 12 and the little horn’s usurpation of what
     belonged only to God and Christ.
        “The power to ‘bind and loose’ connotes the authority to absolve
     sins. . . . Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through the min-
     istry of the apostles.”—No. 553.
        “As sacrament, the Church is Christ’s instrument. ‘She is taken up
     by him also as the instrument for the salvation of all,’ ‘the universal
     sacrament of salvation.’ ”—No. 776.
        “It is in the Church that ‘the fullness of the means of salvation’ has
     been deposited.”—No. 824.
        “Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the
     Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation.”—No. 846.
        “The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She
     bears in herself and administers the totality of the means of salva-
     tion.”—No. 868.
        “There is no offense, however serious, that the Church cannot for-
     give.”—No. 982.
        “Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would be no
     hope of eternal life. Let us thank God who has given his Church such
     a gift.”—No. 983.
        “By Christ’s will, the Church possesses the power to forgive the sins
     of the baptized.”—No. 986.
        “Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high priest, contin-
     ues the work of our redemption in, with, and through His Church.”
     —No. 1096.
        “Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accordance with the
     Lord’s will, it is necessary for salvation, as is the Church herself,
     which we enter by Baptism.”—No. 1277.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 How do these quotes help us better understand the little
      horn’s usurpation of what belongs only to God?

      ●2 As a class, discuss the question at the end of Tuesday’s lesson.
      What is the role of the church in the plan of salvation; what are
      the limits in what it can do for us? Why is the church a means to
      an end but not an end in itself?

The Strange Illness
Irina Polushkina
   Irina grew up in an atheist home in the Ukraine. Shortly after her sec-
ond child was born, she began to suffer severe back pain. The pain
increased daily, and Irina lost several inches in height as her spine deteri-
orated. Her doctor was puzzled and could do little more than give her pain
medication. She would have committed suicide, but the sight of her chil-
dren’s sweet faces kept her alive.
   Her brother visited her and was horrified to see that his once-beautiful
sister had lost her hair, her teeth, and her fingernails. “You came too late,”
Irina told her brother. “No one can help me.”
   “No, there is one Physician who can heal you,” he replied, “and that is
God. You do not have to leave home to consult Him, for you can speak to
Him through prayer.”
   Irina was surprised at her brother’s words, for he had been a strong
Communist. But she listened as he explained that Jesus had created the
world and cared for her. He gave her a New Testament and urged her to
read it and to pray.
   Irina found the New Testament hard to understand. She could not kneel
to pray, so she lay on the floor and prayed, “If You love me, turn Your face
to me and let me be healthy again.”
   Slowly Irina began to recover, and after 18 months she was well enough
to return to work. She and her husband continued searching for God. They
tried several churches but did not feel comfortable in any of them.
   When Irina enrolled in a sewing class, she sat next to a woman who
talked about God. Irina was eager to hear all this woman had to say. After
class Irina asked the woman, “How can I find the truth?” The woman
advised her to let the Bible lead her to the true church, which would fol-
low all of God's commandments.
   The next week Irina stayed after class to learn more. Her new friend
talked about the Sabbath. Irina had never heard of the Sabbath before.
Irina accepted her new friend’s invitation to evangelistic meetings in a
house church. Though the church was small, the people welcomed her
warmly. Irina took some literature home to study with her husband. The
couple attended the meetings together, and today they are members of the
Adventist Church.
   Part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering helped provide a new
church in Irina’s city. She and her fellow Adventists say “Thank you!”

Irina Polushkina lives in Sumy, Ukraine.

      The Pre-Advent Judgment




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 25:1, 1 Kings 8:32,
      Ps. 51:1-4, Matt. 22:1-13, Heb. 9:22-24, Rev. 20:12, 22:12.

Memory Text: “And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is
      with me, to give every man according as his work shall be”
      (Revelation 22:12).

             ast week we looked at the pre-Advent judgment mostly in

      L      Daniel 8; this week we’ll look at it again but from the perspec-
             tive of Daniel 7 and some of the fascinating insights given to us
      there. As with the Gospels, we are given here more than just one
      rendering; both chapters contain crucial truths that need to be under-
      stood together. Each one, however enlightening, needs what the other
      has and, taken together, they reveal to us much about this judgment.
        What’s important to remember is that these chapters are not just
      deep theology or prophecy or history; instead, they together send a
      message to us, a message of hope, a message of promise. Together
      they tell us that no matter how bad things are, they aren’t going to last;
      that despite appearances, the God who outlines for us the history of
      the world from Daniel’s time until ours and into the future will bring
      about a wonderful end in which evil will be punished and the just shall
      be saved. How important, amid our study of charts and graphs and
      historical events, not to lose sight of this crucial point. How impor-
      tant, too, that as we share with the world these truths, we always keep
      before the people not just beasts and little horns but the wonderful
      promise of eternal life in God’s kingdom that’s been assured to us
      through the blood of Jesus and His death in our behalf.

      “Until the Ancient of Days Came”
         One point that we touched on earlier this quarter was the impor-
      tance of the cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8. We saw (see week
      5) four events depicted in the vision (Media-Persia, Greece, Rome,
      sanctuary cleansed); with the first three of obvious major importance,
      and with the vision climaxing with the cleansing of the sanctuary, it’s
      more than obvious that whatever the cleansing of the sanctuary was,
      it had to be of major importance, as well.
         Thus, the question is, What is this cleansing of the sanctuary, which
      was of such importance that it would be linked with the great empires
      that Scripture uses to depict the history of the world?
         Daniel 8 itself doesn’t yield much, in and of itself, on the answer;
      fortunately, the Lord didn’t give us just Daniel 8. We have the obvi-
      ous parallel with Daniel 7, which, in a great way, helps unfold the
      mysteries of Daniel 8.

We earlier saw the parallel between the judgment in Daniel 7 and the
      cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8. Read Daniel 7:9, 10, 13,
      14, 18, 21, 22, 26, 27. What does this judgment (the same as the
      cleansing of the sanctuary) lead to? What is the result of this
      judgment? What one specific point is emphasized over and over?

         Notice a theme reiterated in these verses: The saints will be given
      God’s kingdom, an everlasting kingdom that will not pass away as did
      all the ones before it. Over and over, after the depiction of various
      kingdoms, especially the blasphemous and persecuting little horn, the
      final victory of God and His saints is shown. In other words, no mat-
      ter how bad things get or how long things take, in the end, as a result
      of this heavenly judgment/cleansing of the sanctuary, evil will be
      eradicated, and God’s eternal kingdom will be established.
         In this context, how much easier now to understand why the cleans-
      ing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8 climaxes the vision of these earthly
      powers. No wonder, too, it’s shown to be so important!

       All the other kingdoms came and went or finally will be
       destroyed. In contrast, the saints will “possess” (vs. 18) God’s
       eternal kingdom. What does that promise mean to you? What’s
       the first thing you want to do when you get there?


                                                                           97

      Judgment and the Little Horn
        As Adventists, we understand the cleansing of the sanctuary as a
      judgment that involves those who have professed to be followers of
      Christ (see Matt. 22:1-13). We see this especially because in the
      earthly type of the cleansing of the sanctuary, the Day of Atonement
      (see Leviticus 16), the judgment centered around God’s people.
        Nevertheless, the question arises, Why in both Daniel 7 and in
      Daniel 8 is the judgment/sanctuary cleansing depicted in the context
      of the little horn, at least the phase of the little horn shown in the
      vision? What does the little horn have to do with the pre-Advent judg-
      ment?

Read again the texts looked at yesterday. What is the difference in the
      fate of the little horn and the fate of the “saints of the most high”?
      See especially Dan. 7:22.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        It’s very clear: The little horn is punished, condemned, while the
      saints are vindicated, exonerated. This is typical of the Hebrew con-
      cept of justice and judgment: It involved not just the punishment of
      the guilty or the vindication of the righteous—but both. Both are cru-
      cial elements of justice in Hebrew thinking, and both are seen here in
      this depiction of the pre-Advent judgment.

Read Deuteronomy 25:1 and 1 Kings 8:32. How do these two verses
      reveal the principles seen in Daniel 7 and Daniel 8 together?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Of course, the judgment in Daniel 7 results in the end of the little
      horn, but that’s only because the judgment results in the Second
      Coming, which brings about the end of the whole world anyway (at
      least as we know it now). The point is that the judgment, though
      expressed here in the context of the little horn, a symbol of evil,
      involved more than just the little horn. What we see here are two ele-
      ments: evil punished, the saints vindicated. It hardly would seem like
      justice if it were any other way.

       The righteous vindicated, evil punished. That’s God’s promise.
       How should that promise help you through times when, so
       often, it seems only the opposite happens?

     Theodicy, Again
        In the first week of this quarter we looked at a term, theodicy,
     which meant the vindication of God in the face of evil. It’s the idea
     that despite all the evil in the world, we can trust that God is good and
     righteous and just.
        We saw, too, that sin and evil began in another part of the universe
     and that sin and the questions it raised weren’t limited only to earth.
     On the contrary, the earth is merely the place where they are being
     played out. We also looked at the fact that other intelligences in the
     universe also are involved, and interested, in the question raised about
     sin and rebellion.

 Read Daniel 7:9, 10 and then answer the following questions:

      ●
      1 What event is taking place here?



      ●
      2 Where is it taking place?



      ●
      3 Before whom?



        Not only do we have a heavenly judgment scene here, a judgment
     that leads to the destruction of the little horn and the establishment of
     God’s kingdom, this judgment takes place before a multitude of heav-
     enly beings. “Ten thousand times ten thousand” is a way of depicting
     an uncountable multitude. Thus, what we see here is the onlooking
     universe watching God execute the judgment that leads to the estab-
     lishment of His eternal kingdom.

Keeping in mind this judgment scene in Daniel 7, read Psalm 51:1-
     4 and Romans 3:4. How do these texts fit in with the judgment as
     revealed in Daniel 7?


        The crucial point to remember here is that God is judging His people
     in an open way before the onlooking universe. And He’s going to do it
     in a manner that, when it’s over, it will be said that “you are proved right
     when you speak and justified when you judge” (Ps. 51:4, NIV).

      How open and transparent are you in all your dealings and
      judgments with others? If you’re not, why not, and what does
      your answer tell you about the quality of those dealings? What
      might you need to change?

                                                                             99

      Pre-Advent Judgment
Read Daniel 12:1, Matthew 16:27, and Revelation 20:12. Each, in its
      own way, talks about judgment. What evidence can you find in
      these texts that shows why this judgment is before the Second
      Coming; that is, a pre-Advent judgment?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         If, at the Second Coming, the saints receive the kingdom and the lit-
      tle horn is destroyed, there must have been some sort of reckoning
      before the execution of the sentence. After all, even corrupt earthly
      courts do as much! How fair would it be to sentence someone and
      then, only after the sentence, have a trial and investigate the facts?
         If, when Christ returns, “my reward is with me, to give every man
      as his work shall be” (Rev. 22:12) and we all are to be judged by our
      works (Eccles. 12:13, 14; 1 Cor. 3:13; 1 Pet. 1:17; Rev. 20:12), then
      it’s fairly obvious that there must be a judgment prior to the Second
      Coming. Or, as Adventists phrase it—a pre-Advent, or investigative,
      judgment. (After all, what kind of judgment prior to a sentence doesn’t
      entail an investigation of some kind?)

Read carefully, again, the judgment scene as depicted in Daniel 7 (if
      need be, look at some of the previous charts that parallel the
      chapters). Putting aside any of the numbers and dates, why is this
      so clearly a pre-Advent judgment? In fact, what evidence do you
      find in the texts that hint at an investigation? See also Ps. 56:8,
      69:28, Dan. 12:1, Rev. 13:8, 20:12.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         We can see, then, from Daniel 7 that there is, indeed, a massive pre-
      Advent judgment, a judgment that leads not only to the demise of the
      little horn but to the end of this world and the inauguration of the next,
      in which the saints live forever in God’s eternal kingdom. What’s
      depicted here is, obviously, an event of tremendous importance, an
      event in which the eternal destiny of untold numbers is involved. No
      wonder we deem the judgment-hour message as crucial to what we
      believe as Adventists.

     The Heavens Purified
Read Hebrews 9:22-24 and then answer the following questions:

     1. What two sanctuaries are being talked about here?



     2. What parallel is being drawn between them; that is, what is the
     author saying that must happen to both sanctuaries?



       These texts have baffled non-Adventist scholars because of the
     clear reference to the idea that the heavenly sanctuary itself needed to
     be cleansed. “One might conclude that the earthly sanctuary was
     cleansed because its heavenly counterpart also was to be cleansed.”
     —Craig Koester, Hebrews, Anchor Bible Series (New York:
     Doubleday, 2001), p. 427.
       In fact, the Greek word in Hebrews 9:23 for “purified,” or
     “cleansed” comes from the same Greek word used in an ancient
     Greek translation of Daniel 8:14. Thus, those ancient Greeks who,
     before the time of Christ, translated the Old Testament understood the
     Hebrew in Daniel 8:14 to mean that the sanctuary was to be cleansed;
     years later, the author of Hebrews had the same idea, however differ-
     ent the immediate context: Just as the earthly sanctuary was cleansed,
     so must the heavenly. Indeed, the whole point of the earthly cleansing
     was to point to the greater one, the real one in the heavenly sanctuary.

Look again at Daniel 8:14. Considering the time frame of this
     prophecy, why must this cleansing of the sanctuary be the same
     cleansing that the author of Hebrews referred to?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In Jewish thought, the Day of Atonement, when the sanctuary was
     cleansed, was also the great day of judgment, the time when people
     had their last chance to repent before facing judgment. In fact, on the
     Day of Atonement Jews still sometimes say this blessing to one
     another: “May you be sealed in the book of life forever.”

      Why is Christ’s righteousness covering you, by faith, your only
      assurance that, indeed, in the day of judgment you will be
      sealed in the book of life forever?

                                                                         101
                  F RIDAY September 15

Further Study: In Jewish thought, what happens on the Day of
      Atonement, when the sanctuary is to be cleansed? Compare the
      quotes below with how Ellen White describes the pre-Advent
      judgment in The Great Controversy, as well as the images that are
      seen in the judgment scene of Daniel 7.

         “God, seated on His throne to judge the world, at the same time
      Judge, Pleader, Expert, and Witness, openeth the Book of Records; it
      is read, even man’s signature [name] being found therein. The great
      trumpet is sounded; a still small voice is heard; angels shudder, say-
      ing, this is the day of judgment. . . . On the Day of Atonement, it is
      sealed who shall live and who shall die.”—Quoted in the Jewish
      Encyclopedia, “The Day of Atonement.”
         Some prayers uttered on the Day of Atonement read like this:
      “Justify me in the judgment. . . . O silence the accuser, and suffer the
      advocate to take his place . . . and in consequence of his pleading,
      declare, I have pardoned. . . . O blot out the transgression of the peo-
      ple that have been saved. . . . He, the Ancient of Days, sits as
      Judge. . . . In the book of life . . . may we be sealed by Thee.”

Discussion Questions
       ●1 Think about all that God already has done for us, especially
       in the Person of Jesus. Yet, despite all this, in order to ensure that
       all the universe sees His justice and fairness in dealing with sin
       and rebellion, He allows Himself to be judged on how He judges.
       What does that tell us about the character of God and why He is
       so worthy of our praise, worship, and fealty?

       ●
       2 If you believed that folks go immediately to heaven or hell at
       death, why would all this talk of a pre-Advent judgment, or any
       kind of future judgment, sound silly? What does this tell us about
       how interlocked many of our beliefs are?

       ●
       3 Do you know people who are struggling with our under-
       standing of pre-Advent judgment? Why not, as a class, plan a
       house meeting in which, after prayer and fellowship and food,
       you can share some of the things you have been learning?

The Bicycling Evangelist
Charlotte Ishkanian
   Eulogio Masa is a farmer living in a village in northwestern Argentina.
Several years ago he and his brother, Geraldo, traveled to the city of
Tucuman to visit their brother, Francisco. Francisco had become a
Seventh-day Adventist and invited his brothers to visit his church. They
accepted and were so impressed with the message they heard that they
stayed in Tucuman for six weeks to study the Bible. Before they returned
home, both brothers were baptized.
   Eulogio and Geraldo shared their new understanding of the Bible with
their families. No Adventists lived in their area, so the families met in their
homes to study and worship. In time they built a little church on their land,
making everything by hand. They formed bricks from mud and dried them
in the sun. Their burrow pulled the wagon carrying the bricks to the build-
ing site and hauled the water to make mortar. When the church was fin-
ished, the brothers called a pastor to dedicate the church and baptize their
families.
   The brothers shared their faith in surrounding villages. When Geraldo
died, Eulogio carried on alone. He pedaled his bicycle over dirt roads and
along narrow paths to bring God’s love to others.
   He found some people in the village of Babilonia, 13 miles from his
home, who wanted to learn more about God. Eulogio rode his bike there
every Sunday to study the Bible with them. One woman believed, but her
husband was not interested. When he became sick and the doctors could
not help him, his wife urged him to pray. He prayed, and God healed him.
He and his wife were baptized together. A congregation sprouted in
                            Babilonia that now reaches out to its neigh-
                            bors.
                              Eulogio continues to ride the dirt roads of
                            northwestern Argentina, telling people that
                            Jesus is coming soon. He has led at least 50
                            people to Jesus and raised up three churches.
                            “As long as God gives me strength, I will share
                            this great news,” he says.
                              Our Sabbath School mission offerings help

        LESSON           13 *September 16-22
      The Gospel and Judgment




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Leviticus 16; Rom. 8:1,
      34; Heb. 6:20; 7:25; 9:24; 1 Pet. 1:2, 18, 19.

Memory Text: “My little children, these things write I unto
      you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with
      the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” (1 John 2:1).

               s Adventists, we believe that since 1844 we have been living

      A        in the antitypical day of atonement. This means that the
               earthly day of atonement was simply a model, a type, of this
      true day of atonement. In the same way that the animal sacrifices were
      symbols of the Cross, the earthly Day of Atonement was a symbol of
      the real one, the one inaugurated in 1844 by Christ’s work of judg-
      ment in the heavenly sanctuary.
         This, of course, is good news. After all, what is atonement other
      than the work of God saving us through Christ’s blood? The law can’t
      atone; obedience can’t atone; character can’t atone. Atonement comes
      only one way, through the Cross.
         If, then, we are living in the day of atonement, shouldn’t that be
      good news? Shouldn’t any “day” dedicated to atonement, to God’s
      work of saving us, be something we should be thankful for? Shouldn’t
      we be rejoicing in the hope of living in the day of atonement?
         Of course. The judgment is good news because it forms an insepa-
      rable part of “the good news”; it is the climactic application of the
      Cross in our behalf. This week we’ll look at the gospel and the judg-
      ment, because it’s only through the lens of the gospel that we can fully
      see just what the judgment means for us.

     We Must All Stand
       As we saw in week 2, the Bible is clear that there is a judgment and
     that this is a judgment by works, a judgment where our works come
     under scrutiny. (After all, what is a judgment without such a
     scrutiny?) Remember, Jesus said that we shall give an account of
     “every idle word” (Matt. 12:36). Every idle word? And is this not the
     same Lord who said that the “hairs of your head are all numbered”
     (Matt. 10:30), who knows when a sparrow falls to the ground (Matt.
     10:29), and who said in His Word that He shall bring “every work into
     judgment, with every secret thing” (Eccles. 12:14)? Every work?
     Every secret thing? Thus, the whole idea of a scrutiny of works, an
     investigation in judgment, is biblical.
       But more important is the question, How could any sinner stand
     when every idle word, every secret thing, comes into judgment? It’s a
     pretty frightening thought, standing before God in a judgment when
     everything you have ever done comes under review, especially before
     a God who, in His holiness, is a “consuming fire” (Deut. 4:24). What
     person, no matter how obedient, righteous, or faithful, has the kind of
     record that could put him or her in good stead with such a God?

Read Romans 8:34, Hebrews 6:20, 7:25, 9:24, and 1 John 2:1. How
     do they answer the above question?


        The good news of the judgment is that Jesus, in His righteousness,
     gets us through the judgment because He stands there in our place.
     This is what His intercession, His high-priestly ministry, is all about.
     Otherwise, all of us would be lost because none of us, no matter our
     works, has enough righteousness to stand before a Holy God. Unless
     we are clothed in a perfect righteousness that none of us possess or
     could ever earn, we would have to stand in our own works, our own
     righteousness; and because we are all sinners, we would all be con-
     demned.

      “Man cannot meet these charges himself. In his sin-stained gar-
      ments, confessing his guilt, he stands before God. But Jesus our
      Advocate presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by
      repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls
      to Him. He pleads their cause and vanquishes their accuser by
      the mighty arguments of Calvary.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
      for the Church, vol. 5, p. 471. How does this quote from Ellen
      White help you better understand your only hope in the judg-
      ment?



                                                                        105

      Blood and Judgment
        Central to our theology as Seventh-day Adventists is the sanctuary,
      both the earthly as a model of the plan of salvation and the heavenly
      as the place where Jesus is now ministering in our behalf the merits of
      His atoning death. We as Adventists believe—based on (1) the earthly
      sanctuary model, (2) the book of Hebrews, and (3) the prophecies in
      Daniel—that since 1844 Jesus has been in the Most Holy Place, where
      the judgment, clearly seen in Daniel 7, is now taking place.
        Much of our understanding for this comes from the earthly Day of
      Atonement, in which once a year the high priest entered the Most Holy
      Place of the earthly sanctuary. This is found most clearly in Leviticus 16.

Read Leviticus 16. How many times is the word blood mentioned?
      What does the blood symbolize? See also Heb. 9:12-14.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Central to the Day of Atonement ritual was blood, a symbol for the
      blood of Jesus, shed in our behalf at the Cross. Also, because the Day
      of Atonement is the day of judgment, then judgment and atonement
      are closely linked. And, because atonement is, indeed, good news,
      judgment should be, as well. And it is, but only because of the blood,
      which represents the life and death of Jesus in our behalf.

Read Leviticus 17:11; Luke 22:20; Romans 5:9; Hebrews 10:19;
      12:24; 13:20; 1 Peter 1:2, 18, 19. What do they tell us about the
      central role of blood in the plan of salvation?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Blood is a symbol of life; shed blood means death. All this was a
      symbol of Christ’s life and death for us. And, because blood was shed
      and then ministered on the Day of Atonement, this tells us that, cen-
      tral to the Day of Atonement, are the life and death of Jesus—in our
      behalf! That’s why the judgment, for Christians, is good news. We
      have a Substitute who stands in the presence of God “for us” (Heb.
      9:24), now and especially in the judgment.

       Imagine your case before God on Judgment Day—without a
       Substitute! What hope would you have? Why, then, must you
       have a Substitute stand in your stead in the judgment?

     The Garment
       Early in the quarter (week 2) we looked at the wedding parable in
     Matthew 22 as evidence for a pre-Advent judgment. Yet, there’s more
     to this parable than just the timing; instead, it’s a powerful revelation
     of what it means to be covered by the righteousness of Christ in the
     judgment and what it means not to be covered.

Read the parable (Matt. 22:1-13). What ultimately made the differ-
     ence between whether the man stayed or left?

        In this parable we see a clear example of someone who heeded the
     invitation to the wedding but not the conditions. He refused to accept
     what the owner offered him: the robe of Christ’s perfect righteousness
     and, thus, upon investigation was found wanting.
        Notice, the parable said that both the good and the bad came. It
     didn’t say whether the man without the garment was good or bad. In
     one sense it made no difference: Before God in judgment, we all—
     “good” or “bad”—without a garment stand condemned. What the guest
     needed at the wedding is the same thing that we need in the judgment,
     something covering us; otherwise, we will be cast out where there is
     weeping and gnashing of teeth. That covering, symbolized by the gar-
     ment in the parable, is the righteousness of Jesus, credited to His fol-
     lowers by faith—and it is their only hope now and in the judgment.
        Whether through the imagery of the blood, or the garment, the point
     is the same: We need something other than ourselves to get us through
     the judgment. And the good news is that, through the sacrifice of
     Jesus, we have all that we need: the righteousness of God Himself
     (see Rom. 3:21, 22; 10:3; 2 Pet. 1:1) credited to us by faith.

      Ponder this question carefully: Have you accepted the invitation
      to the wedding but not the conditions? What are those condi-
      tions? Be prepared to talk about these conditions in class on
      Sabbath.

                                                                         107

      No Condemnation
Read Romans 8:1. What message is found in this text that is espe-
      cially important for us, who face judgment?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The good news of the judgment is that we don’t have to stand in our
      own righteousness. We can stand in the righteousness of Jesus. That we
      are judged by works doesn’t mean that we are saved by them; we are
      saved, instead, only through the righteousness of Jesus, which is cred-
      ited to us by faith, a faith that is always manifested by works. This
      righteousness covers us the moment we, through a complete surrender
      of ourselves to Christ, claim it for ourselves, and it stays with us
      (though not unconditionally) right through the judgment. After all,
      what good would being covered by that righteousness do any of us if
      we did not have it when we needed it the most, which would be in the
      judgment?

How does James 2 help us understand the role of works in the judg-
      ment?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         But how do I know that I will have enough works to show that I have
      faith? That’s a logical, but wrongly premised, question. It reflects that
      attitude of those who said, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
      name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done
      many wonderful works?” (Matt. 7:22), or of the Pharisee who said,
      “God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
      adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give
      tithes of all that I possess” (Luke 18:11, 12).
         Instead, our attitude should be that of the publican, who smote his
      breast saying, “God, be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:13). Those
      who have ever glimpsed the righteousness of Christ know that they
      must throw themselves on the mercy and grace of God and that their
      works—whatever they are, however much done out of a pure and lov-
      ing heart—are never enough. This is why they have to live by faith,
      trusting in God’s promises that He will save them because of Jesus and
      Jesus alone. It’s the realization of the inadequacy of our works that
      drives us to faith and to the promises of salvation through Christ. And
      it’s that faith—the faith that believes God’s promises—that transforms
      the life, a transformation revealed in works.

      Judged by Works; Saved by Faith
Follow the train of thought below, looking up the various texts. How
      does this help you understand what a judgment by works means
      for us who are saved by faith?



         A professed follower’s life comes up before God: Every work,
      every secret thing, every idle word comes into review (Ps. 135:14,
      Eccles. 12:14, Matt. 12:36, Rom. 14:10-12, 2 Cor. 5:10, Heb. 10:30).
      Who could stand before such a scrutiny? No one (Rom. 3:23, Gal.
      3:22, 1 Tim. 1:15, Rom. 3:10). However, for the true followers of
      Christ, Jesus stands as their Advocate, their Representative, their
      Intercessor in heaven (Rom. 8:34, Heb. 6:20, 7:25, 9:24, 1 John 2:1).
      And though they have nothing in and of themselves to give them
      merit before God, though they have no works that are good enough to
      justify them before the Lord, their lives—however faulty, however
      defective—nevertheless reveal their true repentance and faith (Matt.
      7:24-27, John 14:15, James 2:14-20, 1 John 4:20, 5:3). How they
      treated others, the poor, the needy, prisoners, how they forgave as they
      were forgiven, the words they spoke, the deeds they did (Matt. 7:2;
      12:36, 37; 18:23-35; 25:31-46)—while these things never could jus-
      tify them before God, while they never could answer the demands of
      a broken law, they reveal those who have accepted Christ as their
      Substitute—and His righteousness alone, which covers them like a
      garment, gets them through the judgment (Leviticus 16; Zech. 3:1-5;
      Matt. 22:1-14; Rom. 8:1, 34; Heb. 9:24; 1 John 2:1).
         Or, as Ellen White so clearly expressed it: “But while we should
      realize our sinful condition, we are to rely upon Christ as our right-
      eousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. We cannot answer
      the charges of Satan against us. Christ alone can make an effectual
      plea in our behalf. He is able to silence the accuser with arguments
      founded not upon our merits, but on His own.”—Testimonies for the
      Church, vol. 5, p. 472. The futility of our works for salvation should
      cause us to lean totally on the mercy and merits of Christ. Then, out
      of love and thankfulness for the assurance of salvation that’s ours
      through Christ, we serve Him with all our heart, soul, mind, and body,
      a service that’s expressed in works. How else could it be?

       How well do your works reflect your faith? Or, is that the prob-
       lem:Your works only too well reflect your faith? What things do
       you need to repent of and change in order to reflect more fully
       the righteousness of Jesus, which is yours by faith?



                                                                          109

Further Study: Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
      “Joshua and the Angel,” vol. 5, pp. 467–476.

         In the context of the saints in judgment, Ellen White writes: “Their
      only hope is in the mercy of God; their only defense will be prayer. As
      Joshua was pleading before the Angel, so the remnant church, with
      brokenness of heart and earnest faith, will plead for pardon and deliv-
      erance through Jesus their Advocate. They are fully conscious of the
      sinfulness of their lives, they see their weakness and unworthiness,
      and as they look upon themselves they are ready to despair. The
      tempter stands by to accuse them, as he stood by to resist Joshua. He
      points to their filthy garments, their defective characters. He presents
      their weakness and folly, their sins of ingratitude, their unlikeness to
      Christ, which has dishonored their Redeemer.”—Ellen G. White,
      Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 473. Again, in the same context:
      “Now he [Satan] points to the record of their lives, to the defects of
      character, the unlikeness to Christ, which has dishonored their
      Redeemer, to all the sins that he has tempted them to commit, and
      because of these he claims them as his subjects.
         “Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and
      faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded hands
      before the Father and the holy angels, saying: ‘I know them by name.
      I have graven them on the palms of My hands.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The
      Great Controversy, p. 484.

Sharing the Light
Thomas Alai
   Thomas Alai lives in Papua New Guinea. One day he looked up from
his work to find a friend standing near his desk. He had come to sell him
a Bible. Thomas had planned to spend the 20 kina (about US$6.50) in his
pocket for beer, but instead he bought the Bible.
   He opened the Bible and found a list of topics and Bible references. He
began reading the Bible by topic. When he came to the Sabbath, he was
puzzled. But as he read the verses listed, he was convinced that the
Sabbath was God’s appointed day of worship. Thomas asked an Adventist
woman at work where to find the Adventist church, and the next Sabbath
he attended worship.
   He knew immediately this was where God wanted him. After church he
told his wife where he had been. “I want to change my life,” he said. She
had heard that line before and was not convinced. However as weeks
passed, she realized that her husband was indeed changing. While she did
not attend church with him, she was glad he had found God.
   An elderly church member told Thomas that he was working in a town
not far away where only four Adventists lived. The man was teaching his
neighbors the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation, and the people wanted
to know more. He asked Thomas to help him. So Thomas began visiting
the village to help his friend teach the people.
   The people told Thomas that the Protestant pastor in town did not want
Adventists in his territory and planned to make trouble for them. Thomas
prayed that God would intervene and calm the man down. One evening the
Protestant pastor entered the home of one of his members. Thomas was
there showing pictures to explain the Bible prophecies to a group of peo-
ple. The pastor said nothing but sat down to watch the presentation.
   After the presentation ended, Thomas was surprised to learn that the vis-
itor was the Protestant pastor. Thomas approached the pastor and said,
“I’m sorry, Pastor. I did not know you were here, or I would have greeted
you properly.” The pastor simply nodded and thanked Thomas for the pres-
entation. He showed no signs of anger.
   Thomas has continued meeting with the people, and several of them
have been baptized. The believers meet in a simple shelter made of sago
palm leaves. Thomas reports that some 45 people have asked for Bible
studies in preparation for baptism.
   Our mission offerings help start work in new areas around the world.

        LESSON            14 *September 23-29
                 The Meaning of the
           Judgment Today


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Job 1:7-11; Ps. 73:1-17;
      Matt. 5:16; John 14:2; Acts 1:11; 1 Cor. 4:5, 9; Eph. 2:8-10; 3:10;
      1 Thess. 4:14-18; Rev. 22:12.

Memory Text: “Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour
      of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and
      earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” (Revelation 14:7).

             o far, we’ve covered a lot of ground in our study of the 1844 pre-

      S      Advent judgment. We have, we believe, firmly established the
             biblical basis for this judgment. Using everything from the
      earthly sanctuary model to the prophecies of Daniel to the life and
      death of Jesus and to the book of Hebrews, we’ve seen that, as
      Adventists, we are on solid biblical ground with our teaching on the
      1844 judgment.
         That being said, another question arises—So what? Here we are, in
      the twenty-first century; what does a judgment that began in 1844
      mean for us today? What does it say to us as Seventh-day Adventists
      now? Why is it important for us to know and believe this teaching?
      What does it reveal about God and about the salvation He offers?
         Sure, with our pioneers, the 1844 judgment helped answer the ques-
      tion of the Great Disappointment; it helped them understand what had
      just happened in regard to the Millerite prophecies. But that was then;
      this is now. How do we, today, relate to this prophecy, which began its
      fulfillment in a time when most of our great-grandparents weren’t
      even born yet? This, our final week, looks at some of these questions.

     Judgment and Justice
        Our world reeks of injustice; in every land, in every government, in
     every city, town, and village unfairness, inequity, and injustice, time
     and again, rear their ugly and evil heads. Probably no human being
     alive hasn’t been stared down by the horrific visages of injustice and
     unfairness. To live in this sinful world is to face injustice; otherwise,
     it wouldn’t be a sinful world.
        Of course, the greatest injustice occurred at the Cross: Jesus, the
     sinless One, faced the punishment due all sinners. Thus, whatever
     injustices we suffer, we have the assurance that God, in the person of
     Christ, faced even worse.

Read Psalm 73:1-17. What’s the point being made, and how does it
     relate to our understanding of the sanctuary and judgment?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Perhaps one of the most important points of the 1844-sanctuary
     doctrine is its teaching that there will be a judgment, a just judgment
     in which evil will be condemned and righteousness vindicated. Our
     judgment-hour message not only tells us about this judgment but tells
     us when it takes place. In other words, what the 1844 message says is
     that God’s justice will not delay forever. He has promised to bring
     judgment, and “the hour of His judgments is come” (Rev. 14:7). The
     1844 judgment is part of our message to the world that God’s justice
     is coming; that we can trust Him and that evil will be recompensed
     and goodness vindicated, no matter how hard it is for us to see it now.
     In fact, the message tells the world that this judgment already has
     begun and that one day we will see the final results. For now, we just
     have to live by faith, awaiting the day of final justice and vindication.

      do to make amends? Why should you make amends?

      Vindication and God
         We have, through the course of this quarter, touched on a crucial
      theme tied directly to the great controversy: the vindication of God in
      the face of evil. We even learned a fancy theological term for this
      idea: theodicy.
         In this context the judgment is so important, because it tells us so
      much about the character of God. It tells us that God is willing to
      work openly in His dealing with sin, rebellion, and apostasy. We can
      trust God even when things seem really bad; that no matter how ter-
      rible the world is, our God can be trusted, for all His works and deal-
      ings will be open to the scrutiny of all the universe. We studied this in
      particular in week 12, for there we saw the whole idea of the judgment
      taking place before the onlooking universe. It’s a theme worthy of
      more study, for in many ways it helps explain so much.

Look up the following texts. How do they, in their own way, teach the
      idea of the vindication of God?

      Ps. 19:9
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Rom.  3:26
      ____________________________________________________________________

      1____________________________________________________________________
         Cor. 4:5

      1____________________________________________________________________
         Cor. 13:12

         What the pre-Advent judgment tells us is that, even now, the Lord is
      working openly before the onlooking universe. They, right now, are see-
      ing the righteousness and fairness of God’s judgment. In Adventist the-
      ology, we understand that our day will come, too, when we shall “know
      even as also I am known” (1 Cor. 13:12). We are, after all, told that “we
      shall judge angels” (1 Cor. 6:3); thus, the idea is that all things will be
      open to us, to our scrutiny, as well. In short, what the pre-Advent judg-
      ment tells us is that this process has already begun and that one day—
      just like the onlooking universe now—we will have all our questions
      answered, all issues about pain, suffering, and sin resolved, and so we,
      too, along with all God’s creatures, will see the justice and righteous-
      ness of God in all His dealing with sin, evil, and rebellion.

       What are some of the questions that you want to ask God?
       What are some things that you, right now, just can’t under-
       stand? What does the promise mean to you that one day these
       will be answered and in a way that will cause us to praise the
       righteousness and goodness of God?

     The Second Coming
        Review the judgment scene in Daniel 7. Notice something impor-
     tant: This pre-Advent judgment is portrayed as the last event in salva-
     tion history before the second coming of Christ. It is, according to the
     text, the event itself that ushers in the Second Coming. The result of
     this judgment leads to the second coming of Jesus.

What do these texts have in common? What event are they all talking
     about? John 14:2, Acts 1:11, 1 Thess. 4:14-18, Rev. 22:12.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

What other texts can you find that talk about the same event?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus Himself, while on earth, talked about His second coming over
     and over again. The early church lived with the expectation of
     His soon return. Since then, through long and painful centuries,
     Christians have awaited the return of Jesus. Each generation lives
     with the hope and expectation that theirs might be the one to be alive
     at the Second Advent.
        We’re still here, though, and with each passing year it has been eas-
     ier and easier for people to lose the hope of His return.
        Here’s where the 1844 judgment comes in, for it’s a powerful indica-
     tor of the times we are living in. It’s a message from God, to us, saying
     basically, Trust me, I am coming as I have said. It can’t be too far off.
        The 1844 pre-Advent judgment is, we believe, that last prophetic
     time element given to the world. It’s God’s way of telling us that final
     events are here, and His coming will be soon. As we saw in an earlier
     study, all the kingdoms predicted by Daniel came and went, just as
     predicted. He proved that we can trust Him regarding future events;
     thus, we can trust Him now that this pre-Advent judgment will,
     indeed, lead to the Second Coming, and because we know when this
     judgment began, we can know that the Second Coming is near.

      As a class, talk about the signs of the times that we are living in.
      How do they portend the second coming of Jesus? At the same
      time, why is the revelation of the judgment the most stable,
      unchanging, and certain sign that heralds His return?


                                                                         115
          W EDNESDAY September 27

      The Assurance of Salvation
        Perhaps the greatest and most important point about the 1844 pre-
      Advent judgment is that it is a message of assurance. It’s the promise
      that as long as we remain faithful to the Lord—living in humble faith,
      repentance, and obedience to Him and His commands—we have a
      faithful High Priest ministering in our behalf, a faithful High Priest
      who, indeed, stands as our Substitute in judgment (see last week’s les-
      son). Though we are sinners, though we have violated God’s law,
      though we deserve death, we have the assurance that we will be vin-
      dicated in judgment because we have Jesus standing there in our
      place. This is the most important message of the 1844 pre-Advent
      judgment.

Some Christians have no concept of a pre-Advent judgment because
      they believe in “once saved, always saved,” the idea that once they
      have accepted Jesus as Savior, then they are saved, regardless of
      the other choices they make in life, even completely turning away
      from Jesus unto a life of sin. Look up the following texts. How do
      they refute this false and dangerous doctrine? Ezek. 18:24, Matt.
      24:13, Luke 8:5-15, Rom. 11:16-21, 1 Cor. 9:27.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         As Adventists, we (along with many other Christians) reject the
      idea of once saved, always saved. It’s obvious that followers of Christ
      can, through their own choice, fall away. And it’s in this context that
      we can understand better the meaning of the pre-Advent judgment,
      for it is here in the judgment that once and for all our decisions for or
      against Christ are finalized. The judgment is not a time when God
      decides to accept or reject us; it’s the time when God finalizes our
      choice as to whether or not we have accepted or rejected Him, a
      choice that always is made manifest by our works. The good news of
      the judgment is that we have the assurance that if we stay faithful to
      Jesus, if we claim His righteousness for ourselves, He stands in our
      stead, and when our name comes up in judgment, we are sealed for-
      ever in the salvation that He freely has offered us. Thus, and only in
      this sense—once their names come up in judgment, true Christians
      are, indeed, once saved, always saved.

     Judged by Works
        As certain as the Bible is that we are saved by faith and not by
     works (Rom. 3:28), it’s just as certain that we are judged by our works
     (Eccles. 3:17, 12:14, 2 Cor. 5:10, 1 Pet. 1:17). Indeed, it’s the reali-
     zation that we are now living in the time when those works are being
     judged that Christians should be motivated to greater works, not in
     order to be saved (that’s impossible) but because their works are a vis-
     ible demonstration to the world and the universe of the reality of
     Christ’s salvation in their lives.

Read Ephesians 2:8-10. How is the role of faith and works presented
     here in a balanced manner?

        As we saw in last week’s lesson, our works, while they can’t save
     us, reveal that we are saved, reveal that we have indeed given our lives
     to Christ. At the same time, our works also do more: They, too, are
     part of the whole package regarding the question of theodicy and
     issues surrounding the nature and character of God.

Read Job 1:7-11, Matthew 5:16, 1 Corinthians 4:9, and Ephesians
     3:10. From what you can piece together from these texts, what do
     they tell us about the role of our good works?

       In the end, what the judgment tells us is that, in a special way, our
     works are coming under scrutiny before the onlooking universe. If we
     love God, if we are rejoicing in the salvation He has given us, we will
     want to send a message to the world and to the universe that, indeed,
     we love and serve the Lord who has done so much for us. Good works
     testify to the reality of the faith that we have in Christ; and though
     they don’t save us in the judgment, good works reveal that, though we
     are sinners, Christ has done the right thing in bringing us into “his
     kingdom that . . . shall not be destroyed” (Dan. 7:14).

      What kind of message do your works send to anyone who might
      be watching them? What changes do you need to make in order
      to send a better message?

         Another important point about 1844 relates to the Adventist Church
      itself. As Adventists, our foundation was erected on the understand-
      ing that, while our spiritual forefathers, the Millerites, got the event
      wrong, they got the date, 1844, right. Thus, not just our heritage but
      the biblical foundation upon which our early pioneers worked
      stemmed from the 1844 foundation. Hence, it’s important for us, as a
      people, to understand the biblical reasoning that leads to 1844. That
      we have grown since the early days in our understanding of this mes-
      sage is unmistakable; that we have a better grasp of what it means is
      unmistakable, as well. At the same time, however, by being firmly
      rooted in the biblical basis of 1844, we have the assurance that the
      prophetic foundation upon which our church was founded is, indeed,
      a foundation rooted in the Word of God itself. In short, it’s important
      for us to be grounded in the 1844 teaching because it affirms the bib-
      lical basis upon which we, as a church, with our distinctive message,
      exist.

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 What do the answers to Wednesday’s final question tell us
       about how well we understand the plan of salvation?

       ●
       2 Though the 1844 judgment helps us to understand where we
       are in prophetic time, we are now in the twenty-first century. The
       year 1844 was a long time ago, and with each passing year that
       date gets further away. How should we deal with this ever-
       growing passage of time? As you think about your answer, con-
       sider some previous time prophecies: the 1,260 years, the 2,300
       years, the 490 years, and so forth. How do these very long time
       periods help us keep things in perspective? That is, though 1844
       was a long time ago, was it that long ago, at least in contrast to
       other prophetic times in which God’s people had to wait?

       ●
       3 As a class, take what you have learned this quarter and put
       together a seminar for the whole church, in order to help every-
       one understand the solid biblical foundation of our 1844 message
       and what it means for the church today.

Visitors’ Day Dilemma
Penieli Kitomary
   Penieli Kitomary was a lay pastor in a charismatic church in Tanzania.
He had raised up two churches and was starting a third congregation.
Following his members' urging, Penieli enrolled in a seminary near the
campus of Tanzania Adventist College (now University of Arusha).
   Someone at the Adventist university invited Penieli to attend the
Visitors' Day worship on campus, but he declined, feeling unprepared to
confront Adventist beliefs. He warned his church members not to accept
an invitation to the Adventist church either.
   During that week Penieli remembered a debate he had heard on the
Sabbath. This doctrine intrigued him, and he decided to visit the Adventist
church to learn more about this Sabbath issue. When he arrived, he found
several members of his church who had also decided to attend the
Adventist worship.
   Penieli was pleased with the welcome he received and the invitation to
stay for the afternoon program. He enjoyed the choir and the message. He
could find nothing to refute what he heard and wondered why people
feared this church so much. He left the church with many questions.
   When Penieli talked to the deacons, he realized that some of them had
attended the Adventist church and had questions, as well. Several believed
in the Sabbath and were willing to accept it. Penieli wanted to know more.
He visited the chaplain at the Adventist school and asked many questions.
Then he reported to his congregation on what he had learned.
   “Bring the chaplain here,” the members said. The chaplain met with the
believers and spent several hours answering questions and explaining
Adventist doctrines. The group invited the chaplain to return, and then
several members visited the Adventist church.
   Other members of the charismatic church urged the new believers not to
visit the Adventist church. When they could not convince them to stay
away, some even went with the new believers to protect them from
Adventist heresy. The chaplain explained that the Sabbath and every other
Adventist teaching comes from the Bible. At the close of the meeting, he
invited those who wanted to follow God’s will to stand, and Penieli and
several of his church members stood up. Following evangelistic meetings,
the new believers asked to be baptized. Penieli continues to pastor them,
teaching the new doctrines that he loves.
   Your mission offerings each week help fund the witness of your church
around the world.

Penieli Kitomary is a lay pastor living near Arusha, Tanzania.

2006      Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter
         Beginnings and Belongings, written by the late Arthur Ferch, gives
       us an inspired account of the miracle that created us; we’ll also get, in
       hints and symbols, the earliest revelations of the miracle that saves us:
       the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. All this is found in the
       book of Genesis, a book about Creation and Redemption, and the focus
       of our study.
Lesson 1—Foundations
         The Week at a Glance
         S UNDAY : Genesis and the New Testament (Matt. 19:3-8, Luke
         17:26-30, Acts 7:1-15)
         M ONDAY : The Mighty and Merciful God (Gen. 1:1, 7:11)
         T UESDAY : Close Encounters (Gen. 2:7, 3:8)
         W EDNESDAY : Foundations (Acts 7:2-17)
         T HURSDAY : The Just Shall Live by Faith (Rom. 1:17)
         Memory Text—Psalm                 11:3.
         Sabbath Gem: As Christians, our principles are found in and
         through the person of Jesus Christ, the One in whom “we live, and
         move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Yet, we know about Jesus
         through the Bible. So, the Bible, in essence, works as the foundation
         for our lives and our faith. Thus, in a sense, Genesis serves as the
         foundation of the Bible.
Lesson 2—“In the Beginning . . .”
         The Week at a Glance
         S UNDAY : “In the Beginning, God . . .” (Gen. 1:1, Exod. 20:11)
         M ONDAY : The Creation (Gen. 1:1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24; com-
         pare Ps. 33:6-9)
         T UESDAY : The Creation Days (Gen. 1:4, 5; Exod. 20:8-11)
         W EDNESDAY : The Chicken or the Egg? (Gen. 1:2)
         T HURSDAY : The Creation of Humanity (See Gen. 1:24; 2:7, 19)
         Memory Text—Psalm                 33:6, 9.
         Sabbath Gem: The          Bible tells us that we are here only because
         a loving, benevolent Creator-God purposely created life on earth in
         a process that took six literal, contiguous 24-hour days. As we’ll
         study this week, in the creation of the world, particularly humans, it
         doesn’t appear that God left anything to chance.
