         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of worldwide evaluation committees and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

    Love for God           about which was the greatest command-
     cannot be             ment, Jesus said: “ ‘ “Love the Lord your
                           God with all your heart and with all your
     manifested
                           soul and with all your mind.” This is the
    in any other           first and greatest commandment. And the
    way than love          second is like it: “Love your neighbor as
                           yourself ” ’ ” (Matt. 22:37-39, NIV).
     for others.             Obviously, God cares about our relation-
                           ships; otherwise, He would not have
named loving others as the most important command besides loving
Him. It’s no coincidence Jesus linked these two commands: Love for
God cannot be manifested in any way other than love for others.
  God created people as individuals with unique character traits that
make them who they are. Yet, He created them also as social beings
who enter into relationships with others. And nowhere is our relation-
ship with others more important, more fraught with both temporal
and eternal consequences, than in the family. Here so much of who
we are, either for good or for ill, is determined.
  Though living as a Christian at home is crucial, it can be challeng-
ing, even harder than in public, where it is easier to put on façades. At
home, generally, the masks come off. It is a lot easier to fool others
than to fool those with whom you share the same table, the same
rooms, the same bed day after day, year after year. If you can be a
Christian at home, you can be one anywhere.
  Families fit into God’s design as centers in which individuals expe-
rience intimate association with others and are prepared for the great-
est intimacy of all—a relationship with God. In the family both chil-
dren and adults may have a warm experience that reflects the Creator
and that encourages them in loving discipleship. On the other hand,
because of pseudolove or indifference, people may leave their home
with emotional and spiritual problems that are often difficult to erase.
  Just as our homes have the greatest potential to do the most good,
they also can do the most harm. No wonder that the Bible says so
much about family life. So much depends upon it.

family of god
  Christian families face the challenge of seeking to live according to
God’s will for life and for relationships, even as each individual mem-
ber finds himself or herself falling short of that will (Rom. 3:23).
That’s why, first and foremost, true Christians grasp by faith the sin-
less life of Christ and claim that life as their own, the foundation upon
which they can build a relationship with God that will enhance their
relationships with their own family (Eph. 5:2).
  The wonder of our faith is the good news that God knows all about
us. He sympathizes with our weaknesses and is full of compassion and
longsuffering. Knowing this about Him, even experiencing for our-
selves His love for us despite our faults, we do the same to others,
especially those in our own family. Through family relationships God
wants to show His love to the world. As families learn to live together
according to the Word of God, His grace is diffused to all whose lives
they touch, winsomely drawing others to Jesus.
  Marriage and family, along with the Sabbath, are two institutions
passed to humankind from Eden. Equally the work of the Creator’s
hand, they are indissolubly linked and meant to bring glory to God
and blessings to humanity. As creationists raised up to give voice to
Revelation’s call to worship the One who made all things (see Rev.
14:7), Seventh-day Adventists have lifted up the Sabbath, reminding
the world of the Creator’s rest. Marriage and family, in their own way,
also recall Creation, when a merciful Maker prepared a place for
humanity to rest, a haven where the power of His love draws diversity
into oneness, where a promise is a promise and commitment means
commitment. This place of rest, this haven, is the home.
  However, this quarter’s study has been written in the sad recognition
that for many, this haven doesn’t exist as it should. Our goal, if noth-
ing else, is through study of the Word to help homes and families be
what God would have them to be: more loving, more secure in Christ.

  Ron Flowers, author of this quarter’s study guide, has worked in the
department of Family Ministries at the General Conference since
1980. He has been teaching and writing on family issues for many
years. He and his wife, Karen, have two adult children.

      A Family of Families




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:18-25; 27:1–28:5;
      Matt. 10:35-37; John 17:11, 21, 22; Acts 9:17; 21:8, 9; Rom. 16:1;
      1 Cor. 4:14, 15; Gal. 4:5; 1 John 4:8, 16.

Memory Text: “Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and
      foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the
      household of God, having been built on the foundation of the
      apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cor-
      nerstone” (Ephesians 2:19, 20, NKJV).

The Week at a Glance: Through our family, both in our
      households and in His church, God longs for us to experience His
      self-giving love.

               aurice and Sara, newly baptized Adventists who lived in a

      M        crime-ridden area, told the pastor they wanted to move to a
               safer place, one closer to the church, so their two daughters
      could attend church school. With their permission the pastor shared
      their hopes with the congregation. Before long a member spotted an
      empty apartment not far from the church. It was just what the family
      had been hoping for, but their hope fell at the news of the large secu-
      rity deposit. Telephones rang, and by the next day donations by
      church members helped Maurice and Sara make the deposit and the
      first month’s rent. Church members cleaned both apartments and
      moved them across town. Exhausted but exhilarated, Maurice stood
      before the church the next Sabbath and beamed with gratitude. A man
      of few words, he said only, “I’m so glad I have a family!”

     Family Roots
      When He brought together the first man and the first woman in
     marriage in the Garden of Eden, the Creator formed the first family.

Study the origin of the family (Gen. 2:18-25). What purpose for the
     family is evident in this account?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       “ ‘It is not good for the man to be alone’ ” (Gen. 2:18, NIV).
     Companionship is one of the first purposes of families. Scripture uses
     family and household to describe social units made up of relatives and
     sometimes domestic helpers, all dwelling together in companionship.
     Together, families fend off loneliness and provide for the needs of
     each person (compare Lev. 25:49; Ruth 2:20; Ps. 68:5, 6).
       A special companionship. With the marriage of the first couple,
     God supplied a very special kind of companionship. He intended hus-
     bands and wives to experience a unique union He called “one flesh”
     (Gen. 2:24). To the married couple He entrusted another of His pur-
     poses for families—the bearing and rearing of children (Gen. 1:28).

What deeper meaning of the family emerges from reflection on the
     nature and Personhood of God and the creation of humankind in
     His image? Gen. 1:26-28. Compare John 17:11, 21, 22; 1 John 4:8, 16.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        What we can see in Christ’s words is the unity and the loving rela-
     tionship within the Godhead Itself. Think of the meaning and purpose
     this gives to life in our individual households, which, in their own
     way, can reflect the self-giving love seen within the Trinity! No won-
     der family becomes a major metaphor in the New Testament for the
     church, the household of faith (Gal. 6:10).

      Companionship, we see, is one of the fundamental components
      of family life. How much time do you spend being a companion
      to other family members? What things should you give up that
      would allow you to spend more time with your family?




                                                                         7

      Jesus’ Affirmation of Families
What do the following texts tell us about Jesus’ attitude toward fam-
      ily relationships?

      Matt. 19:4-6
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Mark 7:9-13
      ____________________________________________________________________

      John 5:17, 18
      ____________________________________________________________________

      John 19:26, 27
      ____________________________________________________________________

        The divine plan for family living got a boost from the ministry of
      Jesus. He left no uncertainty about God’s plan for marriage, espe-
      cially when the Pharisees quizzed Him about divorce. The fifth com-
      mandment about honoring parents was in His mind as He rebuked the
      Pharisees who encouraged adult children to give as an offering the
      money that should have been spent upon their aging parents. Probably
      Jesus’ greatest acknowledgment of the parent-child relationship came
      when He talked about God as His Father. On the cross He expressed
      love and care for His mother, Mary. During that terrible time He made
      sure the woman who had cradled Him, cherished Him, and, at times
      through the years, wondered at Him, got the best care He could give
      in the home of His trusted disciple.

Some statements of Jesus about families may need some clarifica-
      tion (Matt. 10:35-37, Mark 3:32-35, Luke 9:59-62, 14:26). Why do
      you think Jesus said these things? How can they be reconciled
      with His approval elsewhere of family life?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         He who set people in families from the beginning did not change
      His mind about them during His earthly ministry. Just as He planned
      at Creation, the Son of God upheld them as sources of nurture, sup-
      port, and strength. However important, families must be seen in the
      light of the higher loyalty to God.

       Since God calls us to commitment to Him in both our church and
       family experience, how can energy, time, and resources be fairly
       distributed between these two? What dangers exist for those who,
       so busy in their work for God, neglect their family commitments?

     A Variety of Families
Consider the various kinds of households in Bible times: Genesis
     27:1–28:5; Ruth 1:22; 2:23; Jeremiah 16:2; Hosea 1:2, 3, 6, 8;
     3:1-3. What others can you think of?


        Isaac and Rebekah lived with their adult son, Jacob, and his married
     twin brother, Esau. The grieving widows Naomi and Ruth, bound
     together as mother and daughter-in-law, found refuge together.
     Jeremiah was single. Hosea parented his three children alone before
     he was reconciled to Gomer. Still other Bible families include the sib-
     lings Lazarus, Martha, and Mary, who had a home in Bethany where
     Jesus visited (John 11:1-3, 20); Aquila and Priscilla, married but
     apparently never had children (Acts 18:2, 18; 1 Cor. 16:19); and the
     family of grandmother Lois, her daughter Eunice, and grandson
     Timothy, in Lystra. Timothy’s Greek father may have separated from
     the family as an unbeliever (Acts 16:1, 2 Tim. 1:5; compare 1 Cor.
     7:15).
        Acceptance of different family types. That God loved and cared
     about such diverse families is a source of abundant encouragement in
     our world today. It should also lead to appreciation of widely varied
     family types within His church.

What core values for family living are continually present in
     Scripture? Gen. 2:24, 25; Exod. 20:14; Lev. 18:22; Prov. 5:18-20;
     Matt. 19:6; Rom. 1:26, 27; 1 Cor. 7:3-5; Heb. 13:4.


        God’s gracious dealings throughout salvation history bear witness
     to His mercy toward humankind in a world distorted by sin, where the
     divine blueprint for families is rarely replicated. There are, however,
     certain core values that frequently appear throughout Scripture,
     intended to preserve and, where necessary, restore and elevate God’s
     gift of sexuality to the human family. These values hold that sexual
     intimacy is a mutual expression of love reserved for the monogamous
     marriage of a man and a woman only (the Bible knows nothing of
     same-sex marriages). Many types of families in which a commitment
     to these values exists can be accommodated; yet relationships in
     which sexuality is otherwise expressed, or exploited, ultimately under-
     mine God’s design for marriage and degrade humanity.

      Is there anyone in your church who is living in a household
      different from your own? How can you show this person, or such
      people, appreciation and support?

                                                                          9

     One Is a Whole Number
        When present households in the family of God are counted, those of
     single adults represent a large and growing segment. Whenever and
     wherever society or the church hold up marriage as the norm, often it
     is difficult for these individuals to feel normal and whole. Often they
     do not feel as though they truly belong.

Consider the circumstances of these single adults. In what ways
     did they contribute to the cause of God? Elijah (1 Kings 17:1–
     2 Kings 2:11); Anna (Luke 2:36-38); John the Baptist (Matt. 11:7-
     11); Philip’s daughters (Acts 21:8, 9). What other Bible characters
     remained single?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The option to live singly. For many people, singleness is a season of
     life, either preceding or following marriage. For others, singleness is
     a positive lifetime choice. They recognize that although many people
     get married, God also gives His sons and daughters the option to live
     singly. For still others, singleness is not really a choice but an agoniz-
     ing and reluctant consent to circumstances in which suitable partners
     are unavailable or marriage would be inappropriate.
        Paul supported marriage in his teaching and writing, but he person-
     ally held that because of the work to be done for Christ in a short time,
     singleness was preferable. This was especially true if individuals had
     the gift for singleness; that is, if they felt led of God to make such a
     choice. The fellowship of the church must include both single and
     married people. In the choices they make and challenges they face,
     single people need to be understood and affirmed as persons rather
     than minimized, as often happens (even if unintentionally).
        Personal value and completeness are ultimately related not to one’s
     single or married situation but to one’s response in faith to Christ. In
     Him who draws everyone to Himself, all are complete (Col. 2:10).

      Who are the single people in your church? How can you relate
      to them in a positive manner, one that affirms them in their
      present circumstances?

      Household of Households
Discover the family imagery in the following texts describing life
      in the church: John 20:17; Acts 9:17; Romans 16:1; 1 Corinthians
      4:14, 15; Galatians 4:5; 1 Timothy 5:2.

         Just as the human family was to reflect the Creator’s relational
      nature, so the church is to be an even more exquisite replica of the har-
      monious, giving, loving relationship known within the Godhead.
      Family terms—birth, adoption, mother, father, sister, brother—pro-
      vide a new vocabulary, a whole new way of talking about the human
      relationship with God and of human beings with one another.
         A template for the church. The Holy Spirit uses common family rela-
      tionships to describe a community in which new births are embraced,
      diversity is accommodated, strengths are affirmed, and people are
      encouraged to grow. If the word family calls up warm feelings for us,
      we likely will embrace this view of the church. Sadly for some, family
      means painful memories. For these, other images of the church may
      have more appeal. Yet, God is a relational Being. He formed humanity
      with relational capacities, and it is comforting to know that although
      family may fail us, in His church He provides for rest, healing, and
      experiences of surpassing family love (compare Ps. 27:10).

How does the idea of the church as a household (Gal. 6:10, Eph. 2:19)
      open the doors to include everybody?


         “Household of faith” calls to mind the sense of belonging that fam-
      ilies build in one another and the attitude of neighborliness that has
      always characterized well-functioning family relationships. Many
      people, who have received Christ individually as their personal
      Savior, come as households or families to church. Others attend
      alone. In a sense, though, their families are with them, for each has
      been shaped by their family experience, and each will always be part
      of a family somewhere. Church, then, is quite literally a household of
      households, a family of families. The first Christians broke bread
      “from house to house”; yet, they were one church (Acts 2:46, 47). First
      Corinthians 12 shows the importance of valuing, incorporating, nur-
      turing, and utilizing all the individual parts in the complex organism.

       ent from your present home or the one in which you grew up?

       Untidy living rooms. “The churches of the Revelation show us that
     churches are not Victorian parlors where everything is always picked
     up and ready for guests. They are messy family rooms. Entering a per-
     son’s house unexpectedly, we are sometimes met with a barrage of
     apologies. St. John does not apologize. Things are out of order, to be
     sure, but that is what happens to churches that are lived in. They are
     not show rooms. They are living rooms, and if the persons living in
     them are sinners, there are going to be clothes scattered about, hand-
     prints on the woodwork, and mud on the carpet. For as long as Jesus
     insists on calling sinners and not the righteous to repentance—and
     there is no indication as yet that he has changed his policy in that
     regard—churches are going to be an embarrassment to the fastidious
     and an affront to the upright.”—Eugene H. Peterson, Living the
     Message (HarperSanFrancisco, 1996), p. 71.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, discuss how the church should relate to those who
      are living in a family relationship that goes against the
      Scriptures. How do we show them Christ’s love and acceptance in
      a way that doesn’t condone their actions?

      ●2 For singles to gain a sense of wholeness and belonging can be
      difficult in a culture that holds up marriage as the standard.
      What can you as a class do to reach out to singles in your own
      church and show them they are a valued part of the church fam-
      ily?

Summary: “Family” is God’s idea. He formed the human family as an
     expression of His own relational nature. He has ordained both indi-
     vidual families and the church as a family of families to express His
     sacrificial love within both these circles of close companionship.

Casting Lots Determines the Truth
by STANLEY SAMUEL
   Johnny is a bricklayer in southern India. Most of what he earned went to
buy drinks. His wife kept a cow and sold the milk to feed the family. The
family suffered financially and emotionally from Johnny’s excesses, and
even his colleagues at work worried about him.
   While seeking treatment for their daughter, who had a serious health
problem, the family was introduced to God. They began reading the Bible
and listening to Christian radio programs.
   Johnny noticed that the speakers contradicted one another. He listened
carefully to the messages and looked up the Bible references to validate each
point. Still Johnny could not determine which speaker spoke the truth, so
they decided to cast lots, as the disciples had done in Acts. They fasted and
prayed, then they wrote the names of the radio programs on pieces of paper.
   Johnny held the papers in his hand as his mother drew one out. They read
the program's name: The Voice of Prophecy. From that day on, they listened
only to The Voice of Prophecy. The family did not know that the program is
sponsored by Adventists.
   Shortly after this, a group of Adventist pastors and lay workers visited
Johnny’s village and invited people to attend a Bible study group. When they
reached Johnny’s home, they introduced themselves as representing The
Voice of Prophecy. They invited the family to attend their Bible study group.
Johnny was amazed and told them how God had shown them that this radio
ministry spoke the truth. Johnny’s wife attended the Bible study worship
first, asking the members to pray for her health. When she was healed,
Johnny began attending the Bible study group, as well. They accepted the
Bible truths they learned, and six months later they were baptized.
   Jeeva, Johnny’s daughter, wanted to keep the Sabbath, but she worked six
days a week. She was able to get several Sabbaths off before her supervisor
questioned her reasons for wanting every Saturday off. When she explained
that she wanted to keep the Sabbath, Jeeva was fired. Although disappointed
to lose her job, Jeeva rejoiced that she could worship God on His holy day.
The family praised God that Jeeva was willing to stand firm, and they
prayed that God would bless them in their financial difficulties.
   Johnny’s colleagues noticed that Johnny stopped drinking. He responded
to their questions by inviting them to the Bible study group. Johnny and his

      God’s Word on
      Family Living


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 20:12, Ps. 18:2, Song
      of Solomon, Isa. 54:5, 62:5, John 10:11, 15:5, Eph. 5:21-25.

Memory Text: “For everything that was written in the past was
      written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encour-
      agement of the Scriptures we might have hope” (Romans 15:4,
      NIV).

The Week at a Glance: Within the pages of His Word,
      God has unfolded His plans and purposes for families.

              isitors to a science theater were given special eyeglasses. In the

      V       darkened room the group saw dramatic nature scenes on a
              large screen. First, they looked at the pictures without the
      glasses; afterward, they put the glasses on, and when they did, a photo
      of an orchard in full bloom brought gasps from the crowd: “Oh, how
      magnificent!” “What a difference!” It seemed as if the branches stuck
      out from the screen over their heads. Like these three-dimensional
      glasses, a change of perspective in looking at Scripture can help us see
      and appreciate old truths in fresh ways. This week we will put on
      family glasses and view the different ways in which God in His Word
      has revealed truths about families and family living. This perspective
      transforms the Bible into a contemporary textbook for life in our
      homes, as well as in the church, the household of faith.

     Family Commandments
       One way in which Scripture presents its message on family life is
     through relational directives. Some of these command statements apply
     broadly to all relationships; some address neighborliness and friend-
     ship; while others are given for husbands, wives, parents, and children.

What do the following texts teach us about the kinds of “relational
     directives” we have been given by the Lord?

     Exod. 20:12

     Exod. 20:14

        The quality of marriage and parent-child relationships are impor-
     tant to God. Three of the Ten Commandments focus directly on fam-
     ily life: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exod. 20:12, NKJV),
     “You shall not commit adultery” (vs. 14, NKJV), “You shall not covet
     your neighbor’s wife” (vs. 17, NKJV). Other specific directives flesh
     out God’s expectations for marriage, parent-child relationships, and
     life in families. General relational directives, such as “ ‘love your ene-
     mies’ ” (Matt. 5:44, NIV), “ ‘do to others what you would have them
     do to you’ ” (Matt. 7:12, NIV), and “ ‘love one another’ ” (John 13:34,
     NIV) apply equally to relationships at home.

      Go back over those relational directives and ask yourself, In
      which area(s) do I need to make some changes, and what will it
      take in order for me to make those changes?

     Family Narratives
       Bible stories provide glimpses into people’s lives. The accounts
     show how, over the course of individuals’ lives, they reap the conse-
     quences of their choices and grow in spite of setbacks. Through these
     stories we see how God abides with His people, even through difficult
     times.

Capture the flavor of a Bible narrative by reading Ruth 1 and 2
     (you might even want to read the whole story). What lessons can
     you learn here about family living?


        Not unlike many families today, this Bible family was hit by a series
     of life-changing losses. Famine, relocation to another country, death
     of her husband, and death of both sons left Naomi reeling. As the story
     opens, she despairs, feeling mournful, bitter, and alone. However, as
     this book shows so well, family means committed companionship. It
     means helping one another in troubled times and caring for the help-
     less. Ruth, Naomi’s Moabite daughter-in-law, exhibits extraordinary
     faith in God. She shows this by her loyalty and service to the despondent
     Naomi. Faced with incredible hardship, these two unfortunate
     souls finally get real help from a perceptive wealthy relative—Boaz.
     In fulfilling his legal responsibility (and also obviously acting out of
     love), Boaz marries Ruth. Those who enjoy a love story are treated to
     an example of the One who loves with an everlasting love, who does
     not rest until He, like Boaz, obtains the object of His love. In the end,
     the baby born to Boaz and Ruth softens the painful memories and
     provides joy for the present and hope for the future.
        Ourselves in view. Stories like these are in the Bible for a purpose.
     They instruct, inspire, correct, and train God’s people in right living
     (Rom. 15:4, 2 Tim. 3:16). Readers find themselves in them and take
     comfort in the fact they are not alone in temptation and trial, in strug-
     gles and setbacks. The Scriptures’ honesty about the weaknesses and
     mistakes of others reveals pitfalls and how to avoid them. Further, we
     see good qualities we want to copy for ourselves. God’s longsuffering
     and patience inspire our hearts with courage and hope that He who
     never changes will be with us today also.

      What could you learn from the story of Ruth that could help
      you and your family through a bad time?

     Principles of Relationships
       Quite a different category of scriptural instruction about relation-
     ships is found in the Bible’s presentation of relational principles. The
     book of Proverbs has the greatest collection of this material.

What truths do these examples of relational principles convey? How
     do you think the writer reached his inspired conclusions?

     Prov. 12:25
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Prov. 15:1
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Prov. 17:9
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Prov. 17:22
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Solomon was a keen observer of nature, and because his capital,
     Jerusalem, sat right on the trade routes, he had contacts with people
     from many parts of the world. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, he made a
     special study of people; his careful observations, scattered throughout
     Proverbs, speak of universal principles that govern human feelings
     and reactions.
       Principles implanted by the Creator. The universal principles of
     emotions and relationships Solomon observed reflect the truth
     described by Ellen White when she wrote, “The senses, the faculties
     of the mind . . . were placed under law.”—The Ministry of Healing,
     p. 415. Though sin has damaged God’s creation, human behavior in
     relationships is still shaped by the laws He implanted within human
     beings. To discover and apply the insights gained from these princi-
     ples is to acquire the keys to better family living.

How do you think these implanted relational principles have been
     affected by sin? What difference does the gospel make? Compare
     Matthew 12:34, 35 with Philippians 2:2-11 as you think about
     your answer.



      Like an infectious computer virus, sin corrupts the core of
      human beings, rendering them self-centered and fouling the
      functioning of all their physical, mental, social, emotional, and
      spiritual processes. The gospel puts people right with God and
      with one another through Christ (2 Cor. 5:18, 19).


                                                                         17

      The Royal Love Poem
        Further insights on the principles governing relationships, espe-
      cially the intimate life within marriage, are found in the divinely
      inspired poetry of the Song of Solomon.

Match the verses in Column A with the characteristics of intimate
      relationships found in Column B.

b. Song of Sol. 1:15, 2:14, 4:9, 5:12,   __Being totally honest, open, vul-
6:5.                                     nerable with each other.

c. Song of Sol. 1:2, 2:6, 7:8, 8:3.      __Using terms of endearment, ex-
                                         pressing appreciation, giving affir-
                                         mation and honest compliments.
d. Song of Sol. 1:6, 2:2, 6:5, 8:10.     __Communicating face to face,
                                         making eye contact.
e. Song of Sol. 2:10-13, 17; 7:11,       __Treating each other as friends.

f. Song of Sol. 5:16.                    __Spending time together, playing
                                         together.
g. Song of Sol. 2:16; 6:3; 8:6, 7.       __Showing feelings through touch.

         The Song of Solomon reflects upon the love between Solomon and
      a woman called “Shulamite” or “Shulamith,” who evidently was his
      first true love and leading queen (Song of Sol. 6:9, 13). The poem
      emphasizes aspects of their love rather than a chronological history of
      their relationship.
         God draws back the curtain on marital intimacy. Through the expe-
      riences of this couple, the Bible presents the relationship principles
      involved in forming close friendships and in fashioning the intimate
      love and covenant commitment of marriage. God Himself chose mar-
      riage as a figure of His relationship with His people. Thus, the discov-
      eries of love in this poem afford priceless insights into the grandest love
      relationship of all—the bond between Christ and the soul.

       Why is it important to address the heart as well as the head in
       understanding relationships?

     The Divine Parent and Marriage
     Partner
What family terms and imagery are applied to God in the following
     sets of texts? Isa. 54:5, 62:5, Jer. 31:32 and Isa. 66:12, 13; Jer. 31:9;
     Hos. 11:1.

        God refers to Himself as the Husband of Israel. The imagery is
     repeated in the New Testament, where Christ is the Bridegroom and
     His bride is the church. God also is represented in Scripture as a par-
     ent, usually as a father, though some of the comparisons are maternal;
     for example “like a woman in childbirth” (Isa. 42:14, NIV) or as a
     “hen gathereth her chickens under her wings” (Matt. 23:37).
        Gazing upon the perfect Marriage Partner and Parent. Watching
     others is one of the main ways human beings learn. In His Word God
     permits us to gaze upon Him as the perfect expression of love in mar-
     riage and parenting. The family metaphors for God show us more of
     what our families can be like. They also have the effect of drawing us
     closer to Him as we come to know Him in family terms.
        Principles for study. Comparisons that liken God to a husband or
     parent contain valuable principles for us to study. They are not
     intended, however, to be literal blueprints for the responsibilities of
     married partners or parents. The scriptural imagery is frequently tied
     to local customs. For example, in Ezekiel 16:6-14, God’s association
     with Israel is likened to the betrothal and marital customs of the time
     when a groom spread his garment over the bride, and she, in turn, was
     washed, anointed, and adorned in preparation for the wedding festivi-
     ties. More important, the analogies are limited, because humans are
     not God. All human attempts at intimacy pale into insignificance
     when compared to the constancy, faithfulness, and closeness God dis-
     plays toward those He loves. Yet, we are hopeful, for God has been
     revealed in Jesus Christ. He beckons us to love as He loved and to be
     empowered for such loving through the gift of His Spirit.

      What other Bible images of God might be helpful to those whose
      memories or experiences in a marriage or with parents make
      these family metaphors painful for them? See, for instance, Ps.
      18:2, John 10:11, 15:5.

        Selecting relevant Scripture. Though the Scriptures are the basis for
     understanding God’s plan for family living, not every statement
     applies literally to all people in all eras, such as the death penalty for
     a rebellious son (Deut. 21:18-21) or for a wife who had been sexually
     promiscuous before marriage (Deut. 22:20, 21).

       Detecting God’s will for families as revealed in Scripture today
     involves:
       ●1 Studying the theological and historical context of the message
       ●2 Determining the original meanings of words
       ●3 Comparing texts on a topic with other similar passages, looking
     for corroboration by other Scripture writers, and understanding the
     application and adaptation made by New Testament writers of Old
     Testament material
       ●4 Discovering broad-based principles and even details that apply to
     today’s family issues

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, discuss this question: If there is any one factor that
      is crucial to a healthy family, what is it? Is there more than one
      factor? If so, what are they?

      ●
      2 As a class, go through some of the imagery used to describe
      how God relates to us. Who in the class prefers certain images
      over others, and why? What should these different preferences
      tell us about how God relates to different people?

Summary: Scripture employs a variety of means to convey instruc-
     tion for family living. These include God’s direct commands, various
     marriage and family examples, proverbs describing relationship prin-
     ciples, and His own modeling as a divine Husband and Parent.
     Nurtured and guided by such revelation, family members grow closer
     to Him and to one another.

Like Sheep Among Wolves*
by JEANE ZACHARY
   The Waldensian Christians suffered persecution and death at the hands of the
religious majority in Europe, beginning in the thirteenth century. They lived in
secluded regions and dedicated themselves to sharing the truths of God with
their neighbors in spite of the dangers they faced. Many became door-to-door
salespersons in order to search for honest-hearted people with whom to share
their beliefs. When they discovered someone who was open to God’s message,
they shared precious portions of Scripture with them.
   Today modern Adventists are using similar techniques to bring Christ to
unentered areas of Southeast Asia where few Christians live. These Adventists
volunteer to live and work in unentered communities where they daily face the
threat of persecution. For this reason we will not reveal their location.
   The work is rigorous, and most of the volunteers are young people. So, the
program’s leaders were surprised when Jaibi, well beyond her youth, volun-
teered to go to a distant unentered community to work. She knew that she would
receive housing but would have to earn her income by selling health books. She
was so determined to go that she shared her excitement with friends. By the time
she left, she had recruited 40 other volunteers to go with her.
   Jaibi was asked to supervise her large team. As the group prayed and worked
together, the Holy Spirit opened door after door. They found the community
happy to learn the health principles the volunteers taught. Friendships devel-
oped, and soon small groups formed. It was not long before the volunteers called
a pastor to prepare their interests for baptism.
   Jaibi continued working in the village far beyond her one-year contract. In
three years she and her team had planted five new congregations, a feat that
could never have happened through public evangelism.
   The strength of the Waldensian-style program lies in three things: Door-to-door
visits, offering people valuable health materials; developing friendships that
open the way for small groups to study the Bible; and the power of the Holy
Spirit to open doors and bring conviction to people.
   Some volunteers who came with Jaibi have returned to their homes, but oth-
ers have joined her in this work. So far Jaibi and her team of volunteers have just
witnessed an additional 105 persons baptized as the result of the blessing of the
Lord on their work.
   The inspiring example of the ancient Waldensian volunteers who spread the
gospel through Europe as merchant-evangelists lives on today in Southeast Asia.

      Restoration



      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:26-28; 2:24, 25;
      Gen. 3:1-24; Matt. 19:3-5; Luke 17:21; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 1:4; 6:2;
      Eph. 3:17-19.

Memory Text: “Marriage should be honored by all, and the
      marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all
      the sexually immoral” (Hebrews 13:4, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: Though the institution of mar-
      riage was distorted by sin, the gospel can restore marriage to its
      original purity and beauty.

                arriage was divinely instituted by God as a permanent,

      M         monogamous union of a man and a woman. It was meant to
                be a blessing, another aspect of His great work of creation.
      Marriage was, perhaps, the greatest pre-Fall manifestation of His infi-
      nite love for humanity. How tragic, then, that the openness, equality,
      and mutuality of the first human pair were supplanted by the curse
      brought on by their sin. The race has been living with those dire con-
      sequences ever since. With Christ, however, a new day dawned for the
      institution, as well as for the marital experience of couples. In Him,
      husband and wife may know a restoration of God’s plan for marriage.

     The Genesis Marriage
Jesus discussed marriage in reply to a question about divorce. What
     source did He use? What points did He make? Matt. 19:3-5.
     Compare Gen. 1:26-28; 2:24, 25.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Using Genesis 1 and 2, Christ reaffirmed God’s creation plan for
     marriage. Genesis 1:26-28 presents humankind in two genders, male
     and female (compare Gen. 5:2). They stand as equals before God,
     both in His procreative blessing and in the stewardship over the earth.
     Genesis 2 shows how the male and female were created and how mar-
     riage got started. The need of the first human being for companion-
     ship and sexual fulfillment led God to plan a “helper” for him (Gen.
     2:18, NIV). The word helper frequently describes God in relationship
     to humankind (compare Deut. 33:7, 26, 29). Following the extraordi-
     nary surgery and the exquisite fashioning of this partner, God joined
     them in marriage (Gen. 2:21, 22). Ecstatically, the man acknowledged
     his companion as “woman” (Heb. ishshah)—connected to him but
     separate from himself as “man” (Heb. ish).

What are some of the elements of marriage as outlined in Genesis
     2:24?


        Marriage—a permanent, exclusive union between a male and a
     female—includes (1) leaving father and mother, (2) being joined to
     each other, and (3) becoming one flesh. “Leave” implies the creation
     of a distinct family unit with specific inviolable boundaries. “Joined”
     refers to the couple’s mutual commitment expressed in a formal mar-
     riage covenant. “Becoming one flesh” describes both the sexual union
     and the lifelong process of growth in intimacy, unity, and fulfillment
     that God intends a couple to experience in all aspects of their lives.

      In what ways does the Eden marriage reflect principles that
      should help define our relationship to God?

      Crisis and Consolation
How does the account of the fall into sin present the changed situa-
      tion of marriage and of the marriage partners in their attitudes
      toward God and toward each other? Genesis 3.

         The first couple donned clothes made from fig leaves and hid from
      God in the bushes! Here can be seen the tragic loss of physical, emo-
      tional, and spiritual oneness they had known with their Creator and
      with each other. Neither took responsibility for their actions. Each put
      the blame elsewhere—he blamed her, and she blamed the snake. In
      reality, they put the blame on God, who had created both.

How does Genesis 3:16 present the change in the marital relationship
      that resulted from sin?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Effects of the Fall on marriage. The original mutuality, coregency,
      and equality were replaced by the subjection of the wife to the ruler-
      ship of the husband. Down through history, wives often have been
      viewed as the property of their husbands. Abuse has made many
      women’s circumstances very hard. Ellen White comments on the
      effects of the Fall: “But after Eve’s sin, as she was first in the trans-
      gression, the Lord told her that Adam should rule over her. She was to
      be in subjection to her husband, and this was a part of the curse.”
      —Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 484. The subjection was not
      because she was female but because “she was first in the transgres-
      sion.” Also, the subjection was “part of the curse.”

       In what ways do you see in your own life the tendency to shift
       blame for your actions on others? What practical steps can you
       take to change and be more open to responsibility for what you
       do?

        In biblical thinking, close relationships are bound together by
     covenants. The predominant covenant is one between God and His
     people (Gen. 9:9-17, Isa. 55:3, Heb. 13:20). Human covenants are
     binding commitments that include promises, privileges, and obliga-
     tions—key factors in any marriage. These commitments, made before
     God, endeavor to bring the qualities of divine faithfulness into human
     relationships, where promises are so often unreliable (compare Deut.
     7:9).
        The prophet Ezekiel uses the human marriage covenant to describe
     God in His relationship to His bride, Israel (Ezek. 16:8). The marriage
     covenant is violated when the marital union has in some way been des-
     ecrated; for example, when an adulterous wife leaves “the partner of
     her youth,” ignoring “the covenant she made before God” (Prov. 2:17,
     NIV), or when a husband repudiates the wife of his youth, the wife of
     his “marriage covenant” (Mal. 2:14, NIV). Sacred promises made at
     the beginning of marriage—in one’s “youth”—are intended to be hon-
     ored throughout life.

      Why is death to self so important in keeping any marriage
      strong? In what areas might you need more of this death in any
      of your relationships?

     Restoration in Christ
       “Marriage has been perverted by sin; but it is the purpose of the
     gospel to restore its purity and beauty.”—Ellen G. White, Thoughts
     From the Mount of Blessing, p. 64.

How does the Bible portray the work of Christ in restoring what was
     lost through sin? Luke 17:21, 2 Cor. 5:17, Gal. 1:4, Eph. 3:17-19.
     What are the implications of these texts for marriage?


        Though they await the release from the presence of sin, subjects of
     Christ’s kingdom of grace are freed from sin’s penalty and power.
     Believers seek to pattern their lives and relationships in harmony with
     Christ’s will. For marriage, the Creator becomes Re-creator. By His
     indwelling Spirit He calls and enables couples to exhibit love and
     grace in their marriage. Eden lost can be Eden regained. By the study
     of His plan, by prayer, and by His power married couples may grow
     more and more toward marriage as it once was, with its spiritual, emo-
     tional, and physical intimacy.

What principle helps counteract the power of sin? Matt. 20:20-28;
     John 13:4, 5, 12-17; compare Phil. 2:5-8.


What specific words does Paul give to wives and to husbands? Eph.
     5:22-33.


       “The gospel emphasizes the love and submission of husband and wife
     to one another (1 Cor. 7:3, 4; Eph. 5:21). The model for the husband’s
     leadership is the self-sacrificial love and service that Christ gives to the
     church (Eph. 5:24, 25). Both Peter and Paul speak about the need for
     respect in the marriage relationship (1 Peter 3:7; Eph. 5:22, 23).”

     and Herald® Pub. Assoc.) revised 2000, 16th edition, pp. 192, 193.

      If married, what changes can you make in order to allow more
      fully the principles of the gospel to control your marriage? If
      unmarried, in what ways can these principles help you in other
      relationships?

     The Creation Plan in a Fallen World
How did Jesus acknowledge both the divine plan for marriage and
     the reality confronting marriage in a fallen world? Matt. 19:3-9.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus restated God’s plan for marriage as a permanent union of a
     man and a woman. Christ’s followers seek to uphold this plan, know-
     ing that what He desires He also enables by His grace and the
     indwelling of His Spirit. Christians have a special obligation to
     approach marriage prayerfully, to choose their partners wisely, and to
     prepare carefully for the transition to marriage. Then, in marriage,
     they must sacredly guard their commitment to each other, seeking
     diligently for God’s grace in the work of adjusting to each other and
     growing together.
       Hardness of human hearts. While marriage is divinely instituted, its
     subjects are fallen human beings. Marriages between Christian men
     and women do sometimes break down. Jesus acknowledged that hard-
     ness of human hearts led to the concession of divorce by Moses (Matt.
     19:8; compare Deut. 24:1-4), though Jesus Himself was very explicit
     about how He viewed divorce.
       When a marriage is in crisis, those who are able to minister to them
     should do everything possible to help them experience reconciliation.
     Divorce never should be taken lightly. Scripture provides guidance for
     restoring damaged relationships (Hos. 3:1-3; 1 Cor. 7:10, 11; 13:4-7;
     Gal. 6:1). When divorce has occurred, former partners should be
     encouraged to seek divine grace to help them examine their experi-
     ence and to learn the will of God for their lives. God provides com-
     fort to those who have been wounded. He also accepts the heartfelt
     repentance of individuals who commit the most destructive sins, even
     those that carry with them irreparable consequences.

      How is it possible for the church both to uphold God’s plan for
      marriage and to be a community that shows understanding,
      provides compassion, and assists believers in rebuilding their
      lives after divorce?

        Entering marriage intelligently. “The family tie is the closest, the
     most tender and sacred, of any on earth. It was designed to be a bless-
     ing to mankind. And it is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant
     is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due consider-
     ation for its responsibilities.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home,
     p. 18.
        Rulership. “Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for ruler-
     ship. The Lord has laid down the principle that is to guide in this mat-
     ter. The husband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church.
     And the wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to cultivate
     the spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or injure the
     other.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 47.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Read the second Ellen G. White quote aloud in class. Discuss
      the principles expressed there. What, if followed, would these
      principles do for just about any marriage?

      ●
      2 Keeping your answers to the previous question in mind,
      answer, as a class, this question: What factors are, so often, the
      cause of divorce?

      ●
      3 How, at least in certain ways, are the principles of a good mar-
      riage similar to the principles that could help someone maintain
      other kinds of healthy relationships?

      ●
      4 As a class, make up a single paragraph, a kind of official
      declaration, of what marriage vows should be.

Summary: Though sin has damaged marriage, God through Christ is
     working in us to restore what we have lost.

Pathfinders Open Doors
by SETH NYARANGA
  The Turkana people of northern Kenya knew little of the Adventist faith.
But when believers in the region organized a Pathfinder Club for these
people, many of the Turkana children joined.
  The children took part in many of the activities Pathfinders around the
world enjoy, but they also engaged in their own form of evangelism, visit-
ing villages where groups of believers met and leading out in Pathfinder
Clubs there. Children from other Protestant denominations begged to join
Pathfinders and were welcomed into the clubs. Some Protestant churches
even asked if they could organize their own Pathfinder Clubs.
  A camporee was planned that would incorporate these other Protestant
Pathfinder Clubs, using the camporee to introduce young people from
other faiths to the Adventist beliefs.
  Marching and drilling attracts much attention and interest in Africa, and
many young people join just to learn marching skills.
  The watchman at a Pathfinder camporee watched the young people take
part in their activities. He visited the evening meetings and listened to
Bible stories and the Christian songs the children eagerly sang. Later he
asked some of the leaders how he could enroll his son in Pathfinders and
was delighted to learn that there was a Pathfinder Club nearby that his son
could join. The watchman brought his son and stayed to watch the pro-
gram for a few minutes.
  The boy continued to attend Pathfinders, though it was a long walk from
his home. He found a church with a Pathfinder Club closer to home.
Because of this boy’s involvement in Pathfinders, he and his parents have
been baptized.
  This story has been repeated over and over as parents see the benefits of
Pathfinders for their children. Children invite their parents to attend spe-
cial events held in the church, and the parents are introduced to Adventist
beliefs.
  Once, while Pathfinders were holding a camporee, they learned that a
neighbor’s calf had fallen into a reservoir and was in danger of drowning.
Some of the Pathfinder leaders quickly rescued the calf. When the owner
learned what had happened, he was impressed. Some members of this
man’s family have begun attending church because of the Pathfinders’
help.
  Every activity of our churches can become a means of evangelism when
we invite those around us to join.

SETH NYARANGA is a Pathfinder leader and a student of accounting at the University of
Eastern Africa in Baraton, Kenya.

      Living With Lambs




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 16:1; Deut. 8:5; Pss.
      30:1-9; 50:10-12; 127:3; Prov. 3:11, 12; Mic. 6:8.

Memory Text: “He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers
      the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gen-
      tly leads those that have young” (Isaiah 40:11, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: To have children is to be a parent-
      steward. And God, in His Word, gives parent-stewards instruction
      on how to execute their responsibilities faithfully.

              hildren, indeed, are gifts from God; outside of life itself (both

      C       temporal and eternal), they are the most wonderful of all gifts.
              Yet, the greater the gift, the greater the responsibility upon
      those who receive the gift. Thus, a precious opportunity, and solemn
      calling, is open to all parents to share with their children the simple
      good news of Jesus’ love and life-giving power. However important it
      is to impart to our children the good news of Jesus and what He has
      done for us all, children grasp truth first, not so much from what the
      Bible teaches but from what their parents live. This week we’ll look at
      some of the instructions the Gift-Giver gave to those whom He gave
      such precious gifts.

     A Unique Stewardship
        When God created the first human couple, He gave them dominion
     over the earth. Along with this stewardship, they were privileged to
     bear and rear children. The Bible considers children to be gifts from
     God. Actually, children belong to Him; parents are, therefore,
     accountable to God for the way they treat these offspring. “Children
     are the heritage of the Lord, and we are answerable to Him for our
     management of His property.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home,
     p. 159.

What do you think it means for children to be God’s “property”?
     Study Psalms 50:10-12; 127:3; Isaiah 43:1, 7; and 1 Peter 2:9 as
     you answer. How does this idea change the way we should perceive
     children? What do these texts tell parents about their responsibil-
     ity and obligations toward their children?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Everything is God’s by right of creation and by redemption, as well.
     Though Satan claimed to be the rightful ruler of this planet after sin,
     God reclaimed His rulership of the world through Christ. This
     reclaiming includes everyone, even children. Parents must always
     remember whose children their children really are. This is certainly
     one case where no one wants to be deemed an “unjust steward” (Luke
     16:8).

When you think of parenting as a unique stewardship, what insights
     come to mind? Why is this kind of stewardship different from
     every other kind? What might faithful stewardship of children
     mean? 1 Cor. 4:2.
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      Good managers ask advice from the owner of the property they
      manage. Godly parents likewise seek through prayer and Bible
      study to be guided as they rear their children. Manoah and his
      wife asked the right questions, “How shall we order the child
      [Samson], and how shall we do unto him?” (Judges 13:12).

      Momentous Decisions
        Throughout time, couples have generally expected to be parents.
      Children continued the family line, provided companionship, helped
      with work, and cared for aging parents. Like Rachel, women often
      connected their sense of value to bearing children (Gen. 30:1).

Consider these comments from married couples about to have a
      baby. Which ones represent good reasons for bearing a child?
      Which do not, and why not?
        ●1 “We thought a child would help cement our marriage.”
        ●2 “I’ve always wanted a baby since the time I played with dolls.”
        ●3 “We love each other and want to share that love with
        a child.”
        ●
        4 “We weren’t trying to get pregnant; it was an accident, really.”



         Becoming parents is an important choice. The decisions about
      whether to bear or adopt children and how many to have should be
      thoughtful ones. What purpose would a child serve? Will God be hon-
      ored if a new life is brought into the world? Do we have the emotional
      and physical resources and the long-term commitment to provide for
      all the needs of a child (1 Tim. 5:8)? Rearing children can be difficult
      in troubled times (Mark 13:17).
         On the other hand, children have a way of helping families to be
      more affectionate, patient, and selfless. Few joys compare with join-
      ing the Creator in the formation of a new person and experiencing the
      wonder of life alongside a growing child.

What impact did infertility have on some Bible families? What do you
      think might have been done differently to ease these situations?
      Gen. 16:1, 2; 30:1-9; 1 Sam. 1:1-20.

        Many couples struggle to understand why God withholds children
      from them. Much soul-searching, quarreling, and domestic turmoil
      often result. We should not judge such couples then or now too hastily.
      Sensitivity toward couples without children spares them from unfeel-
      ing remarks. They should receive accurate information and counsel
      when they ask for it and be given privacy to decide the best course to
      follow.

      Lessons From the Heavenly Parent
        The Bible describes God as a Parent. Jesus called God “Father” and
      introduced Him in winsome ways (Matt. 5:16; 6:9, 14, 15, 18). God
      wants to be Father to each of us personally. This picture of God com-
      plements the view of those who grew up in loving homes, while those
      who had difficulty relating to a parent may have trouble trusting Him.
      All who come to God, however, are treated with the care that only this
      Parent, the most attached and nurturing of all fathers, can give. Before
      we parent our children, we must be parented by Him.

What parental responsibilities are seen in God’s relationship with His
      people? What guidance for parenting today does this provide?



   God as Parent         Responsibility      Guidance for Our Parenting
Deut. 1:31, John 6:33-
35, Phil. 4:19
Ps. 32:8, Isa. 54:13,
Hos. 11:3
Deut. 8:5; Prov. 3:11,
12; Heb. 12:5-7

         God’s love especially helps parents who have invested heavily in
      their children only to have them reject values that are dear. “ ‘When
      Israel was a child, I loved him. . . . But the more I called Israel, the
      further they went from me’ ” (Hos. 11:1, 2, NIV). God experienced all
      the emotions parents know when teenagers ignore counsel, behave in
      disappointing ways, or turn their backs on home. He values human
      freedom. He can guide parents to know how or whether to pursue a
      wayward one or to acknowledge an adult child’s decision and wait, as
      did the father of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32).

       How is God’s attitude toward those who reject Him helpful to
       parents in dealing with wayward children? In what way does
       knowing that He knows the pain of rejection bring comfort and
       encouragement to troubled parents?

     Doing What Is Good for Children
      “He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the
     Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to
     walk humbly with your God?” (Mic. 6:8, RSV).

How should parents use these principles in regard to how they raise
     their children?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Ellen White elevated the importance of kindness and firmness in
     dealing with children: “The combined influence of authority and love
     will make it possible to hold firmly and kindly the reins of family
     government.”—The Adventist Home, p. 308. Current parenting
     research shows the significance of control and support to the devel-
     opment of emotionally healthy, well-functioning children. Support
     refers to demonstrations of warmth, affection, and sense of belonging
     that convey the respect of parents for children. Control has to do with
     parents providing structure, regulation, boundaries, and restraints in
     their children’s lives that help children respect themselves and others.
     “Kindness” and “support,” “firmness” and “control” express qualities
     within the biblical concepts of Micah 6:8.
Evaluate the parenting practices in these families: Jacob (Gen.
     37:3, 4), Manoah and his wife (Judg. 14:1-3), Eli (1 Sam. 2:22-25,
     3:13). How could parenting with both firmness and kindness have
     made a difference? What practical changes would be necessary in
     order to incorporate both?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Optimal parenting involves an abundance of warmth, affection, and
     affirmation, as well as appropriate limits, with realistic expectations
     appropriate to the child’s age. Rules are few, consequences are clear,
     and there is follow-through on consequences. In homes where firm-
     ness and kindness are found together, the likelihood that children will
     adopt their parents’ values is increased. They also will develop
     morally in keeping with their ages and be socially responsible and
     caring in relationships with others.

     Shepherding a Child’s Heart
        Research confirms what many parents and teachers know
     already—children do have an active spiritual life. They believe God is
     important in their lives. Jesus honored children and taught us about
     their spiritual development.

How did Jesus relate to children? What did He say regarding their
     faith? Matt. 18:2-5; Mark 9:36, 37, 41.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus affirmed the faith of children. This faith can be cultivated by
     the emotional security caring parents provide. If it is safe to ask any
     question, to talk about any topic at home, then children will learn to
     be comfortable talking anything over with God. When home is a car-
     ing place where one’s needs are met, when parents are both physically
     and emotionally available to children, the young readily learn that
     God can be counted on to care for them. When children are made
     aware of how precious they are to their caregivers, it will help them
     to understand that God values them too.

What was Christ’s warning to those who would offend children or
     cause them to sin? Matt. 18:5, 6; Mark 9:42.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Attitudes or actions toward a child that emotionally or physically
     harm him or her make it hard for the young person to believe in or
     trust in God. When sexual abuse of a child takes place, especially by
     a parent, betrayal goes to the deepest places of the soul. What follows
     is an often-lifelong struggle to relate to the perfect love of God or to
     the affection of a mate. An experience with the grace of God; life in
     a healing, accepting environment; and the guidance of trained coun-
     selors have enabled many such individuals to cope with these scars.

      How does your relationship with the heavenly Shepherd influ-
      ence the shepherding of your flock? What changes would you
      like to make in your approach to your child or to the children
      with whom you live or work?

       One such correction enough for a lifetime. “Whipping may be nec-
     essary when other resorts fail, yet she [the parent] should not use the
     rod if it is possible to avoid doing so. But if milder measures prove
     insufficient, punishment that will bring the child to its senses should
     in love be administered. Frequently one such correction will be
     enough for a lifetime, to show the child that he does not hold the lines
     of control.”—Page 250.

      (and where appropriate), why not plan some activities in which
      your class can help these children?

Summary: Children are younger members of the Lord’s family. As
     responsible stewards, Christian couples seek God’s guidance in the
     decision regarding whether to be parents and in the number of children
     they can appropriately care for. God supplies an abundance of instruc-
     tion in His Word for His parent-stewards. His own providing, teach-
     ing, and correcting of His people offer important instruction.

Breaking Ties With Satan
by VOLODICHIEV ALEXANDER
   I returned from Russian military service, feeling spiritually empty. I
had grown up in a Communist family and did not know God. Some Satan
worshipers invited me to join them, and I discovered religion. I attended
their worship services until a devil-possessed girl began speaking to me in
a man’s voice. I was terrified.
   My grandmother had told me, “If you are afraid, recite the “Our Father,”
the Lord’s Prayer. I recited the prayer loudly, trying to drown out the girl.
She pointed a finger at me and laughed furiously, but I chanted the prayer
over and over.
   I felt powerless in the face of this demon, as if I were trying to stop a
military tank with a stick. I realized that I needed a stronger power, and
the only power stronger than Satan was—God, the very Person I was rail-
ing against.
   As I repeated the Lord’s Prayer aloud, in my heart I was pleading, God,
if You exist, protect me from this evil. As soon as I prayed, the girl fell
down, silent. Suddenly everyone in the room became quiet. I ran past the
girl and never returned.
   Leaving the satanic church left an emptiness in my heart, a spiritual
longing I did not know how to fill. But how could I get to know God? I
began my search in my grandmother's church. The services were beauti-
ful, but they seemed formal and cold. I did not find God there.
Disappointed, I stopped trying and started drinking and smoking mari-
juana to drown my confusion.
   One day some friends invited me to go with them to some evangelistic
meetings to heckle the speaker. I went along. After several meetings, in
spite of our bad manners, someone invited us to visit a house church. We
went, and to our surprise, we liked it. Soon several of my heckling friends
and I accepted Jesus as our Savior.
   I remembered the books on the occult that I kept in my parents’ home.
I returned one night to retrieve the books and burn them. But the family
awoke and began shouting at me for removing the books. I realized what
a strong hold Satan had on my family, as well as on me. I wavered, but with
prayer I was able to destroy the books and know God’s complete forgive-
ness. A week later I was baptized.
   God took a Satan worshiper and made him a disciple of Jesus. He has
blessed my life beyond all I could have imagined and made it beautiful. I
praise His name. Thank you for your weekly mission offerings, which
helped make possible my introduction to Jesus.
VOLODICHIEV ALEXANDER is a pastor in Briansk, Russia.

      Disciples Making Disciples




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 29:38-42; Prov.
      1:8; 22:6; Matt. 28:18, 19; John 8:31; 13:35; Rom. 8:28; Eph. 6:1-
      4.

Memory Text: “ ‘All your children shall be taught by the Lord,
      and great shall be the peace of your children’ ” (Isaiah 54:13,
      NKJV).

The Week at a Glance: Parents are called to lead their
      children to embrace godly values and to introduce them to the
      Lord.

             ike an Olympic runner passing a torch, Moses sought to put

      L      faith in the hands of those who followed him. One thing was
             clear to Moses: Home is irreplaceable as a setting in which par-
      ents and children grasp faith in God, live it, and hold on to it. The
      greatness of the nation depends upon faithfulness to God’s Word at
      home. Throughout its pages the Bible is concerned with enabling chil-
      dren to receive the heritage of faith of their parents and grandparents.
      Themes of Deuteronomy echo in Proverbs and Ephesians. These all
      offer guidance and hope to parent disciples who would make disciples
      of their children.

      Parent Disciples
Jesus commissioned His followers to go everywhere and make disci-
      ples. Earlier, He had defined what He meant by disciple. Study the
      definitions Jesus gave. In what way does His teaching about mak-
      ing disciples and being disciples help define the mission of the
      Christian home? Matt. 28:18, 19; John 8:31; 13:35; compare Deut.
      6:6-9.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        A disciple is one who follows his master’s teaching (John 8:31).
      This kind of disciple is formed by sharing the truths of Christ so
      another person absorbs them. Elsewhere, Jesus defined disciples as
      individuals who know how to love others (John 13:35). Making disci-
      ples by this definition means helping people become the kind of indi-
      viduals who love God and love people.
        Parents as disciple makers. The family is a natural place to carry out
      Jesus’ marching orders. Parents have a mission to attract children to
      Jesus and to invite them to be His disciples. Both definitions for making
      and being disciples apply to the Christian home. Family is the primary
      place in which children absorb truths and values. It is also in their
      families that children get their first messages about love and loving. A
      loving relationship with parents who dearly love Jesus and bring that
      love into their relationships with others increases the likelihood that a
      child will grow up loving Jesus and others too. Such children are apt
      to be more successful with their own children and likely will be able
      to form friendships that most naturally lead to fruitful witnessing.

What is the prerequisite for parents before attempting to guide chil-
      dren spiritually? Deut. 6:5, 6; compare Deut. 6:18.

      ____________________________________________________________________

       Why is it more important to rear children to know a perfect
       Savior than to rear perfect children? Think about your personal
       experience with the good news of the gospel. What is your testi-
       mony of faith you would like your children to know about?

      Spiritual Education at Home
How does Moses convey the all-important need for parents to focus
      their attention on sharing God’s truth with their children? Deut.
      6:7. What special challenges face latter-day parents who stand
      near the border of the heavenly Promised Land?


         “Teach diligently” or “impress” (NIV) is the same as “whet” (Deut.
      32:41) or “sharpen” (NIV). As mothers and fathers share their spir-
      itual experience with their sons and daughters, they “sharpen” these
      young “arrows” and help prepare them for the spiritual challenges
      they will face. The pairs of expressions “sit”—“walk” and “lie
      down”—“get up” convey that the sharing is incessant and persistent
      and involved with all life’s activities. Faith sharing takes time.

What does Solomon say is the intent of his parental instruction? Prov.
      2:1-9, 3:5-8.


         The passing of faith to the next generation is not an exact science.
      Even godly, attentive parents understand that they can perform only
      half the task. As youth mature they make choices and, ultimately, will
      assemble their own set of values. Christian parents do want their chil-
      dren to have freedom of choice but sometimes fear that their children
      might not make responsible choices. Proverbs pleads with youth to
      learn from their elders, to lay aside their youthful invincibility and
      self-sufficiency—their “own understanding”—and give God the con-
      trol of their lives. Yet, Proverbs also upholds human freedom of choice
      and repeatedly endeavors to engage the minds and hearts of young
      people so they will choose God’s way.

       Contemporary research has demonstrated an unfavorable com-
       parison between the amount of focused attention given by par-
       ents to their children (sometimes only seconds per day) and the
       amount of time children spend with television, video games, and
       computers. What can parents do to make a difference? Is qual-
       ity time the answer? How do parents compete with high-tech
       toys and television or anything else that steals time that could be
       better spent?

     Family Worship
What experience of morning and evening worship did God’s people
     have in Old Testament times? Exod. 29:38-42. What spiritual les-
     sons can we, today, draw from this ancient practice of the
     Israelites?


        The offering of a yearling lamb morning and evening at the temple
     took place at regular times each day when the Israelites worshiped the
     Lord. At these times they remembered their covenant history and
     expressed anew their faith in God as their Savior. Every sacrifice pre-
     figured the death of Christ, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
     world (Rev. 13:8). “In this custom Christians have an example for
     morning and evening prayer. While God condemns a mere round of
     ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He looks with great pleas-
     ure upon those who love Him, bowing morning and evening to seek
     pardon for sins committed and to present their requests for needed
     blessings.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 354.
        Prayer is so important for family life. The members of such fami-
     lies, drawn close by a common faith, gain strength from one another
     in fighting the battles of life. They experience a peace that is unknown
     in families that have not made Christ the center of their lives. Surveys
     of youth indicate that regular worship at home with their family does
     enhance the quality of their spiritual development and increase the
     likelihood they will accept their parents’ values and continue their
     family’s heritage of faith.
        The best time of the day. Ellen White offers the hope that family
     worship can be the best time of the day when it is regular, “short and
     spirited,” “intensely interesting,” and “full of life.”—Child Guidance,
     pp. 521, 522. Family worship should be varied from time to time. It
     can include a few Bible verses and brief comments, time for the young
     to ask questions, singing, prayer, and parental sharing of their stories
     of faith. Children should have a part in the selection and presentation
     of Scripture, stories, songs, and other activities.

      When were some of your most memorable experiences with
      family worship? What can parents do to create more of these
      memorable experiences? How do children’s questions provide
      opportunities for faith sharing?

     Winsome Witness to Your Child
Read Proverbs 22:6. What principle is expressed here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The words train up are closely related to a word for “initiate,” which
     describes the way a midwife helped a newborn, reluctant to take the
     mother’s breast. By rubbing the baby’s gums with a tasty substance
     like date juice, she started the sucking response. “The way” likely
     means “the way he ought to go”; as in “the way of wisdom” and “right
     paths” (Prov. 4:11, 2:20), though it has become popular in Christian
     child-rearing literature to read “his way” or “the way he should go” as
     “according to his individual aptitude.” Taken together, the verse con-
     veys the thought that, like the midwife luring the infant into taking the
     mother’s milk, parenting children and adolescents is about making
     godly values winsome and attractive, creating a thirst for spiritual
     things youth will find irresistible.
        Some parents whose children have rejected their beliefs feel anx-
     ious or guilty when they read Proverbs 22:6. They assume their son’s
     or daughter’s loss of spiritual interest was caused by their poor par-
     enting. Proverbs, however, presents probabilities rather than promises.
     This proverb is not intended to imply that the future choices of chil-
     dren always will be in line with their upbringing, whether that
     upbringing was wholesome or unwholesome. Rather than taxing par-
     ents with the impossible weight of moral responsibility for their
     child’s future (which is the responsibility of the adult child), the
     proverb conveys the thought that wholesome attitudes toward spiritual
     things, developed in childhood, tend to linger into maturity.

      What kind of practical advice and encouragement would you
      give to some parents whose older children have wandered from
      the Lord? How might the following texts, and the principles
      behind them, be of help? Luke 15:11-22, Rom. 8:28, 2 Pet. 3:9,
      Rev. 16:7.

     A Service of Love
What is the counsel in Ephesians to children? What are the unique
     features of the parenting instruction that follows? How are these
     two ideals related to each other? Eph. 6:1-4.


        The validity of the commandment to “ ‘honor your father and
     mother’ ” (NIV) continues for Christians. The plural “parents” (Eph.
     6:1) indicates that the child honors both. A mutual partnership in par-
     enting is in view here; mothers are not to bear the responsibility
     alone. The apostle adds a qualifier to a child’s obedience—the phrase
     “in the Lord.” Children are not expected to obey those commands or
     expectations of their parents that are contrary to the Christian faith
     (compare Acts 5:29).
        The overall instruction to parents surely applies to both fathers and
     mothers, but “fathers” is specifically used. This may be because the
     management and discipline of the household typically rested with
     them or because, as was the case with fathers then and now, their par-
     enting style and use of power could exasperate and embitter their off-
     spring.
        “Exasperate” (Eph. 6:4, NIV) means “to rouse to wrath, to provoke,
     exasperate, anger.” Parents must be sensitive to the individual emo-
     tional needs of their adolescent children and accompany their regula-
     tions by relationship building. “Nurture and admonition,” or “training
     and instruction” (NIV), express the intention that children are to be
     reared in a manner that includes discipline and godly values.
        Here again is a qualifying phrase—“of the Lord.” The parenting
     described in these verses is Christian in nature, and its most signifi-
     cant task is helping children to have a relationship with God and an
     appreciation of eternal things. The teaching of Jesus shapes Christian
     parenting. Christian parenting, as described in these verses, is a serv-
     ice of love that Christian mothers and fathers render to their children.

      What is your relationship to your parents? What changes might
      you need to make in order to be sure that you are, indeed, hon-
      oring them?

         A sacred trust from father to son. “In his childhood, Joseph had
      been taught the love and fear of God. Often in his father’s tent, under
      the Syrian stars, he had been told the story of the night vision at
      Bethel, of the ladder from heaven to earth, and the descending and
      ascending angels, and of Him who from the throne above revealed
      Himself to Jacob. He had been told the story of the conflict beside the
      Jabbok, when, renouncing cherished sins, Jacob stood conqueror, and
      received the title of a prince with God. . . .
         “By communion with God through nature and the study of the great
      truths handed down as a sacred trust from father to son, he had gained
      strength of mind and firmness of principle.”—Ellen G. White,
      Education, p. 52.

Discussion Questions:
       ●
       1 If some people in class are willing, have them talk about their
       relationship with their parents and/or children and what things
       they have learned from those experiences that could help others
       in the class better relate to either their parents or children.

       ●2 What special stresses in values transmission to children are
       faced by parents in troubled marriages, by single parents, or by
       those who are married to non-Christians or members of other
       faiths? How might your class be of practical help in such situa-
       tions?

Summary: The passing of faith to the next generation is a concern
      expressed throughout Scripture. When vibrant faith in God and His
      Word is found first in parents, it manifests itself in every aspect of
      their life with their children.

Louder Than Words
by GAIL SCHATZSCHNEDIER
  “We want Arshad! We want ADRA!” the Muslim villagers demanded to
the government official. But who was Arshad, and what was ADRA? The
Pakistani official did not know. He had come to the village to inquire why
the villagers had refused to allow their children to be vaccinated against a
serious outbreak of polio.
  For 10 years the villagers had allowed Arshad Inayat and his team of
ADRA workers to enter their villages in southern Pakistan. They knew
Arshad, and they trusted him to vaccinate the children. But when funding
ran out, Arshad and the ADRA workers had to stop their work.Then a seri-
ous outbreak of polio erupted, and the children needed vaccinations. In
desperation the government official told his assistants, “Go find Arshad,
and find ADRA!”
  The government health officials called Karachi Adventist Hospital and
found Arshad. They told him the problem and pleaded with him to return
to the village and vaccinate the children.
  When Arshad returned to the villages, the Muslim women asked him,
“Where have you been? We have prayed to Allah for you to return.”
Arshad vaccinated the children, and with funds from other countries, he
installed hand pumps for the wells that his team constructed in the rural
villages that had no water.
  Sometime later Arshad and a government official entered the courtyard
of a mullah, a Muslim holy man. Hundreds of Muslims had come to see
this man and ask for his blessings. Many had brought offerings of cattle
and sheep. When the government official introduced Arshad, the mullah
replied, “Yes, I know you.” Then the mullah turned to the waiting people
and said, “Mr. Arshad is a Christian man. He has helped our poor, vacci-
nated their children against diseases. He has taught them how to be healthy
and has drilled wells in the villages that had no water.” Then the mullah
asked the crowd, “What have you done for the poor?” The mullah contin-
ued to chide the waiting crowd for neglecting the poor.
  In Pakistan, Christians are not allowed to speak to Muslims about their
belief in Christ. But this mullah had spoken in Arshad's stead. As an aston-
ished Arshad listened, this mullah had told the crowd more than Arshad
ever dared say on behalf of Christ.
  Arshad’s quiet, faithful deeds had not gone unnoticed. In fact, they had
spoken louder than words.

      Wise Words for Families




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Prov. 5:3-14; 13:22;
      14:26; 17:22; 23:13; 31:10-31; Matt. 19:5; 1 Cor. 7:3, 4.

Memory Text: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean
      not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge
      Him, and He shall direct your paths” (Proverbs 3:5, 6, NKJV).

The Week at a Glance: The book of Proverbs presents
      powerful, practical advice for marriage and family to those who
      will listen.

             he book of Proverbs contains a combination of instructions,

      T      poems, questions, and wise sayings filled with practical wis-
             dom. Family relationships are directly addressed, and other
      words of wisdom can be applied to the home. Proverbs is, in fact, cast
      as a family document in which keys to a godly life are handed down
      from parent to child. Just as parents might write a letter of advice to a
      son or daughter going off to college, setting up his or her separate
      dwelling, or taking a job away from home, so Proverbs is addressed
      from father to son, “My son, hear the instruction of your father, and
      do not forsake the law of your mother” (Prov. 1:8, NKJV).
      Deuteronomy directs parents to share their convictions with the next
      generation. This is what Proverbs does. In the father’s summons, we
      hear the voice of the heavenly Father calling us to learn.

     Love the Right Woman
List the problems and consequences involved with a sexual liaison
     before marriage or an extramarital affair as depicted in Proverbs
     5:3-14.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The godly person reserves (if not married) and preserves (if mar-
     ried) his or her deepest affections and sexual intimacy for marriage.
     Men specifically are addressed in Proverbs, but the same idea as it
     relates to women is expressed in the Song of Solomon (compare Song
     of Sol. 4:12-15). The powerful attraction of illicit love must be
     weighed against the horrific consequences of this sin. Casual sexual
     liaisons lack commitment and, therefore, fall far short of true inti-
     macy. Material, physical, and emotional resources are squandered.
     Most important, one must answer to God for the choices made in life.
        Sexual intimacy, one of God’s greatest gifts to humans, is a privi-
     lege of marriage only (Matt. 19:5; 1 Cor. 7:3, 4; Heb. 13:4). In
     Proverbs the imagery of nourishing, plentiful water is used as a deli-
     cate symbol of the pleasure and satisfaction a married couple ought to
     obtain in their love together. This is contrasted with the waste that
     results when there is unfaithfulness. The use of “the wife of your
     youth” (Prov. 5:18, NKJV) indicates that, even when the two grow
     older, their commitment is to continue. A husband is still ravished
     (“intoxicated” [vs. 19, margin, NKJV]) by his wife’s charms.
        In the human fallen condition, sexual instincts can lure individuals
     away from the divine design for sexuality. However, God has also
     given humanity the power to reason and to choose. These temptations,
     if not continually suppressed, can become overwhelming. A firm com-
     mitment to the divine design for sexuality in marriage can prevent the
     development of illicit sexual relationships. The choice of lifelong
     faithfulness to God’s design for sexuality in marriage not only is pru-
     dent but carries its own bountiful rewards.

      If you knew someone struggling with sexual temptations that
      could destroy a marriage, what counsel would you give that
      person?

         The characters of fathers have a direct impact on their children and
      the legacy they pass on to them. Children look to their fathers for sup-
      port, devoted affection, guidance, and modeling. Proverbs lauds those
      fathers who are reliable providers and wise managers of family
      resources. Many are the ways in which “a greedy man brings trouble
      to his family” (Prov. 15:27, NIV); fathers must be mindful to give pri-
      ority to family over work. Godly fathers seek to be patient and in com-
      mand of their emotions. They respect their children’s dependence
      upon them. They discipline their children but are careful not to abuse
      their position of authority. Most important, dedicated fathers want to
      follow God, to be controlled by His love and by the teaching of His
      Word, that they might guide the feet of their children in the right way.
         In the end, the most important thing a father can do for his children
      is to love their mother. His faithfulness and continuing affection for
      her, or the lack of these, have a telling effect upon children’s well-
      being even into adulthood.
         In Proverbs, loyalty to God, commitment to marriage and family,
      and integrity in one’s personal and community life are key themes.
      Success in everything depends upon the condition of the individual
      heart. The attractions of sin—whether sex, sloth, wealth, or power—
      abound, but the wise husband and father looks to God for help to make
      right choices continually.

       How are the moral principles expressed here important for any-
       one, whether or not a father? How have your actions, either for
       good or bad, impacted others, especially children? In what ways
       might you need to be more careful?

     Correction With Love
What does Proverbs teach about the importance of discipline and
     correction of a child? Prov. 10:17; 23:13, 14; 29:1; 29:15.


        Parents sometimes discipline their children to impress upon them
     what is socially unacceptable behavior, to punish for disobedience, or
     even to express their displeasure when embarrassed. But what is God’s
     intention regarding discipline for these young members of His family?
     Proverbs sets discipline in the context of hope for the future (Prov.
     19:18). Godly parents know that children have a sinful nature. Only
     one power can help them with this, and this power is Christ (see Ellen
     G. White, Education, p. 29). The mission of Christian parenting,
     including discipline, is to lead children to God.
         Supporting a tender plant. Through Christ discipline is seen not as
     punishment, nor an expression of authority, but as redemptive correc-
     tion. God’s plan is that loving parents, knowing the strength of sin,
     guide their children’s footsteps to Christ. Caring parents correct
     kindly and firmly, restraining and guiding children through the early
     years, much as a horticulturalist provides support to a newly planted
     tree, until self-control emerges and a youth comes to trust in God and
     cooperates with the divine plan for salvation, growth, and maturity.

What message for parents is found in Proverbs 13:24; 23:13, 14?


        All told, just a few verses mention the “rod” (Heb. shebet) in the
     context of disciplining children. Popular within Christian parenting
     literature is the notion that parental use of the rod should be like that
     of the heavenly Shepherd who uses it to guide His flock (Ps. 23:4).
     Elsewhere, Scripture points to patient teaching, consistent modeling,
     good communication, and close relationships for influencing change
     in children (Deut. 11:18, 19). The child’s feeling of being loved by his
     or her parents is vital if discipline is to have its desired effect of being
     corrective and redemptive (Prov. 13:24).

      When discipline has missed its intended purpose by being too
      harsh or misunderstood, how can parents set matters right with
      their children?

     Is Life Better on a Rooftop?
In what way does the book of Proverbs sprinkle humor on some of the
     irritations in domestic living? Prov. 21:9, 19; 27:15, 16. What
     effect does this humor have?


        A number of the proverbs consider the ways we treat each other in
     close relationships. They make their point with a light touch and a
     flash of wit, like the ones about the insensitive friend who “sings
     songs to a heavy heart” (Prov. 25:20, NKJV) and the early rising fam-
     ily member who “blesses” sleepers “with a loud voice” (Prov. 27:14,
     NKJV). Wives reading these verses about contentious women may
     want to add some proverbs about men! They may retort that such say-
     ings perpetuate the very problem of these proverbs by targeting only
     women when husbands, who share responsibility for the home atmos-
     phere, are equally capable of contentious behavior. (Imagine what it
     must have been like living in the home of Caiaphas or Annas!)
        A merry heart helps. Having a sense of humor in family living is a
     good thing. Humor lubricates the machinery of living, helping to
     reduce stresses and strains. “A merry heart does good, like medicine,
     but a broken spirit dries the bones” (Prov. 17:22, NKJV). Proverbs
     takes some of its own medicine throughout the book and gives us per-
     mission to chuckle at a few of the behaviors that annoy and irritate.
     Perhaps when we have smiled (or smarted a bit if the joke is on us),
     we are in a better place to talk about habits or behaviors that irritate or
     annoy us. On the other hand, humor should not be used to minimize
     or bypass issues that need serious attention.
        A low-grade fever may be symptomatic of a chronic infection.
     Quarreling, nagging, and complaining may signal that there is sup-
     pressed anger in one or more family members, perhaps related to dif-
     ficulties with mutuality or communication in the relationship. The
     complaining partner tries to offset his or her partner’s perceived
     power, control, and unwillingness to communicate. If the infection is
     cleared up, the symptoms will go away. In families, rather than avoid-
     ing the problem or one another, members build on their love for the
     Lord and their commitment to one another to communicate their
     needs and feelings, get to the root of their anger, and clear it up.

      Why is laughter so important for the home? How can it be used
      for good, or how can it be perverted and used for evil? Bring
      your answer to class.

      A Truly Wealthy Wife
The book of Proverbs closes with praise for a wife of noble character.
      Identify the characteristics and qualities that are lauded. Prov.
      31:10-31.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The woman described is special, and so is the poetry. Each of the
      verses, commencing with Proverbs 31:10, begins with one of the 22
      letters of the Hebrew alphabet. One senses from this tribute to a wor-
      thy wife that even the whole national alphabet barely provides a suf-
      ficient framework to extol her properly!
         Proverbs’s emphasis on marrying a good partner is reflected in a
      dictum of the rabbis: “A man’s home is his wife.” “A wife of noble
      character is her husband’s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay
      in his bones” (Prov. 12:4, NIV). Here, at the end of the Proverbs,
      rolled idealistically into a portrait of one, are many varied skills:
      clothing manufacture, buying real estate, agriculture, home and
      financial management. Meanwhile, she cares well for her family.
      They love her and praise her.
         These extensive talents are not to be expected in every woman, nor
      are they a blueprint whereby husbands should measure their wives.
      Rather, through describing these capabilities and qualities, Proverbs
      conveys what is most important and universally relevant for women,
      as well as for men: the traits of trustworthiness, compassion, reliabil-
      ity, faithfulness, kindness, and industry. The secret of such a life,
      according to Proverbs 31:30, is that she “fears the Lord” (NKJV).
         In Proverbs 31:10 the word for “virtuous,” or “of noble character”
      (NIV), means “strength,” “might,” or “wealth.” It is translated as
      “riches” in Psalm 62:10 and describes Joshua’s “men of valour”
      (Josh. 1:14). Boaz commends Ruth with the word virtuous (Ruth
      3:11). In Proverbs 31:10 there is a play on the concept of “wealth.”
      True wealth lies in character, integrity, and the fear of the Lord. This
      vastly exceeds the worth to be found in precious stones.

       Who are some of the women of valor and virtue who have influ-
       enced your life? How would you expand the list of character
       qualities, virtues, and capacities of godly women?

        Keeping the heart in heaven. “Christians should be careful that they
     keep the heart with all diligence. They should cultivate a love for med-
     itation, and cherish a spirit of devotion. Many seem to begrudge
     moments spent in meditation, and the searching of the Scriptures, and
     prayer, as though the time thus occupied was lost. I wish you could all
     view these things in the light God would have you; for you would then
     make the kingdom of heaven of the first importance. To keep your
     heart in heaven will give vigor to all your graces, and put life into all
     your duties. To discipline the mind to dwell upon heavenly things, will
     put life and earnestness into all our endeavors. . . . We are dwarfs in
     spiritual attainments. . . . [Eph. 4:13.].”—Ellen G. White Comments,
     The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1157.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Many Christians find a support group network helpful as
      they seek to guard their hearts against temptation. In what way
      might this augment prayer, Bible study, and reliance on the Holy
      Spirit?

      tion. Discuss the implications of your various answers.

      ●3 In contrast to Proverbs 31, what qualities does contemporary
      culture tend to exalt in women? How can we as individuals pro-
      tect ourselves from partaking of that same degrading attitude?

Summary: The book of Proverbs passes on the distilled wisdom of
     generations of godly men and women who have valued loyalty to God
     and also the freedom of the human will. Appeals are made to the peo-
     ple of future generations to reverence God and make wise choices that
     will strengthen marriage and family life.

The Balance of Life and
Death in Chad
by JAMES APPEL
   The sun beats fiercely from the brilliant blue sky as we make our way
along the well-worn path toward the river. The path disappears into a
flooded rice field. Removing our sandals, we wade into the warm water.
   Occasionally we pass locals and greet them with a friendly “lapia.”
When we arrive at the river, the half-naked children quickly leave their
fishing spears to watch the foreigners swim.
   The sun sets as we make our way back across the rice paddies, tired but
refreshed. A little recreation helps us focus on the difficult tasks we face
working in the mission hospital in Béré, Chad.
   One morning a baby is brought in with a severe infection in her lower
abdomen and legs. Antibiotics fight the infection, and I remove large
patches of dead black skin to save the child’s life. Later that day, Sarah,
one of our mission nurses, reports that the baby is unconscious. I rush to
her and find she is not breathing. Desperately I perform CPR, but it is too
late; the child is dead. Sarah is devastated, thinking that somehow the
child's death is her fault. But I blame myself. If I had checked on her more
often, maybe I could have saved her. We see death all the time, but this
child's death troubles me deeply.
   A young woman comes in with abdominal pain. The nurse suggests a
urinary tract infection; I suspect appendicitis. She says she is not pregnant,
but I wonder. A pelvic exam suggests an infection of the uterus or fallop-
ian tubes. I wish I had an ultrasound that could identify the source of
infection. I put her on antibiotics.
   That evening the staff wants to go to the river. I do too. But I stay behind
to check on the woman. She is worse. I ask more questions and search the
medical books. A urine test reveals she is pregnant. If it is an ectopic (out
of uterus) pregnancy, only surgery will save her life. But if I am wrong,
she has undergone major surgery for nothing. I pray, then I decide to oper-
ate. I find a swollen mass that is about to rupture.I thank God for reveal-
ing her problem, even without proper equipment.
   What if I'd gone to the river instead of staying with this woman? How
does one find balance in a world so overwhelmed with the never-ending
needs of a place like Béré?

that at the outpost hospital in Béré, Chad, possible.

The civil war in Mozambique that ended in 1994 left the country
in ruins. The educational system is still recovering, and parents
            struggle to find a school for their children.
Adventists in Mozambique are working to improve their schools,
        but they don’t have enough trained teachers.
    The church is expanding its seminary in Mozambique to a
   four-year, degree-granting college that will offer education
courses, as well as business and religion. But to accomplish this,
  the school needs classrooms and dormitories for students.
     Part of your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter
 will help the church in Mozambique to provide teachers for the
future. And that is vital for the future of the Seventh-day
              Adventist church in Mozambique.

      The Royal Love                                   Song



      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Song of Solomon.

Memory Text: “Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal
      on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding
      as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame” (Song
      of Solomon 8:6, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: With an openness some might
      find shocking, the Song of Solomon explores the beauty of sexual
      love within marriage.

             he Song of Solomon portrays, in sensitive terms, the attraction,

      T      the passion, and the exquisite delights of sexuality. Certainly in
             these days when the whole trend of society is to dishonor mar-
      riage and devalue love, we can be grateful for the instruction, insights,
      and inspiration found in this part of the Bible.
         The Song of Solomon is an invitation to enter the private world of
      a wedded couple. They are not embarrassed to speak about their sex-
      uality, though the poem uses delicate metaphors and symbols to
      express the delights of their love. The openness of the Song of
      Solomon is in keeping with the view of Scripture that sexuality is an
      integral part of life. Further, because the redemption of Christ
      includes the whole person, His followers can trust in the guiding of the
      Holy Spirit as they seek to become more comfortable with this sensi-
      tive yet crucial topic, so interwoven with life.

     Indivisible Life
Based on the following passages, how would you characterize the
     Bible’s view of the human body? Gen. 2:7; Pss. 63:1; 84:2; 1 Cor.
     6:19, 20; 1 Thess. 5:23.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Some religions believe in dualism, a philosophy that views the
     human body as a problem for the life of the spirit. In Scripture, how-
     ever, the human body, including its sexual characteristics, is integral
     to the whole being. Life is “body” and “spirit” (Gen. 2:7). The
     psalmist gives the whole of himself in worship to God (Ps. 63:1,
     84:2). The total person is to be sanctified, set apart for the holy pur-
     pose God intended.
        This positive view of the human body, in the context of sexual rela-
     tions, is reflected in the Song of Solomon. How do these texts reveal
     this attitude? Song of Sol. 1:2, 13; 2:6; 5:10-16; 7:1-9.
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Throughout this sacred text the human body is admired. The phys-
     ical aspects of married love are not an embarrassment. A full range of
     emotions is presented openly.
       Toward greater comfort with the topic of sexuality. Powerful sexual
     taboos typically exist in many cultures. Married couples thus often
     find it difficult to communicate in healthy ways regarding their inti-
     mate life. Similarly, children often are deprived of the opportunity to
     learn about sexuality in the setting of a Christian home, where godly
     values can be integrated with accurate information. The Bible’s open-
     ness with sexuality calls His people to a greater level of comfort with
     this topic so this vital aspect of life is treated with the respect and dig-
     nity due so great a gift from the Creator.

      How can we protect ourselves against cultural and moral forces
      that either make sexuality into nothing but degrading animal
      passion or turn it into something shameful that must never be
      talked about? How does the Bible show us that both extremes
      are wrong?

                                                                             57

      The Loves of the Love Song
Describe various aspects of love presented in the Song of Solomon.
      Song of Sol. 1:2, 13; 2:10-13, 16; 3:11; 4:1-7; 5:16; 6:6; 7:1-9; 8:6, 7.

         Friendship love. The Song of Solomon shows how friends spend
      time together, communicate openly, and care about each other. In the
      Song of Solomon, two good friends become married partners. The
      wife declares, “This is my friend” (Song of Sol. 5:16). The word friend
      expresses companionship and friendship without the overtones of sex-
      ual partnership. Happy is the husband or wife whose spouse is a dear
      friend.
         Throughout the poem intimate compliments and loving gestures
      convey the strong attraction and the physical and emotional delight
      that the male and female find in each other. The natural intimacies of
      romantic love are a gift of the Creator, to help partners bond closely
      to each other in marriage. As partners are open to the work of divine
      love in their hearts, their human love is “refined and purified, elevated
      and ennobled.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 99.
         These verses also convey the loftiest of thoughts about love. True
      love, though, is not natural to the human heart; it is a gift of the Holy
      Spirit (Rom. 5:5). Such love bonds husband and wife in a lasting
      union. It is the committed love so desperately needed in the parent-
      child relationship to build a sense of trust in the young. It is the self-
      giving love that binds believers together in the body of Christ. The
      Song of Solomon calls us to make this love an active force in our rela-
      tionships.

How does this kind of intimacy reflect, in its own way, the kind of inti-
      macy we can have with God? What are some parallels one can
      draw (for example, spending time, giving completely of ourselves,
      and so forth)? What other parallels are there?

     A Loving Knowledge
        Many have seen a “return to Eden” theme in the Song of Solomon.
     Though the couple described is not the first man and woman, the
     poem calls to mind the earliest Garden. God’s plan that they be “one
     flesh” (Gen. 2:24, 25) is portrayed throughout in delicate metaphors
     and symbols.

How does the Song of Solomon present a commitment to mutuality in
     the intimate life of the married couple? Song of Sol. 4:7–5:1. How
     is Paul’s instruction of 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 similar?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Solomon invites her, “Come with me” (Song of Sol. 4:8). His bride
     responds. Later she invites him: “Let my beloved come into his gar-
     den” (vs. 16). He responds (Song of Sol. 5:1). Scripture here teaches
     that there is to be no force or manipulation in this intimate setting. Into
     this relationship both partners freely and lovingly enter. “My garden”
     is “his garden.”
        “Solomon” and “Shulamith” share names that are derivatives of the
     Hebrew shalom, “peace,” or “wholeness.” Their admiration is mutual
     (Song of Sol. 4:1-5, 5:10-16). The balance in their relationship is evi-
     denced even in the poetic style of paired lines and verses. The
     covenant expression “My beloved is mine, and I am his” (Song of Sol.
     2:16) echoes the language of Eden, “This is now bone of my bones,
     and flesh of my flesh” (Gen. 2:23).

How does the description of the marital union as “knowing” enrich
     our understanding of our relationship with God? Gen. 4:1, 25;
     1 Sam. 1:19; Luke 1:34; John 17:3; 1 Cor. 8:3.


       The Bible uses know for the intimate union of husband and wife. In
     this loving “knowledge,” the most hidden inner depths of their beings
     are offered to the other. Not only two bodies but also two hearts are
     joined in “one flesh.” Know also describes the relationship between
     individuals and God. For the discerning Christian the unique and ten-
     der knowledge of marriage, with its companionship, commitment, and
     unbounded delight, provides a profound insight into the most sublime
     and holy mystery ever, the union of Christ and the church.




                                                                            59

     Love at the Right Time
Study the following passages and the comments. Then make obser-
     vations of your own. How do these add to the scriptural teaching
     that sexual intimacy is to be reserved for marriage? Compare Gen.
     39:7-9, Proverbs 5.


         “Wall” or “door”? (Song of Sol. 8:8-10). During her childhood
     Shulamith’s brothers wondered whether she would open herself to oth-
     ers like a “door” or guard her purity as a “wall.” Both before and
     within marriage, she has decided to be a “wall,” keeping herself only
     for her husband. Such a decision enabled her to be “as one who found
     peace” (vs. 10, NKJV). Peace (Heb. shalom) is a word-play on her
     name and his name and means “wholeness” or “completeness.”
         A locked garden (Song of Sol. 4:8-12, 16; 5:1). A verdant garden
     symbolizes the woman in this poem. On their wedding night her hus-
     band affirms her for being “a garden enclosed . . . , a spring shut up,
     a fountain sealed” (Song of Sol. 4:12, NKJV). “The image of the
     garden behind its walls and with the gate locked suggests the
     unapproachableness of the area to all but those who rightfully belong.
     . . . Here, a fountain sealed and a garden locked speak of virginity. The
     couple, while approaching consummation of their love, still have not
     reached that level of intimacy.”—G. Lloyd Carr, The Song of Solomon
     (Downer’s Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1984), p. 123.
         Guarding one’s affections. A poetic device has the bride speaking
     words of caution to the “daughters of Jerusalem” in conjunction with
     moments of physical intimacy with her husband: “Do not stir up nor
     awaken love until it pleases” (Song of Sol. 2:7, 3:5, 8:4, NKJV). The
     likely intent is “Do not start the process of loving exchange until the
     appropriate occasion is present.” These verses join others that call
     upon young and old to guard against premarital and extramarital sex-
     ual intimacy.

What good news is there for individuals who regret their wrong
     choices in the expression of their sexuality? 1 John 1:9; compare
     Ps. 103:12, Isa. 55:7, John 8:11.



      What practical steps can be taken by those who are single and
      those who are married to reserve or preserve intimate sexual
      expression for marriage?

      Safeguarding the Creator’s Gift
        God had a special purpose in creating humankind as male and
      female (Gen. 1:26-28). While each bears His image, the joining of
      gender opposites in the “one flesh” of marriage reflects the unity
      within the Godhead in a special way. The union of male and female
      also provides for procreation of a new life, an original human expres-
      sion of the divine image.

What attitude does Scripture take toward sexual practices not in
      keeping with the Creator’s plan? Lev. 20:7-21, Rom. 1:24-27,
      1 Cor. 6:9-20.


        Scripture disapproves of all that alters or destroys God’s image in
      humankind. By placing certain sexual practices off-limits, God
      guides His people toward the right purposes of sexuality. When
      human experience is confronted by God’s precepts, the soul is con-
      victed of sin.

What guidance is given Christian believers for relating to their sexu-
      ality and that of others in a fallen world? Rom. 8:1-14; 1 Cor. 6:15-
      20; 2 Cor. 10:5; Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:3-10; 1 Thess. 5:23, 24.


         Believers wait for release from the corruption of sin at Christ’s
      return. They wait in faith, considering themselves dead to sin through
      Christ’s death on the cross and alive in Him through His resurrection.
      Through unceasing prayer, watchfulness, and the power of the Spirit,
      they treat their sinful nature as crucified and seek to obey Christ in
      their thoughts. They acknowledge God’s ownership of their bodies
      and sexuality and use them according to His divine plan.
         Submitting our sexuality to God. God forgives those who repent of
      sin (1 John 1:9). The gospel enables individuals, who formerly
      engaged in promiscuity and sinful sexual activity, to be part of the fel-
      lowship of believers. Because of the extent to which sin has altered
      sexuality in humanity, some may not be able to know full restoration
      in this aspect of human experience. Some, for example, might choose
      a life of celibacy rather than get involved in any sexual relationships
      that are forbidden by God’s Word.

       How should we as a church relate to, for instance, homosexuals?
       How should their own attitude about their sexual orientation
       influence our response?



                                                                           61

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “Love and Sexuality in the Human
     Experience,” Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 1, pp. 218–239.

        True love. “True love is a high and holy principle, altogether differ-
     ent in character from that love which is awakened by impulse and
     which suddenly dies when severely tested. It is by faithfulness to duty
     in the parental home that the youth are to prepare themselves for
     homes of their own. Let them here practice self-denial and manifest
     kindness, courtesy, and Christian sympathy. Thus love will be kept
     warm in the heart, and he who goes out from such a household to
     stand at the head of a family of his own will know how to promote the
     happiness of her whom he has chosen as a companion for life.
     Marriage, instead of being the end of love, will be only its begin-
     ning.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 176.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Why is it important to present sexuality education within the
      context of the Christian message? How can parents and others
      involved with youth best fulfill their responsibility to guide youth
      in knowing truth in this area?

      ●
      2 Unwed mothers, AIDS, broken homes . . . the list goes on
      regarding the impact of sinful sexual relations. How can you as a
      class, in a practical way, help those who have suffered because of
      these wrong choices?

 Summary: Lessons in close relationships, with applications for
     friendship, abound in the Song of Solomon but especially for mar-
     riage. The consummation of the royal couple’s love in the poem beck-
     ons married couples toward deeper levels of knowing each other and
     invites each human heart toward greater intimacy with God.

One Bullet for Porras, Part 1
by ANTONIO SENDING, JR.
   Fourteen-year-old Porras was a bright student and a born leader. His
father, Chief Tranning of the Manobo people of Mindanao in the
Philippines, was proud of him. One day Porras would be a warrior, so his
father took him along on headhunting expeditions.
   Porro’s village often received threats of tribal war, so they were con-
stantly alert for signs of danger. His father had rifles and taught his son to
use one. But Porras did not share his father’s dream for him. He wanted to
lead his people in a different way; he wanted to study at Mountain View
College, where his teachers studied; and one day, he hoped, he would
return to the mountains of southern Philippines and teach his people to
read and to write and introduce them to Jesus.
   One day, a chief from another Manobo village came to visit Porras’s
father. He brought a horse, a gift from a family in the chief’s village. The
chief had come to ask Porras’ father for permission for Porras to marry a
girl from his village. Porras knew that in the past there had been problems
between these two villages. A marriage would resolve those problems and
prevent further bloodshed. Porras wanted nothing to do with this marriage.
But to Porras’ horror, his father agreed to the marriage.
   Porras was in serious trouble. To refuse the marriage surely would mean
bloodshed between the two tribes, and Porras’s own life was at risk. But if
Porras accepted the offer of marriage, his dreams for the future would van-
ish with the smoke from the morning fires.
   Confused and frightened, he went to talk to his teachers, student mis-
sionaries from Mountain View College. The missionary teachers, how-
ever, did not dare advise Porras what to do. That would be to interfere with
the village’s customs. They could only advise Porras to pray that God
would reveal His will for this young man.
   Porras went home and prayed. “Dear Lord, I want to be a teacher! Please
help my father understand that I want to attend the Adventist high school
and then study at Mountain View College. If I marry, that will be impos-
sible.”
   Porras’ father and mother argued about what to do. His father wanted
Porras to marry the young woman from the nearby village, but his mother
refused to allow her beloved son to live in another village. “He is still a
boy!” she sobbed to her husband. “I don't want to give him away!”

                                                             (continued next week)

          LESSON            8        *February 18-24



      Keys to Family Unity




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 33:12-14, Ruth 1:16-
      18, John 17:21-26, Gal. 3:28, Eph. 2:11-22, 5:21–6:9.

Memory Text: “ ‘That all of them may be one, Father, just as
      you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the
      world may believe that you have sent me’ ” (John 17:21, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: The Bible exalts Christ as the
      great Center who draws all disconnected relationships together in
      His body on the cross.

              ife in the household of God should help us grow closer at home,

      L       for in both cases the same principles should be at work—prin-
              ciples of love, humility, selflessness, and concern for others.
        All this doesn’t come automatically. On the contrary, each of us
      must fight constantly against the sinful and selfish tendencies of our
      fallen natures.
        Though in the body of Jesus Christ on the cross all humanity has
      been reconciled to God and to one another (Eph. 2:13-16, Col. 1:21-
      23), on a daily practical level we must appropriate for ourselves the
      grace of Christ, which alone can make this unity a living experience
      for all who seek it in faith. This must be a daily experience in our lives.
      Fortunately, through the grace of Christ, it can be. We, though, have to
      make the choice to be what the Lord wants us to be.

      Christ the Center
What illustration does Paul use to describe the new unity that exists
      between peoples in Christ? How has Christ made “one” out of
      “two”? Eph. 2:11-22; see also Gal. 3:28.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The Cross of Christ removes the barriers that separate people from
      one another. Walls separated worshipers in the Jewish temple, men
      from women and Jews from Gentiles. Describing the unity of Jews
      and Gentiles in Christ, Paul used language that applies equally to
      other divisions between nations, people groups, social strata, and gen-
      der. “To create out of the two a single new humanity in himself,
      thereby making peace” (Eph. 2:15, NEB) is good news that helps cou-
      ples to truly know “one-flesh” unity in marriage. Also, by faith in
      Christ, long-divided families can be reconciled.

It’s one thing to quote Bible texts about oneness in Christ; it’s wholly
      another actually to experience it. What practical changes does
      Christ bring to our lives that enable us to experience the oneness
      and unity we have been promised? See, for instance, Rom. 6:4-7,
      2 Cor. 5:17, Eph. 4:24-32.

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “Picture a large circle, from the edge of which are many lines all
      running to the center. The nearer these lines approach the center, the
      nearer they are to one another. . . .
        “The closer we come to Christ, the nearer we shall be to one
      another.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 179.
        “Between father and son, husband and wife . . . stands Christ the
      Mediator, whether they are able to recognize him or not. We cannot

       to be as they ought to be?

     Becoming One Through His Love
       “May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each
     other and for everyone else” (1 Thess. 3:12, NIV).

       Jesus prayed to His Father that His followers would “ ‘be one as
     we are one’ ” (John 17:22, NIV). Summarize what Jesus was saying
     here, focusing specifically on the role of love needed in order to
     achieve this oneness.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Unity among His followers was on Jesus’ mind in this prayer.
     Experiencing agape love is essential to this unity. Agape is the Bible
     word for God’s love used in this prayer and in many other places in the
     New Testament. Such love is God’s very nature (1 John 4:8), and it
     identifies Jesus’ followers (John 13:35). God’s love is not natural to
     the sinful human heart. It comes into one’s life as Jesus dwells with
     the believer by His Spirit (Rom. 5:5; 8:9, 11).
       “ ‘Love each other as I have loved you’ ” (John 15:12, NIV). The
     disciple John, who wrote these words, was once not lovable but proud,
     power-hungry, critical, and hot tempered (Mark 3:17; Luke 9:54, 55;
     see also Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 295). Later in life he
     remembered how Jesus had kept on loving him in spite of these traits.
     Jesus’ love gradually changed John, enabling him to love others in
     Christian unity. “We love Him because He first loved us” (1 John
     4:19, NKJV), he wrote, and “if God so loved us, we also ought to love
     one another” (vs. 11, NKJV).

      Read 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Try placing your name where the
      word love appears. How well does it fit? Ask Jesus to bring these
      qualities of love into your life by His Spirit. What changes might
      the Spirit prompt you to make in order to reach this Christian
      ideal?

      Selfishness: Family Destroyer
        “If pride and selfishness were laid aside, five minutes would
      remove most difficulties.”—Ellen G. White, Early Writings, p. 119.

         As human beings, our natures have been corrupted by sin. And, per-
      haps, the greatest example of that corruption is the curse of selfish-
      ness. We seem to be born selfish; we can see this reality in small chil-
      dren, whose basic nature is want for themselves. “Me, me, me! . . .”
      By the time we reach adulthood, this trait can manifest itself in some
      pretty terrible ways, especially in the home.
         Of course, Jesus came to change this (Eph. 4:24). His Word prom-
      ises us that we, through Him, don’t have to be dominated by this
      destructive character trait. His whole life is a perfect example of what
      it means to live without selfishness; to the degree we emulate His life
      (1 John 2:6), we will overcome the tendency to live only for ourselves.

Look up the following texts. What do they tell us about living a life
      of selflessness?

      Phil. 2:3-5
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      1 John 3:16-18
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         As Ellen White wrote above, if pride and selfishness were put aside,
      so many problems could be solved very quickly, long before they fes-
      ter and brew and eventually turn into something nasty. All members of
      the family, especially the parents, must be purged (Prov. 16:6) of this
      sin at the foot of the Cross (the greatest example in all the universe of
      selflessness), even if that means constantly coming back to the Cross
      and kneeling in prayer, faith, tears, and submission.

       How much time are you spending at the Cross fighting against
       whatever selfishness appears in your life? How does this verse
       (Matt. 7:16) help show you whether or not you have been spend-
       ing enough time there?

      Submission
What counsel does Paul have regarding humility and service in rela-
      tionships? Eph. 5:21. How do you think this attitude contributes to
      unity in the church? Why is it so important at home? Eph.
      5:22–6:9.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The word submit (Eph. 5:21) means to place oneself humbly before
      another person on the basis of voluntary choice. This unique principle
      began with Christ (Matt. 20:26-28; John 13:4, 5; Phil. 2:5-8) and
      characterizes all those who are filled with His Spirit (Eph. 5:18).
      “Reverence for Christ” is what motivates people to submit in this way
      (vs. 21, NIV). Mutuality in self-giving was, and still is, a revolution-
      ary Christian teaching about social relationships. It brings to life the
      spiritual reality that all are one in Christ; there are no exceptions.
         A household principle. The proving ground of Christian submission
      is in the home. If this principle is effective there, it will make a dra-
      matic difference in the church. Paul moves immediately from the
      introduction of the principle of submission to discuss its application
      in families.
         Three pairs of relationships are addressed in Ephesians 5:22–6:9—
      the most common yet most unequal relationships in society. The intent
      is not to reinforce an existing social order but to show how the faith
      culture of Christ operates when there is a radically different voluntary
      submission of believers to one another.

Why do you think Paul consistently speaks first to those who are socially
      weaker in the culture—the wives, children, and slaves? Write the
      qualifying phrase attached to the submission of each of these.

     Eph. 5:22                  Eph. 6:1                   Eph. 6:5




        Those with greater social power—husbands, parents, masters—are
      always addressed second. Each receives a directive quite uncommon
      to the culture. These directives must have astonished the believers of
      the first century. They leveled the ground around the Cross and
      opened the way for true oneness to be experienced in relationships.

     Living the Love We Promise
        Ultimately, family cohesion and unity rest on the commitment of
     family members, beginning with the commitment of the marital part-
     ners, to care for one another. Sadly, Bible history is strewn with exam-
     ples of failed promises, broken trust, and lack of commitment where
     it should have been present. Scripture also has stirring examples of
     ordinary people who, with God’s help, committed themselves to
     friends and families and kept their promises.

Look at the following families and their levels of commitment. How
     could commitment have been strengthened in some families?
     What encouraged the commitment shown in the others?

     Parent-child commitment (Gen. 33:12-14, Exod. 2:1-10)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     Sibling commitment (Gen. 37:17-28)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     Family commitment (Ruth 1:16-18; 2:11, 12, 20; 3:9-13; 4:10, 13)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     Marital commitment (Hos. 1:2, 3, 6, 8; 3:1-3)

     ____________________________________________________________________

       When we commit ourselves to another person, as in marriage or in
     the decision to bear or adopt a child, there must be a willing surren-
     der of ourselves in order to make a different choice in the future, a
     surrender of control over an important segment of our lives. Laws
     may restrain negative behavior, but marriage and family relationships
     need love within them to enable them to flourish.

      What does Jesus’ promise of commitment (Heb. 13:5) mean to
      you personally? What effect should His commitment to you
      have on your commitment to Him, to your spouse, to your chil-
      dren, and to fellow believers?

       Unity—the first work. “The first work of Christians is to be united
     in the family. . . .
       “The more closely the members of a family are united in their work
     in the home, the more uplifting and helpful will be the influence that
     father and mother and sons and daughters will exert outside the
     home.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 37.
       The secret of family unity. “The cause of division and discord in
     families and in the church is separation from Christ. To come near to
     Christ is to come near to one another. The secret of true unity in the
     church and in the family is not diplomacy, not management, not a
     superhuman effort to overcome difficulties—though there will be
     much of this to do—but union with Christ.”—Page 179.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Talk about the forces in your own society that work against
      family unity. What practical solutions can you offer to a family
      that is struggling against these influences?

      ●
      2 Is there a family in your church right now that has come
      apart? If so, what can you do as a class to help each member in
      this crisis time?

      ●
      3 Discuss this whole question of submission. How is it to be
      understood in a Christian context? In what ways has the princi-
      ple been abused?

Summary: The Bible exalts Christ as the great Center who draws all
     disconnected relationships together in His body on the cross. His love
     courts and wins sinners, reconciling them within a warm and caring
     fellowship that astounds the world and glorifies God.

One Bullet for Porras, Part 2
by ANTONIO SENDING, JR.
   Porras watched his dreams for the future crumble as his father accepted
a proposal for him to marry a girl from a neighboring village. The mar-
riage would ease tensions between the villages and prevent future blood-
shed, but Porras wanted to study and become a teacher. To disobey his
father could well mean his death, but to obey meant the death of his
dream. Frustrated and confused, Porras asked his student-missionary
teachers what to do. They could only pray for him and urge him to pray for
God’s will to be done.
   God answered Porras’s prayers, and no wedding was held. A gift of
another horse averted the possibility of war between the villages.
   When it was time for us to return to Mountain View College to give our
monthly report, we asked the chief to allow Porras to go with us. We
planned to spend several days working on the new Adventist high school
for Manobo youth. To everyone’s surprise the chief agreed to let Porras go.
“I want Porras out from this village,” he said. “If anyone else asks him to
marry, surely there will be bloodshed.”
   But Porras’s mother could not be convinced to allow her son to leave.
“No!” she wailed. “I will die if my boy goes! I will never see him again.”
   “If you did not want him to go to the new high school, you should have
given him in marriage!” the chief roared.
   Finally Porras was allowed to go. The villagers gathered for a last
farewell. Porras comforted his crying mother as his father spoke. Holding
his rifle, he announced, “Today marks the day when my boy will leave this
village for the first time. He is the first one to go from this village to attend
the Adventist high school. When he finishes there, he will go to Mountain
View College to study. And, if it is God’s will, he will return to us and be
our teacher. I will miss my boy. I don’t want him to come home until he is
done with school, because if he does, someone will trap him into mar-
riage. Now, I will shoot one bullet for Porras, to drive away any evil spir-
its that would keep him from following his dreams.”
   BANG!
   Everyone hugged Porras goodbye. His mother cried as we walked down
the path toward his future. Through tear-filled eyes his father watched us
go. They wait eagerly for the day when he will return, educated and able
to lead his people out of spiritual darkness into God’s light.

      Homes of Peace
      and Healing




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 37:8, Matt. 5:22, 12:1-
      14, 18:15-18, Mark 7:6-13, Phil. 2:1-16, Col. 3:12-15.

Memory Text: “ ‘Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I
      do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be
      troubled and do not be afraid’ ” (John 14:27, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: The Bible gives us principles that,
      if applied, can help minimize family conflict and turmoil.

             he schoolchildren were trying out a new seesaw. The bigger and

      T      heavier kids moved closer to the center; lighter riders stayed out
             at the end. Once everyone was balanced, each child got a good
      ride. Things went fine until some mischievous bigger boys seemed to
      get pleasure from bouncing girls in the air like rag dolls until they
      screamed to get off. Then kids started piling on at opposite ends, each
      side trying to outweigh the other. Before long, the seesaw, the toy that
      had been the setting of so much fun, became a painful place. No one
      wanted to ride on it anymore.
         Family life is sometimes like a seesaw. Life is more pleasant when
      people respect and care for others. Sadly, individuals experience pain
      when some use their status or position in the family to dominate, con-
      trol, or treat others harshly. This week’s lesson looks at ways relation-
      ships run into difficulty and how God, in His Word, provides insights
      that help His children move from hurt to healing.

      Saints Have Family Problems Too
        “Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the
      bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3, NIV).

        Christian believers possess by faith the precious spiritual reality of
      being seated in heavenly places with Christ (Eph. 2:6). In daily life, as
      they await His return and their removal from the presence of sin, some
      tension, discord, even conflict may occur. This is a part of the human
      experience with intimate relationships (Gal. 5:17). Friction can come
      because people differ widely in disposition, habits, education, and
      ways of looking at things. Families must find ways to respect the indi-
      viduality of each member yet be able to function and enjoy life as a
      close-knit group. The mark of healthy Christian relationships is not
      only keeping conflicts to a minimum but surmounting, in ways that
      accord with the gospel, those conflicts that do come.

How does the Bible teach God’s people to deal with the conflicts that
      may arise among them? Summarize the principles in Matthew
      18:15-18, Philippians 2:1-16, and Colossians 3:12-15.

         Christian love and tolerance enable many families to cope with
      great differences. Others find themselves in uncomfortable situations
      that must be remedied if unity and peace are to be maintained.
      Without resolution—anger, hostility, and distance may develop in the
      relationship. Facing conflict can be difficult; many avoid or shy away
      from it, deny it exists, or withdraw emotionally. Others determine to
      get their way at any cost, while many simply give in to keep peace.

       Think back over family struggles you either have experienced or
       seen. What caused them? How might they have been more eas-
       ily resolved? How could the principles seen in today’s text have
       made a big difference?

     Putting Anger in Its Place
       Scripture plainly condemns angry attitudes and behaviors that are
     destructive to individuals and relationships (Gen. 49:6, 7; Ps. 37:8;
     Matt. 5:22; Gal. 5:19-21). These belong to the “old man,” whom
     Christians are called to “put off ” (Eph. 4:31, Col. 3:8-10). However,
     the Bible acknowledges that anger as an emotion is part of life in
     Christ (Eph. 4:22-27).
       Anger sounds an alarm inside us when inequity or injustice is rec-
     ognized or when there is oppression of the innocent. Moses felt this
     emotion in defense of God’s name and cause (Exod. 32:19); Jesus did,
     too, when His ministry, the Sabbath, and the man with the withered
     hand were all treated with coldhearted indifference by the religious
     leaders (Mark 3:1-5). Injustice aroused anger in David and Nehemiah
     (compare 2 Sam. 12:5, Neh. 5:6). Jacob loved Rachel (Gen. 29:30)
     but became angry when he felt accused unfairly by her (30:1, 2).

What do you think “In your anger, do not sin” (Eph. 4:26, 27, NIV)
     means for believers?

        ●
        1 “In your anger do not sin” indicates that the emotion of anger
     and sin are not one and the same. The feeling of anger is not sin in
     itself. Family members are to give each other permission to have this
     emotion and to report it without guilt.
        ●
        2 “Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry” (Eph.
     4:26, NIV) indicates that anger is to be processed promptly. Final res-
     olution of issues may take time, but anger can often be diffused by a
     “soft answer” (Prov. 15:1). “Soft answers” are caring responses that
     result from listening, accepting the person, and recognizing the deeper
     feelings such as fear, frustration, or hurt that triggered the anger.
     Getting behind the anger like this helps families clear things up and
     grow closer to each other.

      Some people tend to blow up the instant they are angry; others
      hold it inside, where it seethes and festers. What is your own ten-
      dency, and what promises can you find in the Bible that can help
      you toward a more Christlike resolution of your anger?

      Anguished Hearts
       Unthinkable as it is, research reveals that the home is the single
     most violent place in society. Family violence touches all kinds of
     families, including Christian homes. Violence is an assault of any
     kind—verbal, physical, emotional, sexual, or active or passive neg-
     lect—that is committed by one person or persons against another in
     the family.

The Bible includes accounts of family violence, even among God’s
     people. What are your thoughts and feelings as you read these
     verses? Why do you think these stories were preserved in
     Scripture?

Though people today don’t burn their children on altars to pagan
     gods, what are some modern parallels to this same practice?


        Abusive behavior is the conscious choice of a person to exercise
     power and control over another. It cannot be explained or excused by
     alcoholism, stress, the need to fulfill sexual desires, the need for bet-
     ter control of anger, or any behavior of the victim. Victims are not
     responsible for causing the abuser to abuse. Abusers distort and per-
     vert love, for “love does no harm” (Rom. 13:10, NIV). Professional
     treatment can facilitate change in an abuser’s behavior but only if the
     person takes responsibility for the behavior and seeks such help. To
     those who will open themselves to His presence, God “is able to do
     exceedingly abundantly” to help abusers stop abusing, to repent of
     their attitudes and behavior, to make restitution in every way possible,
     and to embrace the qualities of agape love to heal their own hearts and
     to love others (compare Eph. 3:20).

      Try to put yourself in the place of someone traumatized by vio-
      lence. What words of acceptance, comfort, and hope would you
      like to hear? Why is it important to provide safety and caring
      acceptance rather than offering advice about how to live better
      with the abuser?


                                                                          75

     Twisting the Word
With which of these statements do you agree or disagree? Why?

       ●
       1 People who are abused should turn the other cheek.

       ●
       2 Wives should be submissive, regardless of what their husbands
     do to them.
       ●3 Violent behavior by a spouse or a parent is just a cross some peo-
     ple have to bear.
       ●4 The pain we encounter in life is ultimately for our good.


        Victims of violence in Christian families need support to find safety
     for themselves and their children and to meet other practical and emo-
     tional needs. Times of domestic violence are times of great spiritual
     crisis. Where was God when I was being abused? Is God punishing
     me for something I have done or trying to teach me a lesson?
     Sometimes their deep-seated beliefs or the counsel they receive will
     have a tendency to prolong, rather than relieve, their situation.
        No Christian principle supports or condones abuse. Those who seek
     biblical texts to defend their behavior are guilty not only of abuse but
     of perverting the Word of God. Christ championed the cause of the
     oppressed. It is His Spirit to love and accept, to affirm and build oth-
     ers up rather than to abuse or tear others down. His followers are
     called to rectify those religious and cultural beliefs that some may
     twist and pervert in order to justify or cover up family violence.

The New Testament has examples of people twisting doctrines in
     order to justify their own ways. See, for example, Matthew 12:1-
     14, Mark 7:6-13. Which Bible texts might some people pervert in
     an attempt to justify their abuse?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Victims need people who are sensitive and careful about offering
     hasty solutions or moralizing. Abused persons need help accessing the
     specialized help they need. While those seeking to help them encour-
     age victims in getting professional care if possible, they also minister
     to them graciously and compassionately, providing them with stabil-
     ity in a time of unrest.

     The Gift of Forgiveness
       At the heart of Christianity is an incredibly wonderful concept—
     forgiveness. It is God’s gift to families when hearts and relationships
     have been wounded.

What do the following texts tell us about forgiveness? Matt. 18:27,
     Luke 23:34, Rom. 5:6-11, Eph. 1:7.

       Through the Cross of Christ, forgiveness is offered, even before the
     offenders ask for it (Luke 23:34; compare Acts 5:31, 13:38, 26:18).
     By His grace God made a fountain that has washed us and invites us
     to come, repent, and be clean (compare Rom. 2:4). Humanly, forgive-
     ness is a decision to let go of the destructive malice of revenge. We
     remind our wounded hearts that Christ has suffered for all sin, ours
     against God and that of others against us. We then pass forgiveness
     on. The hurt one is now freed within, whether or not the offender asks
     for forgiveness. It does not, however, free the wrongdoer from respon-
     sibility, from the need to repent, or from all the consequences of the
     abusive behavior.

What do these texts tell us about forgiveness? 2 Chron. 7:14, Matt.
     18:32-35, 1 John 1:9.

        Notice the conditional “if ” in these texts. If forgiveness is ulti-
     mately to be effective, there must be repentance on the part of the
     wrongdoer. Recognizable earmarks of true repentance include: stop-
     ping the offending behavior, giving a sincere apology, taking respon-
     sibility for the behavior and damage done, showing care for the pain
     of the wronged one, making restitution in every way possible, and
     making changes to protect against reoccurrence.
        Reconciliation is not the same as forgiveness. For reconciliation to
     occur, both must want it and be willing to try to rebuild trust again.
     Over time, through open communication and consideration of each
     one’s needs and feelings, destructive relational patterns can change.
     Patterns of conflict resolution that meet the needs of both can be cul-
     tivated.

      In what way does the assurance that we have been forgiven by
      God in Christ give us courage to offer forgiveness to a wrong-
      doer or to make a much-needed apology?

         Justifiable indignation. “It is true there is an indignation that is jus-
      tifiable, even in the followers of Christ. When they see that God is dis-
      honored, and His service brought into disrepute, when they see the
      innocent oppressed, a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger,
      born of sensitive morals, is not a sin. But those who at any supposed
      provocation feel at liberty to indulge anger or resentment are opening
      the heart to Satan. Bitterness and animosity must be banished from the
      soul if we would be in harmony with heaven.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Desire of Ages, p. 310.

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 What are some of the cultural attitudes that exist in your own
       society that help create an environment in which family abuse is
       tolerated? What can you as a class do to help church members be
       on guard against assimilating these attitudes?

       ●2 For those who are willing (and only to an appropriate degree),
       talk about how their own family works through conflicts. What
       have they learned from their own experiences that could help
       others facing similar challenges?

       ●
       3 Discuss the difference between forgiveness and what some-
       times is mistaken for forgiveness—tolerance, excusing the
       wrongdoer, absorbing the blame, or rationalizing the hurtful
       behavior. Why is it so important to know the difference?

Summary: Some conflict can be expected in close relationships.
      Often, through prayerful use of scriptures that teach about relation-
      ships, these can be reduced and managed by Christians.

The Accident That Saved His Life
by MASAMI TANAKA
   Masami lay in the emergency room trying to answer the doctor and the police’s
questions. “I was driving, then I lost control of the car. It skidded. Then I heard a thud.
The next thing I remember was crawling out of the car.”
   Masami had suffered only a few bruises in the crash, so the doctors released him
from the hospital that night. He could find no bus or taxi, so he walked several miles
to his home.
   During the days following his accident, Masami had time to think about life and
his near-fatal crash. He could not deny the conviction that something—or some-
one—had saved him from death. But who?
   Masami had resented all religion and was glad when he no longer had to follow
the foolish beliefs his father had taught him. He did not need his father’s god—or any
god. He could care for himself.
   After the accident, he was willing to admit that some powerful deity might exist
somewhere. He remembered an acquaintance who attended a Christian church.
Perhaps he could ask his friend to help him sort out what had happened to him. He
contacted his friend and asked which church he attended. Masami decided to visit the
church—not every week, but occasionally. He knew little about God, but he enjoyed
the fellowship and the Bible study. He found his commitment to God increasing. This
is a faith I can believe in, he told himself. It’s not like my father’s religion.
   Two years after he began attending the church, he was baptized.
   He met some volunteer missionaries who were teaching English and giving Bible
studies in Osaka. He feels that God sent them to show God’s love and compassion
to him, giving him a strong tie with the church. Throughout his life God provided
good people to guide him and strengthen him. He met his wife in church, and she
strengthens him. God’s presence had never been conspicuous in his life before he
invited Him in to live in his life. But Masami is sure that He was always there, watch-
ing over him, protecting him.
   Masami has had several accidents and experiences since then that have developed
his faith. As his faith was growing, he had another accident. Falling while playing
ball, he fell and broke both wrists. Because he had no serious pain, he did not go to
a surgeon. But some time later he began feeling pain in his shoulders. The doctor
examined him but found nothing wrong with his shoulders. A little further investi-
gation led to the old break in his wrists. The doctor x-rayed and found that the wrist
bones had both been broken and had never healed. He had to have surgery on both
wrists. This was not good news, but it gave him time to spend with God. While he
was still in the hospital after the surgery, his church called and asked him to work
with the youth.
   To this day God has led him gently, kindly. He wants to let many people know
about this wonderful God. He would like to do whatever he can to bring others to God.
MASAMI TANAKA is a businessman living in Osaka, Japan. He is active in the Osaka
Central Church.

      Families of Faith




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: John 1:12, 13; 3:7; Acts
      10:1-28, 34, 35; 1 Cor. 2:2; 1 Thess. 5:21, 22; 1 John 5:1.

Memory Text: “Therefore . . . let us run with endurance the race
      that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of
      our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the
      cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of
      the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:1, 2, NKJV).

The Week at a Glance: Families face a lot of cultural
      pressures; the power of the gospel can allow them to confront
      those pressures victoriously.

              nd this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the

      A       world for a witness unto all nations” (Matt. 24:14). We, living
              in the early twenty-first century, have the opportunity to see
      this prophecy being fulfilled in a way that earlier generations could
      not. Of course, as the gospel is spreading into new lands, new cultures,
      it meets with various traditions and practices, some of which might fit
      nicely with the truths given to us by God about families; while others,
      in contrast, might be in conflict with these truths in marked ways.
         Regardless, though, of the culture in which the gospel is preached
      and lived, Christian families confront cultural challenges all the time.
      The great news is that the power of the gospel gives us light, comfort,
      and strength to deal with these challenges and to be “families of
      faith.”

     Hold Fast What Is Good
        As the gospel circles the globe, Christians encounter different cul-
     tures and practices, many of which pertain to family and social rela-
     tionships. One of the great questions for Christian missionaries
     regards how they should relate to various cultural norms about many
     things, including family relationships they might personally find
     uncomfortable.

Read Acts 10:1-28, 34, 35. What can we learn here about our need to
     overcome our own barriers and prejudices when dealing with
     other cultures?



        Christ’s death was for the sins of every human being everywhere.
     Many people simply do not know this great truth yet. To bring this
     news with an invitation to respond is the evangelistic mission of
     Christians. Because God shows no partiality, Christians are called to
     treat everyone with respect and integrity, giving them a chance to
     embrace the good news that is for them, as well.

What conclusions did early Christian missionaries reach regarding
     the presentation of the gospel to other cultures? What principle
     can we draw from these texts? Acts 15:19, 20, 28, 29; 1 Cor. 2:2;
     1 Thess. 5:21, 22.



       Though every culture mirrors the fallen condition of the people
     within it, cultures also may have beliefs that are compatible with
     Scripture, even useful to the cause of the gospel. The value placed
     upon close relationships in family and community in many parts of
     the world is an example. Christians can uphold and strengthen that
     which is good and in keeping with biblical principles.
       At the same time, God’s truth must not be compromised. Church
     history sadly shows that compromise and accommodation to cultures
     have yielded a patchwork of pseudo-Christian beliefs posing as
     authentic Christianity. Satan claims to be the god of this world and
     happily spreads confusion, but Jesus has redeemed this world, and His
     Spirit guides His followers into all truth (John 16:13).

      How much of your faith is shaped by your culture, and how
      much is biblical truth? How can you learn to discern between
      the two? Be prepared to discuss your answer in class.

                                                                        81

       The Power of Culture on Family
        “For I know him, that he will command his children and his
      household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to
      do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham
      that which he hath spoken of him” (Gen. 18:19).

        Though they might come in various configurations, families are the
      building blocks of society; thus, many distinct cultural traits of vari-
      ous societies are directly tied to family. For instance, in one ancient
      culture it was deemed a man’s responsibility to eat the corpse of his
      dead parents; in another, a man who wanted a bride had to bring her
      father a dowry of shrunken heads from a rival tribe. Even in modern
      times, ideas relating to children, courtship, divorce, marriage, parents,
      and so forth vary widely. As we spread our message to these various
      cultures, we have to learn how to relate to them in ways that, while not
      compromising our beliefs, do not cause unnecessary problems. At the
      same time, and closer to home, we have to be very aware of just what
      cultural influences impact our families.

In what ways did culture impact family life in the following examples?
      What principles can we learn from these examples?

      Gen. 16:1-3

      Gen. 35:1-4

      1 Kings 11:1
      ____________________________________________________________________

        None of us lives in a vacuum; all of us and our families are
      impacted by the culture in which we live. Our responsibility as
      Christians is to exist within our culture the best we can, keeping that
      which is in harmony with our faith, while shunning, as much as pos-
      sible, that which conflicts with it.

       What things in your particular culture are helpful to family life
       and in harmony with the Bible? What things are not? How can
       you best adapt your faith to your culture without compromising
       essential truths?

     Sustaining Families Through Seasons
     of Change
        Change is an inescapable, unsettling occurrence in families, regard-
     less of whatever culture they live in. Some change is related to pre-
     dictable passage through the life cycle. Often change is unpredictable;
     such as deaths, disasters, wars, illnesses, family moves, or career fail-
     ures. Many families face economic and social changes in their commu-
     nities and countries. Other changes are directly related to the culture.

Below are some examples of great, even traumatic, changes people
     faced. Using your imagination, put yourself in their positions. How
     did these changes impact their family life? What mechanism
     would you have needed in order to help cope? In what ways might
     you have reacted differently?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        With change comes the experience of loss and the anxiety of uncer-
     tainty as to one’s immediate future. Depending on a family’s ability to
     adjust to changes, these experiences can propel people to new levels
     of growth and appreciation for spiritual things, or they can lead to
     stress and anxiety. Satan exploits the disruption that changes bring,
     hoping to introduce doubt and distrust in God. The promises of God’s
     Word, the resources of family and friends, and the assurance that their
     lives were in God’s hands helped many heroes and heroines of faith
     cope successfully with momentous life upheaval.

      If you know someone (or even a whole family) who is facing a
      traumatic change, do something in a practical way to give them
      some help and encouragement.

      Toward a First-Generation Faith

          Studies of how values and beliefs in organizations, such as
      churches, are transmitted to subsequent generations show that the
      founders have very high levels of commitment to the beliefs. They
      were the ones who first championed them. Within a generation or two,
      many lose sight of the principles behind the values. They may go
      along with the organization but often from habit. In subsequent gen-
      erations, habits tend to crystallize into traditions. The founders’ pas-
      sion is no longer present.

It has been said that God has no grandchildren, only children. What do
      you think that means? See also John 1:12, 13; 3:7; 1 John 5:1.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         A common approach to transmitting values through long genera-
      tions of Christianity has been for older ones simply to tell the youth
      what they believe. Learning what one’s parents believe or what the
      church believes is not personal faith, however. Being a Christian is
      more than belonging to an organization with a history and a dogma.
      True faith is not something genetic, is not something that is passed on
      naturally from one generation to another. Each one needs to know
      Christ for himself or herself. Parents can do only so much. The
      church, as a whole, and parents in particular, need to do all they can
      to create an environment that will make young people want to make
      that right choice, but, in the end, a generation is saved or lost for the
      gospel one person at a time.

       Joe, coming out of atheism, joined the Seventh-day Adventist
       Church as an adult after a powerful conversion experience. He
       married an Adventist woman and had a few children, whom
       they, of course, raised in the faith. One day, thinking about the
       spiritual condition of his children, he said, “Oh, if only my chil-
       dren would have the experience that I had!” If you had been
       there, what would you have said to him?

     Twenty-first-Century Runners
       In his popular Bible paraphrase The Message, Eugene Peterson uses
     message wherever the biblical word for “gospel” appears. The good
     news about Jesus is truly the message still needed by the world today.
     Christian families are called to experience it together and to share it
     in whatever culture they live.

How would you summarize “the message” using the following texts?
     Matt. 28:5-7; John 3:16; Rom. 1:16, 17; 1 Cor. 2:2; 2 Cor. 5:18-21.


        The earliest news with which the disciples ran everywhere was of
     the resurrection of Jesus. Christian families today join a long line of
     runners, proclaiming, “He is risen, as he said” (Matt. 28:7). The real-
     ity of His resurrection makes credible everything else Jesus said
     about Himself, about God and His love for sinners, about forgiveness,
     and about the assurance of eternal life by faith in Him.
        Passionate about the gospel. Scripture gives glimpses of the
     gospel’s sweeping effect on the lives of Jesus’ early followers. They
     opened their homes for Bible study; they prayed and ate together,
     shared money and resources, and took care of one another. Whole
     households embraced the message. Were they suddenly flawless peo-
     ple? No. Were there some conflicts and discord among them? Yes. But
     somehow these followers of Christ were different. They acknowl-
     edged their needs for God and for one another. They put a priority on
     unity and harmony at home and at church, endeavoring to fulfill the
     Gethsemane prayer of Jesus (John 17:20-23). They witnessed to one
     another and to unbelievers with boldness, even putting their lives at
     risk for their beliefs.
        So must it be for us. Even in the current age, jaundiced as it is
     toward godly things, people who are excited about something still get
     a hearing. The Spirit longs to fill human hearts with excitement about
     the gospel. When the good news really becomes as good in our hearts
     as it is within the Word, sharing will be spontaneous and unstoppable.

      What changes might need to be made in your own family that
      could help it become a better harbinger of the message we have
      been called to share?

        No respecter of persons. “The religion of Christ uplifts the receiver
     to a higher plane of thought and action, while at the same time it pres-
     ents the whole human race as alike the objects of the love of God,
     being purchased by the sacrifice of His Son. At the feet of Jesus, the
     rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, meet together, with no
     thought of caste or worldly preeminence. All earthly distinctions are
     forgotten as we look upon Him whom our sins have pierced. The self-
     denial, the condescension, the infinite compassion of Him who was
     highly exalted in heaven, puts to shame human pride, self-esteem, and
     social caste. Pure, undefiled religion manifests its heaven-born prin-
     ciples in bringing into oneness all who are sanctified through the
     truth. All meet as blood-bought souls, alike dependent upon Him
     who has redeemed them to God.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers,

Summary: The earliest evangelists understood that God shows no
     partiality with people. The gospel belongs to all, and every culture
     must hear it, as uncomplicated by the cultural trappings of the carri-
     ers as possible. The good news introduces radical change, working
     strategically but surely in the hearts of individuals and families.

Delayed Delivery
by KRISTINA MUEHLHAUSER
   Our home in Uganda was chaotic as we prepared to leave for a few
weeks’ vacation. In the busyness of life, I asked God to help us not to miss
opportunities to be a blessing to others.
   Then Lucy, my language teacher, called me to attend the birth of her
grandchild. I hopped on my bicycle and pedaled through the dusty streets
to the hospital. I found the expectant mother, Christine, lying on a bed in
the maternity ward, surrounded by other women in labor. Christine was
not in true labor yet, but I hesitated to leave.
   Darkness fell. Lucy and I lay down to rest on a thin mat on the cold
cement floor. The sheet that covered us was inadequate. I slept fitfully.
   In the morning I hurried home to finish packing for our trip. Several
times I returned to the hospital to check on Christine’s progress. Still no
baby. I feared I would have to leave before the baby was born. Finally
Christine’s labor started in earnest. She paced the floor, moaning and cry-
ing in pain. I could not sleep. At dawn, she still had not dilated completely,
and my plane would leave in three hours.
   I hurried home and told my husband to meet me at the hospital on the
way to the airport. Then I hurried back to the hospital. Christine was
exhausted, and the doctors were concerned that the baby would die if not
delivered quickly. I had to leave, but Christine clung to me, begging me to
stay.
   I ran outside and told my family to go check in for the flight, that I
would take a boda boda to the airport. Then I ran into the hospital.
   Holding Christine’s head, I whispered, “You can do it. Push!” She
pushed with more strength than she had.
   The phone in my pocket rang. It was my son. “Mom, the plane is due
any minute!” I did not dare look back. Choking back sobs, I raced toward
the street and hailed a boda boda driver to rush me to the airport. As we
raced through the streets tears streaked my face.
   I arrived at the airport and boarded the small plane. We roared into the
air. God, I cried, You are all powerful. Please take care of them. When we
arrived at the airport, I called home. Christine had delivered just minutes
after I left.
   I am back home in Uganda, and I have visited Christine and held her
beautiful little boy. Thank You, God, for letting me be a part of their lives.

      What Have They Seen in
      Your House?


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isaiah 38; 39; 58:6, 7, 10-
      12; 1 Cor. 7:12-15; Heb. 6:12; 13:7; 1 Pet. 3:1, 2; 3 John 11.

Memory Text: “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
      a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the
      praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful
      light” (1 Peter 2:9, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: The home life of Christians can
      be a powerful evangelistic resource.

             missaries from Babylon came to King Hezekiah of Judah to

      E      hear firsthand about his miraculous recovery. Hezekiah happily
             received these guests with a tour that showcased his armory and
      expansive treasure. When they were gone, the prophet Isaiah con-
      fronted him with a penetrating question: “ ‘What have they seen in
      your house?’ ” (Isa. 39:4, NKJV).
        What a question! Suppose that were asked of us? What have people
      seen in our house? What have heavenly angels seen? What does any-
      one see when walking in the door? What kind of spirit permeates our
      residences? Can one smell the scent of prayer? Is there kindness, gen-
      erosity, love? Will someone who is there walk away thinking Jesus is
      in this home?
        Let us dedicate our home life to Him and seek guidance in order
      that our homes may bring glory to God.

     Learning From a King’s Mistake
Review the account of Hezekiah’s healing and the visit of the
     Babylonian ambassadors (2 Chron. 32:25, 31; Isaiah 38; 39).

        Scripture points out that the messengers are interested in the mirac-
     ulous recovery of King Hezekiah. However, Hezekiah seems to be
     silent about his healing experience. He does not emphasize the things
     that would have opened the hearts of these inquiring ambassadors to
     the knowledge of the true God. The contrast between his gratitude for
     being healed in chapter 38 and his silence about it in chapter 39 is
     striking.
        “God left him to test him.” This state visit is a most significant occa-
     sion; yet, there is no record of Hezekiah seeking special guidance
     about it in prayer, from prophets, or from priests. Nor does God inter-
     vene. Alone, out of the public eye, with no consultation with spiritual
     advisers, the work of God in his life and in the life of his nation
     seems to recede from his mind. The intent of the historian in
     2 Chronicles 32:31 may have been to show how easily God’s blessing
     can be taken for granted and how prone the recipients of His mercy
     are to becoming self-sufficient.

Below are some lessons about faithfulness in home life that can be
     gleaned from the experience of Hezekiah. What others can you
     think of?


       ●1 Every visit to the homes of Christians is an opportunity for peo-
     ple to meet followers of Christ.
       ●2 Few visitors are likely to open conversation about spiritual
     things. Christians must find ways that are sensitive and appropriate to
     the occasion to share the good news.
        ●
        3 Christians are not called to show off their material prosperity or
     accomplishments, though they may recognize these as blessings from
     God. They are called to “declare the praises of him who called you out
     of darkness into his wonderful light” (1 Pet. 2:9, NIV) or, to use
     Hezekiah’s experience as a symbol, to declare that they were dying,
     but Christ has healed them; they were dead in sin, and Christ resur-
     rected them and seated them in heavenly places (Eph. 2:4-6).

      In what ways are you able to use your home to witness to oth-
      ers? How could you share your faith in Christ more forthrightly
      with visitors to your home?



                                                                            89

      Family First
         The most natural first recipients of our gospel-sharing endeavors
      are the people in our households. There is no more important mission
      field than this.

What conclusions can be drawn from John 1:40-42 about sharing
      faith at home? See also Deut. 6:6, 7; Ruth 1:14-18.


         An enthusiastic report. Andrew went beyond mere reporting; he
      arranged for his brother, Simon, to meet Jesus. An enthusiastic report
      about Jesus and an introduction to Him as a Person—what a simple
      formula for sharing the gospel with relatives in our homes! After the
      introduction Andrew stepped back. From then on, Jesus and Peter had
      a relationship of their own.
         Helping children to a place of faith. Children in a home can often
      be overlooked as fitting recipients of gospel-sharing efforts. Parents
      mistakenly assume children simply will absorb family spirituality.
      This must not be taken for granted. While children and young people
      learn from the modeling they observe, it is also true these younger
      members of the Lord’s family need individual attention and opportu-
      nity to be introduced personally to Him. Deuteronomy 6 is insistent on
      this point: Attention must be given to the most effective kind of reli-
      gious education. Regular spiritual habits of personal and family wor-
      ship are to be encouraged in the home. Time and earnest efforts must
      be put forth on behalf of children and youth.

What can we learn from the evangelistic efforts of Naomi? Ruth 1:8-22.


        Ruth saw Naomi at the lowest of moments: when she tried to push
      her daughter-in-law away and when, bitter and depressed and over-
      whelmed by grief as she recounted her losses (Ruth 1:15, 20, 21). No
      more eloquent testimony than Ruth’s can be given to show that youth
      can meet and make a commitment to a perfect God, even when intro-
      duced to Him by an imperfect parent.

       How does the notion of home as the most important mission
       field affect your attitude toward the people who live with you?
       Work together as a family to prepare a list of specific efforts
       your family can make to lead unsaved relatives to Christ.

     Peace That Wins
What counsel does the New Testament have for marriages divided by
     religion? 1 Cor. 7:12-15; 1 Pet. 3:1, 2.


        The blessing of being a Christian partner. In 1 Corinthians Paul
     responds to converts’ concerns that staying married to an unbelieving
     spouse might be offensive to God or bring defilement upon them-
     selves and their children. Not so, says Paul. The sacred state of mar-
     riage and its intimacies are to continue after a partner’s conversion.
     The presence of one Christian partner “sanctifies” the other partner
     and the couple’s children. The word sanctifies should be understood in
     the sense that unbelieving spouses come into contact with the bless-
     ings of grace through living with their Christian partners.
        Heartrending as it is, the unbelieving partner may decide to abandon
     the marriage. Though consequences will be serious, the merciful word
     of our God—who always upholds human freedom of choice—is “let
     him do so.” The believer “is not bound in such circumstances” (1 Cor.
     7:15, NIV).
        Called to live in peace. The clear preference of the Word of God is
     that, despite the challenges of a spiritually divided home, a way might
     be found for the peace of Christ to reign there. The hope is to keep the
     marriage intact, to give evidence of the triumph of the gospel in the
     midst of difficulty, and to promote the comfort of the partner with
     whom the believer is one flesh, though he or she be unbelieving.

What might be the limitations of a spouse’s responsibility toward a
     nonbelieving partner?


        Lovingkindness, unwavering fidelity, humble service, and winsome
     witness on the part of the believer create the greatest likelihood of
     winning the non-Christian spouse. Submission in a Christian marriage
     arises out of reverence for Christ (compare Eph. 5:21). When a spouse
     relates with Christian submission to an unbelieving partner, the first
     allegiance is always to Christ. Faithfulness to the claims of God on
     one’s life does not require a spouse to suffer abuse at the hands of a
     violent partner.

      Is someone in your church struggling with an unbelieving
      spouse? If so, in what practical ways could you possibly help?

      Family Life Is for Sharing
In the following verses, trace the New Testament uses of the words fol-
      low (KJV) or imitate (NIV). What do they tell us about the process
      of becoming and growing as a Christian? What do you think they
      suggest about the relationship between modeling and witnessing?
      1 Cor. 4:16, Eph. 5:1, 1 Thess. 1:6, Heb. 6:12, 13:7, 3 John 11.

         The New Testament emphasis on imitation acknowledges the
      important role of modeling in the learning process. People tend to
      become like whom or what they watch. This principle applies to rela-
      tionships generally and especially in the home, where imitation is
      common. There, children imitate their parents and siblings; married
      partners often imitate each other. This concept provides an important
      clue to how couples and families can bear Christian witness to other
      couples and families.
         The power of social influence. We witness from our homes when we
      provide opportunities for others to observe us and to share in our
      home experience in some way. Many simply have no good example of
      marriage or family relationships to follow. In our homes they may see
      how the spirit of Jesus makes a difference. “Social influence,” wrote
      Ellen White, “is a wonderful power. We can use it if we will as a
      means of helping those about us.”—The Ministry of Healing, p. 354.
         As married couples invite other couples for meals, fellowship, or
      Bible study, or when they attend a marital-growth program together,
      the visitors see a model. The display of mutuality, affirmation, com-
      munication, conflict-resolution, and accommodation of differences
      testifies of family life in Christ.

In this context, however, of what must we always be careful? Jer. 17:9,
      John 2:25, Rom. 3:23.

         Follow believers who follow Christ. All human examples are flawed;
      however, the witness of the Christian home is not about modeling
      absolute perfection. The New Testament notion of imitation is a call
      for individuals to follow believers who follow Christ. The idea is that
      individuals will grasp Christian faith as they see it demonstrated in the
      lives of others who are as human and fallible as they are.

       What could you do to make your home a better model for
       Christian witnessing?

        Hospitality meets another person’s basic needs for rest, food, and
     fellowship. It is a tangible expression of self-giving love. Jesus
     attached theological significance to hospitality when He taught that
     feeding the hungry and giving drink to the thirsty were acts of service
     done to Him (Matt. 25:34-40). Using one’s home for ministry may
     range from simply inviting neighbors to a meal to the radical hospi-
     tality of lending a room to an abuse victim. It may involve simple
     friendliness, an opportunity to offer prayer with someone, or the con-
     ducting of Bible studies. True hospitality springs from the hearts of
     those who have been touched by God’s love and want to express their
     love in words and actions.
        Families sometimes complain that they lack the facilities, the time,
     and/or the energy to offer hospitality. Others feel awkward, unskilled,
     and unsure about reaching beyond what is familiar in order to associ-
     ate with unbelievers. Some wish to avoid the complications to their
     lives that may arise from becoming involved with others. Many con-
     temporary families confuse hospitality and entertaining.

      In what ways does your home life reflect your own spiritual con-
      dition?

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Ask anyone in class if it were the influence of someone’s home
      that helped him or her make a decision for Christ. Discuss just
      what it was that made such an impression. What can the class
      learn from that experience?

      ●
      2 In what practical ways can you as a class minister to a family
      with an unbelieving spouse?

      ●
      3 As a class, talk about some of the pressures in the home that
      work against faith. Write up a list of some of these things; then
      across from them, write down possible solutions.

Summary: The private lives of Christians are a means of witness to
     children, unbelieving spouses, other relatives, and visitors. While faith
     sharing at home may not always be as complete as one would like or
     result in the conversion of relatives and visitors, imperfect family
     members seek to point the way to a perfect Savior. Through generous
     hospitality, expressed in the Savior’s name, they bring within the
     realm of grace all whose lives they touch.

God Shall Provide
by SALNAVE RIARD
   I loved sharing my faith with others and received little satisfaction from
operating my small business. I felt God calling me to study theology at the
Adventist university in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
   Finances were a problem. I did not earn enough to pay my tuition and
eat. I gave my problems to God and focused on reaching others, and God
blessed.
   One day as I walked out of my house, I saw some people crying. They
told me that a child had died. The mother and father led me to the child,
about four years old, who lay limp and cold on the bed. His mother said
that he had been sick for two days and had died some time later. I picked
up the child and hugged him to my body. I prayed for God to help me, then
I read Psalm 46: “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in
trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way” (NIV).
Then I knelt to pray.
   “God, I present myself and this child to You. You can see his weeping
family. Come to us, Lord, and show these people that You are God, that
Your name will be praised.”
   Suddenly someone shouted, “Pray, pray!” Then I felt a slight movement
in my arms. He was alive! My prayers turned to praise as I thanked God
for the life of the child. The child lay calmly in my arms as I praised God.
Then I gave the child to his mother.
   The family asked me what they owed me for bringing their child back
to life. Shocked, I told them they owed me nothing, but they owed God
their lives and their praise. He was the One who had saved the child’s life.
I invited the family to visit the nearby Adventist church to listen to the
message of God.
                                When I returned from holding meetings in
                             southern Haiti, I visited the family and studied
                             the Bible with them. At least one member of the
                             family has become an Adventist.
                                I had been concerned about money, but God
                             showed me that I could trust Him for every-
                             thing. I quit fretting about my bills, and God
                             provided a sponsor to help me through school.
                             It is true what the Bible says, “My God shall
                             provide all my needs.”

        LESSON             12 *March 18-24
      Turning Hearts in the
      End Time


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Kings 16:29–17:24;
      Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 3:2; 11:14, 15; 17:10; 18:20-45.

Memory Text: “ ‘I will send you the prophet Elijah before that
      great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. He will turn the hearts
      of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to
      their fathers; or else I will come and strike the land with a curse’ ”
      (Malachi 4:5, 6, NIV).

The Week at a Glance: In the closing verses of the Old
      Testament, a heart-turning work by Elijah is predicted before the
      day of the Lord.

              boy ran away from home. After years of no word from him, the

      A       parents got a postcard. He was coming their way and wanted
              to see them. “I’ll be riding the train that runs behind our
      house,” he wrote. “If it’s OK for me to stop and see you, hang a white
      handkerchief on the fence, and I’ll get off at the next station. If it’s not
      there, I’ll just keep riding.”
        As the train hurtled toward his boyhood home, he wondered, Will
      the handkerchief be there? Finally, the fence came into view, covered
      with handkerchiefs, towels, bedsheets, and pillowcases, not only on
      the fence but on the shrubbery and the trees—a great mass of white,
      saying WELCOME HOME!
        The point should be obvious.

     The Prophecy of Turned Hearts
Compare the prediction of the coming of Elijah with New
     Testament references to this event. Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 11:14, 15;
     17:10; Mark 6:15; Luke 1:17.


        In the days of Malachi, God’s appeal to the nation, “ ‘Return to Me,
     and I will return to you,’ ” met with the arrogant response, “ ‘ “In what
     way shall we return?” ’ ” (Mal. 3:7, NKJV). The frustrated prophet
     announced that one further opportunity for revival would be given.
     Recalling the heart-turning reform begun by Elijah (1 Kings 18:37),
     Malachi predicted his coming again to “ ‘turn the hearts of the fathers
     to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers’ ” (Mal.
     4:6, NIV).
        A Jewish tradition developed that Elijah would appear personally as
     the herald of the Messiah (compare Matt. 17:10, Mark 6:15).
     However, the New Testament presents John the Baptist as a fulfillment
     of the prophecy (Matt. 11:14, 15; Luke 1:17).

What do you think the phrase “turn the hearts” means?


       Several applications are possible for these texts: It refers to the rec-
     onciliation of the people of Israel with the Lord. God as Father (Isa.
     63:16) has turned from His wrath toward His children (Mic. 7:18, 19)
     and calls them to return to Him (Isa. 44:22, Mal. 3:7). It refers to the
     reconnecting of later generations with their faithful ancestors through
     covenant renewal. The prophetic call for God’s people to follow the
     faith of the patriarchs was given repeatedly in the Old Testament.
     Whether the land continued as a blessed dwelling place was directly
     related to covenant faithfulness (Deut. 4:29-31). It refers to the
     restoration and renewal of family relationships. Parent-child relation-
     ships are a practical expression of covenant faithfulness with God.
     Here, too, fulfillment of responsibilities to parents and children inter-
     weave with continued inheritance of the land and God’s blessing
     (Prov. 2:21).

      What is the connection between a restored relationship with
      God and restored relationships in our families? Why must one
      precede the other?

     Family Reunion
        The introduction of Baal worship into Israel by Jezebel, the
     Sidonian wife of King Ahab, hastened the nation’s downward moral
     slide. The teachings of God that uplifted marriage, family, and sexu-
     ality were overshadowed by practices such as incest, prostitution, and
     other sexual perversions. Into this arena of conflict over worship
     stepped Elijah, whose very name, “Jehovah-is-my-God,” rebuked a
     belief in Baal.

What experience of Elijah associated him with overturning heathen
     beliefs and bringing new life to families? 1 Kings 16:29–17:24;
     compare Luke 4:25, 26.


       Elijah was a marked man after announcing the curse of drought
     upon the land. God sheltered him in an unlikely place—at a poor
     widow’s dwelling in Zarephath of Sidon, near Jezebel’s hometown.
     Elijah greeted the widow with a grim test, to use her last bits of kin-
     dling, oil, and flour to feed him and to trust God for her future. Her
     faith became legendary. Jesus Himself would later commend her
     (Luke 4:26). As her oil and meal stretched out over many days, the
     woman came to understand more about Jehovah. Then, tragically, her
     only son fell sick and died. In expressing her grief to Elijah, she
     reflected the familiar religion around her, the perverted beliefs that
     now engulfed Israel, in which one’s sin could require child sacrifice
     (1 Kings 17:18; compare Jer. 19:5, Mic. 6:7).

What effect did the reunion with her son have upon the Phoenician
     widow’s spiritual experience? 1 Kings 17:24. What can we learn
     from her comments?


       The mother’s response reveals the effect of the Elijah message. Faith
     in God and His Word arises in the heart as, by His power, life is
     restored and the family is reunited. Many today may give assent as
     doctrines are preached but are lukewarm in their spiritual experience.
     However, when the truths of God’s Word are experienced personally
     and revival and restoration occur in home relationships, conviction
     comes ever so much more powerfully upon the heart.

      What are some family reunions that you are still waiting for?
      What promises of God are you clinging to that give you hope of
      that reunion?

      Turning Hearts at the Altar
Read 1 Kings 18:20-45. Write out what essentially this whole episode
      is about. Though the context is totally different, how can the prin-
      ciples seen in this story apply to family life?

         On Mount Carmel, Elijah longed for covenant renewal on the part
      of his nation, a turning back to the faith of their fathers that would
      bring healing to their lives, their homes, and their land.
         The hour of the evening sacrifice. After the heathen priests’ failure
      with their sacrifice, Elijah took his turn. He was deliberate. The time
      of day drew attention to God’s redemptive plan revealed in the sanc-
      tuary service (compare Exod. 29:41). The invitation “ ‘Come near to
      me’ ” (1 Kings 18:30, NKJV) reminds us of the Savior’s welcoming
      sinners (compare Matt. 11:28). Parents who are pained at the way-
      wardness of a child can be assured God loves him or her as truly as He
      loved the Israelites. God works unceasingly to draw wayward ones to
      Him.
         Elijah’s focus on Jehovah’s altar finds its equivalent in our time
      when Jesus and His saving grace are uplifted in families. Family wor-
      ship is an opportunity to talk to Him in prayer, to speak of Him to one
      another, to receive anew His free gift of salvation, and to give our
      hearts time to reflect on His teachings.
         The response Elijah requested would signal that God had taken
      them back to Himself. First Kings 18:37 says, “ ‘That this people may
      know . . . You have turned their hearts back to You again’ ” (NKJV).
      We cannot turn our hearts to God; we can only respond to His grace,
      and that He freely gives.
         The all-consuming fire fell, not upon the guilty but upon the sacri-
      fice, pointing forward to Jesus, who was made “sin for us, that we
      might become the righteousness of God in Him” (2 Cor. 5:21, NKJV).
      Confession and praise burst from the people’s lips. Because they did
      not respond to God’s call, the false priests were executed. Then
      refreshing rains ended the curse upon the land.

       you rebuild the altar in your home, if indeed it needs some

      Turning Hearts at the Jordan
        Alongside Gabriel’s prediction (Luke 1:17) and Jesus’ confirmation
      of John the Baptist as the predicted Elijah (Matt. 11:14; 17:12, 13),
      the Gospel writers affirm that he was the “messenger” who would pre-
      pare the way of the Lord (Matt. 11:10, Mark 1:2, Luke 7:27; compare
      Mal. 3:1).

Note the main aspects of John’s message. In what way is his message
      one of heart-turning? Matt. 3:2, 8; 14:4; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3, 8, 9,
      11, 13, 14.

        Like a farmer who plows hard ground to prepare it to receive seed,
      John denounced sin and urged sinners to repent. Human nature is such
      that, without self-examination, without an awareness of one’s true
      condition, no need is felt for something better. His message turned
      people toward the holiness of God’s requirements and their need of
      His perfect righteousness. Genuine repentance is always marked by
      humility and looking to God for help to change one’s behavior. By
      exposing the shallow, self-centered hypocrisy of those who claimed
      Abraham as their father, he sought to open the deeper meaning of the
      faith of their fathers.

How did the message of John the Baptist prepare the way for Jesus?
      John 1:35-37, 3:27-30.


        John had been shown that Jesus was the Lamb of God. When he
      introduced Jesus this way (John 1:29, 36), he literally turned people to
      the Lord. Andrew and another of John’s disciples, John—the Gospel
      writer who wrote the account of that day—left the Baptist’s side and
      became the first of Jesus’ disciples. Not only does the Elijah message
      point to the need for repentance; it identifies the One who saves from
      sin, generates excitement about Him, and introduces people to Him.

       If John the Baptist were to step into your home, what do you
       think he would be saying to you?

     Turning Hearts in the Last Days
       In a sense, we as Adventists see ourselves in the role of John the
     Baptist. The herald of reform and repentance sought to prepare the
     way for the first coming of Jesus; we, as a movement, see ourselves
     doing the same for the Second Coming.

Read prayerfully Luke 1:17. How do these words capture our mes-
     sage?

        The heavenly Father has turned the hearts of His children back to
     Himself and has turned the hearts of His children to one another
     through the Cross of Christ. The Elijah message pleads with families
     to believe this incredible good news (2 Cor. 5:18-21; compare Eph.
     2:11-18) and to be people filled with grace as His Spirit yields a har-
     vest of love in them.
        The world needs desperately a demonstration of unselfish caring,
     lasting commitment, and unswerving devotion to God. By God’s grace
     Christian families can provide such a demonstration. Yet, we must
     remember that the message we have for the world is also for ourselves.
     Until the principles of gospel, of unity, of love, of self-sacrifice are
     made manifest among us, especially in our own families, we will be
     powerless to share this message with others. All the eloquent sermons,
     all the logic and biblical presentations, aren’t enough: The world needs
     to see manifest in our lives, especially in our family lives, the repent-
     ance, the turned hearts, the love, and the commitment we preach about.
     Just as John the Baptist had a power that changed lives and made his
     preaching effective, we can do the same through the grace of God, but
     only to the degree in which we are willing to cooperate.
        We are, through Jesus, part of the family in heaven (Eph. 3:15).
     Thus, whether we are a family of one or more, we are called to be wit-
     nesses for the God we profess to serve, and nothing can make our wit-
     ness more effective than to show the world what a family, regardless
     of its size, can be through the power of the gospel.

      What can you do, in a special way, to show those closest to you,
      whether immediate family or others, that you love and care
      about them?

                                                                         101

        A message to prepare a people. “Our message must be as direct as
      was that of John. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. Notwithstanding

Discussion Questions:
       ●
       1 As a class, discuss the relevance of the Elijah message to your
       local church. What can you do to help your church understand
       the message and its role in helping to spread it?

       ●
       2 Have those who are willing share with the class their own per-
       sonal experiences of having their hearts turned. What changes
       came about? What difference did this experience have upon their
       lives and the lives of their families?

       ●
       3 If we see ourselves in the role of John the Baptist, what should
       we expect to happen to us? What is the implicit message in that
       answer?

       ●4 As a class, work on a paragraph, a kind of “Declaration of
       Family Principles,” that best encapsulates what the biblical idea
       for a family is. Be prepared to share it with the whole church.


Summary: An appeal for faith in God and acceptance of His recon-
      ciling gospel of grace is going forth today just before Christ returns.
      A positive response to this good news alone secures the bonds of
      earthly children to the heavenly Father, as well as parents and children
      to one another.

The Late Visitor
by ELIJAH ANGELOV
   I was a pastor in a charismatic church in Bulgaria for years. Then the
Adventists held evangelistic meetings in my village. I was sure that
Adventists did not have the Holy Spirit, for they did not speak in tongues.
But I decided to attend the meetings, just to hear what these people said
about God.
   I was shocked by the compelling Bible truths that were presented, that
Saturday is God’s holy day and that the soul does not go directly to heaven
or hell after death. The subjects were clearly presented and backed by
Bible texts.
   As I searched the Bible, I became convinced that what the Adventists
teach was the truth. Others tried to convince me that Adventists are wrong,
but they could not back their statements from the Bible. I continued pray-
ing and studying the Bible.
   My wife, Zoya, attended the meetings too. She noticed my distress and
asked me, “Are you thinking about what the Adventists teach too?”
   “Yes I am,” I told her.
   We did not join the Adventists during those meetings, but we continued
studying the Bible and struggling over what God wanted us to do. Then
one day months later, Zoya told me, “I am convinced that the Sabbath
message is correct.”
   I asked her how she came to that conclusion.
   “I asked God plainly,” she said. “I told God that if the Adventists are His
people, and if I am wrong, then please send Sister Nina to our home to tell
me, ‘Do not waver, the Sabbath is God’s truth.’ If this happens, then I will
be convinced that Adventists are right. But send Nina today. Otherwise I
will know that Adventists are wrong.
   “The hours dragged by,” Zoya continued. “Noon passed, and Sister Nina
had not come. Dinner was over, and still she had not come. Soon it was
time for bed, and Nina was not there. I decided that the message the
Adventists teach is wrong.
   “I was ready for bed when someone knocked at the door. It was Nina.
She did not mince words, but said, ‘Sister Zoya, do not waver. The Sabbath
is God’s truth.’ I started to cry and shout, ‘Praise the Lord!’
   “Then Nina told me she had resisted an impulse to come see us all day.
But finally she could not wait any longer, so she came.”
   I praised God, too, for opening our minds and showing us His power and
His truth.

2006    Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

         The Holy Spirit, our study for the next quarter, is based on a previ-
       ously published Bible study guide, written by the late Arnold V.
       Wallenkampf. While the lessons will present a doctrinal picture of the
       Holy Spirit, they also will emphasize the daily and practical aspect of
       His work in our lives. The powerful reality of His work is manifested
       not only in our personal experiences but in the life and power of the
       church. Thus, we deal extensively with the vivifying power of the
       Spirit as we seek to present Him as God’s regenerating Agent.

Lesson 1—The Personality and Divinity of the Holy Spirit
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: The Triune God
       MONDAY: God the Holy Spirit
       TUESDAY: God the Holy Spirit: Continued (Acts 5:3, 4)
       WEDNESDAY: The Unity of God (Matt. 28:19, 2 Cor. 13:14)
       THURSDAY: Evidences of the Spirit’s Personality
       Memory Text—Matthew                    28:19
       Sabbath Gem: This week we’ll concentrate on one often mis-
       understood aspect of the Holy Spirit: His Divinity. The Holy Spirit
       is not just some impersonal force that emanates from God. Instead,
       He is God, one of the three Persons who make up the Godhead of
       the Christian faith.

Lesson 2—The Holy Spirit Symbolized in Scripture
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Dove (John 1:32)
       MONDAY: Water (John 7:37-39, RSV).
       TUESDAY: Oil (Matt. 25:1-4)
       WEDNESDAY: Seal and Guarantee (2 Cor. 1:22, RSV)
       THURSDAY: Light and Fire (John 1:9)
       Memory Text—John                 3:8
       Sabbath Gem: The Spirit is frequently alluded to through the use
       of a variety of symbols. It only is through an acquaintance with the
       symbols, emblems, or illustrations used for the Spirit that His work
       and ministry in the believer’s life can be adequately understood.
