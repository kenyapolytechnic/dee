         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of a worldwide Sabbath
         School Manuscript Evaluation Committee, whose members serve as consulting edi-
         tors. The published guide reflects the input of the committee and thus does not
         solely or necessarily represent the intent of the author(s).

                       Genesis:
The book of Genesis             In 1997 a Nobel Prize-winning physi-

                              astronomer wrote, “Why should it have
resulted from the             a point? What point? It’s just a physical
purposeful act of a           system; what point is there?” Another
                              scientist, agreeing, said, “I am willing to
loving God who made           believe that we are flotsam and jetsam.”
us in His own image.            Flotsam and jetsam? Yet, considering
                              their premise—that we are here by pure
chance alone—what other conclusion would they have drawn? After
all, we just one day are born; eventually we become aware of our-
selves—pain, fear, and hunger often being the first sensations of
self-consciousness. Uninvited, life is foisted upon us without asking
for it and yet remains difficult to give back if we don’t want it and
impossible to retain if we do. We’re given something none sought
after, planned for, or acquiesced in; we’re not sure what it is, what it
means, or even why we have it; its most real and immediate givens—
pain, sorrow, loss, fear—remain inexplicable.
  No wonder these scientists, left to try to understand our origins on
their own, see it as all pointless, a mere physical system, nothing
more.
  How thankful we should be, then, that the Lord hasn’t left us on
our own regarding our origins. Genesis is God’s revelation to us of
those origins, and it presents a view radically different from what
most science presents. That science, without revelation, has deter-
mined we’re the creation of meaningless and purposeless forces is
more than enough proof of how, without revelation, we get it all
wrong.
  Indeed, contrary to the “scientific” view, which says we’re here
2
Creation and Redemption
  only because of pure chance, the book of Genesis says that we’re
  here because God created us, that our existence resulted from the
  purposeful act of a loving and caring God who made human beings
  “in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and
  female created he them” (Gen. 1:27). It’s hard to imagine two more
  conflicting, irreconcilable positions.
    But Creation is only the beginning of Genesis. The book teaches
  us about the Fall, the global Flood, the Tower of Babel, which
  together help us better understand the nature of the world we have
  all found ourselves in without any choice of our own.
    Most important, though, Genesis also tells the story of Abraham
  and the patriarchal line that would arise out of him, the one in whom
  “all the nations” shall “be blessed” (Gal. 3:8, RSV). Genesis doesn’t
  focus only on the Fall and its results; instead, scattered through its
  pages are symbols and shadows that point to the great hope of
  salvation offered to God’s fallen world through Jesus, a hope offered
  to everyone who, like Abraham, claims it by faith. Or, as Paul,
  steeped in Genesis, expressed it: “So then they which be of faith are
  blessed with faithful Abraham” (Gal. 3:9)—the father of “all who
  believe” (Rom. 4:11, NIV).
    This quarter we’ll get an inspired account of the miracle that cre-
  ated us; we’ll also get, in hints and symbols, the earliest revelations
  of the miracle that saves us: the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus
  Christ.
    All this is found in Genesis, a book about Creation and
  Redemption, not “flotsam and jetsam.”

      Foundations


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 19:3-8, Luke 17:26-
      30, Acts 7:1-15, Rom. 1:17, 4:3, 5:14, Heb. 11:1-22.


Memory Text: “If the foundations be destroyed, what can the
      righteous do?” (Psalm 11:3).

             outh African Laurens Van der Post had a rock sitting on his liv-

      S      ing room table. When asked about the “strange black stone,” he
             responded that it came from fifteen thousand feet below the sur-
      face of Africa. It was sent to him by a friend who, in the accompanying
      letter, wrote: “This is a symbol of what you and I have tried to build
      on all our lives.”
         We all build upon foundations. In the most literal sense, we build
      our lives upon the rocks beneath our feet; but in another, we build our
      lives around the principles that govern us. Atheists, religious fanatics,
      skeptics, scientists—everyone governs their lives by fundamental
      principles, whether they acknowledge those principles or not.
         As Christians, our principles are found in and through the person of
      Jesus Christ, the One in whom “we live, and move, and have our
      being” (Acts 17:28). And yet, we know about Jesus through the Bible.
      So, the Bible, in essence, works as the foundation for our lives and our
      faith. And, in a sense, Genesis serves as the “foundation” of the Bible,
      kind of like the “strange black stone” far beneath the earth that held
      up the ground immediately beneath Laurens’s feet.
         This week, we’ll take our first look at this book, the “bedrock” of
      the Bible itself.

                 S UNDAY October 1

     Genesis and the New Testament
        The Pentateuch (the first five books found in our modern Bibles)
     comes from a Greek term for “five.” The five books, Genesis, Exodus,
     Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, provide the foundation for our
     biblical faith. It would be hard to make much sense of our religion
     without them.
        As the first of these five books—and, indeed, the first book in the
     Bible itself—Genesis begins with the origin of our world. After all, if
     we don’t have our origins right, how easy it is to get everything else
     wrong. If a builder working on the joints of a house gets the joint off
     by a few degrees right from the start, before long the walls will be
     crooked and unusable. Thus, Genesis begins with a clear and distinct
     message about our origins.
        Of course, the enemy of souls works hard to turn the world away
     from the true God. One of his methods is to put doubt in our minds
     regarding the veracity of the Bible. Genesis itself comes under fierce
     attack. If he can undermine our faith in it, which is so foundational,
     how easy for him to undermine our faith in everything else.

What do the following texts tell us about how Jesus and the New
     Testament authors viewed the authenticity and veracity of
     Genesis? Matt. 19:3-8; Luke 17:26-30; Acts 7:1-15; Rom. 4:3, 9-21;
     5:14; 1 Cor. 15:22; Gal. 3:6; 1 Tim. 2:13, 14; Heb. 11:3-22; 1 Pet. 3:20.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Are we going to listen to the critics who come up with all sorts of
     “evidence” to question the historical veracity of Genesis, or do we fol-
     low the lead of those like Jesus and Paul and Peter, who showed
     unquestioned faith in the book? Indeed, to question the veracity of
     Genesis means to question the veracity of the New Testament, which
     time and again refers to Genesis. How reliable could the New
     Testament be if it were all wrong about Genesis? As we can see, once
     we start questioning the historical veracity of the Genesis account, the
     whole edifice of faith crumbles. Which, of course, is exactly what
     Satan wants.

      What other examples can you find of how doubt regarding what
      might seem like a “small” thing can, if taken to its logical con-
      clusion, lead to doubt about major things, as well? Why, then,
      should we be so careful regarding our trust in the Bible as the
      Word of God? After all, once you start doubting the Bible,
      what’s left?

                                                                            7

     The Mighty and Merciful God
       The book of Genesis is first and foremost a revelation of God. In
     Genesis, humanity is given its first written revelation about our
     Creator and Redeemer.

        The first book of the Bible rings with the might and power of God.
     He is seen as the Creator, Judge, Exemplar, Sustainer, Most High,
     Almighty, and Everlasting God. As the Sovereign, He not only exists
     before everything but also brings everything into existence.
       And yet, there’s so much more revealed about God here. Even in
     some of the Genesis accounts about judgment we can see His mercy;
     His sufferings over humanity’s sin; His great patience. Before the
     Flood came, He had Noah preach many long years, giving everyone
     an opportunity to be saved. Even with Sodom and Gomorrah, despite
     their great wickedness, He was willing to spare them, if possible. All
     through Genesis we can see the might and power of a merciful, loving
     God who, despite His hatred of sin and evil, loves His fallen creatures
     and seeks to redeem them.

      God is like. What does your answer reveal about your view of
      God? Be prepared to share your answer in class.

      Close Encounters
        Genesis, we saw yesterday, depicts God as all-powerful, the One
      who spoke the world into existence, the One who could bring a flood
      upon the whole earth, and who could rain fire down on rebellious and
      violent cities. As humans, looking out at the expanse of the creation,
      how could we not be in awe at the incredible power of the God who
      created all things?
        Yet, the Bible also depicts God as up close and personal; that is,
      unlike the god of deism, who creates the world and then goes off to
      leave it on its own, the God revealed in the Bible has been intimately
      associated with fallen beings. We see this most powerfully in the life
      and death of Jesus (see Phil. 2:5-8). And yet, even back in Genesis,
      we are given glimpses of the closeness with which God interacts with
      His fallen beings. Kind of a nice thought, isn’t it, especially if you
      view God as loving and compassionate.

In the following examples, how do we see God closely interacting with
      humanity? What does each account tell us about the character of
      God?

     Foundations
       In Acts 6 a Jewish believer, Stephen, a man “full of faith and power”
     who did “great wonders and miracles” (Acts 6:8) was hauled before a
     council of leaders for preaching and promoting Jesus. Acts 7 then
     begins with him giving the speech that would, when done, lead to his
     death by stoning (see Acts 7).

Read the speech of Stephen in Acts 7:2-17 and then answer the fol-
     lowing questions:

     1. Does Stephen appear to have any questions about the authen -
     ticity of the stories he is recounting? What lesson is here for us?




     2. Where is he getting these stories from?




     3. What’s the purpose of his telling these stories as par t of his
     defense of his belief in Jesus?




        If you look at the context, Stephen is being challenged for his
     preaching that Jesus is the Messiah. And he starts his defense back in
     Genesis, with the call to Abraham; he then traces the family history
     from him up through Joseph in Egypt to the founding of the nation of
     Israel and the building of the temple itself. All of which culminated in
     the coming of “the Just One” (Acts 7:52), Jesus of Nazareth.
        The point is that Stephen uses Genesis as the starting point for the
     great truths that climaxed in Jesus, “the truth” (John 14:6). These Jews,
     who formed the core of the church, had a firm foundation for their faith
     in Jesus—and that was the Holy Scriptures, of which Genesis was the
     starting point. Hence, we can see the important role this book should
     play in our own understanding of what we believe, as well.

      What are some of the “foundations” in your own life, basic
      things upon which so much else rests? How firm are these foun-
      dations? Are you sure they are firm enough to hold you even
      during the weightiest of trials?

     The Just Shall Live by Faith

       It’s often heard that in Old Testament times believers in the Lord
     were saved by works of the law and that after the death of Jesus and
     the beginning of the Christian church they began to be saved by faith
     alone. Yet, that’s not Bible teaching, not in the Old or New Testament.
     According to the New Testament, God’s people lived by faith even
     from the beginning.

Read Hebrews 11:1-22, an inspired account of the lives of some of
     those found in Genesis. How does what you read there harmonize
     with Romans 1:17? As you read about each person, place yourself
     in their position and ask yourself what it was they were having to
     take on faith; that is, what they were needing to trust God on.
     What lessons can you learn from their experiences that can help
     you with whatever you are going through right now?

Further Study:
        “The work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, recon-
     structing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation. It is
     robbing God’s word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human
     lives. By spiritualism, multitudes are taught to believe that desire is
     the highest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable only
     to himself. . . .
        “The power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great need.”—Ellen
     G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 474, 478.
        “Night, dark and portentous, is enclosing the Christian world.
     Apostasy from God’s commandments is evidence of this night, deep,
     dark, and apparently impenetrable. Systems that make the truth of
     God of none effect are cherished. Men are teaching for doctrine the
     commandments of men; and their assertions are taken as truth. The
     people have received man-made theories. So the gospel is perverted,
     and the Scripture misapplied. As in the days of Christ, the light of
     truth is pushed into the background. Men’s theories and suppositions
     are honoured before the word of the Lord God of hosts. The truth is
     counteracted by error. The word of God is wrested, divided, and dis-
     torted by higher criticism. Jesus is acknowledged, only to be betrayed
     by a kiss. Apostasy exists, and will enclose the world till the last. Its
     hideous character and darkening influence will be seen in the mad-
     dening draughts dealt out from Babylon.”—Ellen G. White, Bible
     Echo, Feb. 1, 1897.

The Letters That Changed a
Village
by BIKILA MERGA
  A letter from an isolated area of Ethiopia leads to a new group of believers.
   Adventist World Radio’s program producer in Ethiopia, Temesgen Bulti,
received a listener letter that made him take note. The listener, who lives in
an isolated area several hours from the capital city of Addis Ababa, asked
for clarification regarding the Sabbath and the Holy Spirit’s manifestation in
Christian churches.
   Bulti answered the listener’s questions and sent literature in his language.
The listener learned more Bible truths and confronted his pastor with ques-
tions. “Why do we worship on Sunday, contrary to the Bible?” he asked.
Their pastor could not answer the question, and, realizing where his mem-
ber had learned about the Sabbath, traveled to AWR’s studios in Addis
Ababa to get answers.
   In response, AWR aired more programs designed to answer the questions
and specific needs of the people in this community, including further infor-
mation on the Sabbath. The congregation closed their church on Sunday and
began worshiping on Saturday. They sent elders to Addis Ababa with a peti-
tion to be recognized as a Sabbath-keeping congregation. Bulti referred
them to the Central Ethiopian field office.
   Church leaders promised to come and hold meetings in the village. A
team made the difficult journey to the village, including a five-hour hike
from the nearest road.
   “Church members were so excited when we arrived that they carried our
luggage [and even] the generator all the way to their village,” Bulti says.
   More than five hundred people attended the evening meetings, many of
them sleeping in tents so they would not miss a meeting. Following the
meetings, 185 people were baptized and another 350 committed their lives
to the Lord and will join the Seventh-day Adventist Church soon. Members
of other churches want to become Seventh-day Adventists too. The church
headquarters in Ethiopia plans to build a church for these new believers.
   Until the evangelistic meetings, there had been no Seventh-day Adventist
presence in this area, more than one hundred miles (one hundred fifty kilo-
meters) north of Addis Ababa. This is an area that has proven difficult to
enter because of the strong hold by the traditional church of Ethiopia.
Recently listener interest has increased significantly, judging by the number
of letters the station receives. AWR plans to follow up with materials pro-
duced for each language group.
   Our mission offerings make possible the work of Adventist World Radio
in Ethiopia and around the world.

      “In the Beginning . . .”




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 1.

Memory Text: “By the word of the Lord were the heavens
      made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. . . . For
      he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast”
      (Psalm 33:6, 9).

              n the topic of human origins, a famous scientist wrote: “We’re

      O
      tures.”
              here because one odd group of fishes had a peculiar fin
              anatomy that could transform into legs for terrestrial crea-

         The Bible, of course—particularly the first two chapters of
      Genesis—gives a completely different account of our origins: We’re
      here only because a loving, benevolent Creator-God purposely created
      life on earth in a process that took six literal contiguous 24-hour days.
         It is pretty obvious that modern evolutionary theory stands in bla-
      tant opposition to the biblical account of Creation. If one is correct,
      the other has to be wrong. Even more so, the Bible offers no wiggle
      room for theistic evolution or any theories that seek to integrate a long
      evolutionary process with the work of God in creating life on earth,
      especially human life. As we’ll study this week, in the creation of the
      world, particularly humans, it doesn’t appear that God left anything to
      chance.
         Let’s take a look at what the Bible says about origins and see for
      ourselves that the reason we are here has nothing to do with some fish
      fin that could, by chance, turn into a leg, and everything to do with the
      God who spoke the world into existence.

     “In the Beginning, God . . .”
       One could argue that, in many ways, the most important text in the
     Bible is Genesis 1:1. Out of it and all that it contains flows everything
     else that we as Christians believe. None of our basic teachings make
     sense apart from the idea expressed in that verse—an idea that
     becomes even more pertinent in our day and age, when so many peo-
     ple have been swept away by false science, which explains Creation as
     the result of natural forces that, by chance, evolved into life on this
     earth. The Bible, with its first verse, denies that idea completely.

Read the following texts. What’s the common message in all of them?
     Exod. 20:11; Job 38:4; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15-20; Heb. 1:2;
     Rev. 14:6, 7.

     ____________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Even more than the process of Creation itself, nature’s Creator
     remains the primary focus in the rest of Genesis 1. The word God
     punctuates the 31 verses of this chapter 32 times, a fact that emphasizes
     God’s role in Creation. The first chapter of Genesis seems to go out of
     its way to remove any notion of chance in Creation. Also, unlike other
     ancient polytheisms, which often linked Creation with the battles of
     ancient deities, Genesis depicts only one God as the sovereign
     Creator.
        The verb translated “created” in verse 1 (bara) appears in the Bible
     only when it depicts an activity of God. The other common word used
     when human beings or even God makes or does things is asah. Only
     God, then, can do the kind of creating that was required to make the
     heavens and the earth. As humans, we can work within that Creation
     and do (asah) things with it, but only God could create (bara) it itself.

      It’s a fundamental law that nothing created can be greater than
      its creator. (Try to think of an example.) Hence, when you view
      the entire creation, not just the earth (the main focus of Genesis
      1), and realize that the God who created the universe is greater
      than the universe, what does that tell you about the power of
      God? What does it tell you about the sacrifice of this God, who
      became a human being who died in your stead the death that
      you deserved?
                                                                           15

      The Creation
        When Genesis 1:1 says that God created heaven and earth, some
      believe that “heaven” here includes the entire universe. A study of the
      use of the word heaven in the rest of the chapter shows that’s not
      what’s meant.

See how the word heaven is used in the rest of the chapter (see espe-
      cially vs. 20). What, from the context, is the meaning of heaven in
      Genesis 1?
      ____________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________

What does verse 2 tell us about the condition of the earth at the begin-
      ning of Creation?
      ____________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________


         The phrase “without form, and void” depicts an environment with-
      out shape, form, and light, and void of plant and animal life; in short,
      a nonlife-supporting globe. God created by means of a commanding
      word (vss. 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24; compare Ps. 33:6-9) or by using the
      matter that He already had brought into existence some time before
      the creation of life on earth. Though the reading of these texts in
      Genesis doesn’t require a creation out of nothing, God wasn’t depend-
      ent upon preexisting matter in order to create the earth. Whatever mat-
      ter He used to make the earth, He had already at some point in the past
      created out of nothing because, according to the Bible, God created
      everything.

Read John 1:3. What point is that verse making, and how does it help
      us understand these opening verses of Genesis?
      ____________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________

       In two short verses we are given the essence of our origins: A
       Creator-God made us from a formless and void earth. Much
       else remains a mystery that we’ll never understand now. It is,
       though, a miracle that we’re here at all. Meditate on our exist-
       ence, on the miracle of Creation, and on all that we owe to God.

     The Creation Days
        Probably no aspect of the Creation story comes under more attack
     than the time frame it depicts for the creation of life on earth, culmi-
     nating in Adam and Eve. Almost throughout the Christian world,
     where the Bible is supposedly held in high esteem, few accept the
     Genesis time frame as it reads, with its clear and unambiguous depic-
     tion of six literal 24-hour days of Creation. Apparently, evolution—a
     teaching that at its core denies everything that the Bible stands for and
     teaches—has made deep inroads even in the Christian community.
     Jesus once said, in reference to His second coming, “When the Son of
     man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?” (Luke 18:8). Unless
     there’s a radical change, He certainly won’t find much faith regarding
     the Bible’s account of Creation, that’s for sure.

Read through Genesis 1, focusing on the time element in which
     Creation is depicted. What evidence can you find directly within
     the chapter itself that shows that literal time was meant? Also,
     what other texts can you find in the Bible that show it was meant
     to be literal, not figurative, time? (See, for example, Exod. 20:8-11.)

     ____________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Read carefully Genesis 1:4, 5. A simple reading of these two verses
     makes it clear that it is talking about a single day, as we understand a
     day—half light and half darkness, “day” and “night.” These two el-
     ements, the text says, made up “the first day.” These verses, then, are
     talking about the creation of the 24-hour period we use to mark off
     each single day. And this account ends with a formula that reads in
     Hebrew, “And there was evening and there was morning, day one.”
     That same formula—first used here to mark off explicitly a single day,
     the creation of this 24-hour time period—is then repeated throughout
     the rest of the chapter to depict the other days of Creation themselves.
     “And there was evening and there was morning, day two,” . . . “day
     three,” and so forth. Hence, within the first few verses the Lord
     showed us unambiguously that when the Bible says, in Exodus 20, for
     instance, that “in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth”
     (vs. 11, NIV), He meant six days, nothing less and certainly nothing
     more.

     The Chicken or the Egg?
       The Genesis Creation account is not simple, which shouldn’t be sur-
     prising. After all, the earth and life on earth aren’t simple. We have
     been given (even with chapter 2 included) about fifty-six verses to
     explain Creation: Most manuals on how to fix a bicycle are longer. No
     doubt a lot has been left out. How fortunate that we’ll have an eternity
     to learn more. We’ll need it.
       Nevertheless, there’s still plenty of information there for us to pon-
     der now.

Read through Genesis 1 again; this time focus on the sequence of
     events. What pattern emerges? How does this pattern make sense
     in regard to our understanding of the nature of life on earth?

     ____________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Genesis starts out saying that earth was “without form, and void”
     (Gen. 1:2). God then proceeded to give our earth form and remove the
     “void.” If you follow the sequence, at first there’s darkness and then
     light; this leads to demarcation of day and night. Next, there’s some
     kind of atmosphere, a “firmament” called “heaven.” Water, it seems,
     is already there at the time of earth’s creation, which, of course, is
     needed for life (at least as life exists here). God then brings forth dry
     land, and then upon the dry land there came vegetation, grass, herbs,
     trees (all of which needed land first in order to exist) “whose seed is
     in itself ” (vss. 11, 12). This is followed by the presence of the sun and
     the moon and the visible stars (why these are depicted here, in this
     manner, in this part of the sequence, is one of those questions we’ll
     probably have to wait to get answered in heaven). Finally, with all
     these other things in place, God was able to bring forth creatures, land
     and sea creatures who were flying and swarming and moving through-
     out this part of God’s creation, living things who were to “be fruitful,
     and multiply” (vs. 21) upon the face of the earth. Thus, it seems that,
     within our limited understanding, the Lord followed a very logical
     sequence and pattern that resulted in the creation of life here.

      Keeping the Genesis account in mind, answer this question:
      Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Justify your answer,
      and why is that answer (or at least the principles behind that
      answer) important to our own understanding of just who we are
      and why we are here?

      The Creation of Humanity
Compare the creation of the animals to the creation of Adam.
      What are the similarities? See Gen. 1:24; 2:7, 19.




What are the differences? Gen. 1:26, 27; 2:7.




In contrast to the creation of the animals and Adam, how was Eve cre-
      ated? Gen. 2:21-24.




         As stated yesterday, there’s so much about Creation not revealed in
      the Scriptures. But enough is revealed to show the special place of
      humanity (notice in Genesis 1:27 that the generic term man included
      both male and female; it takes two different sexes to define what is
      meant by human) in the Creation story. Only after God had everything
      else perfectly in place did He create Adam (whose name in Hebrew is
      very closely related to the word for “ground”), and only after him did
      He create Eve. Despite some similarities between these humans and
      the beasts, the Bible makes a clear distinction between them. Also, as
      with the creation of everything else, Genesis knows nothing about
      chance in the formation of humanity. On the contrary, the systematic
      pattern of Creation, expressed in repeated formulas (“and God saw,”
      “and God said,” “let there be”) in a repeated time frame (“and there
      was evening and morning . . .”), culminating in the intimate act of cre-
      ating both the man (Gen. 2:7) and the woman (vss. 21-24), show that
      God left nothing to chance.

       Read Genesis 1:26, 27. What does this idea of humanity being
       made in God’s image mean? What are the differences between
       human beings and other earthly creatures—differences that
       might help us better understand the unique place we have?
       Also, think about Jesus, the humanity of Jesus, and the death of
       Jesus only for human beings as opposed to the animals, which
       also have suffered from the consequences of sin. How does the
       Cross help us understand our special place in the creation of the
       earth? How should this understanding impact how we view
       others, and ourselves?

                                                                          19

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Most of us were taught that atoms, made up of tiny particles
      such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest build-
      ing blocks of the universe. A new theory states that these parti-
      cles are actually made of tiny vibrating strings (a string is to the
      size of a proton as a proton is to the size of the solar system!).
      Though it’s still only a theory, think about the idea of these
      vibrating strings (different vibrations bring about different par-
      ticles) in light of the teaching that God “spoke” the world into
      existence.

      ●
      2 Discuss Genesis 1:28 and the teaching that God has given
      humanity “dominion” over the earth. What does that mean?
      What responsibilities does that entail? How can we as a church
      and as individuals better fulfill that responsibility?

      ●
      3 The Bible teaches a supernatural origin of our world. How
      does that idea help us better understand the reality of a super-
      natural end of this world?

      4 Plan a trip with your class to go out in nature and explore the
      wonders of creation. If possible, bring along some people who
      don’t yet know Jesus and the wonderful plan of salvation. See
      what you all can learn, believers and unbelievers, about God
      through His created works.

Wasted Years
by ILIANA GARCÍA
  A mother’s conversion leads her adult daughter back to Christ.

   I attended a Protestant church with my father when I was growing up,
but when I was a teen, I stopped going. I was glad that I knew about God,
but I did not like the strict rules our church imposed.
   Soon after I married, my mother became an Adventist Christian. She
shared her new beliefs with me, and I saw the huge changes in her life. She
invited me to visit her church, and I did. And when she gave me literature,
she would say, “Read the Bible, and you will see that this is true.” It
worked. I believed.
   But with my job and my family, it was easy to know the right way but
not so easy to follow it. I attended church with Mother once a month and
took the children. But as they grew up, they went their own way, just as I
had with my father.
   For years I attended church without committing myself to God. I wanted
to follow God in baptism, but many things had to change in my life before
I could be baptized. For one, I needed to stop smoking. I tried everything
to quit—except surrendering my habit to God. Cigarettes were my com-
fort, and I feared the pain of withdrawal, even when my doctor said they
were killing me.
   Then I realized that cigarettes were a chain that held me prisoner. Only
God could remove that chain, and I had to ask Him to do it. I prayed hon-
estly and asked God to break the chain of addiction that held me prisoner.
   That day I went home, laid my pack of cigarettes on the table, and
walked away. I did not tell my family until I had been smoke-free for a
week. But they noticed and secretly rejoiced.
   I started attending church regularly and prepared for baptism. It was a
joyful day for my family and me. My only regret is that I had wasted so
many years—years when I could have been training my children to love
God and His church as I now do.
   Your mission offerings provide the support programs that helped lead
me and thousands of others to Jesus. Thank you!

      The Early Earth




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 2.

Memory Verse: “Thus the heavens and the earth were fin-
      ished, and all the host of them” (Genesis 2:1).

               aving dealt with how all of Creation came into being, Moses

      H        now focuses on human beings and their immediate environ-
               ment. While Genesis 1 answered the question How did it all
      originate? Genesis 2 explains why we are what we are. Without the
      information provided by Genesis 2, the test of allegiance to God and
      the subsequent Fall described in Genesis 3 would, to a large extent, be
      unintelligible.
        The intimate world of Adam and Eve surrounded by trees and ani-
      mals in a garden complements the previous majestic account of
      Creation. Chapter 2 introduces the reader of the Bible to the social
      dimensions of humanity and gives some insight on prehistory and the
      original geography of the world.
        Genesis 2 also deals with such divine institutions as Sabbath, work,
      home, and marriage. Given to the human race before the Fall, these
      institutions lie at the basis of human existence, conduct, and happiness
      even today. Though we are, indeed, a long way from Eden, it still pre-
      sents a model, a template of principles, for we who are on the periph-
      ery of Eden restored. What messages are found in this divine account
      of a prefallen world for the rest of us, we who have known only a
      fallen existence?
        This week we’ll take a look at, literally, paradise, one of the few
      we’ll ever see, at least for now.

     The Sabbath              (Gen. 2:1-3)

        Last week we saw a progression in the Creation account: from dark-
     ness to light, from only water to earth and water, to an atmosphere, to
     vegetation, and so forth, culminating in the creation of human beings,
     first the man and then the woman. Only after all these things were cre-
     ated do we get the words in Genesis 2:1—“Thus the heavens and the
     earth were finished, and all the host of them.” God’s work of Creation,
     at least as attested to here, was a finished work. This notion is implied
     in Genesis 2:2, 3, where both verses say that God “rested” from His
     work. Was God tired, or did He rest because His work was completed?

Read Genesis 2:2, 3 and answer the following questions:
     ●1 Is there anything in the texts that implies that Creation was an
     ongoing process that continued after the sixth day? What are the
     implications of your answer?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     ●2 Considering what the Sa bbath stands for, the Creation, how do
     these verses already imply the universality of the Sabbath; that is,
     its meaning for all humanity?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Although the noun sabbath is not mentioned in Genesis 2, the verb
     for “rested,” from which the term sabbath is derived, proves that the
     Sabbath is meant (see Exod. 20:8-11). Just as six literal days came
     before it, the Sabbath is a literal day, as well.
        Notice, too, that the first thing God declared holy was time, the sev-
     enth day. Not a hill, not a river, not a shrine, but a segment of time
     itself was the first thing in God’s new Creation specifically “set apart”
     (another way of expressing “to be made holy”). Thus, we see the
     Sabbath as something special, something universal, something not
     bounded by the limits of place or geography but as something that can
     reach every human being no matter where they live.

      Next time you welcome in the Sabbath, dwell on the fact that
      you are keeping a day that goes all the way back to Eden, to the
      first week of human existence. How does that make you feel,
      linking yourself in such a tangible way to your origins?
                                                                          23

     Nephesh Hayyah
        In Genesis 2, the scene shifts from the Creation of the world to a
     local garden. Rather than being a second and different Creation nar-
     rative, Genesis 2 complements Genesis 1. Human beings are the pin-
     nacle of the pyramid in Genesis 1. In Genesis 2 they become the cen-
     ter of the circle. The spotlight falls on the human race, and everything
     else is relegated to the background.
        Back in Genesis, it wasn’t until the fifth day that God created “liv-
     ing creatures,” from the Hebrew nephesh hayyah. Hayyah here means
     “life,” and nephesh means “creature.” Interestingly enough, that same
     phrase appears in 2:7.

Read Genesis 2:7. What phrase seems most likely in the text to have
     been translated from nephesh hayyah?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Most people are surprised to learn that the phrase often translated
     “living soul” (Gen. 2:7) in the creation of humanity is the same one
     used to describe fish and birds and other creeping things. Though
     unlike these other creatures, humanity was made in the “image of
     God” (Gen. 1:27); in a purely physical sense humanity is tied to other
     life on earth. And, of course, we see this in the sense that, like other
     life on earth, we need certain physical things in order to stay alive.

How does this use of the word nephesh in Genesis 2:7 (often trans-
     lated “soul”) help us understand why the soul isn’t immortal?
     (Ezek. 18:4, Matt. 10:28).

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Though the Bible uses the word nephesh in numerous ways, denot-
     ing a variety of ideas (“person,” “self,” “life,” or “being”), it never
     means in the Old Testament the popular notion of some separate con-
     scious immortal entity that can exist apart from the body. That’s a
     pagan Greek idea that has filtered into almost all monotheistic reli-
     gions today.

      Make a list of the common popular deceptions that arise from
      belief in an immortal soul. Why should one who understands the
      truth about the soul be so grateful that he or she does under-
      stand? What does that knowledge protect you from?

     The Garden Home                    (Gen. 2:8-17)

       The specific geographical details presented in verses 10 through 14
     indicate that, in the mind of the Bible writer, Eden was a specific
     locality rather than merely being a symbol or a metaphor. Several of
     the names mentioned in verses 11 through 14 are later applied to post-
     Flood localities and rivers. However, the Flood changed the surface
     features of our planet so radically that identification of pre-Flood
     geography with places and rivers known to us is impossible.

What elements mentioned in verses 8 through 17 indicate that the
     garden home was an ideal model? (Note particularly the setting
     and the attention given to humanity’s physical, mental, aesthetic,
     and moral needs.)

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Even today, with a world ravaged by six thousand years of sin, we
     can get hints of what the original beauty must have been like. Traces
     remain, and they speak to us of God’s wonderful creative power (Job
     12:7-9; Rom. 1:19, 20). It’s hard to imagine what Eden must have
     looked like and what a paradise it must have been.

What’s the closest thing to paradise that you’ve ever seen? What
     made it like paradise? In what ways does it parallel what Eden, or
     the earth as a whole, must have been like?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Read Genesis 2:15. How interesting that Adam, even in this earthly
     paradise, with everything he could possibly need, was given the task
     of working in the garden. The Hebrew word translated “dress” is a
     common term meaning to “work” or to “serve.” Thus, even before the
     Fall, even before sin, humanity wasn’t to sit idle but to work. This
     alone should get rid of the notion that work itself is somehow bad.

      Though we’re a long way from Eden, what practical things
      could you do now to make your environment more like Eden for
      yourself and those around you? What changes would need to be
      made?



                                                                       25

     The Woman in Adam’s Life                            (Gen. 2:18-25)
       Here’s Adam, in a garden paradise, with rulership over the animals,
     with everything at his disposal except one tree (see Gen. 2:16, 17).
     And yet, still God has more for him.

What was God’s purpose in giving woman to man? Gen. 2:18, 20.
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The woman was to be a “help meet for him” (the Hebrew suggests
     a “helper over against him,” “a help equal to him,” “his counterpart”).
     The Genesis record places value on woman as an equal, a counterpart,
     a partner, or a complement in whose company man finds his fullest
     satisfaction and with whom he shares God’s image and likeness.

Read Genesis 1:27, 28. How do these two verses together show the
     important role the woman was to have in life on earth?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Considering the basic physical makeup of Adam, he couldn’t fulfill
     the command given in Genesis 1:28 without a woman, could he?
     Though the woman was to be his companion, wife, and co-worker in
     subduing and having dominion over nature, she was to be so much
     more, as well (see Gen. 2:24).
How was Eve created? Gen. 2:21, 22. What distinguished her creation
     from that of all other living things?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________
       Everything else, including man, came out of the dirt; Eve came out
     of man. Though the Bible doesn’t explain just what that difference
     means, it certainly shows that she wasn’t to be treated as an inferior to
     him. Sadly, in so many societies, women are treated almost as slaves,
     afforded little dignity and few rights, a powerful example of what sin
     has done to the human race.
      Have you, either as a man or woman, acquired from your cul-
      ture (maybe even subconsciously) some of the wrong attitudes
      about women? How could what’s taught in Genesis 2 help
      change these attitudes?

      Eve Becomes Adam’s Wife                             (Gen. 2:23, 24)

         In Genesis 2:23, Adam was so rapt that he expressed his triumphant
      welcome of his wife in poetry (verse 23 is the first poetic couplet in
      Scripture). The creation of Eve and her and Adam’s subsequent mar-
      riage were designed to be a great blessing. One man, with one woman,
      were to form the foundation of the home, the basic unit out of which
      all human life was to spring and then exist. This model was how they
      were, indeed, to “be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth”
      (Gen. 1:28).

What has sin done to this ideal? What common things occur now that
      deviate from it? What have been the results?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

What steps in marriage are outlined in the words of God, and in what
      order are these steps to occur? Gen. 2:24.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         God’s ideal for marriage is expounded in this verse. When the time
      came to leave those closest to him, his parents, man’s first earthly loy-
      alty was to be to his wife. She was to occupy the foremost place in his
      affections. In God’s order the union of bodies between husband and
      wife is to follow their commitment in marriage. The biblical order
      “leave . . . cleave . . . and they shall be one flesh” tragically and defi-
      antly has been turned upside down, with tragic results.

What kind of intimate relationship between husband and wife does
      Scripture uphold long after the Fall? 1 Cor. 7:2-5, Eph. 5:21-29,
      Heb. 13:4. What principles do you find in these verses that reflect
      what marriage was like before the Fall? And, most important, if
      married, what can you do to better reveal these principles in your
      own home?

Further     Study: Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
   pp. 46–51; The SDA Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 2.

      “The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes
   as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home, beau-
   tified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. . . . God
   placed Adam in a garden. . . . In the surroundings of the holy pair was
   a lesson for all time—that true happiness is found, not in the indul-
   gence of pride and luxury, but in communion with God through His
   created works. . . . Pride and ambition are never satisfied, but those
   who are truly wise will find substantial and elevating pleasure in the
   sources of enjoyment that God has placed within the reach of all.”
   —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 49, 50.
      “Eve was created from a rib taken from the side of Adam, signify-
   ing that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be trampled
   under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be
   loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh
   of his flesh, she was his second self, showing the close union and the
   affectionate attachment that should exist in this relation.”—Ellen G.
   White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46, emphasis supplied.

Discussion Questions:
    ●
    1 How are we today to understand the words in Genesis 1:27,
    28 about the man and woman subduing and dominating the
    earth? What might that have meant then, before sin, and now,
    after sin? What message does that have for us today in how we
    relate to our environment?

    ●
    2 How does your society treat women? What practical things
    can you do, if necessary, to help women who are being mis-
    treated? What can and should your local church be doing that
    it’s not doing now?

    ●3 Are there some marriages in trouble in your church? What
    can you do, as a class, in a very practical manner, to help support
    those going through this painful turmoil?

One Man’s Search for
Meaning
by LEONID TALMAZAN
   I grew up in Russia. My father was an honest, sincere Communist with
a strong sense of right and wrong. But I am sad to say that I did not follow
his example. I spent my time hanging out with my friends who lived in the
neighboring apartment blocks. Their influence was not as positive as my
parents’ influence. I refused to apply myself in school, and soon I began to
fail. I felt bad that I was disappointing my father but not enough to leave
my friends and their influence.
   When I was drafted into the army, my artistic ability got me a job draw-
ing for the military. But my poor habits got in the way of advancement, and
I lost the opportunity to better myself. I began thinking about the opportu-
nities I had lost because of my bad habits. I began hating my old way of
living and decided to better myself. I decided to become a Communist.
   When my parents saw the changes in me, they were amazed. I refused to
waste time watching TV or visiting friends. Instead, I studied law, obsessed
with changing society’s evils. But I became disillusioned when I realized
that catching criminals would not change the defects of the human race. I
quit my studies and joined a circus! I even contemplated suicide.
   One night while riding a trolley, I saw a church dome in the distance.
Maybe religion is the answer, I thought. I got off the trolley and walked into
a nearby chapel. As I knelt to pray, peace flooded over me. Suddenly I knew
that God exists. I would devote myself to studying about God. But my
dying father begged me to enroll in a university, and I could not refuse.
   At the university the spiritual hunger remained. Then I learned about
some evangelistic meetings being held in the city, and I went. The people
there gave me a Bible—the very book that I had searched for! As I read the
Bible and listened to the lectures, I realized that God does exist, and He
loves me. I knew nothing about the Adventists, who were sponsoring the
meetings. I just knew that these meetings were drawing me close to God.
   I saved my pennies so I would have an offering to take to church. I
refused to study on Sabbath. And God blessed me. I realized that God
wanted to be my best Friend, and I invited Him to live in my heart. I am
                                amazed at God’s faithfulness and friendship
                                to me. I never want to do anything that will
                                disappoint my best Friend.
                                  Your mission offerings helped support the
                                evangelistic efforts that brought me to Christ.
                                Thank you!

      Paradise Lost




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:1–4:26.

Memory Text: “And I will put enmity between thee and the
      woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy
      head, and thou shalt bruise his heel” (Genesis 3:15).

          n the 1600s, British writer John Milton wrote his famous poem,

      I   Paradise Lost, about the fall of our parents in Eden. Using a pow-
          erful imagination, Milton said that he sought, with this poem, to
      “justify the ways of God to man.” In it, Milton painstakingly described
      not only the garden bliss of Eden (“flowers of all hue, and without
      thorn the rose”) but Satan’s ruse to bring Adam and Eve’s demise, all
      part of his bitter struggle against God (“Better to reign in hell,” Satan
      says, “than serve in heaven”).
         Of course, we know what happened; after the serpent’s long beguil-
      ing speech to Eve, “her rash hand in the evil hour/Forth reaching to
      the fruit, she plucked, she ate.” And the rest, as they say, is history.
         Fortunately, we know not only the past but the future and God’s
      promise of Redemption. According to Milton’s poem, “the Son of God
      freely offers himself a ransom for man,” which is what the Bible says,
      as well (1 Tim. 2:5, 6), and with that offer comes the hope of eternal
      life for all who accept it.
         This week we look not at Milton’s poem but at the original account
      that inspired it, the Fall as revealed in Genesis, and from it learn not
      only about the disaster of the Fall but the hope of Redemption.

     The Serpent
        Genesis 3:1 introduces a new and, considering what came before,
     unexpected element—the serpent. Though the things that “creepeth
     upon the earth” (Gen. 1:25) were not specifically named, a serpent
     surely could have been among them. It probably wasn’t even extra-
     ordinary that the serpent appeared in the Garden. However, that it was
     talking and that it enticed Eve toward evil, that’s a new element not
     explained by anything in the previous two chapters, in which every-
     thing created was “very good” (vs. 31).

How do these texts, taken together, help us understand more about
     that serpent, who he really was and why he appeared? Job 1:6-
     11, Isa. 14:12-14, Ezek. 28:14-17, Mark 1:13, Luke 10:18, John 8:44,
     2 Cor. 2:11, 11:3, 1 John 3:8, Rev. 12:9, 20:2.

     _______________________________________________________

         If someone were to have had only the first chapters of Genesis, they
     would have no understanding of who this serpent was and how he
     appeared in God’s perfect creation. How could he speak? Why did he
     seek to deceive Adam and Eve? How did he get there?
         What this shows is how important it is for us to use the whole Bible
     in order to understand truth. The appearance of the deceiving serpent
     implies a whole other scenario not revealed in the first two chapters of
     Genesis. (It does hint at it though. Where?) To understand better what
     was going on, people needed more revelation. In time, God provided
     it.
         Also, one of the more unfortunate consequences of living in the
     modern age has been the tendency to downplay the reality of Satan, to
     make him simply a symbol for evil. It’s considered foolish to actually
     believe in a literal, personal supernatural evil being. Popular culture
     has in many minds made him into nothing but another Hollywood fig-
     ure, along with Batman, Spiderman, and Superman. Of course, that’s
     always been Satan’s tactic, to hide himself. In the Garden, he hid
     behind the serpent; today, he has more sophisticated methods.
     However he does it, the results are the same: People are deceived, at
     the peril of their eternal lives.

      Do you ever find yourself doubting Satan’s existence? If so, how
      can you be protected against this deception?

      The Fall         (Gen 3:1-6)

How clear had been God’s command to Adam? How did the tempter
      seek to confuse the issue with his question and obscure the exact
      meaning of God’s stipulation? Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1.


According to Eve, what additional command, not recorded in
      Genesis 2:17, did the holy pair understand? Gen. 3:3.


Having first questioned the divine stipulation, to what did the ser-
      pent now resort? Vs. 4.(Compare John 8:44.)

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Satan started out by mixing truth and error; once the bait was taken,
      he resorted to full-fledged error, blatantly contradicting God’s explicit
      command. How often things work like that even today. Someone starts
      out with a doctrine, a teaching, that contains both truth and error but,
      later, when taken to its logical conclusion, it winds up as pure error.
      How crucial that we always be on our guard!
         Genesis 3:6 states the reasons Eve ate the fruit anyway. It appealed
      to her physical (food), aesthetic (pleasant to the eyes), and intellectual
      (makes one wise) nature—a nature that God had given her. In other
      words, Satan took the gifts that God gave Eve and used them against
      her. If this worked so well with an unfallen being in Paradise, how
      much more so with fallen creatures?

What do these verses say to us in the context of our fallen natures?
      Rom. 13:14; Phil. 3:18, 19; 1 John 2:16.

        The reality of sin, of temptation, of the lure of the flesh, is an ever-
      present reality in the lives of all humans. The difference, however, is
      not to be enslaved to physical, mental, or even intellectual passions.

       Make a list of texts that you could give to a Christian who feels
       weighed down and discouraged over his or her spiritual or
       moral state. What do they say, and what hope is found in them?

      The Fallen           (Gen. 3:7-24)

        In the fulfillment of the serpent’s promise, the eyes of Adam and
      Eve were opened, but their dream of enlightenment turned into a
      nightmare. This, the first of countless subsequent satanic schemes,
      demonstrates that the devil’s promises of precious gold are delivered
      only in the form of tinsel. Deprived of the glory of holiness, burdened
      by the sense of guilt, their physical nakedness revealed in a con-
      sciousness of inner nakedness, the first pair sought to hide from God
      and to fashion their own covering.

In your own experience, or what you have seen happen to others, what
      other “wonderful promises” have turned into hellish nightmares?
      What principles can we learn from these sad accounts? See also
      Judges 17:6, Prov. 14:12, Mark 4:19, 1 Tim. 6:10.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Look at the immediate results of the Fall. First, alienation arose
      between Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:7); then between them and God
      (vs. 8); nature itself suddenly turned more hostile (vss. 16-18); the
      relationship between Adam and Eve changed even more so (vs. 16);
      there was the reality of death (vs. 19); there was a change in how
      humanity related to toil (vs. 19); and Adam and Eve were thrown out
      of the Garden (vss. 23, 24). If only they could have seen in advance
      the consequences of their actions!
        What’s fascinating, too, is that the serpent told Eve that they would
      be like gods, knowing good and evil. He was right (see vs. 22). It obvi-
      ously wasn’t in God’s will for humans to know evil; He wanted to keep
      them innocent and dependent upon Him, like children (see Deut.
      1:39). God had given them only good (tov); everything that He cre-
      ated was only “good” (tov). The Creation in Genesis 1, which was
      “good” with no evil, taken together with Genesis 3:22, reaffirms the
      idea that God wanted only good, not evil, for humanity.

       How can you preserve or (if need be) regain some innocence?
       What things are you doing that are, perhaps, making that goal
       more difficult? What changes do you need to make?

     Hope for the Fallen
      After the Lord came down to the Garden and all the participants
     were together, He issued His judgments upon them all.

Read Genesis 3:14-19. What was pronounced upon them? What were
     the immediate, as well as the long-term, consequences?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Even before Adam and Eve heard about toil, pain, submission,
     thorns, and the judgment upon them for their transgression, God
     granted them words of hope and promise. Verse 15 not only offers the
     first glimpse of the gospel but also presents a compressed history of
     the conflicts between the family of the serpent and the descendants of
     the woman. The genealogies of Genesis develop the lines of those who
     chose “sonship,” either with the devil or with God. And the rest of
     Scripture continues to depict the struggles between God’s people and
     their enemies. The conflict announced in verse 15 points past the
     immediate actors in the drama and toward the entire conflict between
     good and evil as it was to be played out on the earth, a conflict that we
     ourselves are part of right now.

Compare Genesis 3:15 with Revelation 12:17 (see also Rev. 12:9,
     20:2). What common elements are found in both texts? How do
     these verses show how the principles of the conflict first expressed
     in Eden will be manifested at the end of time?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Despite the blatant transgression on the part of Adam and Eve, and
     despite their sorry attempts to justify their actions, the Lord offered
     them hope that although there would be enmity between them and the
     serpent, the serpent’s head would be crushed; that is, it would be
     destroyed. Here we see the first promise of the gospel, of what Jesus
     would do for fallen humanity.

      Keeping in mind today’s lesson, read Hebrews 2:14. What hope
      does this text offer to you amid the struggles you face in your
      part in the great controversy between the seed of the woman
      and the seed of the serpent?

      After the Fall             (Genesis 4)

         Genesis 4 very quickly gets into the story of Cain and Abel. Though
      many years passed since the Fall, the Bible quickly gets into some of
      its catastrophic results. The enmity predicted in Genesis 3:15 and
      hinted at in Cain’s jealousy was manifested in full force in the murder
      of Abel. This murder demonstrated that Cain was a follower of Satan
      (see John 8:44).

Why did God accept Abel’s sacrifice but reject his brother’s offerings?
      Gen. 4:3-7. (Compare with Lev. 17:11, Heb. 9:22. See also Heb.
      11:4.)

        Notice in Genesis 4:6 and 7 how God dealt with Cain. God tells
      Cain to do well, to obey, and thus he shall “be accepted.” He says this,
      though, in the context of sacrifice, which is needed because no matter
      how well we do, it’s still not good enough to save us. We see here,
      then, a balance between the law and grace and faith and works. Cain,
      apparently, understood neither, as reflected in the sacrifice he offered,
      as well as in his refusal to “do well” (see 1 John 3:12).

How does Romans 5:17–6:6 reflect the balance between faith and
      works as in the story of Cain and Abel?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Cain discovered that people cannot hide anything from God (Gen.
      4:9, 10) and that the divine Sovereign will right all wrongs. As punish-
      ment for his callous sin, the earth, which had been forced to drink inno-
      cent blood, would withhold its strength from the murderer (vss. 11, 12).
         Meanwhile, verses 17 through 24 disclose a picture of rapid moral
      decline, as well as technical and cultural advances. Polygamy and mur-
      der characterize the family of Cain. Yet, the Bible writer does not attrib-
      ute only evil to the descendants of Cain; their achievements are recog-
      nized. He notes that artisans, craftsmen, pastoralists, and agricultural-
      ists descended from Cain.
         The chapter concludes with a reference to Seth, who replaced Abel.
      Seth became the ancestor of the line of pre-Flood patriarchs who
      bridged the period between Adam and Noah.

       Have you ever been envious? Isn’t it a wretched feeling? In what
       ways did that envy have the potential to turn into something
       even worse? Why is falling before the Cross your only hope in
       getting victory over this emotional scourge?

                                                                             35

Further Study: Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 52–62,
     71–81; The SDA Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis 3 and 4.

       “Satan represented to the holy pair that they would be gainers by
     breaking the law of God. Do we not today hear similar reasoning?
     Many talk of the narrowness of those who obey God’s command-
     ments, while they themselves claim to have broader ideas and to enjoy
     greater liberty. What is this but an echo of the voice from Eden, ‘In
     the day ye eat thereof’—transgress the divine requirement—‘ye shall
     be as gods’?”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 55.
       “The ‘seed’ is put in the singular, indicating, not that a multitude of
     descendants of the woman jointly shall be engaged in crushing the ser-
     pent’s head, but rather that a single individual will accomplish this.
     These observations clearly show that in this pronouncement is com-
     pressed the record of the great controversy between Christ and Satan,
     a battle that began in heaven (Rev. 12:7-9), was continued on earth,
     where Christ again defeated him (Heb. 2:14), and will terminate
     finally with Satan’s destruction at the end of the millennium (Rev.
     20:10). Christ did not emerge from this battle unscathed. The nail
     marks in His hands and feet and the scar in His side will be eternal
     reminders of the fierce strife in which the serpent bruised the woman’s
     seed (John 20:25; Zech. 13:6; EW 53).”—The SDA Bible Commentary,
     vol. 1, p. 233.

The Invitation
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Show-In saw her neighbor crying as she walked past her home in Taipei,
Taiwan. “Huey, what is wrong?” Show-In asked. Huey sat with her reli-
gious holy book on her lap and a look of despair on her face. Trying to
cheer her, Show-In asked Huey what she thought of the holy book she was
reading.
   Huey told Show-In that she was worried about her children. “I know
that God exists—somewhere,” Huey said, “and I am grateful for every-
thing—even a glass of water.” Show-In encouraged Huey’s faith in God
and invited her to come to church with her on Sabbath. Huey smiled and
nodded. She was eager to learn the truth about God, no matter where she
found that truth.
   On Sabbath Show-In took her neighbor to church. That afternoon after
Huey returned home, she slept. She dreamed about God and was surprised
that she was not afraid of Him. She decided to continue attending Show-
In’s church. Huey could walk there by herself whenever there was a meet-
ing.
   One day when Huey returned home, her eyes fell on the idol sitting on
the shelf. She used to burn incense to the idol every day then bow before
it, telling her wishes and her problems. She would study the holy book,
searching for peace. But peace did not come until she accepted Show-In’s
invitation to worship in her church.
   One night she dreamed that God wanted her to remove the idols from
her home. Huey gathered her idol, her incense, and her holy book, and
took them to a neighbor. “I don’t want these anymore,” she said. “You may
have them.”
   The next day Huey invited Show-In and two friends from the church to
visit her home. When they arrived, she showed them the empty shelf and
eagerly told them what she had done. “You did this alone?” Show-In asked
in amazement. “That takes great courage.” Huey smiled. She had done it
alone.
   The devil has not left her entirely unmolested, but Huey’s trust in God
has strengthened her against the devil’s attacks.
   Huey is often the first person to arrive at church when there is a meet-
ing. She has joined the church by baptism and finds her joy in following
Jesus and being a part of His family.
   Our mission offerings provide the training to help lay workers such as
Show-In lead others to Christ.

Show-In and Huey live in Taipei, Taiwan. Charlotte Ishkanian is editor of Mission.

      Destruction and

      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 5:32–9:29.
Memory Text: “The bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look
      upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between
      God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth”

         “Have you heard the latest about Noah, that religious fanatic?”
         “Noah, pious Noah?”
         “Well, pious Noah’s piety has made him mad. Says water is going
      to drop out of the sky.”
         “Water from the sky?”
         “Says it’s going to create a flood and kill all life on earth, except
      those who go into the ark.”
         “The ark?”
         “It’s a thing that floats on water, like a boat. Says only those who get
      into it will survive the rain. He’s building it now. Says water is going
      to be God’s judgment upon us for all our sins. Please, we’re not all that
      bad, are we?”
         “Water from the sky . . .? Why would a decent guy like him make
      up something so crazy?”
         “Because he is crazy. And such a legalist. Doesn’t he know how
      we’re saved by faith alone? And standards, standards, standards—he’s
      always griping about standards.”
         “Noah’s a bit intense, but he’s basically an honest, upright guy.”
         “Fine, but why should we believe in something that has never hap-
      pened before? The scientists say it isn’t feasible; the philosophers say
      it violates natural law. Water rises from the earth each morning as a
      mist; it doesn’t drop out of the sky, right?”
          “Right . . . I guess.”

      “For All Flesh Is Come Before Me”
        Adam and Eve had children after Cain and Abel, including Seth
      (Gen. 5:4), whose line of descent outlines the history of the pre-Flood
      patriarchs loyal to God. Noah was of this branch (vss. 28, 29).

Read Genesis 6:1-13. What kind of picture does it present about the
      state of unregenerate humanity? In what ways might we see not
      only our age but even ourselves in here?

      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________
         Though some commentators suggest that the designation “sons of
      God” (Gen. 6:2) refers to heavenly beings, context and content indicate
      a reference to the descendants of Seth. The “daughters of men” (the
      “men” who multiplied in verse 1) would then designate the posterity of
      Cain. The “sons of God,” representing the line of faith, contracted mar-
      riages with unbelievers and succumbed to the danger of such alliances.
         In these verses, the wickedness of humankind could not be stated
      more emphatically. Notice the words every, only, and continually
      (vs. 5). The Hebrew word translated “imagination” is derived from the
      verb earlier rendered by “to form” (Gen. 2:7) and here indicates
      “deliberation” and “action.” In the Old Testament the word heart
      describes the complete inner life of a human being, as it is the seat of
      emotion, will, and understanding. The words corrupt and violence in
      verses 11 through 13 expand the picture of verse 5.

How do Genesis 6:6, 7 depict God’s sorrow for what was taking place?
      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        After describing the human heart, the author turns to the grief and
      the affliction of the heart of God. Moses describes the Lord in terms
      that human readers can understand. God is not some far-off abstract
      idea or unbending principle; like us, He is portrayed as characterized
      by will, open to the tragedy of sin and prayer and weeping over human
      guilt. These words give us a feeling for how difficult it is to explain or
      even understand the introduction and great increase of sin.
       Compare Genesis 6:6 with Matthew 23:37. What do both tell us
       about how “emotionally” tied the Lord is with this world? What
       other verses show this tie (for instance, John 3:16)? How does this
       help you better understand God’s ties to you individually?

                                                                            39

      Noah and the Gospel of Grace                               (Gen. 6:8-22)

Read Genesis 6:8. Notice: Noah finds “grace” in the eyes of the Lord
      (the first time the word grace appears in the Bible). Grace is God’s
      unmerited favor poured out upon unworthy sinners (Rom. 4:14-
      16; Eph. 2:5, 8; 2 Tim. 1:9).

Read what Scripture says about the character and life of Noah. Gen.
      6:9, 22; Heb. 11:7; 2 Pet. 2:5. Why, considering the kind of person
      Noah was, did he need God’s grace? See also Gen. 9:20, 21; Rom.
      3:23; 1 John 1:8.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Noah, a sinner like the rest of us, nevertheless revealed a life of faith
      and obedience. This is best seen in the fact that he obeyed the com-
      mand of the Lord to build the ark.

Read Genesis 6:22 and 7:5. What do these verses tell us about how
      true, saving faith—the kind of faith that not only builds the ark
      but gets into it, as well—is manifested in the life of a believer?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         In the midst of a violent, corrupt world, the Lord has this man,
      Noah, whose faith was most clearly made manifest by his works. This
      is a crucial point that all people who love the Lord and the great prom-
      ises of salvation through grace alone, by faith in Jesus, must remem-
      ber. Noah could have had all the faith possible, but had he not acted
      on that faith and obeyed the Lord’s commands, he and his family
      would have been swept away with the rest of the world in the Flood
      (see Heb. 11:7). That should be a great object lesson for all of us who,
      day by day, claim the righteousness of Jesus for us as the only hope of
      our salvation: A faith that isn’t manifested in obedience isn’t really
      faith at all.

       Look at your life during the past week: How has your faith been
       manifested in your works? What works revealed a decisive lack
       of faith on your part? What changes do you need to make?

     The Flood (Gen. 7:1-16)
What does the reference to “clean” and “unclean” animals imply
     about the knowledge Noah already possessed on this matter? Gen.
     7:2, 3, 8; 8:20.
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       The fact that God distinguished “clean” and “unclean” animals long
     before the difference was explicitly stated in Leviticus 11 and
     Deuteronomy 14 presupposes the clear knowledge of the distinction
     between “clean” and “unclean” animals from earliest times, certainly
     long before the Jewish nation was established.

Read Genesis 7:7-24. What evidence can you find in these texts that
     shows that the whole world rather than just a small, local section
     was destroyed by the Flood? Compare Gen. 7:19 with Dan. 7:27,
     Job 28:24.
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        The Deluge covered the earth, and the world returned to the condi-
     tions that existed before God had prepared a habitable globe (Gen.
     1:2), with the exception of Noah and those with him in the ark. The
     repeated biblical statements, “the waters prevailed . . . increased
     greatly upon the earth . . . prevailed exceedingly . . . fifteen cubits
     upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered . . .”
     (Gen. 7:18-20), indicate a worldwide catastrophe. The words regard-
     ing the extent of those killed, contrasted with only Noah and those in
     the ark remaining alive, also testifies to the worldwide extent of the
     Flood. The universality of the Flood is further attested to by the world-
     wide distribution of Flood legends and the global distribution of fos-
     sil remains. In short, the texts are very clear that the Flood was world-
     wide, as opposed to some mere local event. This point is important
     because many Christians, influenced by some scientists who claim
     that there was no worldwide Flood, make the Flood only a local event,
     despite the clear testimony of the Scriptures to the contrary.
      Have you ever had an animal that you had to put to sleep? How
      does that analogy help us understand what was happening here
      and how God must have felt about this act of destroying so much
      of the “good” world He had created? What “good” in your own
      life must you jealously guard lest it turns into “only evil continu-
      ally” (Gen. 6:5) and becomes something that must be destroyed?
                                                                          41

     The Lost Generation
        If you read the Genesis account of Noah and the Flood by itself,
     you’ll notice that nowhere does it teach that anyone else was even
     offered an opportunity to get into the ark. It sounds as if it were to be
     built only for Noah, his family, and the animals (Gen. 6:13-22). Other
     verses, New Testament verses, vaguely hint at something else (Heb.
     11:7, 1 Pet. 3:20, 2 Pet. 2:5). Ellen White, of course, is very clear that
     Noah’s work on the boat was to be a witness to the world of what was
     coming and that Noah “entreated them to seek a refuge while it might
     be found.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 97. Considering all that we
     know about the Lord and His desire for the salvation of all humanity
     (1 Tim. 2:3, 4), it’s not surprising that God was offering people a
     chance to be saved.
        It says a lot, however, about the degenerate character of that gener-
     ation that only Noah’s family, and the animals, got on the boat. After
     all, it would have taken humility and the willingness to face the scorn
     of the majority to have sided with Noah. It would have meant being
     unpopular. It would have meant having faith in something that you
     didn’t fully understand. It would have meant admitting you’re in a situa-
     tion in which you can’t save yourself but must depend upon God.
     These are hardly the attributes one would expect to find in such an evil
     generation.

Compare what it meant for those in Noah’s generation to have
     sided with Noah and what it means to make a stand for Christ and
     all His commandments today. What parallels exist?

     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       The good news in all this is that God is always offering people a way
     out, always offering people a chance to get on the ark. The same Jesus
     we see weeping over Jerusalem is the same Jesus who surely was
     pleading through Noah for people to repent; it’s, of course, the same
     Jesus who is pleading with us today, as well, who is calling us to get
     into the ark before people are swept away and taken away in the final
     judgment (see Matt. 24:38-41).

      What factors work against you staying faithful to Jesus? What
      have you found is the best defense against the forces that would
      turn you away from Him and the truth for this time? What
      practical things can you do to avoid or at least alleviate, as much
      as possible, these factors?

     Covenant and Renewal
How did Noah express his dedication, homage, and gratitude to God
     upon leaving the ark? Gen. 8:20.

        “Here was a lesson for all succeeding generations. Noah had come
     forth upon a desolate earth, but before preparing a house for himself
     he built an altar to God. His stock of cattle was small, and had been
     preserved at great expense; yet he cheerfully gave a part to the Lord
     as an acknowledgment that all was His. In like manner it should be our
     first care to render our freewill offerings to God.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 106.

How did God respond to Noah’s devotion and worship? Write out the
     response, paraphrasing it in your own words. What is God saying
     here? Vss. 21, 22.

     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        The divine response is stated in human terms. God had destroyed
     the world because “every imagination” of the thoughts of the human
     heart was evil (Gen. 6:5); that same idea, about humanity’s evil, is
     restated here, even after the Flood. The Lord is expressing the sad fact
     that even despite the Flood, humanity wasn’t in and of itself going to
     change for the good. What’s fascinating is that from the way the text
     is written, it appears that God’s resolve not to destroy the earth again
     comes in response to the sacrifice offered by Noah. This blood sacri-
     fice is linked with the promise; it’s not the goodness of humanity,
     obviously, but what’s in the sacrifice that leads to the new promise.
     God’s going to spare them a flood despite themselves. In some ways
     this reflects the same principles found in the gospel: God saves not
     because of ourselves but only because of mercy and grace toward us.

      Read Genesis 9:8-19. What’s promised here? Who is included in
      this covenant? What can we learn from this about the new
      covenant promise of salvation we have in Jesus? What are the
      similarities, what are the differences? Compare Gen. 9:12 with
      17:7, Ps. 105:10, Heb. 13:20.

            “Many at first appeared to receive the warning; yet they did not turn
         to God with true repentance. They were unwilling to renounce their
         sins. During the time that elapsed before the coming of the Flood,
         their faith was tested, and they failed to endure the trial. Overcome by
         the prevailing unbelief, they finally joined their former associates in
         rejecting the solemn message. Some were deeply convicted, and
         would have heeded the words of warning; but there were so many to
         jest and ridicule, that they partook of the same spirit, resisted the invi-
         tations of mercy, and were soon among the boldest and most defiant
         scoffers; for none are so reckless and go to such lengths in sin as do
         those who have once had light, but have resisted the convicting Spirit
2
         of God.
            “The men of that generation were not all, in the fullest acceptation
         of the term, idolaters. Many professed to be worshipers of God. They
         claimed that their idols were representations of the Deity, and that
         through them the people could obtain a clearer conception of the
         divine Being. This class were foremost in rejecting the preaching of
         Noah. As they endeavored to represent God by material objects, their
         minds were blinded to His majesty and power; they ceased to realize
3
         the holiness of His character, or the sacred, unchanging nature of His
         requirements. As sin became general, it appeared less and less sinful,
         and they finally declared that the divine law was no longer in force;
         that it was contrary to the character of God to punish transgression;
         and they denied that His judgments were to be visited upon the earth.
         Had the men of that generation obeyed the divine law, they would have
         recognized the voice of God in the warning of His servant; but their
         minds had become so blinded by rejection of light that they really
         believed Noah’s message to be a delusion.”—Ellen G. White,
         Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 95, 96.

    Discussion Question:
          Have people in the class place themselves in the mind of someone
          who lived in Noah’s time and have them give all the reasons why
          they shouldn’t believe in the Flood. What lessons can we learn
          from their thinking, not only for ourselves and our own faith but
          about how we can understand the thinking of others who don’t
          take our warnings about the end of time seriously?

The Idol’s Musician
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Sangum is a Global Mission pioneer in western India. One day he met
Eknath, an old man who was sick with typhoid. Sangum nodded to the
tara, a traditional two-stringed musical instrument, standing in the corner
and asked Eknath whether he played it.
   “I play the tara for the idols and to earn a living,” Eknath said. He
explained that he plays the tara, and people stop and listen. Then they give
him a few coins, enough to feed his family. But recently he had been too
sick to play.
   Sangum smiled and said, “I worship the living God, and He can heal
you. If you will permit me, I will pray to my God and ask Him to heal
you.” Eknath nodded, and Sangum prayed. When Sangum ended his
prayer, Eknath smiled and said he was tired of taking expensive medicines.
Sangum offered to teach him how to live a better life. He also offered to
teach him about the living God.
   Eknath agreed, and Sangum began studying the Bible with him. Eknath
was thrilled to learn of a God who cared about him. Several months later
Eknath was baptized. Now he goes from village to village with Sangum,
playing his tara. When the people gather to listen, he no longer tells them
about the idols; he tells them about the living God who hears his prayers
and who healed him.
   Since Eknath found Jesus as his Lord, one hundred people in his area
have joined the Adventist church. Many of these have come because they
have seen the difference in Eknath’s life. They ask him what has happened
to change him, and he shares his experience with Jesus. Today a church
stands in Eknath’s village, testimony to God’s transforming love.
   Eknath loves to share God’s message with others who have not yet
                              heard. “I want to capture many more villages
                              for the kingdom of God,” he says.

      The Earth After the
      Flood


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 9–11.

Memory Text: “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the
      last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where
      is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all
      things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation”
      (2 Peter 3:3, 4).

              ears ago a British philosopher and strong supporter of evolu-

      Y       tion, Bertrand Russell, joked about the climactic conclusion of
              the evolutionary process: “If I were granted omnipotence, and
      millions of years to experiment in, I should not think Man much to
      boast of as the final result of my efforts.”—Dan Falk, quoted in
      Universe on a T-Shirt (Toronto: Penguin Books, 2002), p. 203.
         Putting aside the philosopher’s error regarding origins, one could
      understand the cynicism regarding humanity. This point becomes
      especially apparent regarding the Flood and afterward. You’d think
      that after a flood, which wiped out the entire earth, people would have
      gotten the message regarding God’s attitude about sin and rebellion;
      apparently they didn’t. The stories that the Holy Spirit inspired Moses
      to write don’t paint a pretty picture; humanity, obviously, didn’t learn
      much. Things started to degenerate quickly, even immediately.
         This week we’ll take a look at the early days after the Flood, at the
      changes that came and at the results. Yet, even amid all this carnage
      and rebellion, we can see the working of a God who loved the fallen
      race and worked to save it from itself despite itself, much as He still
      is doing today.

     Noah and the New Earth
        No doubt Noah and his kin stepped off the ark into a new world, one
     in some ways radically different from what they had known before. It’s
     hard to imagine what must have gone on in their minds. In one sense,
     they must have been terrified, seeing the landscape a wreckage. We
     today, thousands of years later, though we see evidence of the Flood,
     are used to it: It’s all we have ever known. Plus, who knows in what
     way nature has been able to adjust and heal after the initial devasta-
     tion. For Noah and those with him, though, it must have been a heart-
     wrenching, even fearful experience.

Read Genesis 9:1-3. What hope and encouragement did Noah and his
     family receive from the Lord, especially considering their circum-
     stances?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

Compare the above verses with the words of the Lord to Adam and
     Eve in Genesis 1:28-30. What differences are there between the
     two accounts, and what do you think were the reasons for the dif-
     ferences? What great change took place over their relationship to
     animal life?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The most radical change, of course, came with the introduction of
     meat eating, something that was not allowed before. Many of the
     beasts that before were their companions now were to become their
     meals. Something wonderful, something harmonious, was lost to sin.
     Isn’t that always the case?
        Human beings, according to the Bible texts, were not originally car-
     nivores; neither were the animals. In the original earthly paradise,
     despite the great distinction between human beings and the animals
     (Gen. 1:26, 27), they also were linked in many ways: All were created
     by God, all had life, and they were to share a similar diet. Perhaps this
     was all part of God’s way of showing humans that despite their supe-
     rior status, they needed to respect those creatures over whom they had
     “dominion.”

      What’s some of the wreckage you see in your own life because of
      sin? What steps can you take toward healing and restoration?
                                                                          47

     Blood and Life
       “But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall
     ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
     hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the
     hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. Whoso
     sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the
     image of God made he man” (Gen. 9:4-6).

What do you believe these verses here are saying to us, today, as
     Christians?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        With these verses, we see again the results of sin, of God acknowl-
     edging the reality of what life will be like for human beings in a fallen
     world. It’s very interesting, too, that the command against eating blood
     is something that clearly predates anything Jewish, anything linked
     with the Levitical laws of cleanliness and uncleanliness. Centuries
     later, in the book of Acts (15:20, 29), the Gentile converts were
     admonished to, among other things, abstain from blood, more than
     likely a clear reference to what was happening here in Genesis (see
     also Lev. 17:11, 1 Pet. 1:19).

What reason does God give for the strict prohibition regarding the
     taking of another human life?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        There’s been much debate over the centuries regarding the meaning
     of these texts and especially their application. In every case of some-
     one killing another person, should that person be killed, regardless of
     the circumstances? Many Old Testament laws were put in place to deal
     with special circumstances (see, for instance, Num. 35:11). Then, of
     course, we have numerous Bible texts about forgiveness, turning the
     cheek, and not judging; then, too, there are the accounts in the Old
     Testament of the Israelites, at God’s command, wiping out entire
     cities. Regardless of how one puts all these together and formulates a
     theology regarding justice and punishment, one point is not debatable:
     Human life is precious and must be regarded as such. The Lord will
     surely have His day of reckoning for those who disregard the sacred-
     ness of human life (2 Cor. 5:10).

      After the Deluge                 (Gen. 9:18-29)

         No matter the Lord’s gracious offers of peace, safety, and prosper-
      ity or His warnings of judgment, destruction, and death, folk just don’t
      seem to get it, do they? Of course, we don’t need Bible stories to prove
      that point; after all, we have our own selves—and what more proof do
      we need?

Read over Genesis 9. After the Flood God establishes a covenant with
      every living creature, promising never to destroy the world again
      with a flood, even using the beauty of a rainbow as a token of His
      promise. What story does God then immediately contrast with
      this, His promise of this “everlasting covenant”? What messages
      are in there for us? Also, what does it tell us that righteous Noah
      (Gen. 7:1) should be so heavily involved in this sordid tale?


         Noah’s words about his children were not forever sealing the fate of
      posterity; rather, the incident seemed to reveal character traits already
      there and how these traits, as they often are, would be passed down
      from one generation to another. “The sin of Ham was not an uninten-
      tional transgression. He may have seen his father’s shameful condition
      accidentally, but instead of being filled with sorrow over his father’s
      folly, he rejoiced in what he saw and found delight in publishing it. . . .
      Ham’s two older brothers did not share his perverted feelings. Adam
      also had had two well-disciplined sons, Abel and Seth, and one child
      of sin, Cain. Although all had received the same parental love and
      training, sin manifested itself much more markedly in one than in the
      others. Now the same spirit of depravity breaks forth in one of Noah’s
      children, while the older sons, reared in the same home and under the
      same conditions as Ham, show an admirable spirit of decency and
      self-control. As the evil trends of criminal Cain were perpetuated in
      his descendants, Ham’s degraded nature revealed itself further in his
      offspring.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 266.

       Very often we are so concerned about our sins being forgiven,
       which, of course, is important (Rom. 4:7, Eph. 1:7, Col 2:3,
       1 John 1:9, 2:12).Yet, when you read the story of Noah doing some-
       thing so bad here, what should that tell us about the importance
       of how our actions, especially the actions of those who have great
       responsibility, can be fraught with negative consequences? What
       can you learn from this about how our actions influence others
       toward either the good or the bad? Think about some next big
       decision you have to make. What will be its influence on others?



                                                                             49

     Scoffers—Past and Present
     In 2 Peter 2, the apostle writes against false teachers who were
     once faithful to the Lord and who then turned away. With that
     background in mind, read 2 Peter 3:1-11 and then answer these
     questions:

     ●
     1 To what source and authority does Peter immediately point the
     false teachers and scoffers? Why is that answer so important?


     ●2 What’s the real motive behind the scoffing? In what ways do we
     see the same principles manifested today?


     ●
     3 What point is Peter making by reference to the Flood story
     here? See 2 Peter 2:5.


        What is fascinating among Peter’s words is his statement that the
     scoffers will say that “all things continue as they were from the begin-
     ning of the creation” (2 Pet. 3:4). These verses point to a dramatic ful-
     fillment of prophecy that has been especially revealed in the past cen-
     tury and a half. Science has proposed a geological interpretation that
     favors long ages, rather than a sudden catastrophe like the Flood, to
     account for the surface condition of the earth. In other words, things
     just keep on as they have before; many of the massive canyons and
     rock formations didn’t come, we are told, by some sudden catastrophe
     but simply were the result of things continuing as they were from the
     beginning of creation; they’re there only from a long uniform pro-
     gression of events.
        This idea also is the basis of evolution, a steady process of things
     slowly evolving as they did from the beginning of time, rather than a
     sudden literal six-day creation of life on the earth, as the Bible
     teaches. It is remarkable that long ago Peter pointed to these two areas
     as being the points of contention in the last days. That this has hap-
     pened as predicted is a strong sign that we are living in a time when
     we are going to have to make a firm choice on whose side we are
     going to stand.

      Read over again the texts for today in Peter. Might you see your-
      self in there—some doubts, some questioning, some scoffing?
      What must be done in order to get you back on the narrow
      path? Matt. 7:14.

      The Tower of Babel
        Chapter 10 of Genesis then recounts, in a very general sense, the
      repopulation of the earth after the Flood. People are born, nations are
      formed, and the masses start spreading out into powers that will, in
      some cases, appear later in the Bible.

Read Genesis 11:1-10. What example do you see of scientific advance-
      ment and what the people intended to do with this knowledge?


Considering their recent history, why might they have wanted a
      tower that went into heaven?


What reason does the Lord give for wanting to stop them? See also
      Gen. 3:22, 6:5.


         “The dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved God’s covenant
      that He would not again bring a flood upon the earth. Many of them
      denied the existence of God and attributed the Flood to the operation
      of natural causes. Others believed in a Supreme Being, and that it was
      He who had destroyed the antediluvian world; and their hearts, like
      that of Cain, rose up in rebellion against Him. One object before them
      in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety in case of
      another deluge. By carrying the structure to a much greater height
      than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought to place
      themselves beyond all possibility of danger. And as they would be able
      to ascend to the region of the clouds, they hoped to ascertain the cause
      of the Flood.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 119.
         Perhaps the most fascinating verse in the story of Babel is verse 6.
      The Lord sees that, working together, these people are going to
      acquire a great amount of knowledge and technical skill. One would
      think that would be good; after all, look at how much good technol-
      ogy has done for us today. And yet, the Lord here clearly sees this as
      something bad and moves to stop it by confounding their language,
      hence spreading them out and making it much more difficult for them
      to pool their resources and fulfill their schemes. Why would He do
      that?

       What lesson is here for us? What kind of knowledge are we
       seeking? What are we doing with that knowledge? What impor-
       tant lessons could this story have for us on a personal level? See
       also 2 Tim. 3:7.


                                                                          51

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “After the Flood,” Patriarchs
     and Prophets, pp. 105–1l0.

        “The prophecy of Noah was no arbitrary denunciation of wrath or
     declaration of favor. It did not fix the character and destiny of his
     sons. But it showed what would be the result of the course of life they
     had severally chosen and the character they had developed. It was an
     expression of God’s purpose toward them and their posterity in view
     of their own character and conduct. As a rule, children inherit the dis-
     positions and tendencies of their parents, and imitate their example; so
     that the sins of the parents are practiced by the children from genera-
     tion to generation. Thus the vileness and irreverence of Ham were
     reproduced in his posterity, bringing a curse upon them for many
     generations. ‘One sinner destroyeth much good.’ Ecclesiastes 9:18.”
     —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 118.
        “Geologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that it is
     very much older than the Mosaic record teaches. . . .
        “But apart from Bible history, geology can prove nothing. Those
     who reason so confidently upon its discoveries have no adequate con-
     ception of the size of men, animals, and trees before the Flood, or of
     the great changes which then took place. Relics found in the earth do
     give evidence of conditions differing in many respects from the pres-
     ent, but the time when these conditions existed can be learned only
     from the Inspired Record. In the history of the Flood, inspiration has
     explained that which geology alone could never fathom.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 112.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 What are some ways in which science tends to be another
      attempt at creating a modern Tower of Babel? Why, like the one
      in antiquity, is it also doomed to failure?

      traits of character. What can we do, though, to try and lessen, as
      much as possible, the negative impact of those traits of charac-
      ter? What role does the gospel have in this important work? How
      does the idea of the new birth fit in with this important concept
      of character formation?

The Angry Husband
by G. MAZUNDA
   A pastor in northern Malawi held evangelistic meetings that resulted in
eighteen new believers. On the day of the baptism, a woman ran to the
river and asked to be baptized. She had attended the meetings, but fear of
her husband had held her back from asking for baptism. The pastor ques-
tioned her briefly then baptized her.
   Someone saw this woman being baptized and reported it to her husband.
When she returned home that afternoon, her furious husband locked her
inside the house and took the keys. She could not escape. Then he went
looking for the pastor who had baptized his wife. “Who authorized you to
baptize my wife without my permission?” he demanded.
   The pastor told him that his wife had decided on her own to be baptized.
No one had forced her. The still-angry husband threatened to kill the pas-
tor. Then he left.
   He meant what he said to the pastor. He rounded up some men and boys,
and they marched to the chief’s house, for the chief had permitted the reli-
gious meetings to take place. Then the gang saw a young Adventist boy
walking nearby and began stoning him. Though injured, he survived.
   Throughout the following week the woman’s husband threatened her.
“Don’t go to that church!” he demanded. No one who knew this woman’s
husband ever expected to see her in the church again. But on Sabbath she
came to worship. It was youth Sabbath, and the Pathfinders led out.
   When her husband learned where his wife had gone, he followed her to
the church. When he arrived he saw the young people lined up in forma-
tion outside the church. They looked so smart in their uniforms. When
they marched into the church, he followed them in and sat down in the
back. He soon forgot his anger.
   The pastor preached a powerful sermon that day and made an altar call.
To everyone’s surprise the angry husband stepped out of the row and
walked to the front. No longer angry, he was subdued by the Holy Spirit.
He wanted the joy, the peace, and the forgiveness that he saw in these
Christian young people.
   The angry husband remained true to his commitment. He and his wife
faithfully worship God together today.
   Our mission offerings support evangelism in Malawi, eastern Africa,
and around the world.

      The Man Abram




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 11:27–15:21.

Memory Text: “He believed in the Lord; and he counted it to
      him for righteousness” (Genesis 15:6).

                 e ended last week on a sour note: the Tower of Babel and all

      W          that it represented about fallen humanity’s seeming inability
                 to learn from the past.
         This week we begin on a more hopeful one: the descendants of Shem,
      the family line from which sprung the patriarch Abram, who, according
      to Paul, is “the father of us all” (Rom. 4:16). That is, he is the father of
      all who believe in Christ, through whom the promises made to Abraham
      are realized; for through Christ we are now Abraham’s seed, “and heirs
      according to the promise” (Gal. 3:29); the promise of a heavenly
      Canaan where no more evil, sin, and death exist, much less rule.
         In other words, after the Fall, the Flood, Noah’s drunkenness, and
      the Tower of Babel fiasco, the Lord now introduces, in the clearest
      manner yet, hope for the human race. And it begins with Abram,
      who—although living amid a family and a culture steeped in idola-
      try—was a follower of the true God and who, for his faithfulness, was
      given promises not only for himself and for his family but for the
      whole human race.
         This week we begin looking at the life of Abram, his initial calling,
      his response, his humanity, and, most important of all, his relationship
      to God—the great exemplar of what it means for a fallen human being
      to live by faith, to be justified by faith, and to reveal that faith through
      works.

     Abram’s Background
Read Genesis 11:10-32. (See also Joshua 24:2 and Acts 7:2.) What
     story immediately precedes these texts? Why might these accounts
     have been placed next to each other? What details are found here
     regarding the background and family of Abram?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Even though chronological considerations suggest that Abram was
     the youngest of Terah’s sons, he appears to be mentioned first in
     Genesis 11:26, 27 because of his importance as the ancestor of the
     chosen family. Although archaeology has revealed much concerning
     the times in which Abram lived, the great empires of the day form
     merely part of the background. The spotlight is on certain patriarchs
     and their families who attempted to keep alive the truth and knowledge
     about God. This is the great focus of Genesis: The stories, however
     sordid at times, center on those whom God entrusted with preserving
     the knowledge of Him in a world filled with idolatry, paganism, and
     all forms of superstition.

In how many stages did the call of Abram take place, according
     to Acts 7:2-4? Compare Gen. 12:1 with Acts 7:4. Why do you think
     he went through these stages rather than going immediately to
     Canaan?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Stephen states that God first appeared to Abram in Ur of the
     Chaldees and called him to go to the land He would show him. But he
     didn’t go right away. Instead, there was the stopping point in Haran,
     where he lived until his father, Terah, died. It was after his father’s
     death that he finally left for the Promised Land.

      Abram’s family was involved in false worship and idolatry; yet,
      for quite a while he remained with them. What might we learn
      from this story about how we should relate to members of our
      own family who are not walking with the Lord?




                                                                        57
                M ONDAY November 13

      The Call
What reason did God give for calling Abram to leave Haran? Gen.
      12:1-3, Heb. 11:8-10.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Notice a great irony here: Among the things that God says He will
      do for Abram when he leaves is to “make thy name great” (Gen. 12:2).
      Compare this with the Tower of Babel story, in which one of the rea-
      sons they worked on the tower was in order to “make us a name” (Gen.
      11:4). From a human perspective, it seems more likely that those who
      would create their monumental human achievement would have a bet-
      ter chance of having “a name” than someone who—leaving behind
      family, race, culture, and fertile land—would travel to a place “not
      knowing whither he went” (Heb. 11:8).
         Yet, today no one knows the name of any one of those who worked
      on the tower; in contrast, almost all the world knows the name of
      Abram.

What powerful lesson should there be in this contrast for us, who in
      our own way might seek to “make us a name”?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Besides the call, again, to go to Canaan (compare Acts 7:2 to Gen.
      12:1), Abram was given this amazing promise that God would make
      of him a great nation. This obviously implied children, something else
      that he would have to take on faith, considering that up to this point
      his wife had been childless (Gen. 11:30). Despite all this, verse 4
      seems to imply no hesitation on his part. God called him to go, God
      made promises to him, and Abram went ahead (see Rom. 4:13) by
      faith.

      Abram, sure that God had called him, moved out by faith on
      what—from a human perspective—seemed very foolish. What
      does this say to us about having to move and live by faith, even to
      the point of “foolishness” (1 Cor. 1:25, 2:14)? At the same time,
      how must we be careful not to step out by “faith” under the
      assumption that God is leading when He might not be? How can
      we know the difference?

     The Faith of Abram
Read all of Genesis 12. Write out what message it has for you about
     faith, about trials, about character, whatever impresses you. What
     can you take away from this story that could help you in your daily
     walk with the Lord?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        We might expect that, because he was following the call of God,
     Abram would have had his paths smoothed by Providence. The Bible
     gives no evidence that as long as we remain faithful to Him, no trials
     will come. On the contrary.
        Indeed, not long after he had entered Canaan, a severe famine
     caused him to depart for Egypt, which was watered by the flooding
     waters of the Nile. The Sacred Record teaches us that even those who
     follow God’s commands may have to endure trials of faith. Think
     about what a great strain that famine could have put on his faith:
     called to go into this land, and look what happens! A famine? This
     famine, which drove him out of Canaan, could help explain his lack
     of faith regarding Sarai and Pharaoh. Hunger and fear reduced the
     hero of faith to a person with frailties that most of us can identify with
     readily. Faith succumbed to fear and fear to deviousness as Abram
     used one half truth to conceal the other half.
        “The Lord in His providence had brought this trial upon Abraham
     to teach him lessons of submission, patience, and faith—lessons that
     were to be placed on record for the benefit of all who should afterward
     be called to endure affliction. God leads His children by a way that
     they know not, but He does not forget or cast off those who put their
     trust in Him.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 129.

      When was the last time you failed a test of faith? What lesson
      did you learn from that failure that can help you next time not
      to fail?




                                                                           59

     Abram and Lot
Read Genesis 13:1-13. What does this tell us about the character of
     Abram? How does this help us understand the kind of man he was
     and why he was an example of what it means to live by faith?
     What Bible texts can you find that admonish us to show the same
     kind of spirit? See, for instance, Phil. 2:4.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Returning from Egypt, Abram called on the Lord at the second altar
     he had built in Canaan (Gen. 13:3, 4). Fortified by this renewal of his
     relationship with God, he was able to face another test. Once more the
     promise of land seemed to elude Abram (vss. 5, 6), and a decision had
     to be made.
        Abram’s failure in Egypt seems counterbalanced by the nobility of
     character that he demonstrated in his dealings with Lot. From the
     heights of Bethel Lot saw the Jordan Valley, well watered and fertile
     like the Garden of Eden and the plains of Mesopotamia. Lot chose that
     which appealed to his sense of immediate gain. Little did Lot realize
     what his choice would cost him. The decision was between “faith” and
     “sight,” and the results demonstrate the wisdom of making the right
     choice. Abram’s close relationship with the Lord and his determina-
     tion to walk by faith enabled him to look beyond the immediate tem-
     poral advantages to eternal gain.

Read Genesis 13:14-18. What promise does the Lord give to Abram?
     Why do you think the Lord waited until this time before giving it
     (see vs. 14) to Abram? Again, why did it require a lot of faith on
     Abram’s part to believe in these promises?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

      Think of the last time you saw someone reveal the kind of gra-
      ciousness and selflessness displayed here by Abram. What do
      you think is the secret of having such a character, especially for
      beings who are, at their core, selfish sinners? What needs to
      happen in your own life in order for you to develop more of this
      kind of character? Imagine, too, what your local church would
      be like were everyone to display such an attitude.

     Melchizedek and Abram
       Genesis 14:1-16 recounts the story of the plunder of Sodom and
     Gomorrah and Abram’s liberation of the people, including Lot, from
     the invaders. Thus, though a man of faith and a worshiper of the true
     God, Abram could also be a man of war.

What light does the Melchizedek episode cast upon the spiritual
     stature of Abram? How again do we see his faith revealed in his
     works? Vss. 17-24.


        Melchizedek (meaning “my king is righteous”) was king of Salem
     (a name for Jerusalem; see Ps. 76:2) and priest of the Most High God.
     Abram worshiped the same God. In deference to Melchizedek, who
     welcomed and blessed the patriarch upon his return from the battle,
     Abram gave the king-priest a tithe of all (vs. 20), indicating that the
     institution of tithing was practiced long before Moses and the Jews.
        After this great victory the Lord appears to Abram and gives him a
     wonderful promise. “I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward”
     (Gen. 15:1). Ellen White indicated that Abram needed that encour-
     agement, considering the ire his recent victories aroused in some of
     his neighbors.

Read Abram’s response (vss. 2, 3). What’s so human, so understand-
     able, about why he would say what he did? Why, from all rational
     and logical standpoints, did this request make so much sense?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       God (vss. 4-6) then repeated His earlier promise that Abram’s
     descendants would be innumerable in multitude (Gen. 12:2, 13:16).
     Even though the advancing age of Abram and Sarai seemed to make
     the promise of descendants increasingly more impossible, Abram took
     God at His word and trusted the divine power. This is seen in Genesis
     15:6, which Paul later quoted (Rom. 4:3).

      Abram believed God, and it was counted unto him for right-
      eousness. How does it help us understand what it means to be
      accepted by God? What things in the story so far about Abram
      give you hope; what things show you the need to make some
      changes in your life?



                                                                        61

    Further       Study: Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
         pp. 125–136; The SDA Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis
         11:26 to 15:21.

           After God promised Abram again that his seed would become a
         great nation, Abram sought a sign, an affirmation of the promise
         (Gen. 15:7, 8). “The Lord condescended to enter into a covenant with
         His servant, employing such forms as were customary among men for
         the ratification of a solemn engagement. By divine direction,
         Abraham sacrificed a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram, each three years
         old, dividing the bodies and laying the pieces a little distance apart. To
         these he added a turtledove and a young pigeon, which, however, were
         not divided. This being done, he reverently passed between the parts
         of the sacrifice, making a solemn vow to God of perpetual obedience.
         Watchful and steadfast, he remained beside the carcasses till the going
         down of the sun, to guard them from being defiled or devoured by
         birds of prey. About sunset he sank into a deep sleep; and, ‘lo, a hor-
         ror of great darkness fell upon him.’ And the voice of God was heard,
         bidding him not to expect immediate possession of the Promised
         Land, and pointing forward to the sufferings of his posterity before
         their establishment in Canaan. The plan of redemption was here
         opened to him, in the death of Christ, the great sacrifice, and His com-
         ing in glory. Abraham saw also the earth restored to its Eden beauty,
3        to be given him for an everlasting possession, as the final and com-
         plete fulfillment of the promise.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
         Prophets, p. 137.

A Cry for Help
by JOSÉ CALIXTO
   Olga and her husband were inseparable. When he developed kidney dis-
ease, Olga cared for him. For ten years he suffered intensely, and eventu-
ally he became bedridden. But the couple never ceased being each other’s
best friend. When he died in 2003, Olga was devastated.
   Her friends and family surrounded her during the days following her
husband’s death. But as they returned to their own worlds, Olga fell into a
deep depression. She could not find a way out of her loneliness. As her
despair deepened, a plan emerged in her mind to end her suffering.
   She gathered all the medicines her husband had taken and poured them
into a cup. Then she sat down and stared at the cup of pills. How easily
this cup of pills could end her suffering.
   Suddenly Olga remembered Naílson and Maria, a couple who had been
so kind to her during her husband’s illness. She could not get them out of
her mind. She put the cup of medicines on the table and reached for her
telephone.
   When Naílson answered the telephone, Olga poured out her heart to
him. She told him she wanted to die. But before she died she wanted to
attend a church. Naílson listened to her desperate cry and then told her,
“Don’t end your life, Olga. Let’s go to the church today. We have worship,
and you can come to our church.”
   Olga agreed. Naílson and Maria walked with Olga into the Adventist
church. As she listened to the speaker, Olga felt the heavy load of suffer-
ing and pain lift and peace enter her heart. She had come to the church
filled with despair; she left there filled with hope.
   Naílson and Maria befriended Olga, helped her handle her bills, and
bought her food until her husband’s benefit checks started coming in. And
they invited her to worship with them. Olga gladly agreed. She never
missed Sabbath, a Sunday evening, or a Wednesday church service.
   In her darkest hour, Olga met the Savior through sincere friends. Olga
has been baptized, and she shares with others how God’s love saved her
life and restored her hope.
   Your mission offerings help provide the means to reach and win hurting
people such as Olga.

      Faith and Frailty




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 16:1–19:38.

Memory Text: “Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time
      appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
      Sarah shall have a son” (Genesis 18:14).

             his week we still follow Abram and Sarai (soon to be Abraham

      T      and Sarah) as they proceed, not only on their geographical jour-
             ney but on their spiritual one, as well. As they continue, we see
      their faith and their frailties contrasted against a world that, for the
      most part, had lost the knowledge of God and was steeped in sin and
      spiritual ignorance, a condition best exemplified in the seething caul-
      drons of Sodom and Gomorrah.
        A famous French writer once wrote, “Your principal maladies are
      pride, which cuts you off from God, and sensuality, which binds you
      to the earth.”
        How little changes; fortunately, God’s grace doesn’t either, for He
      loves even the proud and the sensual. This point will come through
      most poignantly as we, in following the story of the patriarch,
      encounter the sad and sordid tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, where—
      despite God’s love and willingness to forgive—pride and sensuality
      bring these folk to the point of no return.
        As Scripture says, God is “not willing that any should perish”
      (2 Pet. 3:9); some, nevertheless, will. How unfortunate, when—
      because of the Cross and what Christ has done there—none need 10.
      This week we’ll get a sad example of some who do.

     Hagar and Ishmael                    (Genesis 16)

        Read again the promises that God had so far made to Abram regard-
     ing the nation and seed that would spring from him (Gen. 12:1-3, 7;
     13:15, 16; 15:4-6, 13). Notice something interesting. Abram is told,
     again and again, that he will father a great nation; that out of “ ‘your
     own body’ ” (Gen. 15:4, NIV) his heir will come. Something, though,
     is conspicuously absent from each of those promises: none mention
     Sarai, his wife. The promise is that Abram will father the nation; it
     says nothing about who the mother would be. Sarai was his wife, and
     so the natural and logical assumption would be that she’d bear the
     seed; yet all the promises—as they appear so far in the Scriptures—
     say nothing about whom the mother of that great nation would be.

Read Genesis 16. Considering how the promises were made to
     Abram, why is it easy to see how they could have resorted to the
     course they did? Why, though, was that course still wrong?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Ten years had passed since Abram had entered Canaan, and still
     there was no sign of the promised seed. In typical human frustration,
     the patriarch listened to “reason”; how else, after all, could he have a
     child? Certainly not from old and barren Sarai. Again, considering
     that nothing specifically said that Sarai would be the mother, it’s not
     hard to understand the logic behind their actions. Although a man
     having more than one wife was compatible with the practices of the
     time, the commonality of the practice didn’t make it right, and both
     Abram and his wife—as followers of the true God—should have
     known better. How often even we, as followers of the true God, do the
     wrong thing because everyone else is doing it, even though we know
     better.

      When you read through Genesis 16, you can see an important
      principle unfold: that violation of God’s law will bear bitter
      fruit. What lessons can we learn from this story when we find
      ourselves tempted to violate what we know is right in order to
      achieve something that might even, in and of itself, be good
      (after all, Abram and Sarai were only trying to fulfill a promise
      God had made)?




                                                                         65

     The Covenant Reiterated                         (Genesis 17)

       Thirteen years after the birth of Ishmael, God appeared to Abram
     and repeated in expanded form the covenant He had first made with
     the patriarch.

Compare the earlier promises that God made to Abram (Gen.
     12:1-3, 7; 13:15, 16; 15:4-6, 13) with what God says to Abram here
     in Genesis 17:1-16. What points are added, or elaborated on, that
     didn’t appear before?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        God tells Abram (soon to be Abraham, which means “father of
     many”) to be “perfect” before Him, a reminder that God’s mercy and
     grace don’t cancel the call to faithful obedience (Rom. 5:20–6:2). He
     then unfolds to him even more details of the same promise first made
     to him almost twenty-five years before, which included the need to
     circumcise all the infant males.
        A great deal of speculation has occurred over the long centuries
     about why this specific rite would be the sign of the covenant.
     Considering, however, the promise made to Abram repeatedly about
     his “seed” (Gen. 12:7; 13:15, 16; 15:3, 13, 18; 17:7-10), circum-
     cision apparently was to symbolize the national and generational rela-
     tionship that the Lord wanted to have with His special covenant peo-
     ple, a relationship to be maintained by faith (Rom. 4:11, 12). It was
     through this nation, this people, over many generations, that the truth
     about God was to be spread to a world and through whom the Messiah
     would come. No doubt, too, it also symbolized the circumcision of the
     heart (Deut. 30:6, Rom. 2:29). With the advent of Jesus and the
     spreading of the gospel to the Gentiles, it was no longer required (Gal.
     5:6).
        Also, if it wasn’t clear before, it was now—Sarai (Sarah), old Sarah,
     would give birth to the promised seed (Gen. 17:15-19). If Abraham
     needed faith before, he surely needed it at this time.

      Compare Genesis 17:15-19, and Abraham’s reaction to the
      promise of the seed through his wife, with Romans 4:16-25.
      What can we learn from these texts (as well as Gen. 15:2, 16:4)
      about what righteousness by faith means? What hope can you
      draw from these texts about the faithfulness of God even when
      our own faith isn’t always as unflinching as it should be?

     The Lord on Earth                     (Genesis 18)

       In Genesis 18, the promise of a child is again made, this time specifi-
     cally to Sarah (vs. 10)—a promise that seemed impossible to fulfill
     (vs. 11). Yet, we are shown the answer, “Is any thing too hard for the
     Lord?” (vs. 14), an answer that should stand even today as a stern
     rebuke against all unbelief and doubt, especially among professed
     worshipers of the Lord.

Read carefully verses 16-21. What is being contrasted here? How do
     we see here, in a small way, what is really the basic division of all
     humanity? See also Matt. 25:32, 33; Rom. 11:26; 2 Pet. 2:6; Rev.
     22:14, 15.

     _______________________________________________________

        Perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of this well-known
     story centers on just who was speaking to Abraham. The word trans-
     lated “Lord” in some of the verses (Gen. 18:1, 13, 17, 22, 26) is the
     famous four-letter word often translated as “Jehovah” (YHVH), the
     sacred name for God the Father—the word used, for instance, in
     Genesis 4:1, 4; 6:5; Exodus 20:11; 1 Kings 9:1; Psalm 32:2, and, lit-
     erally, thousands of other texts in direct reference to God.
        Thus, we have here, many centuries before the incarnation of Jesus,
     the appearance of the Lord, on earth, in what is clearly a human form
     (see Gen. 18:1-8). We see, therefore, even way back here the incred-
     ibly close connection God, the Creator God, has with us, His fallen
     earthly creation. Considering the size of the universe, the vastness and
     complexity of all creation, at least the part that we can see, we are given
     here another example of the amazing love that God has for us, that He
     would manifest Himself here in human form and talk to Abraham, a
     sinful human being. This is, of course, only a precursor of what would
     happen centuries later in the life and ministry of Jesus, who not only
     became human but died for the sins of this fallen world. The point?
     God is closer to humanity than most of us even begin to realize.

      In what ways have you personally experienced the closeness of
      God? In what intimate and personal ways has He touched your
      life? What might you need to do in order to experience the real-
      ity of His presence in an even more intimate manner?

                                                                            67

      On the Eve of Doom                    (Gen. 19:1-14)

Read the first seven verses of Genesis 19. What kind of picture does
      it present regarding the moral state of Sodom? What significance
      is found in the fact that men, both the young and old, came from
      “every quarter” of the city? What does that remind us of, from a
      previous time in earth’s history? Gen. 6:5.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Even by modern standards of immorality, which have sunk pretty
      low, the Sodomites were a wretched lot. How could a people become
      so degraded?

Read Ezekiel 16:49, 50. How do these verses help us understand what
      happened to that city? Why would these things lead to the kind of
      moral degradation that they did in Sodom? What lessons are in
      there for us?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Though according to 2 Peter 2:7, 8 Lot was a righteous man who was
      pained by what he saw happening in the city, he probably couldn’t have
      avoided being influenced by his surroundings. Who wouldn’t? (John
      the Baptist had to live in the wilderness to escape the corruptions
      around him.) Perhaps that helps explain Lot’s willingness to give his
      virgin daughters to the mob in order to protect his guests (Gen. 19:8).
      However difficult it is for us to understand Lot’s response, it does
      show us how seriously he took the mob’s intent. He obviously knew
      what these people were capable of. As verses 9-14 show, it took the
      supernatural intervention of the two angels to save Lot from the mob,
      who had become angry at him, as well.

       The pride, the fullness of bread, the “prosperous ease” certainly
       didn’t at once turn the Sodomites into the raging mob seen in
       Genesis 19. The process takes time. Look at your own life and
       the direction you are moving in (toward the Holy City [Heb.
       12:22, Rev. 21:2] or toward Sodom), and the standard you use to
       judge your progress.

     Sodom Destroyed                    (Genesis 19)

Read Genesis 19:12-29. How do we see here even more examples of
     God seeking to save people despite themselves?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Had Lot’s inconsistent witness dulled the effect of his appeals? Not
     even the desperate visit at night could arouse his family. Lot’s children
     “laughed at what they called his superstitious fears. His daughters
     were influenced by their husbands. They were well enough off where
     they were. They could see no evidence of danger. Everything was just
     as it had been. They had great possessions, and they could not believe
     it possible that beautiful Sodom would be destroyed.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 160.

Read carefully verse 15. What principle is revealed here regarding
     the destruction of sin? Focus specifically on the phrase “lest thou
     be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” What message is in that
     for us?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Jesus came in order to destroy sin, not sinners (1 John 3:5); Jesus
     came to save the world, not to destroy it (John 3:17); Jesus came to
     destroy the devil and the works of the devil, not human beings (Heb.
     2:14, 1 John 3:8).
       The whole plan of salvation centers on the eradication of sin, not the
     eradication of people. God in the story of Sodom was trying to spare
     Lot the destruction that will sooner or later fall upon all iniquity. And
     the only way for us to be spared that doom is to flee iniquity, to cling
     to Jesus our Savior in faith and obedience, claiming His sinlessness
     and perfection in our behalf, while, at the same time, putting away all
     sin in our lives (Rom. 6:12; 1 Pet. 4:1, 2). In the end, sin will be eradi-
     cated, once and for all. The good news of the gospel is that we don’t
     have to be eradicated with it.

      Read Genesis 19:24-29. Notice the phrase “and God remembered
      Abraham” in the context of saving Lot. Write out a paragraph
      explaining how that is a symbol of the salvation and deliverance
      we have in Jesus and that only because of Him we can be saved in
      judgment day. Be prepared to share it with the class on Sabbath.

                                                                            69

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
     pp. 137–144, 156–170; The SDA Bible Commentary on Genesis 16–19.

        Talking about Lot, Ellen White wrote: “Living in that wicked city,
     in the midst of unbelief, his faith had grown dim. The Prince of heaven
     was by his side, yet he pleaded for his own life as though God, who
     had manifested such care and love for him, would not still preserve
     him. He should have trusted himself wholly to the divine Messenger,
     giving his will and his life into the Lord’s hands without a doubt or a
     question.”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 161.
        “Our Saviour warned his disciples that just prior to his second com-
     ing a state of things would exist very similar to that which preceded the
     flood. Eating and drinking would be carried to excess, and the world
     would be given up to pleasure. This state of things does exist at the
     present time. The world is largely given up to the indulgence of
     appetite; and the disposition to follow worldly customs will bring us
     into bondage to perverted habits,—habits that will make us more and
     more like the doomed inhabitants of Sodom. I have wondered that the
     inhabitants of the earth were not destroyed, like the people of Sodom
     and Gomorrah. I see reason enough for the present state of degeneracy
     and mortality in the world. Blind passion controls reason, and every
     high consideration is, with many, sacrificed to lust.”—Ellen G. White
     and James White, Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, p. 53.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Read aloud the paragraphs you wrote for the question at the
      end of Thursday’s lesson. Discuss your answers.

      ●
      2 What are some prevalent moral issues facing your society?
      How does your church react to these issues? How can we as
      Christians be a force for good, showing people a higher standard
      of morality?

      ●
      3 Is there someone you know struggling with a sin that’s
      destroying their lives? What can you do as a class to lend help
      and support and encouragement as that person seeks victory?

Blessed Interference
by ASERI SUKA
   I love evangelism! Recently I held meetings on the island of Vanua
Levu, in Fiji. We hoped for a turnout of two hundred people or more. But
on the first night only ninety came. We learned that the meetings con-
flicted with a popular television program that came on every night at 8:00.
We prayed that God would reach these people with His message. And He
answered our prayer in a totally unexpected way!
   The meeting started, and in time I stood to preach. While I spoke, we
noticed people running back and forth between houses. What is happen-
ing? we wondered. Then someone came to talk to a team member in the
back of the tent.
   After the meeting the team member told me our public address system
was interfering with their television reception. The people received the
video signal for their favorite TV program, but the audio came from the
evangelistic meetings. The people were more puzzled than angry.
   We checked our system and found everything was operating as it
should. But the next night the same thing happened. And the next. For two
weeks during the evangelistic series televisions in the area played the
audio of our meetings.
   With no competition from television, people began coming to the evan-
gelistic meetings, the only “entertainment” available. One night the choir
from the local Protestant church came, offering to present special music
for the meetings. No one had asked them to come; they volunteered
because they were enjoying the religious meetings.
   People from nearby villages came when they heard about the television
sets that broadcast the evangelistic meetings. Attendance more than dou-
                                bled to almost two hundred people. So far,
                                nineteen have been baptized, and seventy-
                                four more are preparing for baptism. I am
                                convinced that without the miraculous inter-
                                ference with television, the attendance
                                would never have reached one hundred. We
                                have built a temporary church to house the
                                new believers.
                                   Your mission offerings help fund evange-
                                listic efforts in Fiji and around the world.

      The Triumph of Faith




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 20:1–25:10.

Memory Text: “Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou
      hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me” (Genesis
      22:12).

          n one of the greatest classics of Christian literature, The Screwtape

      I   Letters, British writer C. S. Lewis depicts a senior demon,
          Screwtape, who writes a number of letters to a junior demon, his
      nephew Wormwood. The letters are filled with advice on how to try to
      destroy the soul of a young man to whom Wormwood has been
      assigned.
         In one section, Screwtape gives Wormwood the following advice
      regarding his charge: “Talk to him about ‘moderation in all things.’ If you
      can once get him to the point of thinking that ‘religion is all very well up
      to a point,’ you can feel quite happy about his soul. A moderated religion
      is as good for us as no religion at all—and more amusing.”—C. S. Lewis,
      The Screwtape Letters (San Francisco: Harper, 2001), p. 46.
         What a powerful thought as we continue this week with Abraham,
      especially because among the things we cover is the story of him and
      Isaac on Mount Moriah, one of the most powerful and meaningful sto-
      ries, not only in the life of Abraham but in all sacred history. Whatever
      his faults, whatever his failures, Abraham was a man of faith, a man
      whose religion was the foundation of all that he was, a man whose
      religion was, indeed, “very well up to a point”—the point being ready
      to sacrifice his son at God’s command.
         Moderation in all things? Let’s take a look.

      Lying Through Silence                      (Genesis 20)

        Soon after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham
      moved to a region near the border of Egypt, approximately eighty
      miles southwest from Hebron, before traveling north to Gerar, located
      in a fertile valley southeast of Gaza. The city-state of Gerar was then
      ruled by a Philistine named Abimelech.

Read Genesis 20. What does this tell us, again, about the humanity of
      even a great man of faith?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        There are a number of fascinating elements in this story, one being
      the relationship between God and this so-called pagan ruler.

Read over the whole chapter again, focusing on Abimelech. What
      does this chapter tell us about this king’s knowledge of the true
      God? What recent event might have gotten the king’s attention
      regarding the reality of the true God?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Think how easily Abraham could justify his actions. If he were
      killed, the promise of a great nation coming from him would be lost,
      even though that promise alone—already given to him numerous times
      before—should have been more than enough to keep him from fear of
      a premature death (Gen. 20:11). Second, was he really lying? After all,
      Sarah was, as the chapter showed, his sister, or half sister. So, in one
      sense, by simply telling everyone “at every place whither we shall
      come” (vs. 13) that she was his sister, he wasn’t lying . . . was he?
         What we can learn from this is that deception can come just as eas-
      ily by what you don’t say. We can see here a great example of some-
      one trying to stick to the letter of the law while missing the principle
      behind it entirely.

       Someone once said that even “facts” come with interpretations and
       preconceived ideas. In what less-than-honest ways do you some-
       times interpret the “facts”? Might you need to make something
       right in a case in which you, like Abraham, twisted the facts more
       by what you neglected to say than by what you actually said?

     The Birth of Isaac
        Finally, after so many years, so many disappointments, so many tri-
     umphs and failures, the child of the promise was born (Gen. 21:1-3).
     They named him Isaac, which means “he laughs,” serving as a
     reminder of Abraham’s laughter of disbelief (Gen. 17:17) when told
     by the Lord that he and Sarah would have a child. Indeed, with the
     exception of the one letter used in Hebrew for the word and, his name
     is spelled exactly as the Hebrew in Genesis 17:17 reads, “and he
     laughed.” No doubt, too, the name was also to signify the joy that he
     and his wife would have with the birth of the promised child.
        Unfortunately, it wasn’t all joy and happiness in the home. What fol-
     lows is a painful example of what it means to live with the conse-
     quences of sin, even after that sin has been forgiven.

Read Genesis 21:9-21. What sad events eventually followed the birth
     of Isaac? How did the Lord help ease Abraham’s pain at having to
     send his son away?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Ishmael had lived for about seventeen years with his father
     Abraham. How could Abraham send him away? What a sacrifice!
     What a price the old patriarch had to pay for a well-meaning error on
     his part! How ironic, too, that Sarah, who had first told him to go to
     Hagar, would be the one to tell him to send them away.

How did Paul describe the incompatibility between Abraham’s natu-
     ral and spiritual descendants, and what application did the apos-
     tle make? Gal. 4:28-31.


       Again, however difficult for us to understand how Abraham could
     have done it, what should be clear is that it never pays to distrust the
     Lord, that disobedience leads to pain and suffering, not just for the one
     who sins but oftentimes for those closest to the one who commits the
     sin. Certainly at the time that Abram first took Hagar as a wife, he
     never envisioned things coming to this.

      What’s the next hard decision you have to make? Are you going
      to make a choice that will come with bad consequences you
      can’t even begin to imagine? How can you be sure that you are
      following God’s will in making your choice?

     Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah
Read Genesis 22 prayerfully. What message, or messages, does the
     Word of God bring to you personally from this powerful story?
     What, if anything, can you take from it and apply to your own
     walk with the Lord?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Of the many Old Testament stories, this one is not only one of the
     most powerful, one of the most moving, and one of the most
     Messianic (in that we see the death of Jesus, God’s Son, prefigured)
     but also one of the most difficult to understand. Even if we grasp that
     Abraham’s need to display his faith (after so many repeated failures in
     that area), even when we understand his need to be willing to die to
     self and all that mattered to him—to be asked to do this by God? And
     to obey? Whatever else we can get from this story, it should show us
     all the paucity of our own faith and the realization that in the great
     controversy between good and evil we are dealing with issues that go
     far beyond what we, as sinners, can understand fully.

       Danish author Søren Kierkegaard, commenting on this story,
     said that Abraham “left behind his worldly understanding, and he
     took along his faith.” What does that mean to you? How often, as a
     Christian, are you called to leave behind your worldly understand-
     ing and move only on faith? How are you supposed to do that?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       And though in this story our focus is on Abraham, we mustn’t for-
     get Isaac’s role too. Ellen White was so clear in Patriarchs and
     Prophets (p. 152) that though the young man could have fled, he sub-
     mitted, even tried to help the pained and tormented old man do what
     he must. Isaac’s ready submission typified the future submission of
     the Son of God. Once more in the region of Moriah, on a hill called
     Golgotha, a Father was to surrender His life in His Son. While Moses,
     looking forward by faith, wrote, “ ‘On the mountain of the Lord it will
     be provided’ ” (Gen. 22:14, NIV), we can exclaim in adoration and
     gratitude, “On the mountain of the Lord it has been provided.”




                                                                        75

     Faith and Works
Read Hebrews 11:17-19. Considering Abraham’s previous distrust of
     God’s promises, what insights do these texts add to our under-
     standing of this incident?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        However incredible the story of Abraham and Isaac, whatever les-
     sons we can draw from it, it should be clear that faith, saving faith, the
     kind of faith talked about in the New Testament (Rom. 3:28, 5:1, Gal.
     3:24) is not a mere assent to beliefs, no matter how correct those
     beliefs are. Many of the lost will be those who knew propositional
     truths about God, or who even did things in His name (Matt. 7:22, 23).
     However intense this example, it shows that faith means obeying God
     and that only a faith revealed in works is a saving faith.

Read James 2:17-26. What’s the main message there? What point is
     he trying to make? What point is he not making? See also Rom.
     3:28; 5:1; Gal. 2:16, 17 to keep everything in proper balance.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Sure, we are saved by faith, but a faith that is expressed in actions,
     a faith that allows God to work through us. Notice what happened
     after the angel stopped Abraham. The “angel of the Lord” then called
     attention twice to Abraham’s obedience as the reason for the blessings
     pronounced (Gen. 22:16, 18). Because Abraham had demonstrated
     that he was trusting and trustworthy, God was able to bless him. The
     point is that it’s through an obedience generated out of faith that the
     Lord is able to bring upon us the blessings He has promised. Thus,
     faith and works are, really, inseparable in the life of a believer.

      What exists in your life (if anything) that you might need to sac-
      rifice, not to be justified before God but to show that you have
      already been justified by Him through faith in Christ?

     The End of an Era                   (Gen. 23:1–25:10)

       Abraham had returned to the land of Canaan and lived at Kiriath-
     arba, later known as Hebron. It was here that Sarah died. Despite her
     faults, Sarah was included among those whose faith looked forward to
     dwelling forever in a “better country” (see Heb. 11:11-16).

What does it say to us that Sarah should be listed, as she was, in
     Hebrews 11?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Three years after the death of Sarah, Abraham made preparations
     for the marriage of his son. Isaac trusted divine providence and his
     father to find a suitable wife. For him, the proper marriage of this son
     was of crucial importance.

Why did Abraham advise Eliezer to choose a wife from among his rel-
     atives rather than from the daughters of Canaan? Is not this being
     exclusive, or thinking yourself somehow superior to others? See
     Gen. 24:3, 4; Deut. 7:3, 4; 1 Kings 11:4; 2 Cor. 6:14.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       After Abraham had appointed Isaac as his undisputed legal heir and
     had sent his other son away richly laden with gifts, he died at the age
     of 175 (Gen. 25:1-8). Ishmael and Isaac buried their father in the pur-
     chased tomb where Abraham had buried Sarah (vss. 9, 10).
       Before proceeding with the line of the faithful, Genesis lists the
     generations of those who will fade from our view (vss. 12-18). The
     Bible is focused specifically on the line of Abraham, the line that
     would, however fitfully, keep alive the faith and knowledge of the true
     God.

      Of everything that you’ve read about the life of Abraham,
      what’s the one point that strikes home the hardest? What’s the
      one lesson that, among all else, you have taken from this story
      that can help you in your walk with the Lord?

Further Study: Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
     pp. 145–155, 171–176; The SDA Bible Commentary, comments on
     Genesis 20:1–25:18.

         “The instruction given to Abraham touching the sacredness of the
     marriage relation was to be a lesson for all ages. It declares that the
     rights and happiness of this relation are to be carefully guarded, even
     at a great sacrifice. Sarah was the only true wife of Abraham. Her
     rights as a wife and mother no other person was entitled to share.”
     —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 147.
         “At the appointed place they built the altar and laid the wood upon
     it. Then, with trembling voice, Abraham unfolded to his son the divine
     message. It was with terror and amazement that Isaac learned his fate,
     but he offered no resistance. He could have escaped his doom, had he
     chosen to do so; the grief-stricken old man, exhausted with the strug-
     gle of those three terrible days, could not have opposed the will of the
     vigorous youth. But Isaac had been trained from childhood to ready,
     trusting obedience, and as the purpose of God was opened before him,
     he yielded a willing submission. He was a sharer in Abraham’s faith,
     and he felt that he was honored in being called to give his life as an
     offering to God. He tenderly seeks to lighten the father’s grief, and
     encourages his nerveless hands to bind the cords that confine him to
     the altar.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 152.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 How might the “sacrifice” of Ishmael in the previous chapter
      have helped prepare Abraham for the sacrifices and trials that
      would come next? What principle can you find here that could
      help us understand what it means to live by faith?

      ●3 What advice do you have for someone who, in the faith, is
      thinking of marrying outside the faith? What cautions might be
      in order?

A New Name
by JOHN K.
  I grew up in a family that followed a major world religion. I knew nothing
about Jesus. Then when I was twelve, my father began worshiping with a
group that followed Christianity while it maintained the cultural ways of our
family’s religion. Father did not push us to join him. He wanted us to make
our own choices about religion.
  Father brought home religious books that I read, and I compared what they
said about the Bible with our family’s holy book. I wanted to decide for
myself which religion held the truth about God. I found good ideas in our
holy books, but the ideas did not seem to translate to the lives of the follow-
ers whom I knew.
  But I noticed that Christians behaved differently. They seemed to practice
what they taught. My father became more involved in this religious organi-
zation. Then the group’s leader betrayed the members, and the group fell
apart. Father eventually began attending a Christian church, and the rest of
the family joined him—except for me. I continued to watch and wait to
decide which religion was best.
  Then my father met an Adventist pastor, and the two spent hours talking
about God. My father was excited to find someone who believed totally in
the Bible. When he learned what the Bible said about keeping God’s Sabbath
day holy, it matched something he had read in our holy book about the
Sabbath, and he believed it was true. He was impressed that these Adventists
observe the laws regarding clean and unclean foods. Surely these Adventist
believers were true followers of the living God.
  I became convinced that these Adventists worship God as true followers
should. When my family decided to become Adventist Christians, I joined
them, as well. We knew that we faced trouble from our families, but we felt
God was leading us. With no other Adventists in our area, we worshiped
alone in our home.
  We all had names that reflected our former religion, so when we were
                               baptized, we took Christian names. My new
                               name is John. I want the world to know that I
                               am a follower of Jesus. I am now studying in
                               the Adventist university in my country, where I
                               can learn more about being a true Christian.
                               God is blessing me here in this school.
                                  Our family searched for many years to find
                               true faith. Now we have found God’s truth, and
                               we will stay.
                                  Thank you for sharing God’s love with me
                               through your mission offerings.

      The Price of Duplicity




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 25:19–29:30.

Memory Verse: “Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in
      all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this
      land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
      spoken to thee of” (Genesis 28:15).

            renchman Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), sometimes

      F     deemed the philosopher of the French Revolution, argued that
            “there is no original sin in the human heart” and that human
      beings are all basically good. It was society, he said, that had cor-
      rupted humanity. If left to our own devices, to our own feelings and
      conscience, we would naturally do the right thing (all this from a man
      who, after fathering a number of children, dumped them all at an
      orphanage).
        Of course, it’s hard to think of a view more contrary to Scriptures
      or, really, to reality. “The heart is deceitful above all things, and des-
      perately wicked: who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9). Or, as expressed in
      another context: “But Jesus did not commit himself unto them,
      because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of
      man: for he knew what was in man” (John 2:24, 25).
        This week, as we continue our family saga, we get more sad
      glimpses into the wickedness and deceitfulness of human hearts.
      Pride, passion, and selfishness reign, even (more frightfully) some-
      times under the justification of seeking to do God’s will.
        The bright spot? Even amid all this, the Lord reveals His love, His
      patience, and His saving and forgiving grace for erring sinners.

Esau and Jacob                 (Gen. 25:19-34)

  Though a twin, Esau came out first and was, therefore, counted as
the oldest. As such, to him were given the special promises and privi-
leges that accompanied the covenant first made to Abraham. “With
these promises Esau and Jacob were familiar. They were taught to
regard the birthright as a matter of great importance, for it included
not only an inheritance of worldly wealth but spiritual pre-eminence.
He who received it was to be the priest of his family, and in the line of
his posterity the Redeemer of the world would come. On the other
hand, there were obligations resting upon the possessor of the
birthright. He who should inherit its blessings must devote his life to
the service of God. Like Abraham, he must be obedient to the divine
requirements. In marriage, in his family relations, in public life, he
must consult the will of God.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
Prophets, pp. 177, 178.

  Keeping in mind Ellen White’s insights, read the verses for
today. How do her words help us understand why Esau acted as he
did? What lessons are in here for us? See also Heb. 12:14-17.

_______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________

  Genesis 25:27 contrasts the two boys. It’s interesting that the
Hebrew word describing Jacob is tam, which means “complete” or
“perfect” or “morally innocent.” It’s the same word, translated in Job
1:8 as “perfect,” used to describe the character of Job. Despite this
depiction, he still was willing to take advantage of his brother’s weak-
ness in order to seek for himself the birthright. Perhaps the promise
made to his mother regarding him and his brother (vs. 23) made him
think that he had to have the birthright in order for that promise to be
fulfilled. Whatever his motives, he obviously esteemed the birthright
as something to be coveted.
  At the same time, Esau demonstrated he was unworthy of the
birthright privilege not only by bartering it away in a most flippant
manner but also by reinforcing his choice through an oath (vs. 33) and
by his unperturbed departure (vs. 34; see also Gen. 26:34, 35).

 However worthy the object of his desire, Jacob tried to get it
 through less than honorable means. How can we protect our-
 selves from the same faulty reasoning that the end justifies the
 means?



                                                                     81

     Isaac and Abimelech                    (Genesis 26)

       As in the early sojourn of Abraham, there was a famine in the land
     that caused Isaac to move to a new location. Perhaps because of the
     potential for discouragement, it was at this time that the Lord renewed
     with him the same covenant promises that he had made with his
     father, Abraham (Gen. 26:1-5).

Read verses 7-11. Where have we seen this before? What lesson can
     we draw from this account?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Sometime later Isaac’s wealth increased to the point that it elicited
     the jealousy of the Philistines. In order to preserve peace, Isaac moved
     to the valley of Gerar and later moved again to Beersheba (vss. 12-23).
     This illustrates the hardship and tensions to which believers are
     exposed in this sin-darkened world.

What patriarchal practice did Isaac follow after the second divine
     revelation was accorded to him? What’s the importance of this
     practice? What is it meant to symbolize? Vss. 24, 25; see also Eph.
     5:2, Rev. 13:8.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Nearly a century after the treaty that Abraham had entered into with
     Abimelech, the ruler of Gerar, a later Abimelech, accompanied by a
     friend and the chief captain of his army, invited Isaac to enter into
     another sworn peace treaty.

      Notice what Abimelech says twice to Isaac (vss. 28, 29). How do
      these words in many ways reflect what it means to be a witness
      to the Lord? What aspects of your life could someone look at
      and say, “You are now blessed of the Lord”? In what ways are
      you blessed of the Lord? Write a prayer thanking God for all
      that He has done for you.

      Faithless Schemes
         In Genesis 27:1-7, Isaac permitted his tastebuds to influence his
      heart and conscience. He determined to bestow the birthright blessing
      upon his older son in spite of the Lord’s words at their birth (Gen.
      25:23), Esau’s deliberate disregard of the birthright (vss. 29-34), and
      his ill-disposed choice of Hittite women for wives (Gen. 26:34, 35).
         “Rebekah divined his purpose. She was confident that it was con-
      trary to what God had revealed as His will. Isaac was in danger of
      incurring the divine displeasure and of debarring his younger son
      from the position to which God had called him. She had in vain tried
      the effect of reasoning with Isaac, and she determined to resort to
      stratagem.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 180.

Read the rest of the story regarding this deception (Gen. 27:8-29).
      Notice carefully verse 20, particularly Jacob’s answer to his
      father’s question. Why does this show even more just how wrong
      this action was?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        As Isaac smelled the clothes Jacob wore, his mind was carried from
      the present to the future. The smell of the fields suggested to him an
      abundance of crops and a bounty of grain and wine (vss. 27-29, 37).
      Jacob was promised ultimate dominion over the nations, a plan that
      was reiterated and enlarged upon by later prophets and poets of Israel.
      Under inspiration the prophetic eye envisaged the ultimate success
      and supremacy of God’s people.

Read carefully the blessing bestowed by Isaac on Jacob (vss. 28, 29).
      What elements are found in the blessing? What is in there that
      would make him want it so badly?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

       There’s so much in there, so much that could be used for good
       or for bad. Even though God bestows gifts and blessings, that
       doesn’t automatically mean that people use them always for His
       glory. What kind of gifts and blessings have you received from
       God? How are you using them? What changes might you need
       to make in your use of what God has given you?

     The Price of Duplicity                      (Gen. 27:30-46)

        Twice now we’ve seen Jacob take advantage of the weakness of oth-
     ers in order to obtain what he wanted. What a sorry example. That he,
     though, should nevertheless be one of the founding patriarchs says a
     lot about God’s grace, especially for those who truly repent of their
     sins. However, as the Bible shows numerous times, the forgiveness of
     sin doesn’t automatically equate with the nullification of the conse-
     quences of sin.
        What made this deception even all the more foolish was that it
     should have been obvious that it would be uncovered, that Esau and
     Isaac would eventually know what happened. Apparently, though,
     both mother and son were determined to get what they wanted, regard-
     less of the cost. What an important lesson here for all of us: Think
     through carefully what you are about to do!
        Perhaps the saddest thing, too, about these events (including chap-
     ter 25) is that there are no innocents. All four of the people here, Isaac,
     Rebekah, Jacob, and Esau were guilty of wrongdoing.

Next to each name, write down the wrong they did. What was at the
     heart of all these actions?
     Isaac___________________________________________________


     Rebekah________________________________________________


     Jacob___________________________________________________


     Esau___________________________________________________

        In the end, what we see here is pure selfishness, people wanting
     what they want for themselves, regardless of whether their actions are
     right or wrong. What’s even more frightening is that, in some cases,
     they were actually acting according to what they believed were God’s
     wishes. Yet, look at the results. Though in verse 45 she tells Jacob to
     flee and she’ll call him back later, nothing in the Bible indicates that
     Rebekah was ever to see this son again.

      Go over the list of sins you listed above. What drove each one—
      pride, greed, passion, whatever? Which of these does Satan use
      with greatest success in your own experience? Why is death to
      self at the foot of the Cross your only hope for victory in these
      areas? How can you better avail yourself of the power promised
      us in the Word (1 Cor. 10:13)?

     Jacob’s Ladder                (Genesis 28)

Note the fatherly instruction and blessing with which Isaac sent
     Jacob to Mesopotamia (Gen. 28:1-5). Why should this point about
     marriage be so important?

     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       After all this duplicity and deceit, Jacob flees his family. Yet, it’s
     obvious that God is not through with him. In a dream the Lord appears
     to the young man and gives him some wonderful assurances and
     promises.

Read Genesis 28:10-15. Why do you think the Lord would promise
     so much to someone like Jacob? What does this tell us about
     grace?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Ellen White writes that, before he slept that night, Jacob “with weep-
     ing and deep humiliation” confessed his sin and asked the Lord for some
     evidence that he was not “utterly forsaken.”—Patriarchs and Prophets,
     p. 183. The dream was, she wrote, the response to his repentance.
        The dream of the ladder, of the angels ascending and descending,
     was a partial revelation of the plan of salvation. No matter how far sin
     had separated humanity from heaven, Jesus bridged the gap; He is the
     ladder between heaven and earth; His perfect righteousness was
     enough to reconcile a sinful world with a Holy God (2 Cor. 5:18, 19)
     and to justify before God all those who accept by faith what Christ has
     done for them (Rom. 3:28-30, Rom. 4:5, Gal. 3:24).
        Thus, many years before the Cross, we are shown the close connec-
     tion between heaven and earth; we are shown that we are not forsaken,
     that we are not alone, and that God is intimately involved in what hap-
     pens here.

      Without revelation, we could have cause for such despair: mor-
      tal beings living on a tiny planet in a cold, vast universe that, in
      and of itself, doesn’t seem to care at all about us. Revelation,
      however, tells us differently; revelation gives us a new way of
      interpreting events in our world. How, in your own walk with
      the Lord, have you experienced the closeness of heaven to earth?
      How has God shown you, personally, that He is close? Be pre-
      pared to share your answers with the class on Sabbath.

         25:19–29:30.

            “Jacob and Rebekah succeeded in their purpose, but they gained
         only trouble and sorrow by their deception. God had declared that
         Jacob should receive the birthright, and His word would have been
         fulfilled in His own time had they waited in faith for Him to work for
         them. But like many who now profess to be children of God, they were
         unwilling to leave the matter in His hands.”—Ellen G. White,
         Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 180.
            “In this vision the plan of redemption was presented to Jacob, not
         fully, but in such parts as were essential to him at that time. The mys-
         tic ladder revealed to him in his dream was the same to which Christ
         referred in His conversation with Nathanael. Said He, ‘Ye shall see
         heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon
         the Son of man.’ John 1:51. Up to the time of man’s rebellion against
         the government of God, there had been free communion between God
         and man. But the sin of Adam and Eve separated earth from heaven,
         so that man could not have communion with his Maker. Yet the world
         was not left in solitary hopelessness. The ladder represents Jesus, the
3
         appointed medium of communication. Had He not with His own mer-
         its bridged the gulf that sin had made, the ministering angels could
         have held no communion with fallen man. Christ connects man in his
         weakness and helplessness with the source of infinite power.”—Ellen
         G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 184.

The Disobedient Son
by JOSEPH AMULE JOHN
   I grew up in a nominal Christian family in southern Sudan. Then when
I was a teenager, my brother and I met a neighbor who was an Adventist.
He invited us to study the Bible with him. When I told our mother what
we planned to do, she warned us to stay away from him and not to listen
to his religious heresy. She refused to talk about anything this man said,
and she told us not to talk to this neighbor again.
   But I still had questions. So I sneaked to the pastor’s house to learn more
about God’s Word. He gave me a Bible, and we talked for a long time
about what the Bible teaches. I decided to follow Christ and become an
Adventist.
   There was no Adventist church where we live, and the pastor did not live
in our area all the time. So when he was gone, I kept the Sabbath as much
as I knew how on Saturday, and I worshiped with other Christians on
Sunday. Then a lay pastor came to work in our area, and I started studying
with him. When the pastor returned and held evangelistic meetings, I
attended.
   During the meetings I had a dream that a man tossed away a new ciga-
rette. I picked it up to smoke it, but it turned into a snake. I smoked at this
time, and I understood that I had to stop smoking or it would bite me and
kill me, even as a snake would. I threw away my cigarettes and never
smoked again.
   I continued studying with the pastor, and after several months I decided
to be baptized. I was old enough at this time to make this decision, even if
my mother objected. I just wish that there had been a church in my village
sooner. If there had been one, I would have become an Adventist far ear-
lier. But we had no one to teach us and no church to attend until last year.
                                   I am grateful for everyone who gave mis-
                                sion offerings to send us a pastor and a lay
                                pastor. Without them, I still would be in spir-
                                itual darkness.

        LESSON           11 *December 9-15
      Jacob Becomes Israel




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 29–33.

Memory Text: “Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
      Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
      and hast prevailed” (Genesis 32:28).

          acob’s 20 years of service in Mesopotamia were characterized by

      J   jealousy, contention, and intrigue. One sister sought to outdo the
          other in the number of sons she bore as both vied for first place in
      their husband’s affections. Son-in-law and father-in-law shone in their
      attempts to deceive each other, with Laban manifesting interest only
      in his own advancement. The biblical story notes more faith in potions
      and human schemes than in God. Again, how little has changed in
      thousands of years.
         Yet, while these same chapters reveal how groundless is trust in
      human power, they reveal how certain is the reality of the divine
      promises of mercy, forgiveness, and acceptance (how fortunate for us
      that hasn’t changed either!). Indeed, even amid all these sad stories of
      human faithlessness, deceit, jealousy, and intrigue, we can see the
      mercy of God at work, a stunning and powerful testament to God’s
      grace for fallen human beings.
         This is seen, perhaps, most vividly in Jacob’s night of wrestling.
      Here, again, we can see just how close the Lord can come to those
      who in true faith and repentance seek Him. At Jabbok, repentant
      Jacob became Israel, and God’s plan triumphed in spite of the appar-
      ently unpromising human material with which He had to work.

     Family Woes
       In the story of Jacob and Rachel and Leah (Genesis 29), there’s more
     deception, only now Jacob is the victim instead of the perpetrator.
     Maybe he learned some lessons about deception after being on the
     receiving end of it.
       Jacob’s marriage to two sisters, which later Mosaic law prohibited
     while the first sister was alive (Lev. 18:18), was marred by a great deal
     of intrigue, jealousy, bickering, and sadness. God allowed this practice;
     He also allowed the bitter consequences that always seemed to follow it.
       In a society in which children signified God’s favor and attracted
     the husband’s love, God blessed Leah with several children. The
     names given to the children of both wives and maidservants reflect the
     feelings of Leah and Rachel at the birth of those infants and testified
     to the contention that existed between them. The names either are
     derived from or resemble the sound of the Hebrew verbs associated
     with the names.

Read Genesis 30:1-4. Where have we seen this practice before? What
     does it mean that children keep repeating the sins of the parents?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

Read Genesis 30:5-13. What sinful force is driving these actions?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        By the end of this section, Jacob had fathered the children of four
     different women, for Rachel eventually conceived and bore Joseph
     (Gen. 30:22-24). Thus, he now lived in a single home with four
     women, some loved more than others, some holding higher “status”
     than others, yet all the mothers of his twelve children. Talk about a for-
     mula for contention, jealousy, and intrigue! All this would later bear
     bitter fruit, especially in the life of Jacob, who should have known bet-
     ter and who, having been given promises by God (Gen. 28:10-22),
     should have trusted in those promises without having to resort to
     polygamy.

      What challenges are you facing, right now, that make it difficult
      to live by faith rather than by sight? How can you learn to trust
      in God’s promises so that you don’t resort to the wrong means
      in order to see those promises fulfilled?

                                                                           89
                 M ONDAY December 11

      Jacob’s Wages              (Gen. 30:25-43)

How did the schemers, Laban and Jacob, attempt to outsmart each
      other after Jacob had requested permission for himself and his
      family to return to his native country? Vss. 26-43.


        The form of payment agreed on extended Jacob’s stay for another
      six years (Gen. 31:41). Jacob’s request appears magnanimous when
      we realize that in the Near East “goats, as a rule, are black or dark
      brown, rarely white or spotted with white, and that sheep are for the
      most part white, seldom black or speckled.”—The SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 1, p. 394. As Laban would be left with all the pure-
      color animals, the deal seemed advantageous to Jacob’s father-in-law.

How did Laban seek to prevent any off-color characteristics being bred
      back into the pure-color stock? Gen. 30:35, 36.


To what ancient superstition did Jacob resort after any possible
      attempt at selected breeding had been thwarted by Laban’s sepa-
      ration of the stock? Vss. 37-43.


        Jacob, as well as Laban, seemed to be unaware of the fact that even
      those animals that appeared to be pure in color still carried in them
      recessive color characteristics that could be transmitted to their off-
      spring. Being at a loss as to what he should do, Jacob took refuge in
      the mistaken belief that vivid sights experienced by a mother during
      conception or pregnancy would mark her offspring.

While to all intents and purposes Jacob’s stratagems appeared to meet
      with success (vs. 43), what message did God convey to the patriarch
      in a dream? Gen. 31:7-12.


        Jacob attributed his success to God’s blessing (vss. 7, 9), and the
      Lord blessed him in spite of his superstitious beliefs (vs. 12). Indeed,
      the dream of verses 10-12 may have been intended to explain to the
      patriarch how the recessive off-color characteristics were passed on by
      the pure-color parents. God used the occasion for a miracle and
      blessed Jacob, not because of his skill or ingenuity but in order to
      thwart Laban’s exploitation.

       Even despite all of Jacob’s mistakes, the Lord was still with him.
       What hope does this offer you, despite the mistakes you have
       already made?

      Jacob’s Flight to Canaan                       (Genesis 31)

Read Genesis 31:1-16. What happened that prompted Jacob to finally
      leave?
      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

         As a result of his greed, Laban alienated his daughters and changed
      Jacob’s wages ten times. Laban’s absence provided the opportunity for
      Jacob to leave Mesopotamia (vss. 17-21). Rachel’s theft of her father’s
      household deities may testify to the fact that her beautiful appearance
      concealed a half-converted heart. After thirteen years of marriage, she
      still had not submitted fully to the God worshiped by her husband
      (vs. 19).

What sanctimonious accusation did Laban level against Jacob when
      he overtook him after covering a distance of more than three hun-
      dred miles? Vss. 22-30.
      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

        Conscious of his innocence, Jacob then invoked the death penalty
      upon the one in whose possession the household gods were to be
      found (vs. 32). While such a penalty was in harmony with
      Mesopotamian law, it was as foolish and rash a decision as was that of
      Jacob’s sons years later (Gen. 44:9). Rachel’s ruse demonstrated that
      she was the daughter of Laban, partaking of his character (Gen.
      31:32-35). Since Laban was unable to support any of his charges,
      Jacob reprimanded his father-in-law angrily and attributed his own
      success to the God of his father (vss. 36-42).

Read carefully Jacob’s reply to Laban (vss. 36-42). What can we learn
      from it about the character of Jacob that helps explain God’s
      blessing on him?
      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________

        In the end, despite Jacob’s innocence, he ultimately gave all the
       credit to the Lord. This shows that, whatever his mistakes, he
       knew the Lord and the reality of the Lord working in his life.
       Despite his faults, he was seeking to live by faith. How important
       that we all have the same experience for ourselves, that of hav-
       ing “the fear of Isaac” (vs. 42) with us.

                                                                         91

     Jacob and Esau                 (Gen. 32:1-32)

       Soon after he separates from Laban and is now on his own after so
     many years, Jacob is met by two angels (Gen. 32:1, 2). Though the
     text doesn’t say what, if anything, that they said to him, no doubt their
     presence at that place certainly gave him some courage and confi-
     dence. Perhaps that explains why, in the next verse, he decides to send
     messengers to his brother.

Notice that in the message he calls himself “thy servant Jacob”
     (vs. 4). Why do you think he would use that term with his brother?
     See Gen. 25:23; 27:29, 37.
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       After the messengers return, their words are ominous. They gave no
     reply from Esau to the friendly message Jacob had sent. Instead, they
     say that Esau is coming toward Jacob with 400 men. No wonder Jacob
     was “greatly afraid and distressed” (vs. 7).

Read Jacob’s prayer in verses 9-12. What are the basic elements of
     the prayer? What was he praying for? What promises was he
     claiming? How did the prayer show his dependence upon the
     Lord?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       However sincere and heartfelt the prayer, Jacob was also going to
     use some diplomacy and wisdom (vss. 13-21). He had hoped that
     with all these gifts he could “appease” (vs. 20) his brother. Perhaps
     there’s a lesson here: Sure, we need to pray, we need to lean on the
     Lord, but at the same time we need to do all that we can within our
     power, all that is in accordance with God’s will, to see that prayer
     answered.

Jump ahead to Genesis 33. What can we see in the interaction
     between both these brothers to show that they were changed men
     since the last time they had seen each other?

      Regardless of whatever spiritual growth both had over the
      years, time also tends to heal wounds. What can you do, until
      time applies its healing balm, to help alleviate whatever pain
      you might be feeling over past wrongs?

     Jacob’s Night of Fighting and Faith
Read Genesis 32:23-32. What does this account say to you? What’s
     the lesson you can learn from this story about your own “strug-
     gles” with God? See also Hos. 12:4.
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Ellen White is clear that Jacob was wrestling with Christ, the
     “ ‘Angel of the covenant.’ ”—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 197. No
     wonder that twice in the depiction of the night of wrestling the texts
     state that it was indeed God who had appeared to Jacob that night.
     Here, again, we see just how up close and personal the Lord is willing
     to get with His people.

What is the significance of the name change?


       As Jacob perceived that he had struggled with a supernatural being,
     he pleaded for a blessing (vs. 26). His petition and perseverance were
     rewarded by a change of name. No longer would his name be Jacob
     (“to seize the heel” and by extension “to overreach” or “to deceive”).
     Now it would be Israel (“he strives with God”).

Read verse 30.What meaning can you draw from the words that Jacob
     uttered? How could that apply to us today?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Jacob, when it was all over, said that he had seen the face of God
     and lived. In a sense, this is the same opportunity offered to all
     humanity through the death of Jesus. Jesus was God in the flesh, and
     through His life and subsitutionary death He brought reconciliation
     between heaven and earth. Because of Jesus and what He has done, we
     all can, in a sense, “see the face of God” and live. Our past sins, like
     Jacob’s past sins, no longer have to guarantee our destruction before
     the face of Him who is “a consuming fire” (Heb. 12:29).

      In what ways have you been striving with God? What does it
      mean to strive with God? Might you even come away from such
      striving, like Jacob, with a “limp”?



                                                                         93

            “Though Jacob had left Padan-aram in obedience to the divine
         direction, it was not without many misgivings that he retraced the road
         which he had trodden as a fugitive twenty years before. His sin in the
         deception of his father was ever before him. He knew that his long
         exile was the direct result of that sin, and he pondered over these
         things day and night, the reproaches of an accusing conscience mak-
         ing his journey very sad. As the hills of his native land appeared
         before him in the distance, the heart of the patriarch was deeply
         moved. All the past rose vividly before him. With the memory of his
         sin came also the thought of God’s favor toward him, and the prom-
         ises of divine help and guidance.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
         Prophets, p. 195.
            “Jacob had received the blessing for which his soul had longed. His
         sin as a supplanter and deceiver had been pardoned. The crisis in his
         life was past. Doubt, perplexity, and remorse had embittered his exist-
         ence, but now all was changed; and sweet was the peace of recon-
         ciliation with God. Jacob no longer feared to meet his brother. God,
         who had forgiven his sin, could move the heart of Esau also to accept
         his humiliation and repentance.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
3
         Prophets, p. 198.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 As a class, discuss the actions of Jacob in preparing to meet
          Esau. Why did he work so hard to try to appease his brother?
          Shouldn’t the promises that God had made to him been enough
          to cause him to move ahead only by faith? Was he showing a lack
          of faith by his actions, or was it faith in action?

          ●2 Ask those willing to talk about an occasion when time healed
          some painful wound. What lessons can be learned from those
          experiences? What can we do to help people hurting from
          wounds that can take a long time to heal?

The Troublesome Boy, Part 1
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   When Samuel was six, a village leader invited an Adventist teacher to
come and start a school in their town. Soon Samuel enrolled in the simple
mud-brick schoolhouse that stood in the village. The teacher started a
Sabbath School in the village, as well.
   Samuel’s father thought that students in the Adventist school must
attend Sabbath School, too, so he sent Samuel to church every Sabbath
morning. But, instead, Samuel hid in the bush until church ended. When
his father learned what he had done, he beat Samuel.
   Finally Samuel went to church on Sabbath—and he loved it. He espe-
cially enjoyed the stories about Jesus. He eagerly told his father what he
was learning there.
   Samuel’s family worshiped traditional gods of wood and stone, and his
father worried that Samuel was becoming a Christian. He told Samuel to
stay away from the church. But Samuel had learned to love God and did
not want to worship the family’s idols. When he refused, his father again
threatened to beat him.
   He forced Samuel to go with him to the family farm on Sabbath. Samuel
was still quite young and did not know what to do, so he asked the church
members to pray for him.
   When Samuel told the pastor the problems he faced, the pastor visited
Samuel’s father, who reluctantly agreed to allow Samuel to attend Sabbath
services, provided he returned home after church and went directly to the
farm to work.
   Samuel thanked his father for working out a compromise. Samuel was
glad that he could spend at least part of the day worshiping God. He stud-
ied at the Adventist school and attended the Adventist church, learning all
he could about Christianity.
   As he neared completion of elementary school, he dreamed of studying
at the Adventist boarding school in the city thirty miles from home. He
knew that his father did not have the money to pay his school fees in such
a school. All he could do was pray.

        LESSON            12 *December 16-22
      From Prison Cell to
      Palace


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 37:2–41:40.
Memory Text: “There is none greater in this house than I; nei-
      ther hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou
      art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin
      against God?” (Genesis 39:9).
              he story of Jacob continues, with twists and turns that, again,

      T       contrast the depravity of humanity with the goodness and
              mercy of God.
         Genesis 34 tells of the rape of Jacob’s daughter Dinah by a local
      ruler and the subsequent massacre of all the city’s males by two of
      Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi. Jacob, fearing reprisal, flees and
      returns to Bethel (Genesis 35), where, despite all these horrendous
      events, the Lord again appears to him and reaffirms the covenant
      promises: “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and
      a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy
      loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give
      it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land” (vss. 11, 12).
         The rest of Genesis 35 deals with the birth of Benjamin and the death
      of Rachel. Mention is also made of Reuben, who “lay with Bilhah his
      father’s concubine” (vs. 22). The chapter ends with Jacob reuniting
      with Isaac, 180 years old, who dies and is buried by his two sons.
         Genesis 36 covers the genealogy of Esau, the part of the family that,
      basically, fades from the immediate scene. Scripture then resumes
      (Genesis 37) with Jacob and his “chosen” seed.
         A lesson in all this?
         If, amid so much sin, God can nevertheless fulfill His will, imagine
      what would happen if all those who profess His name actually obeyed
      Him as He asks.

     The Dreamer

     1 Why did Joseph’s brothers hate him so much?

     2 How did Joseph aggravate the situation?

     5 Look back over Jacob’s life. In what ways might he have
     brought this tragedy upon himself by his past actions and mis-
     takes?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        However horrific this story, considering the background of this fam-
     ily, it shouldn’t be all that surprising. Jealousy, violence, and deceit
     marked these people in one way or another from the earliest days. And
     these boys—though raised by a father who worshiped the true God,
     who even received special revelations from God—showed that they
     themselves didn’t know God, nor had they experienced the conversion
     of heart that’s essential for all who truly want to serve Him.

      Look at how far uncontrolled sin (in this case jealousy) took
      these people. What message should this story have for each of us
      regarding where sin, unless dealt with, can lead?

                                                                         97

      Sin With the Canaanites
Read Genesis 38. What is the essence of this story? What does it tell
      us about the character of Judah?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        For some reason the story of Genesis 38 interrupts the Joseph story.
      Perhaps, if nothing else, the Lord wanted to contrast the immorality of
      Joseph’s betrayer, Judah, with the moral character of the betrayed,
      Joseph.
        Maybe even more important, Genesis 38 also helps us understand
      “that the sons of Jacob, forgetting the sacred vocation of their race,
      were in danger of perishing in the sins of Canaan. Had not God in
      mercy interposed to bring about the removal of the whole house of
      Jacob to Egypt, the chosen race might have succumbed to the cor-
      rupting influence of Canaanite customs. Thus, chapter 38 is an inte-
      gral part of the early history of Israel.”—The SDA Bible Commentary,
      vol. 1, p. 434.

However sinful Judah’s actions were, how does he, even amid all
      this, show some moral fiber? See vs. 26; see also Gen. 37:26.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        After being discovered, Judah could do little but admit his guilt.
      Again, as in the plot against Joseph, he revealed a spirit of fair play
      and sincerity beneath his sometimes scandalous and corrupt conduct.
      His frank confession, his subsequent treatment of Tamar, and his spe-
      cial place in the ancestral line of Christ (Gen. 49:10) indicate a thor-
      ough reform on his part. A character more excellent than that of his
      older brothers qualified him for the leadership of the family and his
      posterity for leadership in Israel (see Gen. 49:3, 4, 8-10).

       Why must we be so careful in not passing judgment upon people?
       Matt. 7:1. How can we differentiate between judging actions and
       judging people? Why is that distinction so important?

               T UESDAY December 19

      Joseph in Egypt               (Genesis 39)

        The caravan holding Joseph captive passed the hills where Jacob’s
      tents stood. For a time the teenager “gave himself up to uncontrolled
      grief and terror.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 213.
      However, Joseph, remembering Jacob’s stories about God’s love and
      constancy shown to Abraham, Isaac, and him, decided to trust the
      Lord and act as a citizen of the kingdom of heaven. With Joseph’s
      descent into Egypt, divine Providence prepared the way for the deliv-
      erance of Jacob’s family and for the foreign domination that
      Abraham’s children were to experience until the sin of the Amorites in
      Canaan had reached its full measure (Gen. 15:13-16). It begins an
      incredible story of what the Lord can do through someone who,
      despite all odds, seeks to remain faithful to Him.

Considering the little that was revealed about Joseph before, not
      to mention the character of his family, what, if anything, was there
      from Joseph’s past that would indicate he would be so faithful to
      the Lord? What lessons can we learn from the answer?


         Considering, too, the problems with lust shown by other family
      members (Gen. 35:22; 38:16, 18), not to mention the common prac-
      tice of polygamy (which no doubt fed the lower passions), Joseph’s
      fortitude amid the constant badgering by the master’s wife is a power-
      ful testimony to his faith and character.

Here’s Joseph, unjustly sold into slavery, then, unjustly, thrown into
      prison. Yet, three times Genesis 39 states that “the Lord was with”
      him. How are we to understand what that means? How could God
      be “with” him when so many bad things were happening to him?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        One thing is clear: Problems and trials are no indication that God
      has forsaken anyone. Joseph was unable to understand the providence
      of God; he couldn’t see then what we can see so clearly now. Of
      course, from his perspective none of this made sense; he was, never-
      theless, determined to remain faithful anyway.

       What lessons about trusting God, despite outward appearances,
       can you learn from this story?



                                                                        99
         W EDNESDAY December 20

      The Cupbearer and the Baker                               (Genesis 40)

        Both the baker and the cupbearer were high-ranking officials at
      Pharaoh’s court. (Compare Neh. 1:11.) They had themselves been
      thrown into jail (they may have been accused of plotting to overthrow
      Pharaoh) and had been placed under Joseph’s care.

What further light do verses 6-8 shed upon Joseph’s character and
      disposition?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Even here, in jail, Joseph not only sought to help others but wit-
      nessed for the Lord, as well (see vs. 8), giving God glory for the inter-
      pretation of the dreams.

Despite Joseph’s “success” in the prison and his faithfulness to
      God, what does Joseph say that shows just how keenly aware he is
      of the unjust treatment he has faced and how badly he wanted to
      get out of that jail?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Regardless of his faith, Joseph still sought human help in securing
      his own release. Again, not knowing the future, not knowing the
      Lord’s intentions, he did what he could to try to get out of his situa-
      tion. This is certainly human and understandable. Unfortunately, as
      the chapter shows, it didn’t work. Once released, the chief butler for-
      got all about Joseph. Of course, in fairness to the chief butler, what
      could he have said: “Hey, Pharaoh, there’s a Hebrew in the dungeon
      who’s good at interpreting dreams; why don’t you let him out”? And
      as we’ll see in Genesis 41, he did eventually make mention of Joseph
      when the time was right. Until then, Joseph had to struggle with doubt
      and discouragement as he sat for two more years in that jail.

       No doubt Joseph’s disappointment must have been bitter
       regarding his situation. How easily he could have given up all
       faith and hope. What do we do when we find ourselves, like
       Joseph, bitterly disappointed by events in our life? How can we
       maintain faith and hope amid such disappointments?

             T HURSDAY December 21

      Joseph’s Release                (Gen. 41:1-40)

        This chapter introduces us to a typical Egyptian setting. We read of
      cows cooling off as they stand half submerged in the river. Reed
      grasses are mentioned (Gen. 41:2, NIV). And Joseph shaves as he
      leaves prison (Semites are identifiable in Egyptian drawings because
      they wear beards). Because Egyptians regarded the Nile as the source
      of life, the portrayal of lean cows coming up from the river must have
      scared the Egyptians.

How does the chief butler finally come through for Joseph?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Notice also how Joseph, even after all these disappointments, still
      expressed his faith in the God of his fathers. This is seen in verse 16,
      where Joseph states so clearly that it was only through his God that he
      could interpret the dream. This is remarkable because, considering his
      circumstances, it would have been very easy for him to credit all this
      to himself in order to make himself look better before Pharaoh.
      Instead, we see again Joseph’s faith in action.

After Joseph interprets the dream, what does he say that, in another
      way, witnesses to his God?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         For Joseph, all the events he predicted were the result of the action
      of God. In other words, He saw the hand of the Lord in all that would
      take place. Again, his words show that he trusted in the sovereignty
      and the power of God, which certainly helps explain why he was able
      to keep his faith even while in jail.
         Notice, too, that after Joseph interpreted the dream, he started giv-
      ing the king advice about what to do, which included setting someone
      up to take charge of storing grain. What in the dream, at least as
      recorded in Scripture, could have been interpreted in that manner?
      Nothing. Perhaps Joseph, sensing an opening that could get him out of
      jail, was angling for the spot himself. All things considered, why not?
      It would be the human thing to do, even for a human who loved God
      and was faithful to Him.



                                                                         101

Further Study: “From the dungeon Joseph was exalted to be ruler
      over all the land of Egypt. It was a position of high honor, yet it was
      beset with difficulty and peril. One cannot stand upon a lofty height
      without danger. As the tempest leaves unharmed the lowly flower of the
      valley, while it uproots the stately tree upon the mountaintop, so those
      who have maintained their integrity in humble life may be dragged
      down to the pit by the temptations that assail worldly success and honor.
      But Joseph’s character bore the test alike of adversity and prosperity.
      The same fidelity to God was manifest when he stood in the palace of
      the Pharaohs as when in a prisoner’s cell. He was still a stranger in a
      heathen land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers of God; but he
      fully believed that the divine hand had directed his steps, and in constant
      reliance upon God he faithfully discharged the duties of his position.”
      —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 222.

Discussion Questions:
       ●
       1 In the lesson for this week, dreams and their interpretations
       played a big role in how God worked, because in this part of the
       ancient world, in that culture, dreams were considered omens
       from the various gods. Does God today work through dreams and
       interpretations as He did back then? Or might He do so more in
       one culture today than in another, where dreams and interpreta-
       tions aren’t taken as seriously? If the Joseph story were placed in
       a contemporary setting—say, in your own culture—how might
       the Lord have revealed Himself and His plans?

       ●
       2 Let class members who are willing talk about some of their
       own personal “Joseph” stories, accounts of painful experiences
       that, viewed from later on, revealed the amazing providence of
       God.

       ●
       3 Some people go through bitter experiences and come out
       stronger in faith; others have their faith destroyed. As a class, dis-
       cuss the question: What makes the difference between the two
       outcomes?

The Troublesome Boy, Part 2
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Samuel scored highest on the year-end exams and earned a scholarship to
the Adventist school. His proud father agreed he could go. But an uncle
warned Samuel’s father of the danger of letting Samuel study in a Christian
school. “He will wander from our religion. Better send him to the Islamic
school.”
   When Samuel learned that his father had changed his mind, he was dev-
astated. He objected, but his parents said he could study in the Islamic
school or stay in the government’s school in the village. Samuel chose the
poorly staffed government school.
   He studied hard and never gave up his dream to attend the Adventist
school. His faith grew stronger as he studied his Bible and prayed. When he
scored the highest marks on his exams, his father told Samuel he could
study at the Adventist school in the city.
   Samuel’s joy turned to sadness when his father fell sick and died. He knew
that his mother could not feed and educate the children alone. For two years
Samuel remained at home and worked to help feed and educate the younger
children. But he never gave up his dream of an education.
   One day some church leaders visited the village to hold meetings, and
Samuel translated for them. When the leaders learned why Samuel was not
in school, they offered him a partial scholarship to study. But his family
could not afford to pay the remainder.
   Undaunted, Samuel visited the Adventist secondary school in the city and
found someone who would sponsor him to study. At last Samuel’s dream
would come true!
   Samuel’s mother saw how God was answering her son’s prayers and pro-
viding for him. When Samuel returned home from school, Samuel talked to
her about God, and she listened. Soon Samuel’s mother gave her life to Jesus.
   Samuel’s mother regrets that she did not realize earlier the great truths her
son had discovered. “If I had known,” she says, “I could have raised my chil-
dren differently.” But she faithfully brings the youngest children to church
with her.
   Samuel feels responsible to help his brothers find God. “I want us to be
together in heaven,” he says simply. “I want to spread God’s love to every-
one in our village.”
   Our mission offerings helped establish the school and church in Samuel’s
village. Many who have found Christ through these institutions will say
Thank you in heaven.

        LESSON            13 *December 23-29
      The End of the
      Beginning


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 41:41–50:26.
Memory Text: “God sent me before you to preserve a posterity
      for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance”
      (Genesis 45:7, NKJV).

                 hat is involved here is that in world history something else

      W          results from the actions of men than what they intend and
                 achieve, something else than what they know or want. They
      accomplish their interest; but something else is accomplished which was
      implied in it, but which was not in the consciousness and the intention of
      the actors.”—G. W. F. Hegel, “The Philosophy of History”; in The
      Philosophy of Hegel (New York: The Modern Library, 1954), pp. 16, 17.
         This week, as we come to the end of the beginning, we can see
      something of the principle stated above unfold. Despite the best, or
      the worst, of human intentions; despite what seems to be deceit, dis-
      appointment, sin, and disaster, “something else results from the
      actions of men than what they intend and achieve.” That “something,”
      of course, is the Lord working out His divine plan in human history.
         Because most of us know the story and how it ends, the providence
      revealed in the pages of Genesis doesn’t take us by surprise. For those
      involved in the story itself, however, it took an incredible amount of
      faith to believe that God would work it all out as promised, especially
      in some dire circumstances. No wonder Hebrews 11 says “by faith
      Abraham,” “by faith Isaac,” “by faith Sarah,” “by faith Jacob.” This was
      a faith that trusted in what was not fully seen or completely understood,
      a faith that had to lean only on the promise of God and nothing else.
         Sound familiar?

      Providence Unfolds                    (Gen. 41:41–42:23)

        Overnight Joseph went from being a slave in prison to the second-
      highest leader in Egypt. Now, though, a whole new set of challenges
      would await him.

Read Genesis 41:45. What great new potential challenge did this pose
      to Joseph’s faith and fidelity to God? See also 1 Kings 11:1.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Genesis 41:50-52 reveal Joseph settling into his new existence. The
      names Joseph gave his two sons reflect his own experience. The name
      Manasseh is related to the Hebrew verb “make to forget” and reflects
      the thought that his firstborn boy helped his father to forget the cruel
      past. Ephraim, the second son’s name, seems to mean “twice fruitful”
      and represented Joseph’s joyous feelings and the opening of a new
      chapter in his life.
         As we read the rest of Genesis 41 and the first 17 verses of Genesis
      42, we can see the providence of God unfolding. We see the steps
      leading to the fulfillment of Jacob’s dreams way back in Genesis 37.
      The dreamer’s dreams (Gen. 37:19) were soon coming to fruition in a
      manner that only the sovereign Lord could have arranged. This story
      is an amazing testimony to the power of God to fulfill what He says
      He will do in ways that far transcend our human understanding. The
      famine driving his brothers into his hands was, clearly, the Lord work-
      ing out His will.

What words do the brothers speak among themselves that show the
      guilt they harbored even after all these years? Gen. 42:21-23.

        The great suffering of their father over the loss of Joseph constantly
      brought before these brothers the gravity of their sin. Even worse was
      the fact that they couldn’t tell their father the truth, that Joseph wasn’t
      even dead. Little did they realize the grief that they would bring upon
      themselves and their family by their actions.

       If you are making any major decisions soon, take the time to
       weigh all the possible consequences. Why is it so important to
       make sure any decision you make doesn’t violate any principles
       that God has revealed in His Word?

      Joseph and His Brothers                       (Genesis 42, 43)

        Joseph’s ploy with his brothers showed that he was trying to teach
      them a lesson, as well as learn more about his own family.

Notice the reaction of the brothers at finding the money in their
      sacks (Gen. 42:24-28). What does it signify about their faith and
      understanding of God?

Read verses 36-38. What does this tell us about the character of
      Reuben?
      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________
        “During the years since Joseph had been separated from his broth-
      ers, these sons of Jacob had changed in character. Envious, turbulent,
      deceptive, cruel, and revengeful they had been; but now, when tested
      by adversity, they were shown to be unselfish, true to one another,
      devoted to their father, and, themselves middle-aged men, subject to
      his authority.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 225.
        Jacob’s response to Reuben’s offer helped reveal the pain he had
      suffered at the loss of Joseph. Only when the famine got so severe that
      he had no choice (Gen. 43:8) did he agree to let his youngest son go
      back with them.

What was Joseph’s purpose in making the feast in Genesis 43:31-34?
      _______________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________
        Much to their astonishment, Joseph sat his brothers down in the
      order of their birth, giving the youngest, Benjamin, the most food. He
      did this in order to “ascertain if the youngest brother was regarded
      with the envy and hatred that had been manifested toward him.”
      —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 228. The fact that they
      ate and drank and were merry with him (Gen. 43:34) showed Joseph
      that they, indeed, had changed.

       No doubt a great deal of suffering changed those brothers from
       what they once were to what they had become. How has suffer-
       ing worked in your own life? What changes has it wrought in
       you? How can God use suffering to bring about something posi-
       tive in someone?

     Family Reunion                  (Genesis 44–47)

       Joseph still wasn’t done. The final test came (Genesis 44). Judah’s
     confession and willingness to give himself instead of his brother, all
     for the good of his father, proved to him that his brothers were new
     men. It was only then that Joseph revealed his identity.

Read the words of Joseph to his brothers (Gen. 45:1-13). What does
     he say to show that his faith had, even after all these years,
     remained intact?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Joseph’s faith in God during the dark years was now especially
     rewarded. What he couldn’t see before suddenly became clear to him.
     God had worked it out in ways that he couldn’t have imagined. There’s a
     good lesson here for all of us. If we seek to stay faithful, regardless of
     our circumstances, God will work things out in the end, even if it’s at the
     very end (Rev. 21:1).
       The rest of Genesis 45 deals with the preparations to get the whole
     family together once again; in Genesis 46, Jacob, on hearing about
     Joseph, begins the long journey to Egypt. On the way he stops at
     Beersheba, where his grandfather Abraham had worshiped and his father
     had erected an altar subsequent to a divine repetition of the covenant
     blessings (Gen. 21:33, 26:23-25). As Jacob sacrifices and renews his
     covenant commitment to the God of his father, Isaac, the Lord reassures
     him of the covenant promises made at Bethel, with the added detail that
     Jacob’s family would grow into nationhood in Egypt (Gen. 46:1-4).

       After Jacob and his family reached Egypt, a glad reunion took
     place (vss. 29, 30). Why did Joseph want his family to tell the
     Egyptians that they were shepherds, an occupation loathsome to
     Egyptians? (vss. 31–34).
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Though the text doesn’t say explicitly, Joseph must have known the
     corrupting influence of Egypt. This way, by keeping them separated
     from the Egyptians, he sought to protect the spiritual integrity of his
     extended family. Obviously, Joseph knew something of their special
     calling. No doubt, the incredible unfolding of events that brought him
     and his family together again only affirmed for him the reality of that
     calling.
                                                                           107

      The Patriarchal Blessings                          (Gen. 47:28–49:28)

         After spending 17 happy years in Egypt surrounded by those dear-
      est to him, Jacob felt death approaching. He called his sons to him for
      a last farewell.

Go back over the promises given to Jacob by God over the years (Gen.
      28:12-15, 35:9-15, 46:2-4). Given the conditions and circum-
      stances that surrounded him now, why should it have been easy for
      him to believe that the Lord would fulfill His promises? See also
      Gen. 46:26, 47:27.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         As with Joseph, Jacob probably for the first time was able to see,
      from a human perspective, how God had been able to work out all that
      He promised. No doubt this reality gave the old man solace in his old
      age.
         Before his death Jacob, through divine inspiration, revealed the
      future of his descendants (Genesis 49). The power of God constrained
      him to declare the truth, however painful to himself. Jacob withdrew
      the rights of the firstborn from Reuben and uttered a curse for the
      crime of Levi and Simeon. The later history of Levi’s family illustrates
      how a curse can be turned into a blessing.
         God’s Word ever reveals both the virtues and vices, the failures and
      successes, of humans. The pages of Scripture are realistic and conceal
      neither the faults of its most revered and admired heroes nor their vic-
      tories attained through the power of God. God’s men and women are
      depicted as “subject to like passions as we are” (James 5:17; see also
      Acts 14:15).
         Jacob revealed the corporate destiny of each tribal line. Yet, each
      line was composed of individuals with free will and free choice, espe-
      cially in regard to their relationship with God, just as each of us experi-
      ences free will, as well. Whatever predictions God makes about
      nations and their future aren’t the same as predestinating individuals
      to either salvation or damnation. God’s foreknowledge of our choice
      isn’t the same as predetermining those choices.

       “Character,” it has been said, “is destiny.” How do you under-
       stand that idea? How does your own character influence deci-
       sions you make? What character changes would you like to see
       in your own life?

      The End of the Beginning                          (Gen. 49:29–50:26)

         Genesis 50 is, in a sense, the end of the beginning. The book went
      from Creation to the Fall to the Flood to the covenant promises made
      to Abraham and to his seed. However difficult it was, at times, to see
      how these promises ever could be fulfilled, by the time the book ends
      we can see the groundwork set for everything that God had promised:
      the children of Abraham as a great nation living as “a stranger in a
      land that is not theirs” (Gen. 15:13), a people who will one day be
      called out of Egypt in order that “all the nations of the earth [shall] be
      blessed” in them (Gen. 22:18).

Read Genesis 50. What very human reaction do we see in Joseph’s
      brothers?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Their plea for forgiveness was, of course, unnecessary. Joseph had,
      obviously, forgiven them a long time ago. Now, finally, they could see
      just how genuine that forgiveness was. We see here, again, another
      example of the character and integrity of Joseph. In this way he func-
      tions as a “type” of Christ, forgiving them for what many would deem
      unforgivable.

Read carefully Joseph’s response to his brothers (vss. 19, 20). How,
      in that response, do we see what is, in many ways, a key theme not
      only of Genesis but of the whole Bible? What great principle is
      expressed here? What hope should we draw from it?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         However difficult it often is for us to see it from our perspective
      (just as it was difficult for Abraham on Moriah or Joseph in the dun-
      geon), God is working out His plans to bring out “good” and to “save
      much people alive” (vs. 20). Whoever we are, whatever our circum-
      stances, we must remember that the same God revealed in Genesis is
      the same God revealed in Revelation, a book unfolding in our times
      and telling our story (Rev. 12:17) as Genesis did the patriarchs.
         Finally, Genesis began with a miracle, the miracle of Creation. And
      just as it took a miracle to create this world, it will take a miracle to
      save it. We’ve seen that miracle alluded to, first in Genesis 3:15 then
      in Genesis 22—the miracle of Jesus crucified, resurrected, and com-
      ing again.
                                                                           109

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
      pp. 224–240; The SDA Bible Commentary, comments on Genesis
      41:41–50:26.

         “Jacob had sinned, and had deeply suffered. Many years of toil,
      care, and sorrow had been his since the day when his great sin caused
      him to flee from his father’s tents. A homeless fugitive, separated from
      his mother, whom he never saw again; laboring seven years for her
      whom he loved, only to be basely cheated; toiling twenty years in the
      service of a covetous and grasping kinsman; seeing his wealth increas-
      ing, and sons rising around him, but finding little joy in the con-
      tentious and divided household; distressed by his daughter’s shame, by
      her brothers’ revenge, by the death of Rachel, by the unnatural crime
      of Reuben, by Judah’s sin, by the cruel deception and malice practiced
      toward Joseph—how long and dark is the catalogue of evils spread out
      to view! Again and again he had reaped the fruit of that first wrong
      deed. Over and over he saw repeated among his sons the sins of which
      he himself had been guilty. But bitter as had been the discipline, it had
      accomplished its work. The chastening, though grievous, had yielded
      ‘the peaceable fruit of righteousness.’ Hebrews 12:11.”—Ellen G.
      White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 237.

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 As a class, discuss this question: If there is one major theme
       that you could pull from the book of Genesis that can apply to
       our lives today, what would that be?

       ●2 Much of the suffering we’ve seen here was brought upon peo-
       ple by their own actions, just as much of the suffering we see
       today is, as well. Does that make any difference in regard to how
       we should treat those people and seek to help them? Justify your
       answer.

       ●3 Ask class members to choose a story from Genesis that meant
       the most to them in terms of giving them some practical truth
       that helped them deal with whatever personal situations they
       were facing.

The Real Prize
by LYNN ROBERT
   When my brother-in-law, Ruphino, joined the Adventist Church, we were
not too happy. We accused him of being the antichrist and of following a
false prophet. Ruphino tried to share his new beliefs with us, but we refused
to listen. Even Ruphino’s wife did not want to hear about this new religion.
We were happy with our own church.
   Then our daughter, Leilei, started attending church with her uncle
Ruphino. We tried to discourage her, but she was determined.
   One day Ruphino told us that the church was planning evangelistic meet-
ings. We were ready with all sorts of excuses to avoid going with Ruphino.
But Ruphino surprised us and said, “If I take ten people to the meetings, I
get a really great prize, a study Bible.” He invited me first then my husband,
Rudy. Rudy misunderstood what Ruphino said and thought that he would
win a prize—maybe even some money—if he went with Ruphino. So he
agreed to go.
   Then Rudy told the whole family to go—even the woman who was living
with us! He invited others until ten people agreed to go. When Ruphino
stood with his guests to accept his prize Bible, Rudy forgot about the money
he thought he was going to win.
   The speaker’s message fascinated me. He talked about some beasts com-
ing out of water and the antichrist. His topic was getting really interesting
when he stopped. “If you want to know who this antichrist is, come back
tomorrow,” he said. We all wanted to know more, so we all returned the next
night. Pieces of information fell into place, and we realized we had known
pieces of the puzzle, but we had not put them together correctly.
   When the pastor distributed cards asking people to check the appropriate
boxes, Rudy checked everything but the “I want to be baptized” box. I asked
him why, and he said, “I was born into my church, and I will die in that
church.” I knew that he meant it.
   The pastor had said something that really impressed me. “If you see the
light, walk in the light.” I was seeing the truth, and I realized that I had to
follow that light or risk being lost. But what about my husband?
                                      When the meetings ended, the pastor
                                   invited us to join God’s remnant church.
                                   We all agreed, even Rudy. Six of us were
                                   baptized together, and others joined God’s
                                   family later.
                                      We are evidence that mission offerings
                                   win souls. Thank you for giving.

2007    Bible study guide for the first quarter

         James W. Zackrison is the principal contributor for this quarter’s
       Bible study guide, Ecclesiastes. Unlike other books in Scripture,
       which often begin with a strong affirmation about God (“The Word
       of the Lord to . . .”), Ecclesiastes commences with a cry about the
       meaninglessness of life. “Vanities of vanities . . . all is vanity.” This
       opening sounds more like modern secular writers than a prophet of
       Yahweh. Nevertheless, as Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we
       believe that Ecclesiastes was placed in the canon of Scripture,
       because God has in it a message for us: How cynical, bitter, and
       empty life is apart from the knowledge of Him!

       how close to God we walk, in the end we are fallen creatures with
