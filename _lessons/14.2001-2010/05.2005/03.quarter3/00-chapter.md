    INTRODUCTION



Experiencing Jesus Christ
as Lord
Jesus Christ is Lord of all. And that’s because He is the
Creator of all: “All things were made by him; and without
him was not any thing made that was made” (John 1:3). Thus,
He is Lord of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Though not
everyone currently recognizes Him as Lord, the day is coming when
every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
  When Jesus Christ first came to this earth, He “made Himself of
no reputation, taking the form of a servant, and coming in the like-
ness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled
Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death
of the cross” (Phil. 2:7, 8, NKJV). His second coming will be with
power and great glory. “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every
eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds
of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen” (Rev. 1:7).
   To those who have received Him as Savior and Lord, the second
coming of Jesus will be a time of rejoicing! We will exclaim,
“ ‘Behold, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save
us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and
rejoice in His salvation’ ” (Isa. 25:9, NKJV).
   Every tongue will then confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, but for
many it will be eternally too late to make a saving confession. For
the wicked, confession that Jesus Christ is Lord is simply a recogni-
tion of an undeniable truth; it’s not a heartfelt surrender to His love
and divine authority.
   The Word of God appeals to us to accept the grace of God so freely
given through Jesus. Now is the accepted time. Jesus Christ has paid
the penalty for our sins. We can, at this moment, stand perfect in His
righteousness, which is freely bestowed upon every willing sinner,
“even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely
by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom.
3:22-24). Or, as Ellen White said in Steps to Christ: “Since we are
2
sinful, unholy, we cannot perfectly obey the holy law. We have no
righteousness of our own with which to meet the claims of the law of
God. But Christ has made a way of escape for us. He lived on earth
amid trials and temptations such as we have to meet. He lived a sin-
less life. He died for us, and now He offers to take our sins and give
us His righteousness. If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as
your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you
are accounted righteous.
Christ’s character stands in We must claim Jesus,
place of your character, and
you are accepted before
                                not only as our Savior
God just as if you had not but as our Lord.
sinned.”—Page 62.
  When we receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, we not only
confess Him as Lord of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people;
we also confess Him as Lord of every aspect of our lives. As
Christians, it’s our duty, out of love for God, to show that we truly
believe in that Lordship. We do this not just by confessing He is
Lord of our lives but by allowing Him to rule there, as well.
  In this series of lessons, we will consider what it means to expe-
rience Jesus Christ as Lord in every aspect of our existence. It’s not
enough to claim Jesus just as our Savior; we must claim Him as our
Lord, as well. Because He’s our Lord, He was able to be our Savior.
And nothing reveals more that we have recognized Him as Savior
than how we live, and how we live depends upon the degree in
which we allow Him to be Lord of our lives.
  Let’s now take a look at what it means to experience Jesus as the
Lord of our lives.

          LESSON            1       * June 25–Ju ly 1


      Our Lord and Savior
      Jesus Christ


      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 1:26-38, John 1:1-18,
      Acts 9:1-19, Rom. 3:9-26.

Memory Text: “Then the angel said to them,‘Do not be afraid,
      for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to
      all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a
      Savior, who is Christ the Lord’ ” (Luke 2:10, 11, NKJV).

Key Thought: The New Testament calls us to receive Jesus,both
      as Savior and Lord.

            avior and Lord. Many Christians today are looking for a “no

      S     strings attached” Savior. They want deliverance without obliga-
            tion. They may profess the name of Christian but end up with a
      savior of their own making. Though it is true an angel counseled
      Joseph to call the miracle Child “ ‘Jesus, for He will save His people
      from their sins’ ” (Matt. 1:21, NKJV), an angel also announced to the
      shepherds on the hills near Bethlehem that “ ‘there is born to you this
      day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord’ ” (Luke 2:11,
      NKJV).
         More New Testament texts refer to Jesus as Lord than as Savior. It
      is impossible to receive Jesus as Savior and reject Him as Lord. Peter
      refers to Jesus as “our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 1:11,
      NKJV), and Paul encourages us to look for “the Savior, the Lord Jesus
      Christ” (Phil. 3:20, NKJV). This week we will explore both the impor-
      tance and the consequences of the crucial question: Have you received
      Jesus, both as Savior and Lord?

     Our Need for a Savior                     (Rom. 3:9-26).

       The apostle Paul warns the Romans that “the wrath of God is
     revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
     men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness” (Rom. 1:18, NKJV).
     Rebellion against the will of God and the Word of God has conse-
     quences. “The wages of sin is death” (Rom. 6:23, NKJV).

Read Romans 3:9-26.What important point is Paul emphasizing? (If
     you have never read Paul’s epistle to the Romans, you may want
     to begin with Romans 1:1 in order to follow his whole argument.)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Have you noticed the human tendency to compare ourselves with
     others in order to make ourselves look good? We point to others who
     are worse sinners than ourselves, forgetting that we ourselves also
     stand condemned. Even the act of self-justification is an evidence of
     our fallen condition. The apostle Paul leaves no room for excuses. All
     have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. We all stand con-
     demned before a holy God. This is not hard to see. All we have to do
     is look at the world around us, and we see so much evidence of our
     sinfulness.

What are some of the evidences you see of human sinfulness? How far
     do you have to look to see them?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       There’s no question: Sin and the results of sin exist all around us.
     And in us. We don’t have to point the finger at others; we can find all
     the evidence of sin by looking within ourselves. And that was part of
     Paul’s point. Every mouth is stopped before God, including our own!

      Look at your own life. Do you see anything within yourself that
      could commend you to God? Why is looking at yourself the best
      way to realize there is no hope, unless hope comes from a gra-
      cious, merciful, and forgiving God?




                                                                           7

     Heaven’s Greatest Gift (Luke 1:26-38, John 1:1-18).
       Sunday’s lesson left us with the realization that, unless there was
     divine intervention in our behalf, we would have no hope. The good
     news, of course, is that God has intervened in our behalf: through
     Jesus Christ.
       While many followers of other world religions admire Jesus Christ
     as a holy prophet or a great teacher, few recognize the true signifi-
     cance of Jesus Christ’s entrance into humanity.

What message did the angel Gabriel deliver to Mary, the mother of
     Jesus, about the identity of the Child she would conceive? Luke
     1:26-35.


        The New Testament writers boldly declare that Jesus Christ was
     conceived by the supernatural inter vention of the Holy Spirit of God.
     “ ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest
     will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born
     will be called the Son of God’ ” (Luke 1:35, NKJV). Born of a human
     mother, Jesus could call only God His real Father. He is Son of God
     and Son of man.

Consider the testimony of the apostle John at the beginning of his
     Gospel record. What important message does he convey about
     Jesus Christ? John 1:1-18.


       Jesus Christ is more than a holy prophet. He is more than a great
     teacher. He is the Word made flesh. He is God’s thoughts made audi-
     ble. One with the Father from eternity past, the only begotten of the
     Father became human flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. He is
     Immanuel, God with us, and yet He was “with us”—not in the thun-
     der and lightning and clouds of Sinai—but as one of us; that is, He
     was as fully human as we are. What an amazing condescension for
     Him who “was in the beginning with God”!

      It has been said a desperate situation calls for desperate meas-
      ures.What should it tell us about what sin has done to us that it
      would require God Himself becoming a human being and then
      dying in order to save us from the penalty of sin? How should
      this realization help us trust that, however desperate our own
      personal situation, the God who would do this is able to save us
      from whatever challenges we face?

     God’s Perfect Plan (Isa. 53:3-7).
       When Jesus came to the river Jordan to be baptized, John the Baptist
     exclaimed, “ ‘Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the
     world!’ ” (John 1:29, NKJV). In this brief declaration, John the Baptist
     provided a succinct summary of God’s perfect plan of salvation. Jesus
     Christ was the Lamb of God.

Review the following portions of Scripture. How do these passages
     help you to understand God’s perfect plan of salvation?

     Gen. 22:6-14:
     ____________________________________________________________________


     Isa. 53:4-7:
     ____________________________________________________________________


     Rev.
     _____5:1-14:
          _______________________________________________________________

        We have all gone astray. We have all sinned and fallen short of the
     glory of God. And the wages of that sin is death. We all deserve to die.
     But Jesus Christ, the Son of God, willingly took our punishment upon
     Himself. “He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for
     our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His
     stripes we are healed” (Isa. 53:5, NKJV).
        When Jesus Christ died on the cross, He was laying down His life as
     the Lamb of God. He was fulfilling God’s perfect plan of salvation in
     every detail. “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures” (1 Cor.
     15:3, NKJV). “He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we
     might become the righteousness of God in Him” (2 Cor. 5:21, NKJV).

      “Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as
      He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had
      no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in
      which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours,
      that we might receive the life which was His. ‘With His stripes
      we are healed.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 25.
      Read this famous quote aloud, but put yourself in there:
      “Christ was treated as I deserve, that I might be treated as He
      deserves. . . .” Read it aloud over and over until the wonderful
      truths it portrays hit home and you realize—for yourself—
      what Christ has done for you.




                                                                               9
        W E D N E S D AY June 29

     Responding to God’s Grace (1 Cor. 1:18-31).
       Our gracious heavenly Father has made a perfect provision for
     everyone to be saved. We who were dead in our sins can be made alive
     in Christ Jesus. The apostle Paul proclaimed the good news: “If you
     confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that
     God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved” (Rom. 10:9,
     NKJV). So, when Paul and Silas were asked by the Philippian jailer
     what he needed to do in order to be saved, their answer was simple and
     to the point: “ ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be
     saved, you and your household’ ” (Acts 16:31, NKJV). Salvation is
     available for all who accept God’s perfect plan. When we believe on
     the Lord Jesus Christ, we will be saved.
       Unfortunately, not everyone is willing to accept God’s perfect plan.
     Some view the message of the Cross and blood atonement as a rem-
     nant from humanity’s barbaric past. Others would rather trust in their
     own wisdom rather than the wisdom of God.

How does the apostle Paul describe the varying responses to God’s
     perfect plan of salvation? 1 Cor. 1:18-31. How are some of these
     same responses manifested today by those who hear the gospel?


        In apostolic times, there were some who viewed the death of Jesus
     Christ on the cross as a scandal, a stumbling block. How could
     Someone who was executed as a criminal be the Messiah? Others
     viewed the message of the Cross as foolishness. How could one Man’s
     death affect the destiny of the human race? Both groups rejected
     God’s perfect plan of salvation and scorned His grace, some because
     it went against their own personal religious views, others because it
     just didn’t seem reasonable, logical, and “scientific.” However, some
     embraced the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ. They
     accepted the death of Christ for their sins as the power of God and the
     wisdom of God. In spite of opposition to the gospel, the apostle Paul
     declared, “I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power
     of God to salvation for everyone who believes” (Rom. 1:16, NKJV).

      What has your own response been to the gospel? Go back over
      your own experience with Jesus and your response to His saving
      grace. What, more than anything else, moved you to accept His
      salvation? Or are you still making excuses?

      Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord (Acts 9:1-19).
         The apostle John records the sad news that Jesus Christ “came to
      His own, and His own did not receive Him” (John 1:11, NKJV).
      Because He was not the Messiah they were looking for, many rejected
      God’s perfect plan for their salvation. But the apostle John also
      records the good news: “But as many as received Him, to them He
      gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe
      in His name” (John 1:12, NKJV). Many read this testimony and fail to
      grasp its true significance. When we accept God’s perfect plan of sal-
      vation through Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, we not only receive
      Jesus Christ as Savior. We receive Him as Lord.

Examine the account of Saul’s conversion and his interaction with
      Ananias, recorded in Acts 9:1-19. What are the implications for
      your own life when you receive Jesus as Savior and Lord?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        When Saul realized he was encountering the risen Christ, the first
      thing he said wasn’t “Lord, what do You want me to believe?” or
      “Lord, what do You want me to say?” but it was “Lord, what do You
      want me to do?” Saul, here, by calling Jesus “Lord,” recognized that
      because of who Jesus was, Saul needed to obey Him. And when the
      Lord said “ ‘Arise and go,’ ” Saul arose and went. We see the same
      response from Ananias. At first he argues with the Lord Jesus Christ,
      questioning His judgment. But when the Lord said “ ‘Go,’ ” Ananias
      went. The message is clear: When we confess Jesus Christ as Lord, we
      recognize His absolute authority over our lives.

What word of reproof did the Lord Jesus Christ give to those who con-
      fessed Him with their lips but not with their lives? Luke 6:46-49.

        When we receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, we will obey
      Him, and, as a result, our lives will be radically transformed. It’s in the
      doing, the obeying, and the living the life of faith that we are changed.

       If Christ were to suddenly appear to you, as He did to Saul,and
       you said “Lord, what do You want me to do?” what do you think
       He would say to you, and why?




                                                                              11

 Further Study: Read the Second Epistle of Peter. Notice the
     numerous references to the Lord Jesus Christ. This epistle begins and
     ends with references to Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.
       Think of some individuals in Scripture who struggled with the
     implications of accepting Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. Here are
     some examples:
       Nicodemus—John 3:1-21, 7:50-53, 19:39-42
       The rich young ruler—Matt. 19:16-26
       Zacchaeus—Luke 19:1-10
       Thomas—John 20:19-29
       As you look over these examples, what appears to be the reasons for
     their struggles? Are there any common elements to each situation?


Discussion Questions:
      ●1 How can we encourage one another to confess Jesus Christ as
      Lord in every aspect of our lives without sounding legalistic or
      judgmental? How can we be sure to avoid the trap of legalism as
      we seek to have Jesus rule in every area of our lives? Why is a
      proper understanding of salvation by faith alone the only way to
      protect yourself against legalism?

      ●
      2 As a class, what could you do to help members in your local
      church realize the importance of allowing Jesus to be Lord of
      their lives? In other words, what could you do to encourage mem-
      bers to make a total commitment to Jesus?

      ●
      3 What encouragement would you give to a friend who wants to
      experience salvation but who is afraid to totally surrender to
      Jesus Christ as Lord?

      ●4 Go around the classroom and ask each member to answer the
      following question, “What is the gospel?” After each person has
      a turn, analyze the answers. What are the differences and the
      similarities in the various views of the gospel?

Priska’s Tithe
Priska Chepkwony
   Priska lives in Kenya. Even before she became an Adventist, she was a
faithful tither.
   One day Priska placed her tithe in an envelope and wrapped it in plas-
tic. She asked her daughter to take the envelope to the church treasurer’s
home nearby.
   Priska’s daughter delivered the tithe to the treasurer’s house. But the
treasurer was not home, so the girl left the envelope with the treasurer’s
daughter, who placed it in a cupboard for safe keeping. But in the busy-
ness of life, the daughter forgot to tell her mother about the tithe.
   At the end of the month the treasurer was writing out tithe receipts and
noticed that Priska had no tithe. Knowing that Priska would never with-
hold her tithe, the treasurer asked Priska about it.
   Priska told the treasurer that her daughter had delivered the tithe to her
home and given it to the treasurer’s daughter, who had put it into a cup-
board for safe keeping. But the girl could not remember in which cup-
board she had placed the money.
   The treasurer searched for Priska’s tithe envelope but found nothing.
Feeling responsible for God’s funds, she determined to repay the missing
money herself. But Priska told her, “There is no need to replace God’s
money; it is God’s, and He will take care of it.”
   Several months passed, and the church prepared to host a district meet-
ing. The deaconesses cleaned the church, and members cleaned their
homes. The litter was gathered and burned. After all the trash had burned,
the ashes were spread out.
   At the bottom of the ashes lay a small packet wrapped in plastic. A child
found it and took it to the church treasurer. She opened it to find Priska’s
                              missing tithe and offerings. All of the money
                              was there; none of it had burned. The church
                              members rejoiced that God had protected His
                              tithe.
                                 Priska never doubted that God’s tithe would
                              one day appear. God protected that which was
                              set aside as His property.

      Lord of Our Priorities




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 2:24, Exod. 19:5, Job
      1:1-5, Rom. 3:24, Eph. 1:7.

Memory Text: “ ‘But seek first the kingdom of God and His
      righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you’ ”
      (Matthew 6:33, NKJV).

Key Thought: The Lord Jesus Christ does not ask to be first
      among equals in our lives. He asks to be first without equal.

              he radical claim of Jesus. Jesus asks us to give Him unrivaled

      T       first place in our lives. To all who would be His disciples, He
              says “ ‘If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and
      mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life
      also, he cannot be My disciple’ ” (Luke 14:26, NKJV).
         Obviously, this statement of Jesus cannot be taken literally. If we are
      called as followers of Jesus to love our enemies (Matt. 5:44), we
      should certainly love those closest to us, such as our immediate fam-
      ily. Jesus is not asking us to hate our family members; instead, using
      powerful and exaggerated imagery, He’s saying that we must give Him
      first place in our lives. He wants to be our top priority, the recipient of
      our highest devotion. After all, considering who He is—not only our
      Creator but the One who redeemed us with His own blood (see 1 Pet.
      1:18, 19)—we owe Him everything, and He’s asking us to acknowl-
      edge that debt by making Him first in our lives. How could we do any
      less?

        The whole idea of the Lord having priority in our lives is depend-
     ent upon who He is in contrast to who we are. It’s in the context of this
     relationship that we can understand why the Lord should be given
     complete priority over our priorities. The leader of one nation doesn’t
     have the moral or legal right to make rules for the citizens of another
     country, does he? The president of France, for instance, doesn’t have
     the authority to tell people living in Paraguay how they must live.
        The Lord, as our Creator, is the sovereign Ruler of the universe.
     Whether we acknowledge it or not, He has authority over us, in much
     the same way a ruler in a particular land has authority over the citi-
     zens of that country. Though the Lord has given us stewardship and
     responsibility over the things on the earth, whatever we possess, what-
     ever gifts we have, we have only because God first created these
     things and then gave them to us.
        It’s crucial to keep this realization before us because God does not
     force us to use, for His glory, the gifts He’s given us. He’s made us
     free, free to prioritize as we wish. We can acknowledge His claims
     over us, not just in words but in how we live and how we prioritize, or
     we can go our own way, doing what we want and, of course, reaping
     the sad results of our wrong choices.

      Whatever you have, whatever you are, dwell upon how every-
      thing comes from God. How should this realization help you
      understand how you should set your priorities?

                                                                           15

     Redeemer God
       “I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as
     a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee” (Isa.
     44:22).

       Yesterday’s lesson looked at the claims God has over us by virtue of
     the fact He is our Creator. In that sense, He is our Owner. And yet, in
     and of itself, in a fallen world, that might not be enough to get us to want
     to serve Him, to want to surrender our lives and priorities to Him. It
     might oblige us to, in the sense that someone working for his or her
     employer is obliged to work for that person. But God wants us to serve
     Him, not out of some cold, hard obligation but because we love Him for
     what He’s done for us, not just as our Creator but also as our Redeemer.

In your own mind, recall the situations where you did something for
     someone because you felt obliged to, as opposed to when you did
     something for someone because you really loved and appreciated
     this person.How does this contrast help you better understand the
     way the Lord wants us to relate to Him?


       The Bible makes it clear the Lord is not only our Creator but our
     Redeemer. Numerous verses talk about Jesus in the role of our
     Redeemer, of having done the work of redemption in our behalf.
     Indeed, it’s impossible to understand His death on the cross apart from
     the notion of redemption.

Read Romans 3:24; Galatians 3:13; Titus 2:14; 1 Peter 1:18,19. How
     do these verses about Christ’s work of redemption in our behalf
     help you want to serve the Lord and surrender your God-given
     gifts to Him?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The word for “redeem,” or “redemption,” both in the Old and New
     Testament, comes from various words that mean things like “to buy
     back,” “to ransom,” “to deliver.” These ideas convey the truths of what
     Jesus did for us. Thus, not only is He our Creator; He is our Redeemer.
     He ransomed us from the power and, ultimately, the final legal conse-
     quences of sin (see Rom. 6:23). When we begin to grasp what this
     redemption means for us personally, when we experience for our-
     selves the joy of freedom of this redemption, then it becomes so much
     easier to make Him the Lord of our priorities.

     The Example of the Lord Jesus Christ
       Doing His Father’s will was the number one priority of Jesus. His
     plan for life was simply this: To discover the Father’s will and do it.

Look up the following texts.What is being said in each case? What’s

     Jesus and the example of obedience He presents for us?

       “So utterly was Christ emptied of self that He made no plans for
     Himself. He accepted God’s plans for Him, and day by day the Father
     unfolded His plans. So should we depend upon God, that our lives
     may be the simple outworking of His will.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, p. 208.
       What a powerful example is Christ’s life of complete surrender that
     not only His deeds but His words were from the Father.

      Go back over the texts for today. Put the basic thoughts together
      and ask,What’s the message they have for me? What do I need
      to change in order to move better toward this ideal as personi-
      fied in Jesus?

                                                                         17

     First on Your Agenda (Luke 6:46).
What question does Jesus ask His hearers at the end of His Sermon
     on the Mount? Luke 6:46. How different would your life be if you
     did everything Jesus told you to do?


        Obedience is the ultimate evidence that we have accepted Jesus as
     Savior and Lord. His will becomes our will. His plans become our
     plans. As a loving response to His saving grace, we yield ourselves
     completely to Him as Lord of e very aspect of our lives.
        We must avoid at all costs the fatal delusion of calling Jesus “Lord”
     but failing to recognize His lordship over our lives as we plan our
     daily schedules. We can easily become preoccupied with working out
     our own agendas. Instead of asking the Lord to rule and overrule in
     every activity of our day, we ask God to bless the plans we have
     already made. Ellen White suggests a different strategy for those who
     have accepted Jesus as Savior and Lord: “Surrender all your plans to
     Him, to be carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate.
     Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God,
     and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of
     Christ.”—Steps to Christ, p. 70.

     First in Your Day (Ps. 5:1-3, Mark 1:35).
        Our Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated the importance of seeking God
     first in the day. Mark records that “in the morning, having risen a long
     while before daylight, He [Jesus] went out and departed to a solitary
     place; and there He prayed” (Mark 1:35, NKJV). “The early morning
     often found Him in some secluded place, meditating, searching the
     Scriptures, or in prayer. From these quiet hours He would return to His
     home to take up His duties again, and to give an example of patient
     toil.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 90.
        We would do well to follow the example of our Lord. While it is
     important to set the Lord always before us (see Ps. 16:8), it also is
     appropriate to set aside special times of prayer. David prayed in the
     morning, at noon, and in the evening (see Ps. 55:17). Daniel followed
     a similar practice (see Dan. 6:10).

Read the psalmist’s prayer in Psalm 5:1-3. Why do you think the
     morning is such an important time to especially focus our atten-
     tion on the Lord? What is it about the morning (or whenever you
     first wake up) that makes it such an important time to commune
     with God?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Most Christians agree in principle that it is important to make com-
     munion with the Lord the first priority of the day. However, many
     have difficulty putting this conviction into practice. Late-night activi-
     ties or early morning responsibilities seem to crowd out easily that
     special time of fellowship with the Lord. As a result, our time with
     God often becomes reactive, crying out to Him when things go wrong,
     rather than proactive, seeking Him first before we face any of the
     challenges of the day. Many seriously cripple their spiritual life
     because they don’t take that crucial time to pray, read the Bible, or
     meditate on the Word. In the same way that if you skip breakfast you
     can soon run out of physical fuel, by skipping morning devotion you
     can find the spiritual “fuel” lacking to meet the temptations the enemy
     is always trying to throw in your path (see 1 Pet. 5:8).

      What things are you letting interfere with a consistent morning
      devotional life? Why not, right now, prayerfully resolve in your
      heart to use this precious time when you begin your day to keep
      in communion with the Lord?



                                                                           19

Further Study: Think of individuals mentioned in Scripture who
     put God first in their lives and allowed Him to be the Lord of their pri-
     orities. For example, consider the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus.
     Read Luke 1:26-38. Notice her response to the claim of God.

        Note: The idea of yielding our lives under the authority of another
     is not a popular concept in the twenty-first centur y. People want to be
     the masters of their own destinies. They want to be in control.
     Christians have a different perspective. The One who calls us to live
     under His lordship is our loving Savior, who gave His life to redeem
     us. Under His lordship we find freedom, not bondage. We are sons
     and daughters, not slaves.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 How is it possible to follow the example of Jesus who “made no
      plans for Himself” but simply allowed the Father to direct His
      steps? Give some practical suggestions as to how that approach
      to life might be implemented. Share your ideas with the class.

      ●2 Look at two other important areas of your life, family, and
      finances.What are some practical ways we can acknowledge the
      lordship of Jesus in these two crucial areas?

      ●3 Look up as many texts as you can find that talk about Christ
      as the Sacrifice for our sins and then write down a paragraph
      summarizing what they are saying. As a class, have people read
      aloud what they wrote. How does this great news help motivate
      you to want to serve the Lord and surrender to Him all He’s
      given you? What greater motivation could we possibly have to do
      this?

God Is Faithful, part 1
Maria Tzenova
   My dreams were coming true; I was studying at the University of
Bulgaria. I was not yet a member of the church, but I understood the Bible
principles, and I believed. My parents were not believers, but I had shared
what I believe with them. My mother had visited the church, but my father
was not interested in this strange new religion.
   Then I learned that the required labs for my Latin class fell on Saturday.
I was determined to keep the Sabbath, so I decided to talk to the profes-
sor, a severe woman who seldom smiled. After the first class I approached
her and made my request to miss the labs.
   “No!” she shouted loudly. “If you do not attend the labs, you will fail
the class. And without this class you cannot major in English. So you
might as well leave the university now!” She turned and walked away,
leaving me standing alone.
   That afternoon I went to the train station to go home for the weekend. I
sat wrapped in my winter jacket, not so much from the cold as from fear
for my future, which looked as bleak as the sky outside. Fail the course?
Leave the university? Lose my dream? Never! I had worked too hard to get
this far.
   What would my parents say? They had been so proud of me. How would
I tell them that my faith in God, my religious convictions, would prevent
me from fulfilling my dream? My mother had just begun to accept my new
faith. If I left the university because of the Sabbath, what would she think
of my faith? Would her fragile faith crumble? Would mine?
   I decided not to tell my parents. Not yet. Then I had an idea. I would not
have classes on Sabbath forever. I could postpone my baptism until the
class ended. This seemed like a reasonable solution. But it did not bring
the comfort I had hoped.
   I knew the fourth commandment, but I wanted to understand what God
had in mind for me in this situation. I took out my New Testament and
prayed for guidance. Then I opened it to Galatians 4:9. “But now that you
know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning
back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved
by them . . . again?” (NIV). I closed the New Testament, knowing what I
had to do. It made no difference that I was not baptized; I would be faith-
ful to God, no matter what.
   The future looked bleak, but I had peace.
                                                       (continued next week)

      Lord of Our Thoughts




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 Cor. 2:16;
      2 Cor. 10:3-5; Eph. 6:10-18; Col. 3:1, 2.

Memory Text: “If then you were raised with Christ, seek those
      things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand
      of God.Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth”
      (Colossians 3:1, 2, NKJV).

Key Thought: The Lord Jesus Christ desires to renew our minds
      and be Lord of our thoughts. It is God’s intention that every
      thought be brought into captivity to the will of Christ.

             he battle of the mind. Many new Christians have the mistaken

      T      idea that once they have received Jesus as Lord and Savior the
             battle is over. In reality, the battle has only just begun. As seen
      in the earthly life of Jesus, it’s often after our baptism that Satan inten-
      sifies his attacks. The battle is fought in our minds, and one of Satan’s
      primary temptations is the sin of remembrance: He tries to lure us
      back to the old, forbidden pathways. Our Lord Jesus Christ, in con-
      trast, wants us to forget what is behind and “be transformed by the
      renewing of [our minds]” (Rom. 12:2, NKJV). The Greek verb trans-
      lated “transformed” comes from the same verb used in Mark 9:2,
      when Jesus was “transfigured.” What a remarkable ideal the Lord
      Jesus Christ has for each of His redeemed children. He desires to so
      renew our minds that the glory of the Lord will shine through us.

     The Power of Thought
Read the following texts: Exodus 20:17, Matthew 5:8, 1 Corinthians
     2:16,1 Chronicles 28:9.What’s the one thing they all have in com-
     mon?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The Bible, of course, has so much to say about our deeds and our
     words, all of which is understandable, because our deeds and words
     can have powerful effects on ourselves and others.
       Yet, the Bible also makes it clear that the Lord cares about our
     thoughts. But why? As long as we don’t act on our thoughts, what
     does it matter? Why should God care what we think? Whoever heard
     of anyone hurting another person with a thought? Thoughts are pri-
     vate, personal things that, in the end, if we don’t express them or act
     upon them, don’t hurt anyone.
       Right?

 Why do you think it matters what we think, as long as we don’t act
     on our thoughts? Or is it possible to not, eventually, act on our
     thoughts? Or even if we don’t act on our thoughts, why does it
     matter what we think? See Gen. 6:5, Prov. 4:23, Matt. 5:27-30.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Because our thoughts are the foundation of all our words and
     actions, it matters what we think. Every evil deed ever committed,
     every evil word, every sin, began first as a thought. How many mil-
     lions of people first harbored thoughts—nothing more than “harm-
     less” thoughts—that eventually sprouted into words or deeds that have
     caused incredible damage? Who can know what thoughts will remain
     only as thoughts, nothing more, and which will bear bitter fruit? We
     can never know for sure, which is why it’s best to control our thoughts
     before they turn into something painful and damaging to ourselves
     and others.

      Try this rather frightful, and horrific, experiment: Imagine if
      your thoughts were suddenly projected on a screen for everyone
      to see! What would be up there? What does this tell you about
      what’s in your mind and what changes need to be made?


                                                                         23

Meditate on Paul’s testimony in 2 Corinthians 10:3-5. Read it in dif-
      ferent versions (if possible) and then answer the following questions:

      2.What does it mean to be in a spiritual battle? How does it differ

      ____________________________________________________________________

      3.What is one of the “carnal” (the Greek word means “fleshly”)

      weapons that we need to use? See Eph. 6:10-18.

      4. What are some of the “high things” that exalt themselves
      against the knowledge of God?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The word for “strongholds” in 2 Corinthians 10:4 means “castles”
      or “fortresses.” Paul doubtless is thinking of the inner fortresses of our
      hearts, the “castles” of our minds, the habits of sin and self that deter-
      mine our character. The battle is one of truth against error, the knowl-
      edge of God against ignorance and superstition; it is a struggle of true
      worship against all forms of idolatry. In the end, it’s a great contro-
      versy between Christ and Satan for control of the race. All this occurs
      in the mind, in the heart; and only through the power of God working
      in our lives can we uproot the enemy.

       Keeping in mind the context of what you’ve read today, why is con-
       trol of our thoughts so crucial in the battle we are facing? Why, in
       many ways, is keeping control of our thoughts the whole battle?

     Setting Your Mind on Things Above
     (Col. 3:1, 2).

       Even after we have received Jesus as Savior and Lord, it is still pos-
     sible to become distracted by a multitude of earthly attractions. We
     easily can become preoccupied with things of secondary importance
     and forget we are called to set our minds on things above, not on
     things on the earth. After all, we physically live on the earth; we are
     constantly surrounded by things of the earth. And, indeed, many
     things of the earth are not, in and of themselves, bad (see Gen. 1:31).
     The key is to learn to know the difference.

What reason does Paul give for setting our minds on things above?
     Col. 3:1, 2.
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Let’s look a little closer at what Paul is telling us here. Because we
     have been “raised with [Christ]” (Col. 2:12, NKJV; see also Rom.
     6:4), that we have died to self (Col. 3:3) and now have a new life in
     Him, our thoughts should be on heavenly things, things “above” as
     compared to “things on earth”—the kind of things we thought about
     before we met Jesus. But now, because Jesus Christ died for us (see
     Rom. 5:6), has paid the penalty for our sins (see Isa. 53:6), has cov-
     ered us with His perfect righteousness (see Rom. 4:4-8), and now is
     interceding in our behalf in heaven (see Heb. 9:24), we must now
     dwell upon Him and the great redemption He has wrought out for us
     (see 1 Cor. 1:30).
        Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is sitting at the right hand of the
     throne of God. We must always remember to focus our attention on
     our great High Priest, who has passed through the heavens and ever
     lives to make intercession for us.
        “Fix your thoughts upon the Saviour. Go apart from the bustle of the
     world and sit under Christ’s shadow. Then, amid the din of daily toil
     and conflict, your strength will be renewed.”—Ellen G. White, In
     Heavenly Places, p. 62.

      Take as much time as possible to dwell upon the plan of salva-
      tion, of Christ’s taking on human flesh, of His substitutionary
      death in your behalf, of His ministry in the sanctuary above.
      Think about what it reveals about the character of God.Think
      about the hope it offers you.Think about the promises that are
      ours because of all this. Now, imagine if, day by day, you lived in
      such a heavenly atmosphere. How different would your life be?

                                                                           25

     Receiving a Sanctified Imagination
     (Rom. 12:1, 2).

Read Romans 12:1, 2. Focusing on the theme of this week, write
     down what you believe Paul is telling us.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       One of the precious gifts we have all received from our Creator is
     the gift of an imagination. Unfortunately, our imaginations have been
     corrupted by sinful thoughts and desires. We need our imaginations to
     be sanctified. Given the importance the Bible places on our thoughts,
     we should be encouraged to know there is power from above that will
     help us get control of our thoughts and our imaginations.

How does this renewal of our minds occur? Compare Rom. 12:1, 2 with
     Titus 3:5.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        These two passages of Scripture contain the only references to the
     Greek noun translated as “renewing” or “renewal.” The radical trans-
     formation of our minds promised in Romans 12:2 can be accom-
     plished only by the power of the Holy Spirit working in those
     Christians who have surrendered themselves to Him. God will work
     in us, even at the level of our imagination, but only to the degree we
     allow Him 10. This surrender can, at times, demand an excruciating
     struggle on our part. As everyone has surely experienced, it’s very
     easy for our minds to wander and focus on forbidden themes, earthly,
     carnal things that are from below and not from above. No wonder that
     in Colossians 3:2 (see yesterday’s study) the literal translation of “set
     your affection” means “continually think of ” heavenly things.
     Perhaps that’s partially why Paul says, too, that we should “pray
     always” (2 Thess. 1:11), because nothing can lift our thoughts as can
     prayer.

      What are the ways you use your imagination? Is it working for
      or against your walk with the Lord? What can you do in order
      to make yourself more receptive to the “renewal” of your mind-
      sthat God promises?

     Influences
        Recently, a nation was horrified. A drunken, bedraggled homeless
     man in a big city was sleeping in an alley. A group of about three
     young men, seeing the unfortunate fellow, found a cannister of gaso-
     line. As the man was sleeping, they doused him with the fuel and set
     him on fire. He died a horrible death.
        When arrested and asked why they did such a terrible thing, one of
     the boys answered that they had seen something similar happen in a
     movie and simply copied what they saw.

Think about this episode. However extreme, what’s the crucial prin-
     ciple we see expressed here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       As we’ve seen this week, God cares about our thoughts; and He has
     also promised us strength to change our thoughts. But whatever the
     power promises from above, God isn’t going to just change our
     thoughts supernaturally. We just don’t utter a prayer, “Lord, change
     my thoughts,” and instantly we are pure in heart and mind. However
     nice that would be, it doesn’t work that way. We have a definite role
     in cooperating with the Lord. To a great extent, the things we put in
     our minds will affect what things we think. The more you read about
     Jesus, the more you focus on holy things, then the more your thoughts
     will be about Jesus and holy things; the more you read about earthly,
     unholy things, the more your thoughts will be about unholy and
     earthly things. It is that simple.

How does Philippians 4:8 capture the essence of this week’s lesson?
     Write out each of these words (true, honest, just, pure, etc.), and
     under each heading list some things that fit in these categories (it
     would be interesting to compare your answers with others in
     class). How well are you following Paul’s admonition regarding
     your thoughts?

      Having trouble controlling your thoughts? Having trouble
      thinking of heavenly rather than earthly, carnal things? The
      answer to your problem could easily be found in what you are
      reading and watching. Only you can make the necessary
      changes.Why not, right now, under the power and influence of
      the Holy Spirit, determine seriously to censor the things that
      come into your mind? Otherwise, you will never have victory in
      this crucial aspect of Christian life.

                                                                       27

Further Study: “The apostle sought to teach the believers how
     important it is to keep the mind from wandering to forbidden themes
     or from spending its energies on trifling subjects. Those who would not
     fall a prey to Satan’s devices, must guard well the avenues of the soul;
     they must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which will suggest
     impure thoughts.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 518.
        “The training of the heart, the control of the thoughts, in cooper-
     ation with the Holy Spirit, will give control of the words. This is true
     wisdom, and will ensure quietness of mind, contentment and peace.
     There will be joy in the contemplation of the riches of the grace of
     God.”—Ellen G. White, Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 2,
     p. 656.
        “Those who would have that wisdom which is from God must
     become fools in the sinful knowledge of this age, in order to be wise.
     They should shut their eyes, that they may see and learn no evil. They
     should close their ears, lest they hear that which is evil and obtain that
     knowledge which would stain their purity of thoughts and acts. And
     they should guard their tongues, lest they utter corrupt communica-
     tions and guile be found in their mouths.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Adventist Home, p. 404.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Think about your own home. What things are there that tend
      to make it difficult for you to have purity of thoughts?

      ●
      2 What crucial role does prayer and Bible study have in helping
      us have control of our thoughts?

      ●
      3 What can you do as a church to help other members, particu-
      larly the young, protect themselves from the kind of negative
      influences that can make it very difficult to control their
      thoughts?

      ●
      4 Read Ephesians 6:10-18. In what ways does this help provide
      a formula for victory in this crucial battle for our minds?

God Is Faithful, part 2
Maria Tzenova
   My heart felt at peace as I traveled home that Friday afternoon. No mat-
ter what, I was going to follow God’s leading. I still wondered what my
parents would say if they knew I might lose my opportunity to study at the
university. By the time I arrived home, I had decided not to tell my parents
what had happened or what I had decided.
   On Sabbath morning I went to church. I met a girl there who was study-
ing at another university. After church I told her about my dilemma and
asked her how she solved such problems. She told me that Bulgaria had
laws to assure religious freedom, and that her teachers worked with her to
accommodate her faith. I went home with new courage.
   When I returned to the university, I wrote a letter to the dean, asking
permission to skip lab classes on Sabbath. I wanted to deliver the letter in
person, but she was not in. When I finally found her in, I was happily sur-
prised to learn that the dean was also one of my lecturers. I explained my
problem to her and gave her the letter. She gave me permission to miss the
labs as long as I could prepare for the exams.
   I left her office praising God for the wonderful way He had worked out
my dilemma. It was several hours before I could settle down to study.
   I returned home often during the rest of the semester and attended evan-
gelistic meetings at my home church. At the end of the meetings my sis-
ter, my mother, and I were baptized together. Some time later, after lots of
encouragement to step out in faith and let God take care of his job, my
father also was baptized.
   I think of this trial when I face other problems in my life. I learned how
God can work out His will in my life, even when I cannot see how a solu-
tion is possible. He just wants me to trust Him and move out in faith, just
                               as the Israelites had to step into the Jordan
                               River before the water stopped flowing. We
                               must step forward in faith.
                                  I realize now that when I sat in that dim
                               waiting room at the railway station, I was not
                               alone. If God had opened my eyes, as He did
                               for Elijah, I would have seen angels minister-
                               ing to me as I struggled to make my decision.

      Lord of Our Desires




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Genesis 1, 2; Rom. 1:3;
      6:1-7; 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:17; Phil. 2:8; Col. 2:12, 13; 1 Tim. 3:16; 1 Pet.
      1:13-16; 1 John 2:1.

Memory Text: “For what the law could not do, in that it was
      weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of
      sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh” (Romans 8:3).

Key Thought: God created humans with powerful desires for
      our enjoyment. We, as Christians, need to keep those desires,
      which we should still enjoy, under divine control.

             ubmitting our desires to the will of God. The apostle Paul

      S      warned that in the last days people would be “lovers of pleasure
             rather than lovers of God” (2 Tim. 3:4, NKJV). Talk about a per-
      fect description of this generation! The guiding principle for many
      today is: Satisfy your own desires. Christian values are discarded as
      old-fashioned, unreasonable, and hopelessly out-of-date. The basic
      sentiment is: As long as you desire to do something that doesn’t hurt
      anyone else, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t do it.
         In contrast, those who live under the lordship of Christ are called to
      submit all their desires to the will of God. Our Lord Himself declared,
      “ ‘For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the
      will of Him who sent Me’ ” (John 6:38, NKJV). Jesus set the perfect
      example of submission to the will of God when He prayed, “ ‘Not
      what I will, but what You will’ ” (Mark 14:36, NKJV).This is our man-
      date, as well. Our will, our desires, must be surrendered to the Lord.

     Flesh and Spirit
        The Christian faith began and spread amid Greek culture and phi-
     losophy. Though the Greek Empire itself had fallen to the Romans
     (see Daniel 2), its influence remained long after its political and mil-
     itary dominance faded.
        Sin influences the human body with disease, old age, and so forth.
     But the body cannot be evil, because Jesus put on a human body when
     He came to this earth. Greek culture also taught that the spirit is some-
     thing within us that is always fighting the body. But in Romans 8:4, 5;
     Galatians 5:24, 25; and Galatians 6:8, the spirit is our attitude of sur-
     render and obedience to Jesus. People who live “in the spirit” are peo-
     ple who have surrendered their sinful natures to the Holy Spirit.

What’s the greatest example we have from the Bible that the human
     body, in and of itself, isn’t evil? Rom. 1:3, 8:3, Gal. 4:4, Phil. 2:8,
     1 Tim. 3:16.


       Although now affected by sin, the human body can’t be evil, because
     Jesus Christ assumed a human body. But what about those New
     Testament texts, especially in the writings of Paul, that seem to pit flesh
     against the spirit, such as Romans 8:4, 5; Galatians 5:24, 25; 6:8?
        The basic issue here is not that our body, our flesh, is of itself bad.
     Again, Christ’s humanity proves this point. Paul’s emphasis, instead,
     deals with control of our flesh, the keeping of its desires under the
     control of God. Ephesians 2:3 helps clarify this point: “Among whom
     also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,
     fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature
     the children of wrath, even as others.” Paul talks about not letting the
     things of the flesh, that is, the carnal nature of fallen beings, dominate
     the Christian, who has died to this carnal nature, where passion and
     lust rule, and who now lives in the “spirit,” that is, in an attitude of
     faith and submission to Christ.
        Part of the problem stems from the use of the word spirit, which, in
     Paul’s writing, isn’t this eternal holy entity that lives in constant ten-
     sion or battle with the flesh. In the Bible, spirit can mean “mood,”
     “attitude,” or “feelings.” Oftentimes in the New Testament, flesh is
     simply the word used to symbolize the fallen carnal nature, while
     spirit symbolizes the attitude of submission and obedience to Christ.
     Those who live in “the spirit” are those who have yielded themselves
     to the Holy Spirit, which brings the desires of the flesh under control.

      How can you know if you are walking after the “flesh” or after
      the “spirit”?


                                                                             31

     The Creation
Review the Genesis Creation account of humanity (Genesis 1 and
     2). What evidences do you find there that God intended for human
     beings to enjoy the physical creation He had made?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Even the most simple reading of the Creation account reveals noth-
     ing of the notion that the physical world, especially the human body,
     is bad. On the contrary, God created man and woman to interact
     closely with what He had made. Man came directly from the ground,
     which God had just created, and woman came from the man. Thus,
     humankind and the earth are intimately linked. Together, man and
     woman, living on this earth and drawing sustenance from it, were to
     be “fruitful, and multiply” (Gen. 1:28); they were to be involved in the
     process of creating more human beings, more human flesh. God gave
     them “every herb” (Gen. 2:5) for meat, and He gave them every tree
     that “is pleasant to the sight” (Gen. 2:9), and that was “good for food,”
     indicating they were to enjoy what they ate, that it would not only
     nourish but please them. Truly this was a paradise, and what helped
     make it a paradise was how well it pleased their human senses.
        There’s no question: God created us as physical beings, and He gave
     us physical desires, which, in and of themselves, can’t be bad pre-
     cisely because God gave them to us. The problem is not our basic
     desires but rather how we as fallen beings use them, how we keep
     them under control in order that we don’t allow them to take us where
     God never intended us to go. We can do this only through knowing
     what God’s will is for us and then surrendering our sinful selves to
     Him so we can have the power to keep our desires within that will and
     not enter into the paths of self-destruction.

      Despite the ravages of sin, in what ways can you see, even now,
      indications of how wonderful the original creation was? What
      are some of the things we have been given that we should enjoy,
      and how do these reveal to us the Creator’s love?

      The Fall
         The Lord placed our parents in a paradise, a garden filled with
      things that delighted their senses, things that they, in their physical
      bodies, could enjoy. Unfortunately, some of these same things were
      used against them by Satan in order to cause the Fall.

Read Genesis 3:1-6. How did the devil use the physical senses to
      deceive the woman and get her to flagrantly disobey God?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        It should be a powerful warning to us that, even in their unfallen
      state, Adam and Eve allowed their senses to turn them away from God.
      Satan knows that our senses, our appetites, though God-given, are a
      powerful means to control us. That’s why the Bible tells us to keep
      them under control; otherwise, Satan will use them to destroy us.

Read 1 John 2:16. How do you see the principles here reflected in the
      story of the Fall? Notice, is it saying the eyes and the flesh them-
      selves are bad, or is it saying something else? If so, what?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         All around us we can see the results of humans who have allowed
      these wonderful God-given gifts to control them and their lives. God
      gave us sex, and we became pornographers. God gave us material pos-
      sessions, and we became greedy and selfish. God gave us music, and
      we became punk rockers. He gave us fire, and we became arsonists.
      He gave us food, and we became gluttons. He gave us words, and we
      lie and we curse. He gave us grapes, and we became drunks. It’s hard,
      really, to think of any God-given gift that we, as humans, haven’t, one
      way or another, perverted or abused because of sin. The effects are
      seen everywhere.

       Try to imagine a world where our God-given senses are in per-
       fect harmony with the world around them (kind of sounds like
       heaven, does it not?). What do you think it would be like? And
       though you can’t have that world now, what changes do you
       need to make in order to bring your desires and senses into
       closer harmony with the world as God originally meant them to
       be? Why would doing that make your life better now?

                                                                          33

      Times of Solitude
Read Matthew 4:1, 2 (see also Mark 1:12 and Luke 4:1, 2). Why do you
      think Jesus fasted for so long? What’s the message here for us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

          “Many who profess godliness do not inquire into the reason of
      Christ’s long period of fasting and suffering in the wilderness. His
      anguish was not so much from the pangs of hunger as from His sense
      of the fearful result of the indulgence of appetite and passion upon
      the race. He knew that appetite would be man’s idol and would lead
      him to forget God and would stand directly in the way of his salva-
      tion.”—Ellen G. White, Confrontation, p. 51.
         How fascinating that though Satan caused our first parents to sin on
      the issue of appetite, Jesus—in His first major conflict after His bap-
      tism—would go over the same ground and succeed where Adam and
      Eve failed. What a message His self-denial should have for us, we
      who are often enslaved to our appetites and passions.

Read prayerfully and carefully 1 Peter 1:13-16. What is the essential
      message to us regarding our desires and lusts? How do his words
      “gird up the loins of your mind” focus us on last week’s study, and
      why is this crucial to keeping our desires under control?

         Amid these exhortations is the call to be holy. That’s a pretty intense
      command for beings who, at their core, are sinful and fallen. And yet,
      it’s obviously an attainable goal; otherwise, why would the Bible more
      than once call us to holiness? And, in this context and others—holi-
      ness, which basically means to “be set apart”—deals with the control
      of our lusts and passions. It says to be holy in all manner of conduct,
      behavior, and lifestyle. Though we have been given these basic desires
      by God, we are to be separate from the world and the world’s indul-
      gences and abuses and per versions of these desires.

       How much self-denial do you allow yourself to go through? In
       other words, when your desires are leading you where you know
       you shouldn’t go, how do you respond? What does your answer
       tell you about how well you’re following what the Lord tells us
       about the control of these desires?

      Yield
        It’s one thing, of course, to read the Bible admonitions to keep our
     desires under control; it’s another to do it. Though we want to do what
     is right, sometimes it’s so easy to surrender, not to the will of God but
     to our lusts and passions. Perhaps this problem was best expressed by
     Augustine, who once prayed, “God give me power over my passions—
     but just not yet!” Who, to some degree, can’t relate?
        Nevertheless, there is great hope for us as Christians. We can have
     victory over the things that can, otherwise, destroy us, but we can have
     that victory only through the power and Spirit of God working in a
     soul that yields to that power. In the end, we all yield: The question
     is—to what? To our passions, which bring death, or to God, who
     brings life? There are no other options.

Read prayerfully and carefully the following texts: What’s the basic
      message in them all? What personal experience are they all talk-
      ing about? Rom. 6:1-7; 2 Cor. 5:17; Col. 2:12, 13.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Those who have totally surrendered their lives to Christ will, through
     the Spirit of God, die to their old selves and be “born from above”
     (John 3:3, NRSV). They have surrendered to God their whole exis-
     tence, including the desires of the heart and flesh (see Rom. 6:13).
     Now, they live under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit, which
     gives them a new life in Christ (see Gal. 5:25). Unlike before they
     knew the Lord, those who have died to self and live again in Christ can,
     through this power, live with their desires under control.
        This new existence, however, is a day-by-day existence. Though we
     sometimes hear stories of those who, having surrendered to Christ,
     suddenly have their lifelong habit of smoking, drinking, or whatever
     just simply vanish, for most Christians that’s not the case. Plus, too,
     character doesn’t change in an instant. There’s a day-by-day battle with
     sin, with self, with the carnal nature, which, though subdued through
     the power of God, is always there trying to break through. In and of
     ourselves, we can’t win against our fallen flesh; all we can do is,
     moment by moment, surrender our wills to Christ and claim His power
     over our sinful desires. This takes self-denial, vigilance, a struggle, and
     lots of prayer, but victory is promised. Otherwise, defeat is certain.

       How, in your own life, have you experienced what these texts
       listed today have talked about? Why is knowledge of the Cross
       so important for you to understand when, at times, you fail?

Further Study: Consider the stories of various Bible characters
      who failed to yield their desires to the will of God. Note the conse-
      quences of their actions. Some of these individuals repented of their
      sin and trusted in God’s grace for forgiveness and salvation. Others
      continued in their sin and will be eternally lost.

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 As a class,talk about what it means to die to self and live a new
       life in Christ. Share your own experiences and how some person
       may have changed your life. What advice would you give to
       someone who, wanting to be a Christian, admits that he or she
       never had such experiences with God before?

       ●
       2 In our struggle to keep our desires under control, why is
       understanding the good news of Christ’s substitutionary death so
       important, especially after we make a mistake and yield to our
       sinful desires?

       what you could or even should do, is there anything that, as a
       class or a church, you could do to help limit the damage these
       businesses are doing to your community? If so, what?

The Locked Bookcase
J. H. Zachary
   From the time he was a child, Juan wanted to know God. While still a
teenager, he enrolled in a seminary to become a priest. He read the Bible
carefully and began noticing differences between what it said and what his
teachers taught. He discovered that the Ten Commandments in the Bible
differed from those he studied in class. These discrepancies drove Juan to
study the Scriptures even more.
   Juan spent many hours in the seminary library. One day he noticed some
books locked within a case. A note taped to the case stated that no one was
to read the books locked inside.
   Juan became curious. What could those books contain that would be
harmful to a seminary student? he wondered. And who is this E. G. White
who had written those forbidden books?
   Juan wanted to read those books and decided to make friends with the
librarian. For several weeks he built up trust with the librarian. Finally he
asked, “Is it possible for me to read one of the books locked in that case
over there? I’m curious about them.”
   The librarian smiled, opened a drawer, and pulled out a key. Together the
two walked to the locked case. The librarian unlocked the case, and Juan
selected one book, The Great Controversy. He took it home and began
reading it.
   As he read, he began to understand why these books were forbidden.
The book spoke about his church, and the accusations were as heresy to
him. But every chapter of the book contained scriptural references to back
it up. Juan looked up the verses and realized that the Bible supported what
this book was saying.
   Juan borrowed and read several other books by Ellen G. White. As he
read them, he felt the Holy Spirit urging him to draw closer to the Bible
and to Jesus.
   Juan’s questions in class brought hostility from some of his teachers. In
time he left the seminary and moved to a distant island in the Philippines.
There he met some people who clearly followed the Bible’s teachings.
After studying the Bible with them for several months, he was baptized.
   He praises God for showing him the path of life through those “forbid-
den books.” Juan is sharing his faith with animist people living in the
Philippines.

J. H. Zachary was retired from the Ministerial Association of the General Conference.

      Lord of Our Speech




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalm 9; Acts 1:8; 1 Cor.
      2:1-5; Eph. 4:15, 29; Col. 4:6; James 3:5-13; 4:11.

Memory Text: “Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned
      with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one”
      (Colossians 4:6, NKJV).

Key Thought: We are called to use our speech for the glory of
      our Lord and the blessing of others.

             he gift of speech can be a tremendous blessing or a terrible

      T      curse. When we enter into a newness of life under the lordship
             of Christ, Jesus invites us to let Him be the Lord of our speech.
      Used wisely, our speech can bring glory to God and blessing to those
      around us. Misused, our speech can wreak havoc. Corrupt communi-
      cation causes pain to the heart of God and damage to the lives of those
      within our circle of influence.
        Ellen White reminds us that “the faculty of speech is a precious gift,
      and if the noblest of our faculties, reason, is set to the task of know-
      ing God, then the gift of speech may become a means of grace to oth-
      ers, a channel through which the knowledge of God may be commu-
      nicated.”—Manuscript Releases, vol. 19, p. 277.
        In this week’s study, we will explore some practical ways in which we
      can use our speech for the glory of God and the blessing of others. The
      same appeal that the apostle Paul gave to young Timothy is given to
      each one of us today: “[Be] an example in speech” (1 Tim. 4:12, NRSV).

      Speaking Words of Praise to the Lord
        It is the highest privilege for members of the human family to speak
      words of praise to the Lord. The psalms are full of exhortations to
      praise the Lord. In Psalm 9 the psalmist David declares, “I will praise
      You, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous
      works. I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your
      name, O Most High” (Ps. 9:1, 2, NKJV).

As much as possible, read the last five psalms. What was it about the
      Lord that caused the psalmist to utter so much praise?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Throughout the Scriptures, we find the testimonies of individuals
      who used their gift of speech to express praises to God. For example,
      when the secret of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream was revealed to Daniel,
      the young prophet was quick to offer praise to the Lord (see Dan.
      2:20-23). This is seen over and over again in the Bible.

What spiritual advantages come to us by taking time to praise the
      Lord, whether verbally or in writing?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         There’s power in words that impacts not only those who hear or read
      those words but those who speak or write them. Through our own acts
      of praising the Lord for His goodness, His mercy, His divine acts in
      our behalf, we only strengthen our faith and appreciation of the Lord’s
      goodness, mercy, and divine acts in our behalf. Thinking about these
      things is also important, but there’s something about expressing them,
      either through spoken or written words, that increases their impact on
      us. No wonder, then, that the Scriptures have whole sections praising
      the Lord.

       Write your own psalm of praise to the Lord for whatever you
       feel impressed to praise Him for, and then read it aloud. See for
       yourself how such expressions can impact you only for the good.




                                                                          39

     Speaking With Grace (Col. 4:6).
Study the apostle Paul’s counsel to the believers in Colosse, as
     recorded in Colossians 4:6.What does it mean to “let your speech
     be always with grace, seasoned with salt” (NKJV)? Keeping in
     mind, too, that salt back then was used as a preservative, what do
     you think “seasoned with salt” means in this context?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Nowhere in the Scriptures do we find the suggestion that grace can
     originate in the hearts of human beings. Grace always originates in the
     heart of God. Grace cannot be worked up. It must be prayed down
     from heaven. We can speak with grace only if our lives are filled with
     grace. How does that happen? Through a daily living connection with
     the Source of all grace, through understanding how grace has been
     poured out upon us. When we keep this great truth before us, that we
     have been recipients of grace, that we have received from God,
     through Christ, what we absolutely do not deserve—then we can
     begin to speak with grace to others.

Read the story in John 8:1-11 of the adulterous woman who was cast
     at the feet of Jesus. How does the interaction of Jesus with the
     woman and with her accusers illustrate one way by which one can
     speak with grace?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        We often face situations where the natural tendency would be to
     speak sharp words, words that don’t reflect grace but anger, judgment,
     or retaliation. Oftentimes, we might be in a position where a firm
     word is needed, but even then it’s how we say it, the manner and the
     tone in which we say it, that can either reflect grace or our own self-
     ish nature. Even when we have been mistreated, the Lord desires that
     we respond with words of grace rather than words of rebuke or retal-
     iation. Christ’s whole passion provides us with a perfect example of
     speaking words of grace, even to those who mistreat us.

      Think about the last time your words were graceless.Though all
      you can do is ask for forgiveness for that past act, what can you
      do now to help prevent yourself from making a similar mistake
      next time?

     Speaking the Truth in Love (Eph. 4:15).
       As we suggested yesterday, there are times when we might need to
     speak words of rebuke, counsel, or admonition to others.

Read the following texts: Matthew 16:23; 23:13-39; John 14:8, 9;
     John 18:19-23. What kind of tone do you think Jesus used when
     speaking these words? How would that tone reflect the principles
     of love and grace He Himself embodied?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “Christ Himself did not suppress one word of truth, but He spoke it
     always in love. He exercised the greatest tact, and thoughtful, kind
     attention in His intercourse with the people. He was never rude, never
     needlessly spoke a severe word, never gave needless pain to a sensi-
     tive soul. He did not censure human weakness. He fearlessly
     denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His
     voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. He wept over Jerusalem, the
     city He loved, that refused to receive Him, the Way, the Truth, and the
     Life. They rejected Him, the Saviour, but He regarded them with pity-
     ing tenderness, and sorrow so deep that it broke His heart. Every soul
     was precious in His eyes. While He always bore Himself with divine
     dignity, He bowed with tenderest regard to every member of the fam-
     ily of God. In all men He saw fallen souls whom it was His mission
     to save.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 353.

Read Ephesians 4:15.How do you understand what it means to speak
     the “truth” in love? Is “truth” still “truth” if spoken in any other
     way but love?


       Unfortunately, there are times when we fail to speak the truth in
     love. We seem to easily fall into one of two traps. Some are quick to
     speak the truth but fail to speak it in love. Others replace love with a
     sentimentalism that hinders their ability to speak the truth at all.

      So often it’s not what we say but how we say it that can make
      all the difference in the world. Stand before a mirror, or before
      others, and practice saying the same words, once in a loving
      tone, once in a harsh, unkind tone. You will be shocked that,
      though the words themselves are the same, their meanings will
      seem so different. There’s a powerful lesson here for us, if we
      will learn it.

                                                                          41

      Speaking in the Power of the Spirit
      (Acts 1:8, 1 Cor. 2:1-5).

         When someone refers to speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit,
      we generally think of preaching. The testimony of Scripture is clear:
      It is God’s intention that all preaching be delivered in the power of the
      Spirit.

Study the promise of Jesus in Acts 1:8 and the testimony of the apos-
      tle Paul in 1 Corinthians 2:1-5. What is the secret of powerful
      preaching?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Powerful preaching is not the product of human wisdom or elo-
      quence. Rather, it is the testimony of one who has entered into a per-
      sonal, intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. The same Holy
      Spirit who placed His seal of approval upon the preaching of Paul will
      also enable humble servants of Christ in our generation to speak with
      a demonstration of divine power.
         Speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit, however, is not limited to
      preaching. God intends that all our speech be delivered with a demon-
      stration of divine power. Indeed, each one of us who lives in newness
      of life under the lordship of Christ is given the privilege and respon-
      sibility of speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit. Divine power,
      however, doesn’t necessarily mean just eloquence (see Exod. 4:10,
      1 Cor. 2:1). If we are speaking in the Spirit, our words, our tone, our
      message will reflect the attributes of the Spirit that are made manifest
      in lives touched by the Spirit. Our words will reflect the kind of peo-
      ple we are; they will reflect whether we are walking after the flesh or
      after the Spirit.
         Also, we must never confuse grand elocution with speaking in the
      Spirit. Many of history’s worst tyrants were men whose speech was
      very powerful and very effective; one, though, would hardly say they
      were speaking in the Spirit.

       What principles do the following texts give us that help us know
       whether we, or someone else, is speaking under the influence of
       the Holy Spirit? 1 Cor. 12:1, 2; Gal. 5:22; Eph. 5:9, 10; 6:17-19.
       How can you apply these principles in your own life and speech?

      Avoiding Corrupt Communication                                   (Eph.
      4:29).

         The apostle Paul admonished the believers in Ephesus to avoid cor-
      rupt communication. Unfortunatel y, many of us live in a social envi-
      ronment where cor rupt communication is considered normal. People
      frequently take the name of the Lord in vain, use profane language,
      and make rude or suggestive comments. Even as Christians, if we
      allow ourselves to be exposed continuously to this kind of language,
      sooner or later it will influence us to where we, ourselves, are more
      likely to use these words. We must constantly be on guard.

In the light of Paul’s comment in Ephesians 4:29,how would you define
      “corrupt communication”? Why is it not limited only to what is
      known as profanity? Consider also Exod. 20:16, Prov. 10:18, Eph.
      4:31, James 3:5-13, 4:11.
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Corrupt communication tears down. The Greek word used in
      1 Timothy 3:11, translated “slanderers”(KJV) or “malicious talkers”
      (NIV), is diabolos, one of the names used for the enemy, Satan. When
      people use corrupt communication, they are actually doing Satan’s
      work. What a testimony to the power that is inherent in our words!
         In contrast, the apostle Paul appeals to believers to use speech that
      is “good for necessary edification” (Eph. 4:29, NKJV). The word used
      here literally means “building up.” One translation puts it this way:
      “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only
      what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it
      may benefit those who listen” (Eph. 4:29, NIV).
          Our words, then, have a powerful influence, either for good or for
      evil, for either building up others in faith or for tearing them down.
      Who hasn’t experienced themselves the power of words, either for
      good or for evil, either for edification or for creating doubt? How cru-
      cial that we watch not just our words but the tone and manner in which
      we express them. Indeed, even the right words in the wrong spirit also
      can be considered “cor rupt communication.”

       How much “corrupt communication” emanates from your own
       lips? We’re not talking just about curse words; we’re talking
       about untruths,slander, exaggeration,being judgmental,and so
       forth. Take a hard look at yourself:What things might you need
       to change regarding your speech?


                                                                           43

Further Study: The gift of silence. The wise man Solomon
     reminds us that there is a time to speak and also “a time to keep
     silence” (Eccles. 3:7, NKJV). When Jesus Christ is Lord of your
     speech, you will not only speak for the glory of God and the blessing
     of others; you will also discern when it is time to keep silent.
        Note: In the light of this week’s study, consider to what extent you
     are allowing Jesus Christ to be Lord of your speech. Spend time read-
     ing Scripture with the intention to be more attentive to God’s words
     than to your own. Use a journal to record your thoughts. When you
     conclude your time of silence, you might find that you are more aware
     of the gift of speech.
        “I wish we could have a pledge in our hearts that we would not utter
     one word against a brother or a sister. . . . Do not gossip about them
     and make remarks about their character, but go to them in the love of
     Jesus and the love of the truth and try to help them.”—Ellen G. White,
     In Heavenly Places, p. 289.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Jesus was described as a speaker of “gracious words” (Luke
      4:22, NKJV). This may be a reference to both the content of His
      speech and also the way He spoke. What narratives in the Gospels
      illustrate the gracious speech of Jesus? What can we learn from
      these examples?

      ●2 We tend to think of speech as only an individual thing. But
      what about us as a church? How do we, as a church, use the power
      of speech? Why, in many ways, is our responsibility as a church
      regarding our words more important than as individuals?

      ●3 What counsel would you give to an individual who works in an
      environment where corrupt communication is considered nor-
      mal? When should a person stay to be salt and light? When is it

One Small Miracle
Karen Glassford
   I am a third-generation Adventist and a missionary kid. I had lived in
the mission field, so when I accepted an invitation to go to India to con-
duct evangelism, I did not think that much in India could surprise me. I
was prepared for the poverty I would find, but I wasn’t prepared to witness
the miracles God performed before my eyes and in my arms—miracles
that overwhelmed me with gratitude to God, who can do anything.
   Several hundred villagers came to our evangelistic meetings. They came
to watch the video about the life of Jesus, to listen to the Bible stories, and
to learn how to live healthier lives. I watched their faces as they realized
that there is a God who loves them and wants to spend eternity with them;
to learn of a future far different from the troubled world they knew. Their
eyes filled with joy as they realized that life has a purpose, that hope is
real.
   One night as I waited to preach, someone pulled on my scarf. I turned
to look into the desperate eyes of a woman holding a baby girl. The infant
was clawing the air, struggling to breathe. I touched her fevered body and
could hear her little chest rattling loudly. The baby’s face was turning blue,
and the mother’s eyes begged me to help her. I placed my hand on the child
and prayed, “Dear Lord, help this baby to breathe. Ease her suffering and
save her!” The child seemed to calm down a little, but she still fought for
every breath. I continued praying, “Lord, this little Hindu baby does not
know You, but she needs Your healing touch.”
   The child’s life hung in the balance. My faith seemed so small, but again
I prayed, “Lord, for the sake of this child, her family, her village, please
heal her now, so that all will know that You are all powerful and that You
care about them.”
   Instantly the baby stopped struggling and fell into a peaceful sleep. Her
hot little body cooled, and the rattle in her chest quieted as air flowed
freely into her lungs.
   I stood transfixed, overwhelmed at what I had just witnessed. As I had
held that tiny child, the great God of the universe who had parted seas and
calmed storms, had stepped down into that dusty place and touched her. I
was holding a miracle in my arms.
   Many other miracles marked the meetings that we held in India. Hearts
were changed, souls were gathered into God’s kingdom. But this one small
life will forever stand as a testimony to the compassion of our mighty God.

      Lord of Our Prayers




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 53:12; John 14:12-
      14; Rom. 8:15, 18, 34; Gal. 4:5, 6; Eph. 1:5; 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 8:6,
      12:24.

Memory Text: “ ‘And whatever you ask in My name, that I will
      do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son’ ” (John 14:13,
      NKJV).

Key Thought: Those who choose to live under the lordship of
      Christ are called to follow the Master in a life of prayer.

              he life of our Lord. Christ’s life was a life of prayer. Jesus made

      T       prayer a top priority. Mark records that “in the morning, having
              risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to
      a solitary place; and there He prayed” (Mark 1:35, NKJV). Luke tes-
      tifies that Jesus “went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all
      night in prayer to God” (Luke 6:12, NKJV). “No other life was ever so
      crowded with labor and responsibility as was that of Jesus; yet how
      often He was found in prayer!”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
      p. 362.
         If we follow the life and teachings of Jesus, we, too, will devote our-
      selves to prayer, and we will learn from the example of our Lord.
      Prayer is the heart and soul of the Christian life. We would be spiritu-
      ally dead without it.
         When we pray, let us address our prayers to our heavenly Father. Let
      us pray in Jesus’ name. Let us pray according to His will. Let us join
      our Lord in the sacred work of intercession.

     Praying to Our Heavenly Father
       In His personal communion with heaven, Jesus addressed God as
     “Father” (John 17:1), “Holy Father” (John 17:11), and “righteous
     Father” (John 17:25). Even the brief prayer of Jesus recorded in Luke
     10:21 is addressed to “Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” During His
     agony in Gethsemane, Jesus addressed the heavenly Father using the
     Aramaic term Abba (Mark 14:36), an endearing name connoting the
     idea of “my father.” The early Christians apparently followed His
     example, at least on certain occasions (see Rom. 8:15, Gal. 4:6).

Look up the following Old Testament texts. How do they reveal the
     kind of relationship God sought for His people , and how does the
     image of “Father” fit in? Deut. 1:31, 32:6, Ps. 103:13, Prov. 3:12,
     Isa. 63:16, Mal. 2:10.

       Ideally, a father is to be someone who is loving, caring, protecting,
     someone whom a child can love, trust, and obey.
       Then there’s also the biblical notion of adoption, that as followers
     of Christ we have been “adopted” into the Father’s household (see
     Rom. 8:15, Gal. 4:5, Eph. 1:5). In Roman times, when a son was
     adopted, he received all the legal rights and privileges that came with
     the new family. As followers of Christ, we receive the fullness of sal-
     vation that comes from being the children of God. “See what love the
     Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so
     we are” (1 John 3:1, RSV).
       Thus, praying the name Father should give us comfort, hope, and
     joy.

      Of course, many earthly fathers have been the opposite of what
      a father should be. What advice can you give to someone for
      whom the idea of father brings painful memories? How can you
      help him or her experience the Father’s love?


                                                                         47

     Praying in Jesus’ Name
       “For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men,
     the Man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5, NKJV).

       In John 14:12-14 Jesus tells us that we should ask for things in His
     name. That is, what we request from the Father, we should request in
     the name of Jesus. What does this mean? So often, when we pray, we
     pray to the Father, and then we often, in our prayer, end with some-
     thing to the effect, “And we ask these things in Jesus’name.” What is
     implied with these words?

What are the following texts saying to us that can help us better
     understand the idea of praying to the Father in Jesus’name? Isa.
     53:12, Rom. 8:34, 1 Tim. 2:5, Heb. 8:6, 12:24.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       By praying in Jesus’ name, we are declaring before ourselves,
     before other humans, and even before the universe (see 1 Cor. 4:9)
     that we, personally, acknowledge the authority and power of Jesus
     Christ in our lives. By praying in His name we verbalize our personal
     acceptance of Him as our Savior, our Redeemer, as the One who died
     for our sins and the One through whom we have complete access to
     the Father (see Heb. 8:1). By praying in the name of Jesus, we can
     claim the promises of God that we have in and through Him. By pray-
     ing in the name of Jesus, we are openly expressing our faith in Him as
     the One who has closed the gap caused by sin between heaven and
     earth, the One through whom we, as sinners, have been reconciled to
     our heavenly Father. “And all things are of God, who hath reconciled
     us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of rec-
     onciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
     himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed
     unto us the word of reconciliation” (2 Cor. 5:18, 19).

      By praying in Jesus’ name, we acknowledge Him and what He
      has done for us. At the same time, what obligations does that
      place on us—we who pray in His name—regarding how we live,
      how we speak, and how we treat others?

      Praying According to the Father’s Will
      (Mark 14:36; John 6:38;1 John 5:14, 15).

        Jesus declared, “ ‘For I have come down from heaven, not to do My
      own will, but the will of Him who sent Me’ ” (John 6:38, NKJV).
      Even in His prayers, Jesus demonstrated His commitment to yield His
      own will to the will of His Father. When we pray, there are certain
      requests we can know for certain are in harmony with the Father’s
      will. For example, when we pray for salvation, Jesus assures us in
      John 3:16 that we are praying in accordance with the Father’s will.

List three other requests we can make with full assurance that we are
      praying in accordance with the Father’s will.

        In other situations, it may be more difficult to determine the Father’s
      will. For example, have you ever prayed for someone who is sick?
      How do you know the Father’s will for that individual? We are told to
      pray for the sick and to trust that God will bring healing. But we do
      not know the way in which healing will come, nor do we know God’s
      timing. Should we then shrink back from praying for those who are
      feeble and weak? No! “Let your prayer include this thought: ‘Lord,
      Thou knowest every secret of the soul. Thou art acquainted with these
      persons; for Jesus, their advocate, gave His life for them. He loves
      them better than we possibly can. If, therefore, it is for Thy glory and
      the good of these afflicted ones to raise them up to health, we ask Thee
      in the name of Jesus, that health may be given them at this time.’ ”
      —Ellen G. White, Counsels on Health, p. 375.

       Go back and read Jesus’ prayer in Mark 14:36. Notice the
       sequence of thought: (1) His word Abba expresses the close rela-
       tionship with His Father. (2) He acknowledges the Lord’s power.
       (3) He expresses His own personal desire. (4) He surrenders His
       own personal desire to the Father. How does this serve as a
       model for our own prayers? Is there any prayer you need to pray
       right now that reflects this same pattern? Why not get on your
       knees, even now, and pray it in the will of God?



                                                                            49
         W E D N E S D AY August 3

      Praying for Others
        It is impossible to live under the lordship of Christ and pray only for
      yourself. When Jesus Christ is Lord of your prayers, you will join Him
      in interceding for others. Jesus prayed for groups of people (see John
      17:9, 20) and also for individuals (see Luke 22:31, 32). Several Greek
      verbs are used in the New Testament to describe the prayers of Jesus.
      One such verb means “to beg.” This is the verb used in Luke 22:32 to
      describe the prayer of intercession that Jesus offered on Simon Peter’s
      behalf. “Satan could do nothing against the all-powerful intercession
      of Christ. And the prayer that Christ offered for Peter He offers in
      behalf of all who are humble and contrite in heart.”—Ellen G. White,
      Sons and Daughters of God, p. 91.

How do the following texts help us understand why we should pray for
      others? Jer. 29:7; Mark 9:29; Rom. 15:30, 31; Phil. 1:9, 10; James
      5:16.


          Many times we are asked to pray for others when they are facing
      difficulties and trials. Lists are read in church of people who “need
      our prayers.” On occasion, we may be tempted to feel overwhelmed
      because there are so many people on our prayer list. Nevertheless,
      there are too many mandates and examples in the Bible of God’s faith-
      ful servants praying for others. We can’t neglect doing our part, as
      well. There’s a power in prayer that only those who pray in the Spirit
      and in truth can experience.
        In fact, even science is beginning to understand more about the
      power of prayer. Though the issue is still debated, studies have been
      done that have convinced many “secular” scientists and doctors that
      praying for sick people does, indeed, help the sick get better—a fact
      that from their “scientific” perspective does not make sense. All of
      this simply shows how prayer is something beyond science.

       What are some of the things Satan throws before our minds to
       make us think our prayers are not needed? Or don’t matter?
       What can you do to reject those thoughts and make a personal
       commitment to pray for others in need?

     Prayer Examples
       The Bible is filled with examples of powerful prayers uttered by
     God’s people. None of these folk were perfect, none of their lives sin-
     less, and none had any righteousness in and of themselves to com-
     mend them to God. All of them were—as all of us are—sinners in
     need of divine grace, in need of the incense of Christ’s righteousness
     to mingle with our prayers and make them acceptable to a holy God
     (see Rev. 8:3). Nevertheless, in their great need, in their realization of
     who they were and who God was, they prayed to their Creator, their
     Redeemer, their heavenly Father.
       Prayer is an expression of our realization that we can’t do it our-
     selves, that there are forces beyond our control, and that we are beings
     dependent upon something greater than what we ourselves or what
     our material world could provide for us.

Below are referenced a few great prayers depicted in the Bible. As
     much as time allows, read each prayer (or pick one or two), and
     write down what thoughts come to you about what makes these
     prayers so powerful.As you read, ask yourself: What can I learn
     from these prayers that can help my prayer life be more effective?

Further Study: Perseverance in prayer. Read “The Privilege of
     Prayer” in Steps to Christ. Note what new insights impress you in the
     context of this week’s study.

       Note: Various models for prayer have been helpful for Christians.
     The best-known model is the Lord’s Prayer. It is possible to recite this
     prayer in fewer than 60 seconds. However, if you use the main move-
     ments of this prayer as an outline for prayer, your prayer time can be
     expanded to last for half an hour, an hour, or even all night.
       The earthly sanctuary is also a helpful model for prayer, including
     praise, confession, cleansing, prayer for the baptism of the Holy
     Spirit, empowerment through God’s Word, intercession, and intimate
     communion with the Lord before the ark of the covenant in the Most
     Holy Place.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 The apostle Paul encourages believers to “pray without ceas-
      ing” (1 Thess 5:17). What do you think that means? How can we
      pray “without ceasing”?

      ●2 Share in class some personal experiences with prayer. You can
      talk about dramatic answers to prayer or about what prayer does
      for you, or how you understand how prayer works.What can you
      share that can help edify and encourage class members in their
      own prayer life?

      ●
      3 Is there anyone whom you,as a class,know needs pr ayer? Why
      not stop everything and, right now, pray as a group for this per-
      son? Afterward, discuss the experience of praying as a group as
      opposed to praying individually.

      ●
      4 How can you help your children, or children within your cir-
      cle of influence, to experience a meaningful prayer experience
      with their heavenly Father?

   Jane Bor grew up in Kenya in a family that worshiped traditional spir-
its. In school she met some Adventist children who often talked about
Jesus and sang lovely Christian songs. She wished she could worship
Jesus instead of the spirits, but she knew her parents would not allow it.
   In school, time was set aside for pastors to teach the children doctrines.
Jane belonged to no Christian church, so she went to the Adventist class
to learn about Jesus. More and more she wanted to follow Jesus.
   When Jane finished primary school, her family sent her to marry a man
from another village that they had chosen for her. She was happy to learn
that the man was from a Christian family, and she hoped that she could
worship God openly. But soon after their marriage, Jane’s husband
stopped attending church, started drinking heavily, and forbade her to
attend any church. Deeply disappointed, Jane prayed that God would pro-
vide a way for her to worship Him.
   Four years later Jane’s husband was killed, leaving her with two small
children. According to custom, she went to live with her husband’s family.
Jane found an Adventist congregation nearby, but her relatives forbade her
to go to church on Sabbath. When Jane refused to marry her husband’s
brother, as tradition required, she was told to leave. She returned to her
parents’home, but they were unwilling to allow her to worship God as she
wished. Jane fasted and prayed to know God’s will.
   One day Jane’s mother suggested that she go live with her sister and
look for work at the nearby university. She was thrilled to learn that the
university was an Adventist school. She packed her few belongings and
went to live with her sister near the university. There she is free to attend
an Adventist church.
                                  Because she has no skills, the only work
                              available for her is as a helper on a construc-
                               tion site. Jane works long hours and travels
                              home every two weeks to visit her children
                              and give her mother money to care for them.
                              She is praying for a place of her own, where
                              she can have her children with her and teach
                              them the faith she has learned to love.

      Lord of Our
      Relationships


      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 20:14, 17; Psalms
      127; 128; Luke 6:27, 28; Acts 2:41-47; Eph. 4:32; 5:25; 6:1-4.

Memory Text: “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the
      law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2).

Key Thought: God created human beings to enjoy intimate
      relationships with Him and with one another. When Jesus Christ
      is the Lord of our relationships, we will experience the meaning-
      ful intimacy that was part of God’s original plan.

             reated for relationships. After God had created Adam, He said,

      C      “ ‘It is not good that man should be alone’ ” (Gen. 2:18,
             NKJV). Adam was not simply a work of art to be admired by
      his Creator. He was a relational being, created with the innate desire
      to experience intimacy with God and with other created beings. When
      the Lord brought Eve to her companion’s side, Adam gave the follow-
      ing testimony of the intimacy he was already experiencing: “ ‘This is
      now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called
      Woman, because she was taken out of Man’ ” (vs. 23). Moses provides
      a brief description of the intimate relationship that our first parents
      enjoyed: “They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
      ashamed” (vs. 25).
         So much has changed since that first relational encounter.
      Relationships have become damaged and fractured by sin. God
      desires that we experience the meaningful intimate relationships that
      were part of His original plan.

     The God of Relationships
        As human beings, we live in relationship with other human beings.
     There’s no escaping it. Nature itself shows we are meant to exist in
     relationships.
        For starters, each one of us is here only because of a relationship
     that resulted in our birth. And even after birth, infants cannot live but
     a few hours on their own. They need a relationship to survive; that is,
     they need at least one other person to take care of their physical needs.
     And almost as important as the physical are the mental needs, as well.
     Infants crave love, attention, and affection. From their youngest days
     infants are aware of, and respond to, human love—to touching, to
     words, to moods, to attitudes. Babies are made to bond, not with toys
     or with the bed, but with other people. The children who have loving,
     close parents to bond with are so much better adjusted than those who
     never had them. And that’s because we were made to be in relation -
     ship with other people.
        And yet, no matter how basic to our existence and identity as humans,
     something has gone wrong with our relationships. All around us we can
     see examples of relationships gone sour. Most of the pain and heartache
     we suffer as humans, we suffer because of bad relationships.
        But because God loves us, He obviously cares about our relation-
     ships, which form such an important part of our existence. Thus, He
     wants us to have good, healthy, affirming relationships. That’s why the
     Bible has so much to say about this crucial topic.

       Here, as we interact with others, the true measure of our walk with
     Christ will be revealed. Thus, as Christians, no aspect of our lives should
     be under the lordship of Jesus Christ more than our relationships.

     Relationship With God
       Though we all want good, healthy relationships with each other,
     that’s not always so easy to achieve. We are all sinners with defects
     that don’t always make us so easy to get along with.
       Crucial, however, to our relationship with others is our relationship
     with God. He created us, He alone can change us. Only through a
     close connection with the Lord can we have the kind of relationships
     with others that we should, ideally, have.

Read Matthew 22:36-39. How does what Jesus says here affirm what
     the lesson states above? Why is our relationship with God so
     important in helping us form the right relationships with others?
     What does God do to us that helps us have the right kind of rela-
     tionships with others?


Look up the following texts.How do they help answer the above ques-
     tions? Ps. 51:10, 2 Cor. 5:17-19, Gal. 4:19, 2 Pet. 1:4.


       When Job declared “For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He
     shall stand at last on the earth” (Job 19:25, NKJV, emphasis supplied),
     he was referring to more than simple awareness of a fact. This same
     Hebrew verb yada is used in Genesis 4:1 where Adam “knew” his
     wife, and she conceived and bore a son. Job was testifying concerning
     an intimate personal relationship. In an article entitled “Growth in
     Grace,” Ellen White shared the following insight: “To be living
     Christians, we must have a vital connection with Christ. The true
     believer can say, ‘I know that my Redeemer liveth.’This intimate com-
     munion with our Saviour will take away the desire for earthly and sen-
     sual gratifications. All our powers of body, soul, and spirit should be
     devoted to God.”—Review and Herald, May 30, 1882.

      How has your own relationship with God impacted your rela-
      tionships? Write down the practical, tangible ways in which
      knowing God has impacted how you relate to people. In what
      areas do you need to grow?

     The Gift of Marriage (Eph. 5:22-33).
       Marriage, like the Sabbath, is something we have taken from Eden.
     Sadly, though, many marriages today have hardly been made in para-
     dise. Probably few things better represent the extent of the damage sin
     has caused to human relationships than what it has done to marriage,
     something that was originally designed to bring fulfillment, happi-
     ness, and joy.

Read Genesis 2:24,a command that is repeated in Matthew 19:5 and
     Ephesians 5:31. Is this talking only about physical union, or is
     there more implied? If so, what?


       When Jesus Christ is Lord of our lives and Lord of our relation-
     ships, our perspective on marriage will be uniquely Christian. “Men
     and women can reach God’s ideal for them if they will take Christ as
     their helper. What human wisdom cannot do, His grace will accom-
     plish for those who give themselves to Him in loving trust. His prov-
     idence can unite hearts in bonds that are of heavenly origin. Love will
     not be a mere exchange of soft and flattering words. The loom of
     heaven weaves with warp and woof finer, yet more firm, than can be
     woven by the looms of earth. The result is not a tissue fabric, but a tex-
     ture that will bear wear and test and trial.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Adventist Home, pp. 112, 113.

      The Gift of Family
What insights can we gain from Psalms 127 and 128 about the gift of
      family?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         God has blessed each one of us with the gift of family. Whether we
      are single or married, with or without children, we are all part of a
      family circle. That family circle is extended exponentially when we
      become a part of God’s family! In all our family relationships, we who
      have been redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus and now live under
      His lordship should manifest a Christlike spirit and a loving conduct
      that are different from that of unbelievers.
         In the home, perhaps more than anywhere else, parents have a
      sacred obligation to live out the principles of their faith. Love, for-
      giveness, kindness, compassion, care, discipline—these principles are
      especially crucial. So many of the child’s early impressions about God
      are formed early on as a direct result of how the parents interacted
      with the child and with each other. Nothing done in the home occurs
      in a vacuum: The repercussions of our words, our body language, our
      tone, and our deeds are felt throughout the house, whether we realize
      it or not. And long after the deeds and words or even attitudes are past,
      the influences live on, often in the hearts and minds of the children,
      who are so malleable, so tender and sensitive. How crucial that par-
      ents, or anyone interacting with children, deal gently with them.

What counsel does the apostle Paul give to Christian families regard-
      ing the interaction between parents and children? Eph. 6:1-4.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        When caring for children within our circle of influence, the Lord
      Jesus Christ wants us to avoid two extremes: a harsh, tyrannical dis-
      position and a careless, indifferent attitude. Parents need to find the
      delicate balance between these two extremes, giving discipline and
      guidance when needed, while, at the same time, showing children the
      mercy and love and grace God has shown to them. It’s a sacred, and
      solemn, responsibility. Here, as in all relationships, parents need to
      learn from God at the foot of the Cross.

     The Gift of Community (Acts 2:41-47).
        Those who live under the lordship of Christ experience a unique
     sense of community. The Greek noun used in the New Testament to
     describe this community is koinonia, often translated as “fellowship.”
     Some scholars suggest that the “[koinonia] of the Holy Spirit,” spo-
     ken of by the apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 13:14 (NIV), may also be
     translated the “koinonia brought about by the Holy Spirit.” In other
     words, to the degree that we allow the Holy Spirit to work in our lives,
     to that degree we will have fellowship with one another.

Examine the description of the early Christian community in Acts
     2:41-47.Luke records that they continued steadfastly in koinonia.
     After reading the texts, answer the following questions:

       1. What kind of practical and theological unity did they manifest?


       2.What kind of fellowship did they have?


       3. In what practical ways did they relate to one another?


      4.What kind of witness did they, in their koinonia, present to the
     world?


        What a beautiful picture of the early church; what a powerful depic-
     tion of the very principles regarding relationships Jesus Himself
     taught and, of course, manifested in His life. Try to imagine what a
     force for good your local church could be were it to manifest such
     koinonia. What a powerful witness it would be (see John 13:35).

      What changes need to be made in your church in order for it to
      reflect better what we’ve learned today? Why, though, must
      those changes begin in the heart of each believer? What is the
      only way these changes can come?




                                                                          61

Further Study: When building relationships, the art of listening is
     crucial. We listen to God primarily through His Word and through His
     creative works. We listen to others as they communicate both verbally
     and nonverbally.
        Examine the following situations in the life of Jesus where He
     demonstrated the importance of listening when building relationships:
     John 3:1-21, 4:4-42.
        “The first service that one owes to others in the fellowship consists of
     listening to them. Just as love to God begins with listening to His Word,
     so the beginning of love for the brethren is learning to listen to them. It
     is God’s love for us that He not only gives us His Word but also lends
     us His ear. So it is His work that we do for our brother when we listen
     to him. . . . But Christians have forgotten that the ministry of listening
     has been committed to them by Him who is Himself the great listener
     and whose work they should share. We should listen with the ears of
     God that we may speak the Word of God.”—Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Life
     Together (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1954), pp. 97–99.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 In every aspect of our relationships with others, one crucial
      theme comes to the forefront,and it’s best expressed in the words
      of Matthew 16:24. Read those words aloud as a class.What’s the
      key principle there? Why is this principle so important in order

      lack meaningful relationships in their lives?

One Tiny Church
Juan Chauquian
   Along the rugged coast of Chile lie some isolated clusters of homes
called caletas. These settlements are too small to be called villages and are
extremely isolated. Some are little more than an extended family who
make a living by fishing or raising a few head of cattle. One of these set-
tlements is Caleta Milagros, a cluster of four families. Unless one has a
boat, it takes 14 hours to walk from the nearest settlement.
   Juan Chauquian and a friend had a burden for the people along the coast
of Chile who had never heard the three angels’messages. They walked the
rugged coastline looking for people who were willing to listen to Bible
truth. When he arrived at Caleta Milagros, he found the people wary of
strangers and hesitant to let them in.
   Juan and his friend knocked on each door, but were turned away. Then
they found someone who would invite them in. The two young men gave
the couple a copy of the “Faith of Jesus” Bible course and promised to
visit them again.
   In the next house they visited they found a lonely woman. But she told
them that her husband would be angry if she let them in. Juan talked gently
to the woman and put her at ease. Eventually she invited the two men in.
   The three talked and studied the Bible together for a half hour before the
woman’s husband returned home. He was angry to find two strange men
in his house and threatened to toss them out. But Juan talked gently to the
man, and he calmed down enough to listen. The four people talked about
God and the Bible for six hours that day. Before Juan and his friend left,
the husband apologized for his anger, saying he had misjudged Adventists.
He explained that because Adventists did not dance in the Spirit or speak
in tongues, he had assumed they did not accept the Holy Spirit.
   Before Juan and his friend left at 2:00 A.M., the entire family had
accepted the Bible truths and had asked for baptism. And the man who had
been so angry to find Adventists in his home began to tell his neighbors
what he had learned. In time the other two families in the settlement joined
the first family for Bible studies. Today if you were to visit Caleta
Milagros, you would find that everyone living there is an Adventist. The
families worship together in their homes. Because they have no pastor, the
family members take turns leading their little congregation. They would
not have heard about the Sabbath had it not been for two faithful lay work-
ers who were willing to go the extra miles for people they had never met.

Juan Chauquian is a lay worker living in Zaleta Manzana, Chile.

      Lord of Our Resources




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 8:7-18; Matt.6:19-
      21; 24:45-51; 1 Cor. 9:11-14; Phil. 4:11-13; Heb. 13:5; James 1:16,
      17.

Memory Text: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
      above, and comes down from the Father of lights,with whom there
      is no variation or shadow of turning” (James 1:17, NKJV).

Key Thought: Every good and perfect gift comes from above.
      We are not owners but stewards of the resources the Lord gra-
      ciously places at our disposal.

             he psalmist reminds us that “the earth is the Lord’s, and all its

      T      fullness, the world and those who dwell therein” (Ps. 24:1,
             NKJV). Every good and perfect gift we receive comes from the
      Father’s hand. The greatest gift of all was bestowed when God so
      loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. “He poured out
      all heaven to man in that one great gift. And then he completed the
      work by surrounding man with unlimited blessings, f avor upon favor,
      gift upon gift, opening to our view all the treasures of the future
      world.”—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, August 17, 1891.
         When we have been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we
      will recognize Him as Lord of all our resources, for all our resources
      have come only from Him and certainly not from ourselves. We, then,
      are stewards, not owners, and as stewards we identify ourselves with
      the Master, whose goods we have been given to oversee. We must
      accept the responsibilities of a steward and act in our Master’s stead.

      Giving Thanks for Every Good and
      Perfect Gift (James 1:16, 17).
What important truth does James reaffirm in his letter to the broth-
      ers and sisters in Christ scattered abroad? James 1:16, 17. What
      are some of these gifts? What error is he trying to help them avoid?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Our culture tells us we get what we earn, and we control what
      belongs to us. The Word of God, however, reminds us we get what we
      don’t deserve and that our possessions belong to God. Every good and
      perfect gift comes from above. Were it not for our loving heavenly
      Father, we would have no life, no meaning, and no future. The apostle
      Paul reminds us that “in Him we live and move and have our being”
      (Acts 17:28, NKJV).
         Think for a moment about the blessings you enjoy on a daily basis.
      Have any of us duly considered how much we have to be thankful for?
      What do you possess that didn’t, ultimately, have its origins in God,
      our Creator? Wealth, power, prestige, whatever you have, at its source
      it didn’t start with you but with God, who created all things. How
      important that we never forget that truth.

How does the Sabbath help keep this important truth before us on a
      weekly basis?

      Returning a Faithful Tithe
        The Lord gave the following command to the children of Israel
      through His servant Moses: “ ‘And all the tithe of the land, whether of
      the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s. It is holy
      to the Lord’ ” (Lev. 27:30, NKJV). The phrase “holy to the Lord”
      makes more sense when you understand that the idea of holy carries
      with it the notion of “set apart for holy use,” indicating the tithe is to
      be set apart for the Lord, to be used for Him and His purpose specif-
      ically, as opposed to other uses. It is something special, something dif-
      ferent from the rest of our “seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree.”

Read Malachi 3:8-10.Why does God call not paying tithe robbery?
      What does that imply about who owns it to begin with?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         We see various aspects of the tithing principle throughout the Bible.
      Abraham gave tithe to the priest of the Most High God, Melchizedek
      (Gen. 14:20), a fact that’s reemphasized in the New Testament book
      of Hebrews (see Heb. 7:2); Jacob, as well, understood the idea of
      tithing (Gen. 28:22); and, after the Exodus, God reaffirmed the law of
      tithing as a divine institution (Lev. 27:30-32; Num. 18:24, 26, 28;
      Deut. 12:6, 11, 17).
         “Because Abraham is the father of all believers, he is the model of
      tithe paying for Christians. As Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek, the
      priest of the Most High God, so New Testament believers give tithe to
      Christ, our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Heb.
      5:9, 10; 7:1-22).”—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 272.

Read 1 Corinthians 9:11-14. How do Paul’s words here help us
      understand an important principle behind our duty to pay a faith-
      ful tithe to the storehouse of the church?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

How is tithing a visible manifestation of our acknowledgment that all
      that we have comes from God? Why is tithing such an important
      act of faith?

      Laying Up Treasure in Heaven (Matt. 6:19-21).
Read Matthew 6:19-21. Rewrite the text in your own words, express-
      ing the essential message you believe the Lord is telling us here.


        However simple Christ’s words, the idea behind them is profound.
      Jesus warns us that things of this world are temporal, transitory, unsta-
      ble; why, then, put all your treasure where one day it will be swept
      away or lost forever? Why put your money in a bank that you know is
      going to collapse? The Lord is pointing us to eternal things, to heav-
      enly things, to things that long after this world and all that’s in it pass
      away will still be here.

Read 1 John 2:15-17. In what ways are these words saying to us the
      same thing that Jesus did in the above verses?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
How do you understand the exhortation of Jesus to “ ‘lay up . . . treas-
      ures in heaven’ ”? What specifically does this involve? See Luke
      12:16-21.
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Laying up treasure in heaven deals, not just with what we do with
      our money but with our whole lives. What are our priorities? What are
      our biggest concerns? How much of our life is spent on earthly,
      worldly, temporal things as opposed to spiritual and heavenly things?
      For example, how much time do we spend in prayer, Bible study, or
      witnessing as opposed to watching TV? Do our lives reveal that we,
      indeed, are not only preparing to meet Jesus but we are working to
      help others prepare, as well? Those who are laying up treasure in
      heaven are daily making decisions for the Lord; they are choosing
      obedience over sin, love over hatred, and others over self. In short, lay-
      ing up treasure in heaven is living the Christian life, a life marked by
      self-sacrificing love, a life that isn’t dominated by love of the world or
      the things in the world, where moths and thieves and rust exist.

       Dwell on Christ’s words, “ ‘Where your treasure is, there will
       your heart be also.’ ” Where’s your heart? What does your
       answer tell you about yourself and where your treasure is? Is it
       time to transfer your account?

                                                                              67

      Living as Faithful Stewards (Matt. 24:45-51).
Read the account in Matthew 24:45-51. What message is the Lord
      giving us here?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Look at the characteristics of the faithful and wise servant. He is
      doing what was expected of him. In other words, it wasn’t just that he
      had correct doctrine or theology. Perhaps all that was implicit in his
      actions. The point is, the man was obedient. Hence, the time of the
      master’s return wasn’t all that important; it made no difference when
      he came back, because, at any time, he would find his servant work-
      ing faithfully.
        Meanwhile, in contrast, it is easy for us to pass judgment on the
      unfaithful steward and condemn him for his waywardness. And yet,
      how many of us act in much the same way? We use the resources our
      Master has placed at our disposal to serve ourselves. We preoccupy our-
      selves with our own present desires and agendas, at the expense of what
      the Lord has asked us to do as stewards of the gifts He has given us.

Read again the texts for today. How did the evil servant manifest his
      wrong attitude toward the Lord? What did he do? What are some
      modern parallels to beating the servants and eating and drinking
      with the drunken? In other words, how might we, today, still
      awaiting the coming of Christ, manifest in our lives the same
      wrong attitude as the unfaithful servant?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Notice, too, the unfaithful steward didn’t believe that the Lord
      wasn’t coming back; he thought it was just going to be longer than
      first anticipated. What could better depict a danger that we as
      Adventists face—we who have long been expecting the Lord to come
      and who often talk (rightly or wrongly) about a “delay”? Have we,
      even subconsciously, changed how we live because we think the
      Lord’s coming is delayed?

       Suppose Christ came back yesterday. Would He have found you
       a faithful or an unfaithful steward? If the answer was the latter,
       what would you have done differently yesterday in order to have
       been deemed a faithful servant?

     Learning to Be Content
       “But godliness with contentment is great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6, NKJV).

       The noun translated “contentment” in 1 Timothy 6:6 implies self-
     sufficiency, “the state of one who supports himself without aid from
     others.” This state of being was highly valued by some of the philoso-
     phers in Paul’s day. While the apostle Paul also affirms contentment
     as a virtue, he suggests that, for the follower of Jesus, the source of
     contentment does not come from within but from without.

Study the following passages of Scripture that refer to “content-
     ment” or “being content” (Phil. 4:11-13, Heb. 13:5). How is a
     Christian able to experience contentment even in the most diffi-
     cult circumstances? In what ways have you experienced some of
     the things Paul is talking about in these verses? What lessons did
     you learn in these experiences? Give specific examples of your sit-
     uations and share them with your class.


        Our contentment is based upon our confidence in our Lord and
     Savior Jesus Christ. He is the One who strengthens us. He is our Rock,
     when everything else is shifting sand. He is our Surety, when every-
     thing else is uncertain. Apart from Jesus Christ, there is no true con-
     tentment.
        “Paul in this letter to Timothy would impress upon his mind the
     necessity of giving such instruction as should remove the deception
     which so easily steals upon the rich, that because of their riches they
     are superior to those who are in poverty, that because of their ability
     to acquire they are superior in wisdom and judgment—in short, that
     gain is godliness. Here is a fearful deception. How few heed the
     charge which Paul commissioned Timothy to make to the rich! How
     many flatter themselves that their acquisitiveness is godliness! Paul
     declares, ‘Godliness with contentment is great gain.’ Although rich
     persons may devote their whole lives to the one object of getting
     riches, yet as they brought nothing into the world, they can carry noth-
     ing out. They must die and leave that which cost them so much labor
     to obtain. They staked their all, their eternal interest, to obtain this
     property, and have lost both worlds.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
     for the Church, vol. 1, p. 541.

      Why does one not necessarily need to be rich in order to face the
      dangers Ellen White is talking about? Why is the imbalanced
      pursuit of anything worldly dangerous? What practical steps
      can we take to make sure we don’t get caught up in this trap?


                                                                          69

Further Study: Look at two case studies in stewardship. Compare
     the story of the rich fool with the story of Nicodemus.

     The Rich Fool: Luke 12:13-21
        “By the parable of the foolish rich man, Christ showed the folly of
     those who make the world their all. This man had received everything
     from God. . . . He did not realize that God had made him a steward of
     His goods that he might help the needy. He had a blessed opportunity
     of being God’s almoner, but he thought only of ministering to his own
     comfort.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 256.

     Nicodemus: John 3:1, 2; 19:38-40
        “Now, when the Jews were trying to destroy the infant church,
     Nicodemus came forward in its defense. No longer cautious and ques-
     tioning, he encouraged the faith of the disciples and used his wealth
     in helping to sustain the church at Jerusalem and in advancing the
     work of the gospel. Those who in other days had paid him reverence,
     now scorned and persecuted him, and he became poor in this world’s
     goods; yet he faltered not in the defense of his faith.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 105.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 What if everyone felt at liberty to place their tithe wherever
      they felt the urge to place it, as opposed to the church itself? It’s
      hard to see how the church could still function or even exist.
      What should this tell us about the importance of where we place
      our tithe? Discuss this issue as a class.

      ●
      2 How does the act of returning tithes and offerings help keep
      us from being greedy?

      ●3 Suppose someone were to come to your class and say, “Look,
      I just lost my job. I barely have enough money to pay the rent and
      feed my kids. I just can’t possibly return tithe . I can’t get by on
      what I have now.” What would you say to that person? What
      could you do for that person, as well?

Where’s Ina? part 1
Virgie Amora
   Ina is a widow who lives in a mountain village in the southern
Philippines. Ina is the local word for mother, and it fits Ina. Whenever
children in the village cry for their mother who is gathering food in the
forest, Ina comforts them. Whenever somebody in the village is sick, Ina
brings herbs and roots to treat them.
   Although Ina’s village has no Adventist members yet, Ina faithfully wor-
ships God with the school children. She hushes the noisy ones and
reminds them to listen to the teacher.
   When Ina gathers sweet potatoes from her garden plot for dinner, she
brings extras for the missionary teachers.
   When a storm tore half the roof from the missionary teachers’hut, Ina
came to help us fix it. She was everyone’s mother.
   One day Ina did not attend morning worship at the school. She did not
attend evening worship at the missionaries’ hut. They grew worried and
went to find her. Others searched for Ina too. “Ina! Ina!” the people called
at her hut. The door was open, but no one answered. Just then someone
inside the dark hut coughed. “Ina?” they called.
   A frail voice struggled to say, “Come in!” Quickly the teachers climbed
the stick ladder to the house, and inside they found Ina curled up under a
thin blanket, very weak, very sick.
   “What happened, Ina?” one missionary teacher asked, touching her hot
forehead. The teacher bathed her hot body and asked her if the children
could sing for her.
   “Please, sing, Maestra [teacher],” Ina said.
   The children began singing songs that Ina knew. Tears streamed down
Ina’s face. “Stop singing,” Ina whispered. “Stop singing and pray for me.”
   The group bowed their heads and prayed for Ina. “Dear God in heaven,
our Great Physician, please touch Ina and make her whole so that she can
again worship You.”
   After prayer Ina told the children, “Be good; love one another; obey
your parents, and love your teachers. God is coming soon to take us to
heaven. Now, sing,” she pleaded.
   Ina was still very sick when the missionary left the village for her
monthly trip to Mountain View College. Every step she prayed that she
would see Ina alive when she returned.

Virgie Amora is a student at Mountain View College in southern Philippines. She served as
a missionary teacher among the Manobo people.

      Lord of Our
      Body Temples


      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: John 1:1-4; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20;
      10:31; Gal. 3:13; Col. 1:16, 17; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19.

Memory Text: “Do you not know that your body is a temple of
      the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?
      You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore
      honor God with your body” (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20, NIV).

Key Thought: Our bodies are not disposable containers we can
      use and abuse according to our own desires.As trophies of God’s
      grace, redeemed by the precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      we should honor God with our bodies.The question is,How do we
      do that?

             ou are the temple of the living God. When the apostle Paul first

      Y      mentioned the word temple to the inhabitants of Corinth, they
             did not think of their own bodies; rather, they thought of the
      temple of Aphrodite, a place where worshipers engaged in sexual
      immorality with temple prostitutes. That’s probably why in his letters to
      the Corinthians Paul goes to great lengths to reeducate the new believ-
      ers concerning the temple where God dwells, which is in the hearts of
      those who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord. Paul declares,
      “You are the temple of the living God” (2 Cor. 6:16, NKJV), and “Your
      body is the temple of the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor. 6:19, NKJV). Thus, the
      most compelling reason to care for our bodies is not simply that we
      might extend our lifespan or enjoy better health now, but because we
      choose to honor God with our bodies, which are His gifts to us.

     All Things Were Made by Him (John 1:1-3).
       The New Testament writers boldly proclaim that the Lord Jesus
     Christ is not only the Messiah, the Son of the Highest, but He is also
     the Creator of the world. Thousands of years before the Son of God
     entered into humanity in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, He spoke
     the world into existence.

What three claims about the Word who became flesh does the apos-
     tle John make at the beginning of his Gospel record?
John 1:1, 2

John 1:3

John 1:4

        The apostle Paul also emphasizes the supremacy of Jesus Christ,
     Son of God, as the Creator of all things, and the One from whom we
     have even our life. Speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, the image of the
     invisible God, Paul writes, “For by him all things were created: things
     in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or pow-
     ers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.
     He is before all things, and in him all things hold together” (Col. 1:16,
     17, NIV).

Compare John 1:1-4 with Colossians 1:16, 17. How do they com-
     plement each other? What’s the key message of both?


       During His earthly ministry, the Lord Jesus Christ never explicitly
     claimed to be the Creator of all things. However, as we study His life
     and teachings, we find many evidences that point to His creative
     power. For example, when Jesus calmed the storm on the sea of
     Galilee, the astonished disciples exclaimed, “Who is this? Even the
     wind and the waves obey Him!” (See Mark 4:41, NIV.)

      With the few texts we read for today as background, read
      Genesis 2:7, the account of God making humanity. Notice the
      closeness, the intimacy, of the act, in contrast to how everything
      else in the Genesis account was made. What does that tell us
      about the basic meaning of our own personal existence, about
      who we are, about why we are here? What radically different
      conclusions can we draw about the meaning of our lives in con-
      trast to those who believe we are products of pure chance, noth-
      ing more? (See also Gen. 1:26, 27.)

                                                                           73

      Redeemed
        In yesterday’s study, we saw that the Bible very clearly reveals Jesus
      Christ as the Creator, the One who created all things, the One who
      spoke the world into existence, and the One who in a very intimate act
      breathed “the breath of life” into the first human being. Thus, we are
      not our own, in that we somehow created ourselves or put ourselves
      here out of our own volition, and, therefore, have an absolute claim
      over ourselves. On the contrary. As the objects of His specific act of
      creation, we belong to God, whose claim over us is greater than our
      claim over ourselves.

Read the last sentence of the above paragraph, specifically the itali-
      cized section. What are the implications of that thought? How
      should it impact how we live and the kind of decisions we make?
      When was the last time you made a decision based on the premise
      of that sentence?


        We might belong to God because He is our Creator, but, according
      to the Bible, that’s not His only claim over us.

Read the following texts.What are they saying, and how do they help
      us understand the Lord’s claims over us? Acts 20:28; Gal. 3:13;
      4:4, 5; Col. 1:14; Heb. 9:12; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19.


        In the Bible, the idea of being redeemed is to be ransomed, to be
      bought back, to be recovered, to be rescued, or to be set free. Through
      Jesus our Redeemer, all these things have happened to us, which
      means His claims over us are even greater than before, for now we are
      His, by both creation and redemption. And redemption might even be
      a greater claim, because simply being created doesn’t necessarily
      mean something good. After all, some people might curse their own
      existence and wish they had never been born. In contrast, as the One
      who redeemed us in an act that promises us a new existence in a world
      without sin or suffering, Christ has done something wonderful for us
      that nothing can diminish or destroy (see Dan. 2:44).

       Write out a prayer thanking God for what He has done for you
       as your Creator and Redeemer. How, then, do you want to
       respond to Him because of what He has done? What obligations
       do you feel toward God, and what motivates you to fulfill those
       obligations?

      The Temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19, 20).
        In his first epistle to the Christians in Corinth, the apostle Paul
      emphasized the importance of honoring God with our bodies. The
      Corinthian believers were facing some intense challenges. They lived
      in a city where sexual immorality was not only prevalent, it was
      encouraged. Satan was marring the image of God in unbelievers and
      believers alike. Promiscuity was not only plaguing the culture, it was
      permeating the church.

In Paul’s discussion of the damaging effects of sexual immorality, what
      two reasons does he give for honoring God with our bodies? 1 Cor.
      6:19, 20.


Summarize in a few lines what you believe Paul is telling us with
      these two verses. How should these truths impact our lives in a
      practical, daily way?


         As followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we cannot use and abuse our
      bodies with careless indifference. Too often, people say, “This is my
      life, and I can do what I want with it.” The Word of God challenges that
      self-centered philosophy. When Christians engage in harmful activity,
      they damage themselves personally and dishonor God publicly.

What are some other harmful activities that are inappropriate for
      those whose bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit? See Deut.
      21:20; Prov. 20:1, 25; 1 Cor. 10:31.

         Honoring God with our bodies involves more than refraining from
      sexual immorality. Once we recognize that our bodies are temples of
      the Holy Spirit, redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus, this realiza-
      tion will affect every aspect of our lives. We will not only seek to
      avoid defiling our body temple with any substance or activity that is
      harmful or inappropriate. We will also actively seek to care for our
      body temple and involve ourselves in activities that honor God.

       “What matters for the Christian is only the spiritual, not the
       physical.” How would you, from a biblical perspective, respond
       to this claim? How do you understand the strong link between
       the physical and the spiritual dimensions of humanity?




                                                                           75
        W E D N E S D AY August 24

     Do All to the Glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31).
        Having appealed to the believers in Corinth to avoid defiling their
     body temples through sexual immorality, the apostle Paul shares a
     principle that can guide every aspect of life: “So whether you eat or
     drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31,
     NIV). The Greek noun translated “glory” is the same word used as a
     verb in 1 Corinthians 6:19: “Honor God with your body.” The corre -
     lation between these two passages is clear. Because your body is the
     temple of the Holy Spirit, everything you do, including what you eat
     and what you drink, should be done to the honor of God.

How possibly does one “honor God” with one’s body, or how does one
     eat and drink “to the glory of God”? What does that mean? How
     do these above texts show us that God does care about what we eat
     and drink? Why would He care?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       We are physical beings. In the new heaven and the new earth, we
     will still be physical beings (see Rev. 21:4, 14). The idea that we are
     temples serves to prove even more so how sacred, and important, the
     physical aspect of our being is. No wonder, then, we are admonished
     to take care of ourselves, to use our bodies in ways that glorify the
     One who made them. Any kind of physical indulgence, any kind of
     bodily sin, any kind of abuse of our body simply defiles what God has
     created and given us.
       Also, if God loves and cares about us, then it should be no surprise
     that He wants us to take care of our bodies, which can be a source of
     much joy or so much suffering, often depending upon how we our-
     selves take care of them.

What do the following texts say about God’s attitude regarding our
     physical well-being? Exod. 15:26, Jer. 30:17, Mark 5:25-34, 3 John
     1:2.


      Read these words of Ellen White: “Since the laws of nature are the
      laws of God, it is plainly our duty to give these laws careful study.
      We should study their requirements in regard to our own bodies
      and conform to them.”—Testimonies for the Church, vo l .6 ,p .3 6 9 .
      What is she telling us here? How do these words reflect the prin-
      ciple Paul gave us in 1 Corinthians 10:31?

            T H U R S D AY August 25

     Shalom!
       Many people have heard of the Hebrew word shalom, understood as
     “peace.” It is sometimes used as an informal greeting among Jews today.

What do you think of when you think of the word peace? In what dif-
     ferent ways do you use that word in your language? What does it
     mean to you?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The word shalom itself has a very rich and deep meaning in the Old
     Testament, where it appears in one form or another hundreds of times.
     It carries within it the idea of completeness, good welfare, wholeness,
     soundness, well-being, inner harmony, and health. The word itself
     incorporates every aspect of life, including the physical, mental, and
     the spiritual, whether individually, collectively, or nationally.
        For example, in one of the earliest uses of the word, Jacob inquires
     about the well-being (shalom) of Laban (see Gen. 29:6). The word
     translated “well” both times in the text is shalom. In contrast, in
     Jeremiah 29:7, Jeremiah tells the Jews in captivity to pray for the
     shalom “of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away,”
     because, the Lord says, in the shalom of the city will be the shalom of
     the Hebrew captives.

Look up the following texts where shalom, in one form or another,
     appears. How does its use help us understand the meaning of the
     word in regard to our total health and spiritual well-being? Gen.
     43:28, Ps. 38:3 (the word translated “rest” in my bones is shalom),
     119:165, Prov. 3:2, Isa. 48:22, Jer. 33:6.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Bible calls Jesus, Sar-Shalom, “the prince of peace,” which
     makes sense because, in Him, through faith in Him, through obedi-
     ence to His law, both moral and physical, we can find “shalom,”
     wholeness, completeness, and well-being in our lives.

      As Adventists, we have been greatly blessed with a health mes-
      sage. How seriously do you take the light we have been given on
      health? What changes might you need to make to have more
      “shalom” in your own life?

                                                                         77

Further Study: The message of health reform, honoring God with
     our bodies, has always been important for Seventh-day Adventist
     Christians. God provided much guidance on the topic of health reform
     through the ministry of Ellen White. It is our privilege to share this
     message of honoring God with our bodies with the world. “It is
     impossible to work for the salvation of men and women without pre-
     senting to them the need of breaking away from sinful gratifications,
     which destroy the health, debase the soul, and prevent divine truth
     from impressing the mind. . . . Let the poor have the gospel of health
     preached unto them from a practical point of view, that they may know
     how to care properly for the body, which is the temple of the Holy
     Spirit.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 7, p. 137.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Since we are saved by God’s grace through faith and not by
      our own works, why does it really matter how we care for our
      body temples?

      ●
      2 In what ways, if any, can you see a link between holiness and
      healthful living? Is that idea found anywhere in Scripture?

      ●
      3 As a class, talk about what you might be able to do to help
      your own church members be more conscious regarding the need
      to take care of their bodies.

      ●
      4 What dangers do we face in emphasizing the importance of
      health and its link to faith and spirituality so that we don’t make
      those who are sick feel as if they were somehow facing the judg-
      ment of God?

      ●
      5 What role do dress and adornment have in the question of our
      body temples? What does Scripture say about this topic?

Where’s Ina? part 2
Jugen Densing
   After praying for Ina, Virgie, one of the student missionaries said
Goodbye and started down the trail to Mountain View College for the
monthly meeting. She pondered Ina’s promise: “I will live because you
prayed for me.”
  When Virgie returned to the village, the children ran to meet her. “Ina is
well! Ina is well!” they cried. Virgie hurried to Ina’s hut to see for herself.
  Ina was well. She was washed; her hair was combed; she was walking,
cooking, and comforting others. She welcomed her visitors and invited
them to come and hear of her healing. “It is a miracle!” Virgie whispered.
  Virgie learned that every day the children had gone to Ina’s house to
sing for her. They brought their picture roll and held worship in her little
hut, because Ina was too weak to join them in the school. When Jugen, the
missionary who had remained in the village, told the story about Jesus
raising the dead girl to life again, Ina promised, “I too will be well. This
Jesus, who can raise a dead girl to life, can heal me too.”
  When Jugen tried to bathe Ina, Ina refused. She was sure that she would
die if she bathed. But Jugen reminded Ina that she bathed in the cold river
often, and she was strong and well. Finally, after much protest and tears,
Ina was bathed and dressed. She smiled for the first time in days.
  On Sabbath morning Ina asked if she could attend worship. But Jugen
told her she was still too weak to go and should remain in her hut, where
she could listen. But during worship time, Ina struggled down her stick
ladder and tried to walk to the meeting place. She was too weak to walk,
so she crawled on hands and knees. When the children saw, they ran to
help her. Finally she was seated on a stick pew.
  “You should have stayed in your hut,” Jugen gently reminded Ina.
   “No,” Ina said. “I can’t lie there while you enjoy your beautiful stories
here. Don’t you worry about me, I’m going to be well!”
  What faith! Jugen thought.
  A few days later Ina was strong enough to walk. She made her way to
her garden to dig sweet potatoes. A few days after Virgie returned from
Mountain View College, Ina left to visit her sister in a village three hours’
walk away. Her simple faith in God had seen her through.

Jugen Densing is a student at Mountain View College in the Philippines. She and her fel -
low student missionaries live among the Manobo tribal people in the mountains to teach
the children and share God’s love.

      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:27, 28; 2:15;
      3:17-19; Matt. 25:14-30; Acts 10:36-43; Eph. 4:28; 2 Thess. 3:6-12.

Memory Text: “ ‘He who has two tunics,let him give to him who
      has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise’ ” (Luke 3:11,
      NKJV).

Key Thought: Those who live under the lordship of Christ will
      demonstrate excellence and productivity in their labor. The work
      of their minds and hands will bring honor to God and blessings to
      those around them.

             he dignity of labor. We are called, as followers of the Lord Jesus

      T      Christ, to set our minds on things above, not on things on the
             earth. However, at the same time, God also calls us to be pro-
      ductive in our daily labor. Commenting on Christ’s parable of the tal-
      ents, Ellen White notes that “God has called us to serve Him in the
      temporal affairs of life. Diligence in this work is as much a part of true
      religion as is devotion. . . . Every man and woman who is truly con-
      verted will be a diligent worker.”—Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 343.
        In this week’s lesson, we will explore the gift of work for those who
      have accepted Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. We will discover that
      excellence and productivity in our work are important parts of our
      witness as citizens of the kingdom of heaven.

      The Gift of Labor in Eden (Gen. 1:27, 28; 2:15).
        Contrary to a common notion, daily labor is not one of the negative
      consequences of living in a sinful world (the common notion that
      labor itself is bad, though, is a consequence of sin). Meaningful labor
      for the human family was part of God’s original and perfect plan.

What work assignment did the Creator give to our first parents? Gen.
      1:27, 28; 2:15. What was the nature of their work? Why should
      there be work in a sinless, perfect environment? What does the
      existence of work in such a context tell us about the idea of work
      in general?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The Garden of Eden was a flawless environment. All creation
      rejoiced together in perfect harmony. In this idyllic setting, God gave
      Adam and Eve a meaningful work assignment, both for the Garden
      itself and for the world in general. Their whole relationship with the
      created world around them wasn’t limited to just enjoying it; they
      were, rather, to interact with it. In fact, they were to rule over the cre-
      ated world; thus, in a sense, they were gardeners-rulers, working in
      their garden home while ruling over the earth and the things in it.
      Created out of that world, they were distinctly part of it, working in it
      as laborers while at the same time given rule over it, an interesting
      combination of roles, to be sure.

Given the nature of humanity and our capacity to grow, to learn, to
      be changed, why do you think God wanted our original parents,
      even in a sinless environment, to work and to have responsibilities?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       In what ways does your labor, whatever kind it is, offer you
       opportunities to grow, to mature, to learn? What could you do
       in order to take advantage of whatever opportunities your work
       does offer you toward growth and maturity?




                                                                              81

     The Challenges of Labor After the Fall
     (Gen. 3:17-19).

       The entrance of sin into our world resulted in numerous negative
     consequences. The most devastating consequence was death. Long
     before Adam and Eve experienced death personally, they would wit-
     ness the horrifying consequence of their sin in the death of Abel at the
     hands of his brother Cain. Sin not only affected the human family; it
     also affected the environment.

Read prayerfully and carefully Genesis 3:17-19. How did the
     entrance of sin affect the environment and our interaction with it?
     How do you understand what God is saying in these texts? Were
     these changes purely a punishment of sin, or were they the natu-
     ral results of sin?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       It is not clear how much time elapsed after God created the world
     before sin marred the perfect creation. Undoubtedly, Adam and Eve
     enjoyed the privilege of laboring in that wonderful setting. With the
     entrance of sin, however, the environment became harsh and hostile.
     Our first parents were now compelled to labor by the sweat of their
     brow. The cycle of deterioration and death in the natural environment
     would be a constant reminder of their own mortality as well as a stark
     contrast to the Eden they had once enjoyed.

A quick reading of those texts sounds as if the Lord was being
     very harsh in punishing them. Yet, if you read below the surface,
     what else can you see here? In other words,in what ways could the
     Lord have used these changes to help Adam and Eve?


        “It was God’s purpose to alleviate by toil the evil brought into the
     world by man’s disobedience. By toil the temptations of Satan might
     be made ineffectual, and the tide of evil stayed. And though attended
     with anxiety, weariness, and pain, labor is still a source of happiness
     and development, and a safeguard against temptation. Its discipline
     places a check on self-indulgence, and promotes industry, purity, and
     firmness. Thus it becomes a part of God’s great plan for our recovery
     from the fall.”—Ellen G. White, Messages to Young People, p. 213.

      What examples have you seen, if any, of how work can be used
      for our spiritual benefit?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        2.Whose example should they follow, and in what?___________

      evangelists worked to earn their bread?___________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        4.What was Paul’s attitude toward those who refused to work?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        5. How would you sum up the essence of what Paul is writing
      here? What principles are here that we, today, should apply to our
      own lives and how we relate to work and to those who don’t work?

      ____________________________________________________________________

       6. In what kind of situations might those who are not working
     be excused for not working? What, then, is your responsibility
     toward such a person?_____________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       When we are productive in our labor, we are blessed in many ways.
     We are able to provide for the needs of our families and loved ones.
     Our productivity also brings honor to the Lord we serve. Whether we
     are ploughing a field, caring for the sick, working in the home, or
     operating a small business, we can use this time of labor for the honor
     of our Lord and the blessing of those around us. Such is the attitude
     of an individual who is living under the lordship of Christ.

       “If any would not work, neither should he eat.” How do you
       relate to this admonition with the whole idea of grace, of for-
       giveness, of treating people better than they deserve, just as
       Christ has treated us better than we deserve?


                                                                         83

     Laboring for the Benefit of Others
What principle regarding labor did the apostle Paul share with the
     believers in Ephesus? Eph. 4:28.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The apostle Paul practiced what he preached. Speaking to the
     Ephesian elders before leaving Miletus, he said, “ ‘I have coveted no
     one’s silver or gold or apparel. Yes, you yourselves know that these
     hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with
     me’ ” (Acts 20:33, 34, NKJV, emphasis supplied). Paul’s teaching in
     words and life reminds us of the counsel of another servant of our Lord
     Jesus Christ. John the Baptist challenged his hearers to let the fruits of
     their labors bless the lives of those around them: “ ‘He who has two
     tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him
     do likewise’ ” (Luke 3:11, NKJV).

Read James 2:14-20.What important message does he have for those
     who profess to be saved by faith alone? How does this counsel help
     us understand what saving faith is?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        What’s fascinating about James’s words is the kind of works he
     links with faith. We often tend to think of works as not stealing, not
     killing, not breaking the Sabbath, and so forth, which, of course, are
     all part of what it means to follow Christ. Yet, James here talks about
     something else, that of taking care of those around us who are in need.
     Just saying nice things to them or just offering a prayer for them isn’t
     enough. James is giving us an example of the kind of works that reveal
     true faith. As Christians, we need to be careful that we don’t, as did
     the Pharisees, get caught up in “ ‘tithe of mint and anise’ ” while
     ignoring the weightier matters of the law, “ ‘judgment, mercy, and
     faith’ ” (Matt. 23:23).

      Helping the poor requires two things: time and money. How
      much of your time, how much of your money, are you willing to
      spend helping those in need around you? What does your
      answer say about the kind of faith you have?

      L aboring as We Await Our Lord ’s
      R e t u rn (Matt. 25:14-30).
        The Lord Jesus Christ told a parable that emphasized the impor-
      tance of using every resource to its full potential while we await His
      return.

Read the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30. What lessons can
      we learn for our lives today? What message is Jesus giving to us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “There is not one human being to whom is not committed some tal-
      ent, not one but has a work to do for the Lord. Not one is to be
      excused. Not one is to remain in idleness; but every man is required
      to do his best; the talents entrusted to him are to be used in conse-
      crated service for the Master.”—Ellen G. White, “Redeem the Time
      Because the Days Are Evil,” Review and Herald, April 21, 1896.
        What’s fascinating, too, about this parable is that it comes right after
      the parable of the foolish virgins (see Matt. 25:1-13), which has an
      emphasis more on the life of faith, devotion, and prayer, which leads to
      the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Right after comes the para-
      ble of the talents, which deals with the active Christian life, not of just
      praying and believing and studying but of outward work for the Master.
        The principle here, though, doesn’t have to be limited only to our
      work for the Lord. In all our work, all our labor, we should seek to go
      about our tasks with faithfulness and diligence as did the faithful serv-
      ants.

How do we understand this parable in light of the concept of salva-
      tion by faith alone? (Rom. 3:28, 4:1-13, Gal. 2:16).


         Our faith will be revealed in our works, in what we do with the gifts
      God has given us. We cannot separate our Christianity from how we
      live; and how we live cannot be separated from how we work, how we
      do our job, whatever it is. In the workplace, faithful, thorough, dili-
      gent, and honest labor can be a powerful expression of our faith, as
      well as a powerful witness to the God we serve.

       If all someone knew about your faith was from how you went
       about your work, what impressions would they likely receive
       about your faith?


                                                                              85

        Some individuals are called to full-time service for God. They have
     the privilege and responsibility of devoting their complete attention to
     kingdom business. Ellen White spoke of this call to full-time ministry
     in a letter written at the beginning of the last century: “Many young
     men and women now engaged in secular labor will feel earnestly
     stirred to give themselves to the service of God, to become channels
     of light. . . . Let these be given an opportunity to obtain an education
     for the work of God. And let all God’s workers help and cheer and
     encourage one another with their prayers and faithful conversation,
     impressing one another with the dignity and responsibility of the work
     in which they are engaged.”—Letter 66, 1901, Manuscript Releases,
     p. 44.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 How does the Sabbath fit in with this whole question of labor?
      What message does the Sabbath tell us regarding our labor?

      ●
      2 How do you understand the basic message of this week’s study
      with the words in Galatians 6:2?

      ●
      3 In every generation, God raises up women and men who
      honor Him in their labor. Think about your own culture. Who
      comes to mind as an individual whose labor has brought glory to
      God and blessing to others?

      ●4 Is there anyone in your own church family out of work right
      now? If so, what can you do as a church community to help (1) pro-
      vide for his or her family’s immediate needs and (2) find the per-
      son work?

      ●5 “But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of
      his own house, he hath denied the faith,and is worse than an infi-
      del” (1 Tim. 5:8). As a class, discuss the implications of this text in
      regard to how you would treat someone who refuses to provide
      for his own family.

The Boy Who Heard
God Speak
John McGhee
   Boldera sat on his pony watching the clouds scurry across the
Mongolian sky. The hot August sun beat down on the treeless plain where
his 200 thirsty sheep bleated their protest. The 12-year-old guided his
pony around the herd to turn them away from the nearby railroad tracks.
He was not willing to lose even one sheep.
   Later, as the sheep drank at a spring, Boldera sat astride his pony and
spoke into the wind: “Creator of the sky and the earth, talk to me; teach
me about life.”
   Boldera again rounded up a few sheep who had surged toward the rail-
road tracks. He noticed a scrap of paper lying on the tracks. Sliding off his
pony, he picked up the paper and read its words, “Suppose one of you has
a hundred sheep and loses one of them. . . . When he finds it, he joyfully
puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and
neighbors together and says, Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.
I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over
one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do
not need to repent” (Luke 15:4-7, NIV).
   Other scriptures on that dirty, wrinkled scrap of paper spoke of God’s
desire for Boldera to repent. Boldera knelt in the tall brown prairie grass
and prayed to this God whom he did not yet know. “Creator of the sky, You
have spoken to me. I repent and ask You to forgive my sins. Car ry me on
Your shoulders as You did that lost sheep. Be my Shepherd.”
   God led Boldera from his perch atop his pony to the city of Darkhan,
Mongolia, where he met other Christian believers. There he learned more
about the Savior to whom he had prayed. He gave his life to Christ and
pledged to follow Him wherever He led.
   Four years later Boldera continues to worship God in Darkhan. Today he
is a soft-spoken teenager, leader of his 43-member Youth Alive club.
   Boldera still has that tattered scrap of paper that led him to God. And he
has a special burden to reach the other Mongolian shepherd boys with the
gospel. He wants them to know the Creator and recognize His voice when
He speaks.

      Lord of Our Worship




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalms 47; 63:1-4; 95:6,
      7; 99:9; 150; John 2:13-16; Acts 4:24-31; Col. 3:16; Rev. 5:8-14;
      14:6, 7.

Memory Text: “Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us
      kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the
      people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand” (Psalm 95:6, 7,
      NKJV).

Key Thought: Those who live under the lordship of Christ will
      find their greatest joy in worshiping God the Father, Son, and
      Holy Spirit in spirit and in truth.

               od is seeking true worshipers. Every human being will

      G        inevitably worship someone or something. Our choice is not
               whether or not we will worship but rather what or whom we
      will worship. During His earthly ministry, the Lord Jesus Christ
      emphasized the importance of worship, both in His actions and also in
      His teachings. Whether in the temple, in a synagogue, or out on a
      mountainside, Jesus took time to worship His heavenly Father. On one
      occasion, when meeting with a woman at Jacob’s well, Jesus shared
      the startling news that God is actively seeking true worshipers.
      According to Jesus, true worshipers are those who worship God “ ‘in
      spirit and truth’ ” (John 4:23, NKJV).
        In this week’s study, we will explore the theme of worship as it
      relates to those who live under the lordship of Christ.

     The Focus of Our Worship
       There is only One who is worthy of worship. When Satan urged
     Jesus to bow down and worship him, our Lord responded:
       “ ‘Away with you, Satan! For it is written, “You shall worship the
     Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve” ’ ” (Matt. 4:10, NKJV).

What are some reasons given in the Scriptures for worshiping God?

           _______________________________________________________________

       Even though the Scriptures clearly testify that God alone should be
     the focus of our worship, there are times when individuals attempt to
     direct their worship elsewhere. For example, when the apostle John
     encountered an angelic being, he fell down in worship. He received
     the following rebuke from the heavenly messenger: “ ‘See that you do
     not do that! . . . Worship God!’ ” (Rev. 19:10, NKJV).

Read Acts 14:8-18.How did the inhabitants of Lystra respond to Paul
     and Barnabas after a crippled man was healed in Jesus’ name?
     Why were their actions so understandable? In what ways might
     we, today, in the twenty-first century, be tempted to do the same
     thing; that is, worship something other than God?


       The inhabitants of Lystra brought sacrificial animals and wanted to
     worship Paul and Barnabas, saying, “ ‘The gods have come down to
     us in the likeness of men’ ” (Acts 14:11, NKJV). Ellen White notes
     that even though “Paul endeavored to direct their minds to the true
     God as the only object worthy of worship, it was still most difficult to
     turn them from their purpose.”—Sketches From the Life of Paul, p. 58.

      If someone were to ask you,Why do you worship the God that
      you do, what answer would you give? How do you justify wor-
      shiping a Being you have never seen, whose mere existence even
      you have to take on faith? Write a paragraph or two that clearly
      and simply gives your reasons (read them to one another in class
      on Sabbath).

     Sabbath and Worship
       It is our privilege to worship our Creator moment by moment. Every
     time we lift our hearts and voices to God in worship, we join with the
     heavenly beings before His throne who worship Him day and night.
     Through silent prayers of thanksgiving and praise, we can worship our
     God anytime, anywhere (see 1 Thess. 5:17). In many ways, our per-
     sonal, private devotion and worship are more important than what we
     might do as part of a community.
        Nevertheless, there are special times for worship, distinct from
     whatever we might do throughout our normal daily routine. This was
     seen, in principle, in the ancient Hebrew feasts, where numerous times
     were set apart for various acts of worship and thanksgiving (see Lev.
     23:4-44).
       Yet, more universal than the Jewish feasts is the seventh-day
     Sabbath, which has been set apart by our Creator as a time for all
     God’s people, Jews or Gentiles.

Read Genesis 2:1-4.What do you see in there that shows the univer-
     sality of the seventh day; that is, why it was not set aside simply for
     one group of people but for all humanity?

      What is it about the Sabbath commandment itself (Exod. 20:8-
      11) that gives us a special opportunity for worship we might not
      have at any other time? How well do you avail yourself of that
      opportunity? What changes might you need to make to get the
      best out of the Sabbath that it offers?

     A Heart for Worship
Read David’s song of thanksgiving in 1 Chronicles 16:8-36. What
     does it mean to “worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness” (vs.
     29)? Read John 4:23, 24 for further insights.


        Holiness in the Bible gives the idea of something “set apart for holy
     use.” In a real sense, worship is just that, setting aside not just time but
     setting aside ourselves for special communion and interaction with
     God. It’s our way of saying, “How great Thou art, and how unworthy
     I am.” It’s our way of acknowledging our total dependence upon
     Christ’s righteousness as our only means of salvation. It’s a time to
     cease from work, from play, from everything else we do and pour our-
     selves out in praise and adoration of the One who’s the Source of all
     that we are, the One whose death on the cross has opened the door to
     heaven for all who will walk through.
        Yet, true worship is so much more than merely forms, songs, or a
     liturgy. It’s, in a real sense, a work, a human expression of gratitude
     for who God is and the great things He has done for us through Jesus.
     Just as John said, “This is the love of God, that we keep His com-
     mandments” (1 John 5:3, NKJV), we also reveal our love for God by
     worshiping Him. It’s a different kind of expression of love than that of
     keeping His commandments, but it’s an expression nonetheless.
     Certainly this was part of what Jesus talked about when He said we
     would worship the Lord in “spirit and in truth.”

Keeping the above idea in mind, what do you think motivated
     Jesus to do what He did at the temple? John 2:13-16.


       Worship, like anything that’s repeated, faces the danger of becom-
     ing mechanized, routine. Once we cease worshiping God out of sin-
     cere love for who He is and what He has done for us, our worship can
     go in any one of a number of unhealthy directions. The temple serv-
     ices during Jesus’ time on earth had become cold, formal, and busi-
     nesslike. The same can happen now; or they can become a means of
     entertainment or a social gathering where the Lord could look upon us
     and say: “With their lips [they] do honour me, but [they] have
     removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by
     the precept of men” (Isa. 29:13).

      Think of two different worship experiences you have had: one
      where you left exuberant,uplifted,encouraged in your faith; the
      other, where you left downbeat, discouraged, cold.What caused
      the crucial difference between the two?

                                                                              91

      The Expressions of Our Worship
        As we search the Scriptures, we discover that through the ages wor-
      shipers have expressed their devotion to God in a variety of ways.

What expressions of worship do you find in the following passages of
     Scripture? As you read these texts, ask yourself: What kind of
     environment do they seem to speak of, something morose, solemn,
     or something joyful and exuberant? Is something automatically
     holy if it’s somber, or is it automatically irreverent if joyful?
     Psalms 47, 63:1-4, 149:3, 150.


        Music has always played an important role in worship. The heav-
     enly courts are filled with songs of praise (see Rev. 5:9, 10; 15:3, 4).
     When we express our worship to God through music, we are privi-
     leged to join in that symphony of praise. “Music forms a part of God’s
     worship in the courts above, and we should endeavor, in our songs of
     praise, to approach as nearly as possible to the harmony of the heav-
     enly choirs. . . . Singing, as a part of religious service, is as much an
     act of worship as is prayer. The heart must feel the spirit of the song,
     to give it right expression.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 594.

How do you understand Paul’s counsel that, when singing psalms and
     hymns and spiritual songs, we should sing with grace in our
     hearts to the Lord? Col. 3:16.


       There are musical performances that may be entertaining or aes-
     thetically pleasing, but they bear no traces of the grace of God. Only
     music that flows forth from a heart that has been touched by the grace
     of our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, is worship that’s “in
     spirit and in truth.”

       What is your favorite worship song, a song that really moves
       your heart? Why not sing it now and offer praises of thanks-
       giving to the Lord?

      The Impact of Our Worship
        When we worship God in spirit and truth, we will experience per-
      sonal transformation. It is impossible to stand in the presence of the
      Holy and remain unchanged.

Consider the experience of the early Christians as they gathered
      together for worship, as recorded in Acts 2:46, 47. What was the
      impact of their worship?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         True worship impacts us personally. The psalmist David declared,
      “I was glad when they said to me, ‘Let us go into the house of the
      LORD’ ” (Ps. 122:1, NKJV). He had discovered that in God’s presence
      “is fulness of joy” (16:11). We experience joy when we worship God
      in spirit and in truth. Though there’s always the danger of getting car-
      ried away with hype and emotionalism (as seen in certain types of
      church services), there’s also the danger of our worship being cold,
      dead, and lifeless worship that’s neither in spirit or in truth.

Though worship is nothing if not a personal expression of faith, the
      Bible talks about corporate worship, about coming together and
      worshiping as a community. How, for example , were the lives of
      the early Christians impacted by the time of prayerful worship
      following the release of Peter and John from prison? Acts 4:24-31.
      What can we learn from this account about what corporate wor-
      ship should do for us?

         The early Christians left their times of worship filled with joy, ready
      to speak the Word of God boldly. They were strengthened and encour-
      aged by the others’ expression of faith, of testimony, and of their love
      for God. This should be our experience, as well. We should draw faith,
      hope, and encouragement from others, just as others should draw these
      things from us. Corporate worship should bring us closer to God and
      to one another; it should fill us with a desire to proclaim the great news
      of Christ and Him crucified. If this isn’t your experience, you haven’t
      worshiped; you’ve just gone through the motions of a religious service.

       Write down your understanding of what true corporate wor-
       ship should be about. Might you have some notions that need to
       be changed? Compare notes in class.



                                                                             93

Further Study: Worship and the Cross. Go through the New
     Testament and find some texts on Christ’s death for us on the cross.
     Dwell on what that death means; write out your understanding of His
     death and the forgiveness it offers you. Pray over it and ask the Lord
     to help you grasp the fullness of what Christ has done.
       Afterward, you will be filled with a desire to worship Him, for of all
     the reasons we have to worship God, none is better than because of the
     Cross.
        It will be the privilege of the redeemed to worship God throughout
     the ceaseless ages of eternity. We will come from every kindred,
     nation, tongue, and people. Our cultural heritage will be different, but
     our worship will blend in a beautiful symphony of praise. “Heaven
     and earth will unite in praise, as ‘from one Sabbath to another’ (Isa.
     66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to God and
     the Lamb.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 770.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, have different people express what their under-
      standing of what an ideal worship service would be like. What
      differences are there between your views? Are there fundamental
      differences or simply differences in taste and style? Most impor-
      tant, what does Scripture teach us about proper worship?

      ●2 How can our worship reflect more clearly the worship of God
      in the courts above? See Revelation 4, 5, and 19:1-7.

      ●
      3 What changes have you observed in the way people worship?
      To what extent are those changes cultural rather than biblical?
      How much of a role should culture play in worship? Is there any
      one “right” way to worship the Lord?

      ●4 Worship services can either turn crusty, stale, and formal, or
      they can turn into “sanctified” entertainment.In which direction
      does your local church lean? What changes might you need to
      make, and how can you make them?

Man on Fire
L. Fortunet Kalou
  Fortunet was a college student in West Africa when his sister introduced
him to the Adventist faith. He was not interested, for he planned a great
career.
  One day he found a Bible on a bus. No one claimed it, so he began read-
ing it. He read about the Sabbath and began asking questions. Soon he
joined his sister in church.
  Sabbath conflicts at school led him to quit. He found work with ADRA,
teaching Liberian refugees. Although he could not share his faith while
working, he organized a Bible study group after work. Fortunet discovered
that he loves evangelism.
   He was invited to become a Gospel Outreach worker in Guinea. He and
a partner were given a small stipend and sent to a town in central Guinea
to establish a congregation of new believers.
  Fortunet and his partner visited every home and church in the area and
discovered that the people knew nothing about Adventists. When the peo-
ple learned that these missionaries worship on Sabbath, they wondered
about that. Some remembered that long ago their forefathers had not
worked on Saturdays, which they considered a “bad” day. This roused
curiosity in some, and they asked many questions. Fortunet used transla-
tors to study with the people. The translators learned the gospel as they
taught it to others. In the first year the pair celebrated 11 baptisms.
  They began working in nearby areas. One man, Jonas, studied the Bible
with them for months but made no decision to follow Christ. Then one day
as he worshiped in his own church, he felt no desire to pray or sing. Jonas
realized that because he was not following God’s leading, he was not
receiving God’s blessing. He took a stand for Christ and joined the
Adventist believers.
   Jonas was so excited about his new faith that he began preaching in the
marketplace. Some people don’t like Jonas’s blunt methods of preaching,
but they cannot deny that God has touched him. Some have come to Christ
because of Jonas’s marketplace evangelism.
   One big challenge facing evangelism in Guinea is literacy. People do not
speak or read French, and no Bible is available in their native languages.
This makes evangelism more difficult.
  The new believers worship in a rented house which is too small to
accommodate those who wish to come.

L. Fortunet Kalou is a Gospel Outreach missionary in Guinea, West Africa.

        LESSON             12 *September 10-16
      Lord of Our Service




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 10:38-42, John 13:1-
      15, Rom. 12:4-8, 1 Cor. 12:28–13:3.

Memory Text: “ ‘You know that those who are considered rulers
      over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise
      authority over them.Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever
      desires to become great among you shall be your servant’ ” (Mark
      10:42, 43, NKJV).

Key Thought: Our Lord Jesus Christ provides the ultimate
      example of service. He reminds us that “ ‘the Son of Man did not
      come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for
      many’ ” (Mark 10:45, NKJV). As followers of Jesus Christ, we are
      called to serve in Jesus’name.

                 hen we receive Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord, He invites

      W          us to follow in His steps. This is not a call to greatness as the
                 world counts greatness. Rather, it is a call to service. It is a
      call to have the mind of Christ, who humbled Himself in the form of a
      servant. Like the disciples, we often find ourselves struggling for the
      place of honor, the position of authority. But Jesus lovingly reminds us,
      both in word and in life, “it shall not be so among you” (Matt. 20:26).
        We are called first and foremost to serve our Lord and Savior Jesus
      Christ and then to serve others in Jesus’ name. We will serve, not out of
      compulsion but out of love for Him, who loved us and gave Himself for
      us. That’s the only service that’s truly acceptable in His eyes, service
      born out of a heart of love for God and others.

     The Example of Jesus (John 13:1-15).
       Only the apostle John records the story. Not a word from Matthew,
     Mark, or Luke. Not a single reference in the writings of Peter or Paul.
     And yet, when you read this story, it reminds you so much of the char-
     acter of Jesus.

How did the conduct of Jesus in the upper room demonstrate His
     willingness to serve rather than to be served? John 13:1-15.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The foot-washing service is an opportunity for Christians to re-
     affirm their need for spiritual cleansing through faith in Jesus Christ
     as their Savior and Lord. Jesus made this point clear when He said
     “ ‘He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely
     clean’ ” (John 13:10, NKJV) and “ ‘If I do not wash you, you have no
     part with Me’ ” (John 13:8, NKJV).
        However, the foot-washing service is not only an opportunity to say
     Yes again to Jesus as your Savior and Lord. It is also an act of serv-
     ice. Jesus provided for the disciples, and for each one of us, a perfect
     example of service. He had every right to sit back and let someone
     else serve, but Jesus humbled Himself. He made Himself of no repu-
     tation, taking the form of a servant.

Explore some other incidents in the earthly ministry of Jesus that
     demonstrate His willingness to serve. What can we learn from
     these stories about the call to service? Mark 1:32-34, Luke 9:12-17,
     John 2:1-12.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus demonstrated, both in word and deed, that He came to serve
     rather than to be served. When He calls you to deny yourself, take up
     your cross, and follow Him; He is calling you to a life of service.

      When was the last time you went out of your way to do a serv-
      ice for someone who had no possibility of repaying you, a serv-
      ice that took your time, your money, or both, a service that
      offered you nothing (at least in tangible goods) in return? What
      does your answer tell you about yourself?


                                                                          97

     Our Greatest Service
       Of all the good things we can do for others, the greatest is to lead
     them into a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, the One who, at the
     cross, paid for the sins of every human being. And if we believe that
     every Christian is commissioned to share this good news of Christ’s
     sacrifice with the world, the question is not whether we should witness
     to others, but how. Here again, we can learn from the example of
     Jesus. “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the
     people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good.
     He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won
     their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’ ”—Ellen G.
     White, The Ministry of Healing , p. 143.

Dwell on what the Lord’s servant wrote above and go through some
     of the Gospels and note specific examples of where Jesus was
     doing what she wrote. See, for example, Matt. 12:9-14, Mark 2:15-
     17, Luke 19:2-7. After you find some examples, answer this ques-
     tion: Even if I can’t perform these same kinds of miracles, how
     can I, nevertheless, minister as Jesus did?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Christ’s method of reaching souls, however, took something that
     many of us, even professed Christians, don’t want to give: And that is
     ourselves. Oftentimes we might be tempted to think that throwing
     some money in a collection plate for a mission offering or handing out
     a few flyers for an evangelistic series is enough. And though these acts
     have their role, they are not the same as mingling with people, spend-
     ing time with people, and ministering to their needs. To do this we
     need to give of ourselves in unselfish service. That’s not always easy;
     it takes a painful death to self and a willingness to serve the Lord by
     serving others. Only through a daily commitment, a daily taking up of
     our own cross, will we be doing what we could for the Lord through
     ministering to others. This is the essence of Christian service, and it
     can open hearts to our message in ways that all the argumentation,
     Bible studies, and prophecy charts could never do.

      Think of individuals within your sphere of influence who need to
      hear the gospel message. What are some practical ways that you
      can use Christ’s method to reach them? Also, are you willing to
      make the personal sacrifices needed in order to reach them?

     Varieties of Service
        “And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondar-
     ily prophets,thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of heal-
     ings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues” (1 Cor. 12:28).

       We are all called to share the good news about Jesus Christ with
     others. This is our greatest service, and we will be effective when we
     follow Christ’s method for reaching people. It is important to realize,
     however, that the way in which we serve others will vary, based upon
     our personality and spiritual gifts. We are not all called to do the same
     thing. Part of the death to self required for Christian service is being
     willing to accept just what our gifts and callings are and are not.

Make a list of various forms of service recorded in Romans 12:4-8
     and 1 Corinthians 12:28–13:3.In what ways do you sense the Lord
     calling you to serve others in His name? Justify your reasons.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       When we consider the various ways Christians are called to serve in
     Jesus’ name, a natural question to ask is this: “In what ways is the
     Lord calling me to serve?” Every follower of Jesus Christ has to
     answer that question personally, but here is a process that might be
     helpful.

     Step 1: Explore the forms of service found in Scripture. The list you
             just made is not exhaustive. Other forms of service can be
             found in narrative passages of Scripture.
     Step 2: Experiment with various forms of service. As you ser ve oth-
             ers in a variety of ways, be attentive to your own thoughts
             and feelings. When you serve others using the gifts the Lord
             has given you, you will experience freedom and joy.
     Step 3: Be attentive to the counsel of brothers and sisters in Christ.
             The Lord frequently uses people either to confirm the fruit-
             fulness of your service or to suggest alternate forms of serv-
             ice that might be more appropriate, based upon the gifts they
             observe in your life.

      How were you able to identify the gifts the Lord has given you?
      How are you using those gifts in service for others? Might you
      need to make changes in how you work, or maybe you should be
      doing something else entirely?


                                                                           99

      Examples of Service
        The New Testament is filled with examples of men and women,
      boys and girls, who served others in Jesus’ name. Some well-known
      examples include Andrew, when he brought his brother Simon to
      Jesus (see John 1:40-42), and Dorcas, who sewed garments for those
      in need (see Acts 9:36-39).
         You may find it interesting and educational to select a book of the
      Bible and read it entirely, looking for examples of service.

Skim through the book of Acts, which contains numerous examples
      of service in Jesus’name. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you identify
      examples of service you might imitate in your own life. (Or per-
      haps you might find another book and do the same thing.)

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        When we serve others in Jesus’name, we are not only following the
      example of our Lord. We are giving evidence of His transforming
      presence in our lives. We are no longer self-centered and self-serving.
      Rather, we find joy in serving others. There is a power in unselfish
      service for others that no force in the world can negate. Again, for sin-
      ful beings who are inherently self-centered and selfish, this doesn’t
      necessarily come easy. Daily surrender to the Lord is crucial.
        What’s so important, too, is to keep the Cross before your eyes, for
      here is the greatest example in all the universe of unselfish service for
      others. As we day by day contemplate the great sacrifice made in our
      behalf, the spotless Son of God, the One through whom the worlds
      were made (see Heb. 1:2), taking upon Himself the sins of the world,
      our hearts will be broken. Before the Cross, nothing Christ asks of us
      will be too much; before the Cross, our service to others will be the
      least we can do for the God who has said to us, “Inasmuch as ye have
      done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
      me” (Matt. 25:40).

       Take time to dwell on the sacrifice of Christ, the greatest exam-
       ple possible of unselfish service. How does dwelling on the Cross
       impact you and your willingness to serve others?

     Misguided Service (Luke 10:38-42).
        We must be careful not to allow our service in Jesus’ name to hinder
     our relationship with Jesus. Indeed, we need to keep our relationship
     with Jesus as the center, the foundation, of our desire to serve others.
     Otherwise, a number of things can happen. For instance, we can become
     proud, thinking our good works are things we do that add to our salva-
     tion, that are meritorious toward our basic acceptance with God.
        At the same time, it is possible as followers of Jesus to become so
     preoccupied with serving others that we have no time to spend with
     Jesus Himself. A classic example of misguided service is seen when
     Jesus visited the home of Martha. In many ways, Martha is a model
     of devotion. She believed Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God (see
     John 11:27). She was willing to keep trusting, even when she did not
     see the way (see John 11:21, 22). On one occasion, however, when
     Jesus visited Martha’s home in Bethany, she allowed her service to
     hinder her relationship with Jesus.

How does Martha’s preoccupation with “serving Jesus” affect her
     personally and, consequently, impact her relationship with the
     Master? Luke 10:38-42.


        Martha is worried. The verb used here in the Greek (translated as
     “careful” in the KJV is a strong one. We find this same verb in
     Philippians 4:6, where Paul exhorts the believers to “be anxious for
     nothing” (NKJV). We find a variation of the word, as a noun, in 1 Peter
     5:7, where Peter appeals to believers to cast all their anxiety, all their
     cares, upon the Lord. But Martha is holding on to all her anxieties.
     She is anxious. There is a division and distraction in her mind. She is
     full of inner turmoil.
        Martha is also troubled. The Greek verb (translated “troubled” in
     the KJV) implies external agitation. Martha is not only full of inner
     turmoil. She is also externally agitated. Her service for Jesus is mis-
     guided. As a result, her relationship with Jesus suffers. Instead of sit-
     ting at His feet and experiencing intimate communion with Him, she
     accosts Him with these words: “ ‘Lord, do You not care that my sister
     has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me’ ” (Luke
     10:40, 41, NKJV).

      How can we avoid this trap, where our preoccupation with serv-
      ing in Jesus’name gets in the way of our relationship with Him?
      Why must we not let anything, even our service for the Lord,
      hinder that relationship?



                                                                           101

Further Study: Another danger Christians face as they serve oth-
      ers in Jesus’name is a spirit of competition. We can easily fall into the
      trap of comparing ourselves with others or measuring our service
      against theirs. Consider the following passages of Scripture that
      address the issue of competition in our service for others: Luke 9:49,
      50; 1 Cor. 1:11-13. What lessons can we learn from the teaching of
      Jesus and the attitude of the apostle Paul?

        Note: The teaching of Jesus recorded in Matthew 25:31-46 suggests
      that our service for others is an important indicator of our Christian
      experience. This account of the dividing of the sheep and the goats
      suggests that those who are not involved in acts of service to others
      will be sent away into everlasting punishment. How would you explain
      this passage in the context of salvation by grace through faith? Are
      acts of service necessary for salvation? Is it accurate to say that we
      must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and care for the sick if we
      expect to enter into the kingdom of heaven?

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 A friend tells you she would like to explore ways of serving
       others in Jesus’name, but she feels her schedule is already over-
       loaded.What counsel would you give her?

       ●2 What can you do together, as a class, to reveal to others the
       caring and serving spirit that should be the hallmark of all who
       profess to follow Jesus Christ?

       ●3 How can we avoid the trap of believing that our service for
       others somehow earns us merits with God, that somehow good
       works can add to our salvation?

Mary’s Boys
Mary Metobo and J. H. Zachary
   In Nairobi, Kenya, thousands of children wander the streets searching
for food. Some are orphans of AIDS; others have run away from troubled
families or desperate poverty.
   Mary Metobo’s heart ached to help these children who ate from garbage
cans, begged on street corners, or stole to stay alive. When her husband
retired, they rented a home outside Nairobi where they could start helping
some of these children.
   Mary bought foam sheets for beds and a charcoal stove on which to pre-
pare meals. Mary invited 15 boys to come.
   Some boys needed drug and alcohol treatment; all needed hope. The
boys receive food, shelter, training, and an introduction to Jesus.
   With help from a donor, Mary bought utensils and soybeans and found
someone to help teach some of the boys to prepare a popular soybean
meal. In another room of her home two boys are making metal fencing. A
man teaches some boys mechanics. As the youth see benefits of their
labor, hope fills their hearts. “For the first time in my life I have hope,”
smiles a young man holding the welding rod.
   One boy has accepted Jesus as his Savior and now serves as the group’s
chaplain. Each morning the youth study the Bible and pray together.
   Mary hopes that after spending six months in her home, the boys will
be ready to step out on their own. She plans to help them find work and a
nurturing church family. Then she will start over with another group of
troubled children. She looks forward to the day when she can buy bunk
beds and can double the number of youth she helps.
   Sometimes when Mary sends the boys on an errand in the city, they
meet their street friends who see that they are living a better life. The
friends beg to come to Mary’s home, where they can find help and hope.
“Not yet,” she must tell them. “As soon as we have beds and work oppor-
tunities, you can bring your friends here.”
   Mary hopes that one day soon she can help 100 youth at a time. She
wants to help the girls that live on Nairobi’s streets as well. “I could train
them to work as maids in the homes of the more affluent,” Mary says.
“Many people would be happy to hire them. But this project will have to
wait for some time in the future.” Right now she can only pray.

Mary Metobo lives near Nairobi, Kenya; J. H. Zachary was retired from the Ministerial
Association at the General Conference.

        LESSON            13 *September 17-23
      King of Kings
      and Lord of Lords!




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 24:23-51, 7:21-29,
      John 14:1-3, Acts 1:9-11, Phil. 2:9-11, Rev. 20:7-9.

Memory Text: “Then I saw heaven opened,and behold, a white
      horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and
      in righteousness He judges and makes war. . . . And He has on His
      robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD
      OF LORDS” (Revelation 19:11, 16, NKJV).

Key Thought: Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will come again
      in glory to gather the redeemed of all ages into His eternal king-
      dom. All those who have received Him as Savior and Lord will wel-
      come Him with joy when He returns to this earth.

              f all the promises that Jesus, our Savior and Lord, has given us,

      O       the greatest promise is that He will return and take us from this
              sin-sick world. We have this hope, the hope in the coming of
      the Lord, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, as our Savior, reconciled earth
      to heaven and thus paved the way for the great and glorious day of His
      return when—as KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS—He
      will bring that reconciliation to its eternal consummation.
         This is the great hope of all whose acknowledgment of Christ as
      Lord has been made manifest in their lives; in contrast, for those
      who—regardless of what they confess—have rejected Jesus as Lord
      of their lives, the Second Coming will be a sad and fearful event.
         Why not, right now, make that complete surrender to the One who,
      at Calvary, surrendered all for us?

     The Certainty of Christ’s Return (John 14:1-3,
     Acts 1:9-11).

       Those who have received Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are a peo-
     ple of hope. With joyful expectation we are “looking for the blessed
     hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus
     Christ” (Titus 2:13, NKJV). Our hope concerning the return of our
     Lord Jesus Christ is not wishful thinking. It is based upon the faith-
     fulness of our Lord to honor His promises.

What promise did Jesus Christ give to His followers concerning His
     return to this earth? John 14:1-3.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        We trust in this promise of Jesus: “ ‘I will come again.’ ” This
     phrase might literally be translated “I am coming again.” The verb to
     come is in the present tense. We call this a “futuristic present,” which
     emphasizes the certainty of that which is being described. In this
     promise, Jesus Christ assures us His return is as certain as if it were
     already taking place!

What promise of two heavenly messengers confirmed the promise of
     Jesus regarding His return? Acts 1:9-11.


       Seventh-day Adventist Christians have long cherished the blessed
     hope of the glorious return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Our
     name, Adventist, reminds us that Jesus Christ, who came once as a
     baby in Bethlehem’s manger, will come again as King of kings and
     Lord of lords. Even though our pioneers expected His return long
     before now, the promise is still sure. “The Lord is not slack concerning
     His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,
     not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repent-
     ance. But the day of the Lord will come” (2 Pet. 3:9, 10, NKJV). The
     apostle Paul affirms the certainty of our hope in these words: “For the
     Lord Himself will descend from heaven” (1 Thess. 4:16, NKJV). The
     second coming of Jesus is not wishful thinking. It is our certain hope.

      Feeling discouraged, worried, fearful? Prayerfully, read again
      John 14:1-3 and place yourself, your name, in each spot where it’s
      appropriate. Realize that in a very real sense, Jesus is talking to
      you, that those words are for you. What hope do you draw from
      this precious, and intimate, promise of Jesus—to you,personally?

                                                                         105
                 M O N DAY September 19

      The Nature of Christ’s Return
        Our Lord Jesus Christ wants us not only to be certain of His return
      but also to understand the nature of His return. We have already dis-
      covered from yesterday’s study that His coming will be literal. Jesus
      declared, “ ‘I will come again.’ ” We must reject any interpretation that
      would attempt to spiritualize Christ’s second coming as His coming
      into our hearts. While it is true that Christ can dwell in our hearts
      through faith (see Eph. 3:17), this dwelling in our hearts by the Holy
      Spirit does not replace His literal return in glory.

What can we learn from the following comments of Jesus about the
      nature of His return? Matt. 24:23-26, 27, 30, 31.

         The second coming of Jesus will not be secret. It will be dramatic,
      visible, and audible. These words of Jesus also imply that a resurrec-
      tion of the dead will occur at the time of His coming. Listen to another
      promise of Jesus: “ ‘And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that
      everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have everlasting
      life; and I will raise him up at the last day’ ” (John 6:40, NKJV).

Read Paul’s descriptions of the nature of Christ’s second coming
      (1 Thess. 4:16, 17). Why would that be something hard for an
      imposter to fake? Why, too, with such clear biblical testimony
      regarding the nature of Christ’s return, have so many people
      been fooled by false christs in the past?


        The apostle Paul reinforces the teaching of Jesus regarding the
      nature of His return. The second coming of Jesus Christ is personal:
      The Lord Himself will descend from heaven. It is dramatic: The Lord
      will shout and the trumpet will sound. There will be a resurrection:
      The dead in Christ will rise first. Finally, all the redeemed will be
      gathered up to meet the Lord in the air.

       Using your imagination, depict in writing what it will be like
       when Jesus returns. Share it with your class.

     The Timing of Christ’s Return
        Almost two thousand years ago, in His last recorded comment in the
     book of Revelation, our risen Lord declared, “ ‘Surely I am coming
     quickly’ ” (Rev. 22:20, NKJV). Christians have wrestled with that dec-
     laration ever since. From our perspective, it doesn’t seem as though
     He is coming quickly. We realize, of course, that the Lord is not
     locked in time as we mere mortals are. The apostle Peter reminds us
     that “with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand
     years as one day” (2 Pet. 3:8, NKJV).

Dwell upon what Peter wrote regarding the Lord and time. What
     mistake should these words protect us from making?

        In terms of eternity, the Lord Jesus Christ is coming quickly. And
     yet, many times we find ourselves crying out with the souls under the
     altar, “ ‘How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge
     our blood on those who dwell on the earth?’ ” (Rev. 6:10, NKJV).

Read the parable Jesus tells in Matthew 24:45-51. In your own
     words,write out what you believe is the basic message Jesus is giv-
     ing us here. Why is this parable so relevant for us as Adventists?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       There’s been a long-running debate in the church about the question
     of a delay. Is there one? If so, why? If not, then why hasn’t Christ
     returned? And though we probably won’t get all these questions
     resolved this side of eternity, the crucial thing for us is to be ready
     always, regardless of when He comes.


      If someone were to ask you, What does it mean to be ready for
      Jesus’ return,how would you respond? If Christ returned today,
      would you be ready? Justify your answer.


                                                                        107

      The Impact of Christ’s Return
        The glorious return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will impact
      those living on the earth in one of two ways. For those who have
      refused to receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, it will be a
      time of terror. Even for many professed followers of Christ, those who
      never let Him be Lord of their lives, it will a time of fearful judgment.

Read carefully the following texts in light of this whole quarter’s les-
      son: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
      into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
      Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
      Lord,have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have
      cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
      And then will I profess unto them,I never knew you: depart from
      me, ye that work iniquity” (Matt. 7:21-23). How do these verses
      capture the essence of what it means to profess Jesus as Lord but
      not allow Him to be Lord? What is the crucial difference between
      the two?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Our Savior is very clear: We can’t separate a profession of faith in
      Him from a life of obedience to Him. Notice how Jesus here links
      obedience with actually being in a saving relationship with Him; He
      says He “never knew” those who—though professing Him as Lord,
      and even doing deeds in His name—weren’t obedient to the will of
      God. This has to be one of the strongest statements Jesus ever made
      about the futility of calling oneself a Christian while not living like
      one, and living like one demands that we do the will of the Father in
      heaven. Otherwise, our faith is made out of nothing but sand.

Read the parable that comes right after Christ’s words here (Matt.
      7:24-29). How does this fit in exactly with what Jesus said in
      verses 21-23?

     The Cosmic Confession
        For Christians, their profession that Jesus is Lord is matched by a
     life of faithful obedience, not an obedience that saves (it can’t), but an
     obedience that expresses a true faith in God.

Read Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14, and Hebrews 9:12. What do
     these verses tell us about how we are redeemed?


        And yet, these people are not the only ones who acknowledge Jesus
     as Lord. According to the apostle Paul, the day is coming when every
     knee will bow and every tongue will make that same confession.

Read Philippians 2:9-11.What is Paul talking about here?


        “At His first coming, Christ was denied and rejected by men, and
     by them dragged as a criminal to Pilate’s bar, where they charged Him
     with blasphemy. He was scourged and crucified. Nails were driven
     through His hands and His feet. . . . At His second coming, the scene
     will be changed. He will be acknowledged by all as the King of glory.
     At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall
     confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. The
     angels will bow in adoration before Him. His enemies will see the
     mistake they have made, and every tongue will confess His divin-
     ity.”—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, April 19, 1905.
        However, for the wicked, this will not be a saving confession but
     simply a recognition of that which is undeniably true. There is no
     change of heart. No repentance. In fact, according to Revelation 20:7-
     9, they continue their rebellion against the Lord.
        In contrast, there are those who—though sinners, though imperfect,
     though in and of themselves possessing no righteousness—have, nev-
     ertheless, committed their souls to the Lord Jesus by surrendering
     their will to Him. These people will proclaim Jesus as their Lord, and
     their lives will reflect that proclamation. Our praise of the Lord in
     heaven will simply be our picking up where we left off praising Him
     here. If we love and serve Jesus even amid the toil, pain, sin, and cor-
     ruption on earth now, then how much more so in the new heaven and
     a new earth? Our service to Jesus as Lord there will just be the con-
     tinuation of our service to Him here but without the cumbrousness of
     sin, disease, ignorance, and the devil. That’s the victory Jesus won for
     us. We can, by trusting and living by faith with Jesus as Lord, start
     enjoying the fruits of that victory, even now.



                                                                          109

Further Study: Read the last four chapters in the book of Revela-
      tion. Take time to meditate on this beautiful scene of the new earth:
      “And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, pro-
      ceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the middle of its
      street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore
      twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves
      of the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no
      more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and
      His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name
      shall be on their foreheads. And there shall be no night there: They
      need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light.
      And they shall reign forever and ever” (Rev. 22:1-5, NKJV).
         What a blessed hope is ours. Soon our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
      will return as King of kings and Lord of lords. He will create a new
      heaven and a new earth, and we will reign with Him forever and ever.
      Even so, come, Lord Jesus!

Two Answered Prayers
Dorothy Eaton Watts
   Jaggaya worked in a railway station in eastern India. One day the wind
stirred up stray papers lying around the station. One paper landed near
Jaggaya. He picked it up and read it. It told the story of Jesus feeding the
5,000 with five loaves and two fish. Now that is amazing, Jaggaya
thought. This Jesus must be a very great God to do this. I must learn more
about Him.
   Jaggaya asked a Protestant pastor in his village to tell him more about
Jesus. Soon Jaggaya was attending church and reading his Bible. Always
his prayer was that Jesus would teach him more. Then one day a stranger
walked into Jaggaya’s village.
   Paul Reddy prayed as he neared the village, “Lord, lead me to some soul
longing to know more about You.” As he walked down the street, he
noticed an old man reading a Bible. “Hello, Brother,” Paul greeted the
man. “I see you are reading God’s Word. I am a Christian too.” The two
men talked for a while, then Paul asked him, “Do you know about the
Bible Sabbath?”
   “No,” said Jaggaya. “I have read the Bible a lot, but I do not know any-
thing about a Sabbath. Will you explain it to me?” Paul Reddy opened his
Bible and began seven days of intense Bible study with Jaggaya. They
studied many doctrines of the Bible. Over and over Jaggaya exclaimed,
“This is wonderful! I never knew that before!” At the end of the Bible
studies, Jaggaya asked Paul Reddy to rebaptize him, symbolizing his
acceptance of the new Bible truths he had accepted.
   “I will bring a minister to baptize you,” Paul promised. But it took sev-
eral weeks before Paul could return with a pastor. In the meantime,
Jaggaya faithfully followed what he had learned from Paul Reddy and the
Bible.
   Jaggaya is 80 years old, but he walks the streets of his village sharing
his newfound faith with others. He is studying the Bible with 20 people he
has found. They are preparing to be baptized into the Adventist church.
   The work in Orissa State in eastern India is exploding. In 1997 after 70
years of Adventist work, the church had 102 congregations in Orissa and
3,100 believers. Today there are more than 350 congregations and more
than 30,000 believers. Pray that God will open the way to build more than
300 churches needed by new congregations in Orissa. Pray too that our
new members will remain faithful to God in spite of great difficulties.

2005    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter

          John M. Fowler, author of this quarter’s lessons, will guide us in
       one of the great love letters of the Bible, the book of Ephesians. It
       is our hope that this study will help each of us experience the life-
       changing power of the gospel as it works in the hearts of sinful
       human beings.

Lesson 1 —The Church at Ephesus

       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Ephesus: Jesus Vs. Diana (Acts 19:24-29).
       MONDAY: Ephesus: Aquila and Priscilla
       TUESDAY: Apollos at Ephesus (Acts 18:24-28).
       WEDNESDAY: Paul at Ephesus (Acts 19:1-20).
       THURSDAY: The Depth of Paul’s Ministry (Acts 20:17-38).

       Memory Text—Acts                19:20, NKJV.

       Sabbath Gem: Among those associated with the Ephesian church
       were Aquila and Priscilla, Apollos, Timothy, and the apostle John.
       Each of them had a role to play in the building of this church, one of
       the finest of the first century. What can we learn as we delve into this
       fascinating and instructive moment in early Christian history?

Lesson 2—Ephesians:Themes in Relationships

       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: The Author: Paul (Gal. 1:11-17).
       MONDAY: The Recipients: The Saints in Ephesus (Eph. 1:1, NKJV).
       TUESDAY: Grace and Peace (Eph. 1:2, NKJV).
       WEDNESDAY: The Theme: Unity (Eph. 1:9, 10, RSV).

       Memory Text—Ephesians                   1:3, NKJV.

       Sabbath Gem:        The letter to Ephesians deals with no particular
       problem, doctrinal or social. It celebrates the joy of fellowship, rela-
       tionship, and unity in Christ. It’s also a great expression of thanks-
       giving and praise for what God has done through Christ in the cre-
       ation of His church.
