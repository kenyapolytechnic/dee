    INTRODUCTION



Jesus Through the Eyes
of Mark
We are about to embark on a journey that will take us to the
Holy Land, to Galilee in particular. With John Mark as our
guide, we will retrace the steps of the greatest Man who ever
lived, Jesus Christ.
  So marvelous was this life that no one account can do justice to it.
In the Bible we find four Gospels, but even they, combined, cannot
encompass everything about Jesus. Thus, John the beloved closes
his record with the observation: “Jesus did many other things as
well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even
the whole world would not have room for the books that would be
written” (John 21:25, NIV). That’s an incredible amount of books,
but Jesus did an incredible amount of deeds.
  Each of the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—was
written at different times and, at first, circulated separately. Many
scholars think that Mark’s was written first, and while that’s pos-
sible, it cannot be established with certainty.
  What matters is that each of the Gospels was inspired by the Holy
Spirit, and each bears a united witness to Jesus Christ and what He
did for the world.
  Because each Gospel writer retained his individuality as he wrote,
we see differences of perspective and emphasis. This is as the Lord
wanted it; and, indeed, this is how the Holy Spirit works. Far from
calling into question the divine inspiration of the Gospels, this vari-
ety of perspective helps to affirm it. It’s God’s way of seeking to
touch lives. He wants to reach us all, who are so different, and He
uses different voices to do it.
  “There is variety in a tree,” wrote Ellen White, “there are scarcely
two leaves just alike. Yet this variety adds to the perfection of the
tree as a whole.
  “In our Bible, we might ask, Why need Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John in the Gospels, why need the Acts of the Apostles, and the vari-
ety of writers in the Epistles, go over the same thing?
  “The Lord gave His word in just the way He wanted it to come.
He gave it through different writers, each having his own individu-

2
ality, though going over the same history.”—Selected Messages,
book 1, p. 21.
   John Mark’s Gospel is the shortest of the four accounts. Whereas
Matthew portrays Jesus as a great teacher, Luke highlights His con-
cerns for those on the fringes of society, and John focuses on His con-
versations one-on-one with a variety of people, Mark shows Him as a
Man of action. Through Mark’s eyes, we see Jesus as a Man with a
mission, one that He will accomplish.
  Mark’s Gospel has a simple organization:
  A. Prologue                               (1:1-13)
  B. Ministry in Galilee                    (1:14–8:26)
  C. The Passion Looms                      (8:27–10:52)
  D. Final Ministry in Jerusalem            (11:1–13:37)
  E. The Passion and Resurrection           (14:1–16:20)
   And yet, we shouldn’t be fooled by the simplicity, for just as Jesus,
told “simple” stories with profound implications, Mark does the same.
His account is filled with
powerful insights that give
birth to life-changing rev-
                               Mark shows Jesus a

his account in order, and
like the disciples of old, may we walk with Jesus throughout this
quarter.
   And though the Gospel itself was written by John Mark, our les-
sons come from another disciple of Jesus, a modern-day disciple,
one whose words have, over the years, brought encouragement,
hope, and promise to the church: Dr. William Johnsson, editor of the
Adventist Review. A prolific writer and a well-known New
Testament scholar, Dr. Johnsson takes us through the book of Mark,
giving us his own spirit-inspired insights, as well. Thus, we see
Jesus through the eyes of Mark, who comes to us this quarter
through the eyes of Bill.
     Trustworthy views, to be sure.

      Introducing Jesus,
      the Son of God




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      FOUR ACCOUNTS, ONE LORD. Each of the four Gospel writers,
      inspired by the Holy Spirit, has a particular emphasis on the life and
      ministry of Jesus. Each begins his Gospel in a manner that hints at the
      portrait he will develop. Matthew’s first words are: “The book of the
      generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham”
      (1:1). That is, Jesus is not only Jewish but He is of the royal line.
      Matthew pitches his Gospel especially to Jewish readers as he shows
      that Jesus was Israel’s true King. Luke, on the other hand, addresses
      his account to “most excellent Theophilus” (1:1-4). He has Gentile
      readers in view and uses an introduction that they will be familiar
      with. John writes, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
      with God, and the Word was God” (1:1). Throughout his Gospel we
      are conscious that Jesus is the Word made flesh, “full of grace and
      truth” (1:14).
         This week we’ll take a look at Mark’s inspired opening and the spe-
      cial emphasis he conveyed.

The Week at a Glance: What does Mark’s opening of his
      account of Christ’s life suggest from the outset? What kind of
      start did Mark have in ministry? What did he mean by the term
      gospel? Why the emphasis on Jesus as “the Son of God”?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 1:1-20.

Memory Text: “A voice came from heaven, ‘Thou art my beloved
      Son; with thee I am well pleased’ ” (Mark 1:11, RSV).

      The Writer, John Mark
       The Gospel we are studying this quarter does not mention the name
     of the writer, but it was early attributed to Mark, and rightly so. Mark
     was not a prominent person in the early church; thus, it would be
     highly unlikely for him to be dubbed the author unless he really was.
     That’s one of the great things about what our God can do: He can take
     even the lowliest of people and place them in positions of great
     prominence and influence (see Genesis 40, 41).
       Mark, though, didn’t actually have the greatest start in ministry. In
     fact, early on he proved himself unworthy of the high calling that this
     work involved.

Read Acts 15:36-40.Why was Paul so determined not to allow Mark
     to come with them?


        “It was here that Mark, overwhelmed with fear and discourage-
     ment, wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself whole-
     heartedly to the Lord’s work. Unused to hardships, he was disheart-
     ened by the perils and privations of the way. He had labored with
     success under favorable circumstances; but now, amidst the opposi-
     tion and perils that so often beset the pioneer worker, he failed to
     endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to
     face danger and persecution and adversity with a brave heart. As the
     apostles advanced, and still greater difficulties were apprehended,
     Mark was intimidated and, losing all courage, refused to go farther
     and returned to Jerusalem.”––Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
     Apostles, pp. 169, 170.

How did Paul’s attitude toward Mark later change? 2 Tim. 4:11,
     Philemon 24.


       What an incredible change on the part of Paul toward Mark. Do you
     think that Paul simply became more tolerant of someone who aban-
     doned him; or, perhaps, was it more likely that Mark had indeed
     changed into someone whom Paul could now trust?

      Look back in your own life to where you utterly blew it yet were
      given an opportunity to redeem yourself. How much did that
      new opportunity mean to you? How does that reflect, in a small
      way, the great principles of grace and forgiveness that God gives
      to us? Maybe there’s someone whom you need to do the same
      for now, as well?


                                                                           7
                M O N D AY M a rch 28

      The Gospel Begins (Mark 1:1).
Read Mark 1:1 and contrast it with the openings of the other Gospels.
      What main difference do you see?


         Mark’s beginning seems abrupt. He passes over Jesus’ genealogy,
      His miraculous conception, and His dramatic birth. He gives not a
      hint of the visit of the Magi, the revelation to the shepherds, or King
      Herod’s diabolical plot to kill the Baby. We hear nothing about Jesus’
      flight to Egypt or His early years as a carpenter in Nazareth. It isn’t
      that these facts are unimportant—they are important. But for Mark,
      and for us, they aren’t most important. What Mark wants the reader to
      get from the outset is that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

Study other biblical references to learn what “Son of God” means.
      Note especially Luke 1:34, 35; John 10:30; Phil.2:5-11; Col.1:13-
      19; Heb. 1:1-3.What do these texts tell us about who Jesus really
      is? Why is knowledge about His identity so important to us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The unique role of the Holy Spirit in Mary’s conception shows us
      that the Man Jesus was also the Son of God. But the term “Son of
      God” has a much greater meaning: It tells us that He shares the very
      nature of God—that He is truly God, always has been and always will
      be. Thus, the fundamental beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists declare
      under article 4: “God the Eternal Son became incarnate in Jesus
      Christ. . . . Forever truly God, He became also truly man, Jesus the
      Christ.”—Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . A Biblical Exposition of
      27 Fundamental Doctrines, p. 36.

       Mark makes no reference to the virgin birth, most likely
       because he wants to emphasize the eternal Sonship of Jesus.
       And he calls this the “gospel,” which is an old Greek term
       (euaggelion) that originally meant “news of victory” in war. For
       the followers of Jesus, that term no longer meant good news in
       general but the good news that centers in Jesus Christ, the Son
       of God. He IS the good news, He IS the gospel! Using this idea
       of the gospel as “news of victory” as the background, what is the
       victory that you have in your life now because of Jesus? What
       was won for you? What was defeated? What difference does this
       victory mean for you now, today?

The Messenger (Mark 1:2-8).
  Before all the great interventions of God in history, He sends a
message to prepare the people. “Surely the Sovereign Lord does noth-
ing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets” (Amos
3:7, NIV). So, before the greatest event this world ever will see, He
raised up a messenger, John the Baptist. And, just as Messiah’s com-
ing was foretold in Bible prophecy, the messenger also was predicted.
Notice that Mark quotes Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3, although he
mentions only Isaiah as the source.

What was John the Baptist’s role and message?

   John’s mission pointed beyond himself. He was a forerunner, a her-
ald, to proclaim that One far greater than he was about to appear and
to get the people ready to meet Him.
   The texts emphasize preparing the way. The picture is one of road
building. Just as today engineers involved in constructing highways
cut through mountains, fill in holes and depressions, and straighten
curves, so John was a “road builder” for Jesus, the Son of God (notice
how Isaiah 40:4 elaborates on the highway construction illustration).
John carried out his mission in three ways: (1) by announcing that
Messiah was about to appear, (2) by calling the people to get ready by
turning from their sins, and (3) by baptizing them as a public demon-
stration that they had heeded the message of the Coming One.
   John never sought to draw attention to himself. He seemed devoid
of self-seeking; his head was not turned by the crowds that flocked to
hear him. This self-effacing messenger could say from the heart: “He
must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30).

 We Seventh-day Adventists believe that, like John, God has
 raised us up to sound a prophetic message about the coming of
 Jesus. What can we learn from John the Baptist as we seek to
 be true to our mission? In what way or ways is our task similar
 to and different from John’s mission? What must you change in
 your own life to be better suited to take part in this task?

      The Commissioning
Compare Mark’s account of the Baptist’s ministry with the other
      Gospels (Matthew 3, Mark 1:4-11, Luke 3:1-22, John 1:6-8, 19-35).
      What parallels do you see? What differences? What advantages
      are there to having different accounts, different perspectives, of
      the same events? Should they always be expected to agree on every
      point? If not, why not?

       Mark’s treatment of John the Baptist is by far the shortest of the
     four Gospels. Mark is focused on Jesus the Son of God, and he cuts
     through all the information about John the Baptist to get to Jesus.
     John’s part in the story is twofold: He is the forerunner of the Messiah,
     and he baptized Jesus. Mark tells us nothing about the circumstances
     of John’s birth, as does Luke; he is saying nothing of the later work of
     the Baptist, as do Matthew and John. The only other reference to John
     the Baptist after the brief description of Mark 1:9-13 is a description
     of John’s death, slotted into the ongoing account of Jesus’ministry in
     Galilee (Mark 6:14-29).

Read Mark 1:10, 11. How does this event fit in with the opening line
      of Mark’s account of Jesus? What crucial point is being empha-
      sized?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        By the heavenly dove of the Spirit and the Voice from heaven, the
      Godhead demonstrated to the world that Jesus of Nazareth was not
      just another human. He was truly human, but He was much more—
      He was God’s Son, truly God. Under divine inspiration, Mark stresses
      this point, for it’s an important one for the Christian faith.

       Suppose you believed that Jesus were just a great man, rather
       than the Son of God Himself. How would that impact your
       faith, your deeds, your whole Christian life in general? What
       difference does it make that He is the Son of God?

      The Ministry Begins (Mark 1:14-20).
What place did Jesus give to the element of time as He began His
      public ministry? (Matt. 3:2, 4:17, NIV; compare Mark 1:4, 15).


         The first message of Jesus was identical with John the Baptist’s:
      “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near” (1:4, 15; compare Matt.
      3:2, 4:17). But Jesus added a new dimension: Whereas John preached
      that the long-awaited Messiah was about to come, Jesus proclaimed:
      “The time has come!”
         Seventh-day Adventists are much attuned to the importance of time
      in God’s plan. Thus, we see in Jesus’ dramatic statement “The time
      has come!” not only a general reference to the fulfillment of the Old
      Testament prophecies of the coming of the Messiah but a specific ref-
      erence to the time prophecies of Daniel. In his great 70 weeks of years
      prediction (Dan. 9:24-27), the ancient seer foretold the precise time
      of Messiah’s appearance. And, we believe, just as Jesus appeared right
      on time at His first coming, so He will come again right on God’s
      time. The apostle Paul wrote: “But when the time had fully come,
      God sent His Son” (Gal. 4:4, NIV). That was true at the Incarnation;
      it will be true again for the glorious Second Advent.

Study the account of the call of the first disciples in Mark 1:16-20.
      Put yourself in the scene by the lake; join Peter, Andrew, James,
      and John as they cast nets for fish or get ready to fish.Then Jesus
      walks by and calls,“Come; follow Me!” And without hesitation—
      “at once”—they drop their nets and follow Him.Why should you
      find it surprising that they would leave their all so abruptly? How
      do you account for their apparently spontaneous response? What
      would it take to get you to do the same thing?


        The fishermen who left their nets and boats to follow Jesus were
      not seeking financial reward. Fishing was hard work, but they knew it
      well and could maintain their livelihood. But Jesus of Nazareth had
      neither riches, fame, nor an organized movement. Following Him
      meant indeed launching out into the deep in ways they had never
      before experienced. Only one fact can account for their actions, which
      to others would not have made sense; they saw something in Jesus
      that touched their souls. Seeing Him, hearing His voice, they were
      moved to a decision that would change their lives.

       If you are a follower of Christ, what have you had to give up for
       Him? If your answer is “Nothing,” what might 2 Corinthians
       13:5 say to you?

                                                                          11

Further Study: Compare Matthew’s and Luke’s accounts with the
     verses in Mark we studied this week: Matthew 3:1–4:22, Luke 3:1-22,
     5:1-11. Read “Misrepresentations of the Godhead,” Evangelism,
     pp. 613–617; “The Baptism” and “The Call by the Sea,” The Desire
     of Ages, pp. 109–113, pp. 244–251.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Why could an angel not be our Savior? What if Christ were
      not eternally God but a “god” created by God—what difference
      would that make? Think of the marvelous confidence we can
      have in Jesus, our Savior, Lord, and great High Priest. Discuss in
      class the implications of the deity of Christ.

      ●2 Suppose you were there at the baptism of Jesus; you saw the
      Spirit descending, you heard the Voice from heaven. What kind
      of excuses could you make that could cause you to doubt that it
      really was something from God? How do people, today, do the
      same thing with evidence for God’s existence, power, and care?
      In what ways do we, even as believers, have to be careful of falling
      into the same trap?

      ●3 The disciples had to make some radical changes in their lives
      in order to follow Jesus. What about us? Have we had to make
      radical changes,as well? If you haven’t, what might that tell you
      about your walk with the Lord?

      ●
      4 Have someone in class explain the 70-week prophecy of Daniel
      9:24-27.Why should every Christian understand this important
      prophecy?

Summary: In the first words of his Gospel, Mark introduces Jesus as
     “Son of God.” This expression, which points to Jesus’ oneness and
     equality with God, will underline the entire Gospel of Mark. In the
     passage that opens this Gospel and that was the focus of our study
     this week, we immediately found evidences of Jesus’ divine Sonship:
     (1) He came in fulfillment of prophecy, (2) He came right on God’s
     time, and (3) at the baptism that inaugurated His public ministry, the
     Father declared Him to be “My beloved Son.”

Finding Faith in North Korea
John McGhee
   There are faithful Christians in North Korea. No one knows just how
many, but we know they are there. Here is the story of one of them.
   Mrs. Kim* became a Seventh-day Adventist almost 50 years ago.
Following the Korean War, she was trapped in North Korea, separated from
family and friends.
   Recently Mrs. Kim managed to travel from North Korea via the Korean
“underground railroad” to China and on to South Korea. Her accomplices
created a new identity for her so that she could visit her family in South Korea.
While in Seoul she told church leaders about her amazing epic of faith.
   She has been isolated from other Adventists, but she has talked with God
constantly, daily sensed His presence, and often heard Him communicate
with her. For years she kept her precious Bible hidden in a small cupboard,
knowing that if the authorities ever caught her with it, she would be tortured
and perhaps killed.
   One day several years ago, Mrs. Kim felt a strong impression to put her
Bible into her son’s backpack. A few minutes later she answered a knock on
her door and found two policemen. The men brushed her aside, strode into
her kitchen, and walked straight to the cupboard where she normally kept
her Bible. She is sure that it was God who had warned her to move her Bible.
   She had to find someplace to hide her Bible. That evening she dug a hole
near the utility pole near her front door, placed her carefully wrapped Bible
into the hole, and covered it with dirt.
   Daily Mrs. Kim dug up the Bible and read it. She grew stronger spiritu-
ally and physically. Then one afternoon three men, including a guard and
two utility workers, knocked on her door. “We need to move the pole in your
front yard,” one of them said.
   Instantly praying, she heard a voice, Invite them inside for tea! She invited
them in, and they accepted. While the men sipped tea and ate crackers, a
crack of thunder exploded in the air. Rain began to fall, and the men jumped
from their chairs. Hurriedly the men ran to the truck, shouting, “We’ll come
back tomorrow!”
   The men did return the following day. But by that time, the Bible was
safely moved to a new hiding place.
   As Mrs. Kim finished her testimony, she said, “Almost all the other
Adventists my age are already dead. I don’t know why God has allowed me
to live 79 years. The believers I know in North Korea end their prayers
with a request to be faithful martyrs when the time comes.”

      Amazing
      Miracle Worker


      SABBATH A FTERNOON
      MAN OF ACTION. After his abbreviated introduction, Mark
      plunges into Jesus’ ministry in Galilee. He presents a series of short,
      action-packed vignettes, like a fast-paced television report.
        Again it is instructive to compare and contrast Mark’s approach
      with the other Gospel writers. In Matthew’s Gospel, the first major
      event emphasized in Jesus’ ministry is the Sermon on the Mount
      (Matthew 5–7), but Mark doesn’t even mention it. Luke focuses on
      Jesus’ sermon at Nazareth (Luke 4:14-30), but Mark bypasses that
      too. For John, the miracle at the wedding in Cana highlights the open-
      ing of Jesus’ministry, but Mark makes no mention of it. Each Gospel
      writer, inspired by the Holy Spirit, creates an individual account of
      the life and work of this incredible Man, our Savior and Lord.

The Week at a Glance: What proof did Jesus start giv-
      ing of His power? In what ways did the healing of Peter’s mother-
      in-law reveal the principles of a Christian life? How did Jesus
      show the link between the spiritual and the physical life? In what
      ways did Christ break down some of the longstanding religious
      traditions of His day?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 1:21–2:17.

Memory Text: “Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his
      hand and touched the man. ‘I am willing,’ he said. ‘Be clean!’ ”
      (Mark 1:41, NIV).

      The Demon-Possessed Man (Mark 1:21-28).
        Jesus came at a time when the forces of evil were in the ascend-
      ancy, when men and women were held tightly in their grasp. Ellen
      White paints a graphic picture of the times: “The deception of sin
      had reached its height. All the agencies for depraving the souls of
      men had been put in operation. The Son of God, looking upon the
      world, beheld suffering and misery. With pity He saw how men had
      become victims of satanic cruelty. . . . The very stamp of demons
      was impressed upon the countenances of men. Human faces
      reflected the expression of the legions of evil with which they were
      possessed.”—The Desire of Ages, p. 36.

In Mark 1:21-28, what’s the first thing that Jesus did that impressed
      His audience that He was someone special? At the same time, why
      wasn’t that enough to prove who He really was?


        Jesus came as the great Deliverer of humanity. He came, not to be
      served but to serve; not to be exalted but to bring hope and healing.
      Thus, we find Him in constant conflict with the forces of evil who
      fought hard to retain their hold over the human beings they possessed.
      The demons were strong, but Jesus was stronger.

Read carefully the healing of the demon-possessed man in the syna-
      gogue at Capernaum (Mark 1:21-28). How should this miracle
      help prove His identity?


        Jesus eventually would be rejected by many of the people He came
      to deliver because they would refuse to acknowledge who He truly
      was, despite the powerful evidence given them. In contrast, the devils
      recognized Him and bowed before His authority. Talk about irony!

       Christian author C. S. Lewis told how, when he was an atheist,
       another atheist, talking to him about Jesus, said something to
       the effect of, Well, you know, C. S., there’s a lot of historical
       information backing up the Gospel accounts of the life and
       death of Christ. The friend then went on his merry way, seem-
       ingly unaffected by the implications of his own statement. The
       implications, however, profoundly impacted Lewis, who eventu-
       ally became a Christian. How does this account fit in with
       today’s lesson? In what ways are we, even as Christians, in dan-
       ger of assuming a similar attitude as Lewis’s atheist friend; that
       is, of ignoring powerful evidence given to us about the working
       and power of God?

                                                                         15

     Peter’s Mother-in-law (Mark 1:29-39).
How does Jesus’ healing of Peter’s mother-in-law demonstrate His
     personal interest and care? (Mark 1:29-34).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The New International Version translates Mark 1:30, 31 like this:
     “Simon’s mother–in–law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus
     about her. So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The
     fever left her and she began to wait on them.” As soon as Jesus heard
     about her sickness, He went to her bedside. No putting off the visit
     until He had eaten Sabbath lunch, no time given to instructing the dis-
     ciples. Instead, she came first. And at the bedside He didn’t simply
     speak to make her well: He took her hand and helped her up. What a
     tender, thoughtful Healer He was! Notice also that the healing was not
     only immediate but complete. A bout with fever frequently leaves a
     person weak and debilitated. Not so with Peter’s mother-in-law: She
     got up and immediately ministered to them.

Jesus does something for Peter’s mother-in-law that she couldn’t do
     for herself, and then she responds.How does this reflect the whole
     idea of the Christian life? (See Matt. 10:8; John 15:12; 1 John
     5:2, 3).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

When was the last time someone did something really special for you
     for which you were exceedingly grateful? How did you respond,
     and why? How did your response also reflect what the Christian
     life of grace is all about?


      By doing all these wonderful things, Jesus gets a great follow-
      ing. “All men,” said the disciples,“seek for Thee.” But did they
      really? When you read the whole story of Jesus, it’s possible
      that some of these same people were among those who, in the
      end,turned away from Him.Thus,seeking after Jesus,in and of
      itself, isn’t always enough. There needs to be something else.
      How does the response of Peter’s mother-in-law hold the key to
      solving this potential problem, and how does that apply to our
      own spiritual life? (See also James 2:22.)

      The Leper (Mark 1:40-45).
Study Jesus’ cleansing of the leper in Mark 1:40-45. What shows
      Jesus’ compassion? Why did He give the healed man a strong
      warning? What was the result of this miracle?


         The English term leprosy comes from the Greek lepra, which is
      used in the New Testament. It seems evident, however, that the word
      was used for various diseases affecting the skin. The SDA Bible
      Dictionary, in discussing the description of leprosy in Leviticus 13,
      notes: “An analysis of the various symptoms . . . disclose[s] that the
      term leprosy was evidently used in a more general sense than it is
      today. Some have suggested that Leviticus 13 comprehends 7 differ-
      ent diseases under the general term ‘leprosy.’ Some of the symptoms
      described resemble . . . psoriasis, . . . rather than leprosy, also called
      Hansen’s disease, although leprosy is certainly included.”—Page 667.
         The Old Testament gave explicit instructions for those diagnosed
      by the priest as having leprosy. They were sent away from home and
      society (Num. 5:1-4, 12:9-15, 2 Kings 15:5) and forbidden to enter
      any city (2 Kings 7:3). The leper was to wear torn clothes, let his hair
      hang loose, and cry out “Unclean, unclean!” if anyone approached
      him (Lev. 13:45, 46). Apparently these conventions were still in force
      at the time of Jesus. The ten men with leprosy who met Jesus outside
      a certain village stood at a distance and shouted out to Him (see Luke
      17:12). However, the leper in Mark 1:40 came right up to Jesus and
      begged Him on his knees for cleansing.

As humans, we all have a disease worse than leprosy, and that’s sin.
      How, though, did a holy, sinless God respond and treat us anyway?


         The fact that Jesus not only permitted the leper to approach Him but
      reached out His hand and touched him—breaking the conventions of the
      day—vividly shows the Savior’s compassion. We, too, must not under-
      estimate the healing power of touch. Employed with appropriate discre-
      tion, the touch of love—whether the outstretched hand or an embrace—
      for many wounded people goes far beyond what words may accomplish.

       And though (in most cases) none of us have the power of super-
       natural healing in our touch, we should all as Christians have
       the power of love, of compassion, of mercy and unselfish care
       for others.What is your attitude toward modern-day “lepers”?
       What do you need to change about yourself in order to show
       them the same compassion as did Christ? Why is that so often
       hard to do?

                                                                            17
         W E D N E S DAY April 6

     The Pa ra ly t i c (Mark 2:1-12).
       The story of the paralytic lowered through the roof is one of deter-
     mination and ingenuity. We can’t but admire the four men who, find-
     ing no way to get to Jesus through a crowded house, made a hole in
     the roof through which they lowered the man on the mat. The story
     even has a humorous touch. The teachers of the law, out of their ele-
     ment in the crowded, sweaty room, couldn’t believe it when bits of
     ceiling began to rain down on them and someone was coming in
     through the roof!

Read Mark 2:1-12. Imagine that you are sitting on the floor in the
     crowded room. You have come out to see this Jesus of Nazareth,
     whose miracles have people talking. But what happens is more
     amazing than anything you have heard. Imagine the reaction of
     the participants to Jesus’ words and actions:

       The men who lowered the paralytic—their first reactions?
     Later reactions? The reaction of the paralytic? The reaction of the
     scribes? The reaction of the people who saw and heard Jesus?


        Jesus honored the faith of the men who brought the paralytic, but
     not in the way they expected. He knew that the paralytic’s most press-
     ing burden was spiritual. As much as the sick man wanted to be made
     physically whole, he sought peace with God even more.
        “Like the leper, this paralytic had lost all hope of recovery. His dis-
     ease was the result of a life of sin, and his sufferings were embittered
     by remorse. He had long before appealed to the Pharisees and doctors,
     hoping for relief from mental suffering and physical pain. But they
     coldly pronounced him incurable, and abandoned Him to the wrath of
     God. . . .
        “Yet it was not physical restoration He desired so much as relief
     from the burden of sin. If he could see Jesus, and receive the assur-
     ance of forgiveness and pace with Heaven, he would be content to live
     or die according to God’s will.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     p. 267.

      Stress, guilt, fear, loneliness, anger, resentment,and jealousy all
      can have a debilitating effect on health. What promises do we
      have through Jesus that, if claimed by faith, could help bring
      healing both to body and soul? How have you experienced this
      power?

             T H U R S DAY April 7

     Levi Matthew (Mark 2:13-21).
        Levi also is known as Matthew (see Matt. 10:31). As a tax collec-
     tor, he was a member of a despised group. People hated tax collectors
     for two reasons: (1) They worked on behalf of Rome, a foreign occu-
     pying power. The tax collectors were collaborators with the enemy,
     and (2) tax collectors were often unscrupulous. The Romans followed
     a system of “tax farming.” Instead of taxing each person directly, they
     relied on tax agents who were held responsible for bringing into the
     treasury a stipulated sum. But so long as the tax collector paid in the
     designated amount, he could raise as much as he was able and keep
     the remainder for himself. Thus, the system lent itself to abuses. Tax
     collectors became wealthy by preying on their fellow citizens.
        Jesus’ call to Levi Matthew must have shocked many people,
     including His followers. Further, Jesus went to the dinner that
     Matthew, in gratitude, put on for Him. Matthew invited his friends—
     other tax collectors—and “sinners,” meaning ordinary people on
     whom the Pharisees, who prided themselves in their superior standing
     with God, looked down upon. Their attitude toward them was: “ ‘This
     mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them’ ” (John
     7:49, NIV).
        Jesus, however, saw every person, no matter how society or the
     Pharisees regarded them, as a candidate for the kingdom of heaven.
     “ ‘It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick,’ ” He said. “ ‘I
     have not come to call the righteous, but sinners’ ” (Mark 2:17, NIV).

Explain Jesus’ parable of the new cloth and new wine (Mark 2:21,
     22) in the context of the day’s lesson.


        Jesus wasn’t one more in the line of Israel’s prophets. He was a
     prophet, but much more. He was God in the flesh, bringing the king-
     dom of heaven. This newness would burst old patterns of religious tra-
     ditions and conventions of society, such as those that looked down
     upon certain classes of people, even in violation of the basic princi-
     ples of true faith. It would eventually burst outside the wineskins of
     traditional religion itself, as the gospel would go to the Gentiles.

      Some longstanding human traditions, by virtue of nothing but
      their age, can become such a part of a faith that their violation
      seems sinful. What human traditions (if any) in Adventism
      have taken on the aura of something divine and inviolable?
      What’s the danger when this happens? How can we help peo-
      ple discern between what’s divine and what’s only human?
      (See also Mark 7:7.)


                                                                            19

Further Study: Luke covers all the material in this week’s lesson
     and Matthew some of it. Compare their accounts with Mark’s:
     Matthew 8:14-17, Luke 4:31-44, 5:12-38. Read “At Capernaum,”
     “ ‘Thou Canst Make Me Clean,’ ” and “Levi-Matthew,” The Desire of
     Ages, pp. 252–280.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Are miracles the ultimate test that a particular religion or reli-
      gious leader is genuine? What part will miracles play in the clos-
      ing events of this world’s history? Why must we be very careful
      about how much faith we put in miracles?

      ●2 In your class, discuss in more detail the idea of the danger of
      taking what are only human traditions and turning them into
      religious obligations.

      ●3 All the stories we have studied this week involve people con-
      sidered as second-class by society—the demon-possessed man,
      Peter’s mother-in-law (women were viewed as inferior to men),
      the leper, the paralytic, Levi Matthew. The first four stories
      involve physical healing, the last one spiritual healing. But the
      irony is that the teachers of the religion, who thought they were
      “the righteous” and had no need of a doctor, missed out on
      Jesus’healing. And though it’s easy for us to look down upon the
      “the righteous” here, in what ways can we by our attitudes
      toward others reveal the same kind of spiritual disease as did
      these leaders in Israel?

Summary: The material of this week’s lesson gives us a magnificent
     picture of Jesus as the Son of God. By expressions like “immediately”
     and “as soon as,” Mark creates a fast-moving account of a dynamic
     Savior who brings hope and deliverance to all, even though society
     rejects Him. Jesus the Son of God casts out devils and heals both body
     and soul.

Heal My Son
Svetlana Chikurova
   Svetlana held her tiny baby close as tears streamed down her cheeks. All
she wanted was a healthy baby, but the doctor had confirmed her worst
fears. Little Vladimir had suffered trauma to his central nervous system
during birth; he probably would never walk. His muscles were weak and
only would grow weaker.
   Svetlana cried out to God for help, for there was no one else to hear her.
“God,” she prayed, “my son needs Your healing. My neighbors ask me,
‘Where is your God?’What can I tell them, God?
   After one doctor’s appointment, Svetlana laid her baby on the couch.
Beside him she laid the pile of prescriptions the doctor had given her.
“Lord, you have created my child,” she said quietly. “You know his body,
and You heard what the doctor said. You see the prescriptions the doctor
wrote. I will not buy a single pill, but I lean on You to heal this child.”
   After several weeks in which Svetlana saw no improvement, she prayed
a prayer of surrender. “Lord, I accept that my child will be sick. Give me
strength and love to care for him.” While still kneeling, she saw a vision
of how she could massage the baby’s muscles to make them stronger. She
began massaging his arms and legs from the extremities to the trunk, and
she massaged his back. Every day she massaged his body. By six months
Vladimir could sit up.
   The doctor was pleased with the boy’s progress and credited the
improvement to the medicines she had prescribed. Svetlana did not tell her
that she had not given the boy the medicines. “He may walk,” the doctor
said thoughtfully, “but he will limp. He will not run, and one side of his
body will be weaker than the other.
   Svetlana continued massaging him, especially on his weaker side.
Vladimir walked at one year, and by the time he was 3 years old, he could
walk without a limp. He showed no sign of the weakness that the doctor
predicted. Today Vladimir loves to play soccer and volleyball; he won sec-
ond place in a ping pong tournament in his region.
   Svetlana says, “When someone says there is no God, I tell them, ‘Look
at my child. He is evidence that God exists.’ ”

      Sabbath Healings
      and Hard Hearts




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
      TROUBLE BREWING. It wasn’t long before controversy started to
      swirl around Jesus. And that’s not hard to understand. Anyone saying
      what He said, and doing what He did, would create controversy.
        And yet, it’s not all trouble. Besides the Sabbath healing, we follow
      Jesus as He ordains the Twelve to ministry, this motley group who will
      change the world forever. And we see Jesus, too, dealing with His own
      human family and their own misunderstanding of Him and His mis-
      sion.
         But most of all, this week we get another glimpse of the life and
      ministry of our Savior, whose every word, every act—even when
      accused of being in league with Satan or of being a Sabbath breaker—
      should help us love Him even more.

The Week at a Glance: Why did Jesus do healings on the
      Sabbath? What was the real issue behind the Pharisees’hatred of
      Christ? What were they trying to protect? What is the unpardon-
      able sin? Why did Jesus mention it when He did?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 2:23–3:35.

Memory Text: “And he said unto them,The sabbath was made
      for man, and not man for the sabbath:Therefore the Son of man
      is Lord also of the sabbath” (Mark 2:27, 28).

     Made for Man (Mark 2:23-28).
Read the account in Mark 2:23-28. Analyze Jesus’ answer to the
     scribes and Pharisees. What was the principle for David’s
     actions? In this specific context, what does Jesus mean when He
     says that the Sabbath was “made for man”? What does that teach
     us about how we should experience the Sabbath ourselves?


        In the world of Jesus’day, two characteristics set the Hebrew nation
     apart from other people—they worshiped one God instead of many
     gods, and they refrained from work on the seventh day. Centuries ear-
     lier, when they were a free nation, they failed on both these matters,
     falling into idolatry and Sabbath breaking. Prophet after prophet
     warned them of the disastrous course on which they were headed, but
     they continued their downward spiritual slide. Eventually they were
     carried away captive—the ten northern tribes by Assyria and the
     Southern Kingdom of Judah 140 years later by the Babylonians.
        When they returned from Babylonian captivity, they tried hard to
     avoid the errors that had led to their earlier loss of nationhood.
     Attempting to put a hedge around the Sabbath, they formulated
     detailed lists of what was permitted and not permitted.
        The Mishnah, the codified traditional law of the Jews, lists 39
     major types of labor prohibited on the Sabbath. But “these general
     regulations were further explained in minute detail. In addition to
     these major regulations there were countless other provisions con-
     cerning the observance of the Sabbath. Most commonly known, per-
     haps, is the so-called ‘Sabbath day’s journey’ of 2,000 cub.—some-
     what less than 2/3 mi. . . . It was also counted as Sabbathbreaking to
     look in a mirror fixed to the wall . . . , or even to light a candle. . . . It
     was counted unlawful to expectorate [spit] upon the ground, lest
     thereby a blade of grass be irrigated. It was not permissible to carry a
     handkerchief on the Sabbath, unless one end of it be sewed to one’s
     garment—in which case it was no longer technically a handkerchief
     but part of the garment.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 587.
        Whereas the Jewish leaders had become obsessed with detailed
     regulations, Jesus restored the Sabbath to the purpose for which He
     created it. The Sabbath was not meant to be a burden but a delight. It
     was to be a day of worship, relaxation, and restoration; a day of joy;
     a day that contributes to the happiness of others.

      We are told to call the Sabbath a “delight” (Isa. 58:13) and to
      “keep it holy” (Exod. 20:8). What is your concept of “delight”
      and what it means to be “holy”? Why should there be no con-

     The Man With the Withered Hand
Read Mark 3:1-6.Why do you think the leaders wanted to kill Jesus?
     Was it because He healed on the Sabbath day? Or was there some-
     thing else going on, a much bigger issue at stake for them? See
     also John 11:48, Acts 17:6.

       Even on the Sabbath, a day for worship and contemplation of heav-
     enly things, the enemies of Jesus could not keep their minds off Him.
     Instead of opening their hearts to the blessings that God had for them
     through the reading of Scripture, prayer, and fellowship, they kept
     their eyes fixed on Jesus, waiting to see if they might find an oppor-
     tunity to accuse Him. They wanted to “prove” that He was a Sabbath
     breaker, but they themselves were breaking the Sabbath in their
     hearts.
       Mark says that Jesus was grieved because of the hardness of their
     hearts. Yet, the hardness wasn’t over their firm belief in how the
     Sabbath should be kept, but it was over their attitude toward Jesus. He
     threatened their power; He threatened their religious and political
     influence over the people. That’s why they hated Him so much. Of
     course, they couldn’t come right out and say that, so they needed to
     make up some excuses, anything they could find, in order to accuse
     Him and thus weaken His power. Thus, their fear of losing influence
     so blinded them that instead of rejoicing in the great power of God
     being manifested before them by the miracle of the healing, they
     accused Christ of Sabbath breaking.

Read Mark 3:4. Why didn’t they respond to Christ’s question?
     Shouldn’t they have had an answer? What does their silence
     reveal about their true motives?

      As human beings, we have a frightening ability to mask our
      true motives under the cloak of piety or holiness, and what
      makes it so frightening is that we don’t just cloak it before oth-
      ers, but we cloak it before ourselves. How can we be sure that
      our religious motives for what we do are pure, or if we are, in
      our own way, doing the same thing as the Pharisees?

     The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:7-19).
       This lesson marks an important expansion of Jesus’ ministry.
     Previously He had called various individuals to follow Him; that is, to
     be disciples. As His fame grew and as He traveled around Galilee, the
     band of followers continued to grow. It was now time to select some
     from among the many for a special work.

       Mark 3:7-14 gives us a brief but vivid portrayal of the strength
     of Jesus’movement in Galilee by this time. What do the verses say
     about the popularity of Christ? In what ways might the answer
     explain why He decided, at that point, to ordain people to work
     with Him?


       At the height of His popularity Jesus withdrew to a mountainside.
     Luke supplies an important detail—He spent the night in prayer (Luke
     6:12). Jesus faced an important decision and, as was His custom, He
     sought His Father’s guidance.

What were the two purposes that Jesus intended for the twelve peo-
     ple He selected to be apostles? Mark 3:13-19. What larger pur-
     pose, though, was intended? See Matt. 10:5-15, Mark 16:15.


        The word apostle literally means “one who is sent.” The Twelve
     whom Jesus called would be sent out to preach and to drive out
     demons. That is, they would be an extension of His ministry while He
     was still on earth, and after He returned to the Father they would carry
     on His work. But before being sent, they were to be “with Him”—
     observing His methods and becoming like Him in character.
        As we look at the Twelve, we see a mix of backgrounds, personali-
     ties, strengths, and weaknesses. Several were fishermen, one a tax-
     collector, another a member of the zealots, a strongly nationalistic
     faction that at times resorted to violence. Simon Peter, bold and
     impetuous, had much to learn. James and John were fiery tempered.
     And then there was Judas Iscariot, who would betray Jesus.

      There were so many other people in Israel—learned, eloquent,
      erudite, rich—who could have, it would seem,made a much bet-
      ter nucleus for this new movement. And yet, Jesus chose this
      bunch? What lessons are here for us about (1) judging the out-
      ward character of others, (2) judging another person’s spiritual
      potential, (3) judging what characteristics we deem important
      in people engaged in ministry?


                                                                          25
          W E D N E S DAY April 13

      Jesus and Beelzebub (Mark 3:22-30).
         The miracles of Jesus were too many and too amazing to deny. A
      power more than human was at work in Him, but the spies who
      dogged His footsteps seeking to find grounds to accuse Him refused
      to admit the obvious—that He was the Son of God. Instead, they tried
      to argue that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub, the devil.

How did Jesus answer the claim of the critics that He was in league
      with the devil? Mark 3:22-27.


        By a simple but effective reply Jesus demolished the accusation of
      the teachers of the law. Jesus’ work tore down the kingdom of Satan:
      He cast out demons, healed the sick, and set men and women free
      from the chains of sin and bad habits by which they were bound. This
      was just the opposite of the manner in which Satan works. If Jesus
      were in league with the devil, He would do the works of Satan and
      build up Satan’s kingdom, not destroy it.

Why did Jesus, after His specific response to the charges, say what He
      did about “the unpardonable sin”? What was in their words and
      attitudes toward Him that would have elicited this strong warning?
      How were they, by their attitude, doing just what he warned about?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “The Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke this warning did not them-
      selves believe the charge they brought against Him. There was not one
      of those dignitaries but had felt drawn toward the Saviour. They had
      heard the Spirit’s voice in their own hearts declaring Him to be the
      Anointed of Israel, and urging them to confess themselves to His dis-
      ciples. In the light of His presence they had realized their unholiness,
      and had longed for a righteousness which they could not create. But
      after their rejection of Him it would be too humiliating to receive Him
      as the Messiah. Having set their feet in the path of unbelief, they were
      too proud to confess their error.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
      Ages, p. 322.

       How, in this context, do we then understand “the unpardonable
       sin”? What would you say to someone who thought they had
       committed it? How is the mere fact that they feel this conviction
       evidence that they have not committed that sin?

     Jesus’ Mother and Brothers (Mark 3:31-34).
       During His earthly ministry, Jesus did not receive support from His
     family. John the beloved tells us plainly: “Even his own brothers did
     not believe in Him” (John 7:5, NIV). His mother, Mary, had stored in
     her heart the events connected with His birth and childhood (Luke
     2:19, 51), but she did not understand the mission that Jesus as the
     Messiah had come to fulfill.

With Jesus surrounded by crowds so that He hardly had time to eat,
     what did His family members decide to do? (Mark 3:20, 21).


        The New International Version translates Mark 3:21 as “When his
     family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said,
     ‘He is out of his mind.’ ” Perhaps they were embarrassed by the sort
     of people Jesus was associating with. Perhaps the accusations of His
     critics that He was in league with the devil bothered them. And most
     troubling of all to them was His rejection by the religious leaders,
     who might have been expected to embrace Him as Israel’s deliverer
     from the hated Romans.

Analyze Jesus’ response when He received word that Mary and His
     brothers were standing outside the house looking for Him. Did
     Jesus not care about His earthly family members? What point
     was He making by saying: “Whoever does God’s will is my
     brother and sister and mother”? Mark 3:31-34, NIV. See also Deut.
     30:20, Matt. 7:21, John 15:14, 1 John 5:3.


        Elsewhere Mark names Jesus’brothers—James, Joseph, Judas, and
     Simon. He tells us that Jesus also had sisters (Mark 6:3). It is signifi-
     cant that Joseph, the husband of Mary, is not mentioned in this inci-
     dent. The brothers of Jesus here and elsewhere relate to Jesus as a
     younger brother, telling Him what to do and wanting to take charge of
     Him. This indicates that Joseph had been married previously and was
     a widower when he married Mary. During Jesus’ministry he is never
     mentioned; presumably he had died by this time. After His resurrec-
     tion, Jesus’ family saw Him in a new light. His brothers are mentioned
     as being among the believers at Pentecost (Acts 1:14), while Paul
     calls James, the Lord’s brother, an “apostle” (Gal. 1:19).

      If you know someone (or perhaps you’re facing it yourself) who’s
      struggling with family members who don’t understand or
      appreciate this person’s Adventist faith, what kind of help can
      you give them? How does todays study offer encouragement?

                                                                          27

Further Study: Work through the seven Sabbath miracles of Jesus,
     noting why He performed each one, the lessons He sought to teach,
     and the reactions of His enemies. See Mark 1:21-28, Mark 1:29-31,
     Mark 3:1-6, Luke 13:10-17, 14:1-4, John 5:1-15, 9:1-41. Read “The
     Sabbath,” “He Ordained Twelve,” and “Who Are My Brethren?,” The
     Desire of Ages, pp. 281–289, 290–297, and 321–327.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 If some new Adventist came and asked you, What principles
      can you show me about how to keep the Sabbath, what would you
      say, and why? Discuss your different approaches as a class.

      ●2 What differences will there be in our Sabbath keeping if (1) we
      observe the Sabbath simply because it is commanded by God or
      (2) we keep the Sabbath because we love Jesus and want to follow
      Him? What differences will there be between the two?

      ●3 Why is it so difficult to work with someone who has the atti-
      tude of the Pharisees; that is, who has indeed squelched the
      prompting of the Holy Spirit on his or her heart? What different
      approaches might you take to try to help that person? Is it ever
      too late, even for someone who has committed the unpardonable
      sin? Cannot someone repent from that sin,or does the mere fact
      that they have committed it mean that it’s too late for repent-
      ance? Discuss this as a class.

Summary: Jesus was the Lord of the Sabbath, and He showed His
     authority by the deeds He did on the Sabbath. What a frightful testi-
     mony to the hardness of human hearts that the leaders, those who
     should have known better, closed themselves off to the very Lord they
     professed to serve with all diligence and faith. There are lessons here
     for anyone who believes they are living in service to the Lord.

The Farmer’s Dream
Juan Gratica Silva
   A farmer in Chile had a dream that Jesus was coming soon. In his dream
he was told to tell everyone what he had seen. The farmer had little edu-
cation, but he did not hesitate. He began visiting his neighbors, giving
them his message, “Do you know that Jesus is coming soon?”
   The neighbors looked at him curiously. These people considered them-
selves Christians, but they knew little about God or the Bible. The farmer’s
message seemed strange to them. But the farmer would not give up. He
continued visiting every house in town, asking, “Do you know that Jesus
is coming soon?”
   He went from door to door, up one street and down another. He stopped
people on the street and in cars and asked them, “Do you know that Jesus
is coming soon?” People began to refer to the farmer as the “Jesus-is-
coming man.”
   One day a new resident in town answered the farmer’s knock at his door.
When the farmer asked his familiar question, “Do you know that Jesus is
coming soon?” the man smiled.
   “Yes, I know that. It is written in the Bible.” The man invited the farmer
into his home to talk. The farmer rejoiced, for this man was the only per-
son who responded to his questions and wanted to talk about Jesus.
   The farmer did not know where in the Bible it said that Jesus would
come soon, so the man showed him Jesus’ promises. Together they read
John 14, 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18, and parts of 1 Peter. The farmer was so
excited to meet this man, for in the whole city of 5,000 people, he at last
had met someone who knew that Jesus is coming again.
   The man he had met was an Adventist. He invited the farmer to study
the Bible with him. The farmer faithfully studied the Bible to learn more
about Jesus, who had spoken to him in his dream. In time the man was
baptized into the Adventist Church.
   Today the farmer and the Adventist layman work together to tell every-
one in their town that Jesus is coming soon. They have formed small
groups that meet in their homes, and they look forward to the day when
the groups will unite to form a single congregation. And it all started
because a farmer had a vision and was not afraid to tell everyone that Jesus
is coming soon.

      By Galilee




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      THE MAN OF GALILEE. Though Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a
      small town in the highlands, He made Capernaum, rather than
      Nazareth (see Mark 2:1), the base for His ministry. Capernaum was a
      city at the north end of the Lake of Galilee and a center of the fish-
      ing industry. When Jesus came “home” from His frequent travels, it
      was to Capernaum.
         The Sea of Galilee dominates the landscape of northern Israel.
      Shaped like a giant heart, it is about thirteen miles long north to south
      and about eight miles at its greatest width. The greenish blue fresh
      water lake teems with fish; it is, in places, 130 to 148 feet deep.
      Because its surface lies about 700 feet below sea level, the climate
      around the lake is subtropical.
         Here is where we find Jesus located in this week’s lesson. Every
      day’s study places Him either on the lake or on one side or the other.

The Week at a Glance: What lesson was Jesus teaching
      in the parable of the sower? Why did Jesus compare His eternal
      kingdom to a seed? What lessons can we learn from the storm on
      the sea? From the healing of the demoniac? From His ministry to
      two women almost at the same time? What traditions did Jesus
      overthrow, and why?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 4:1–5:43.

Memory Text: “They were terrified and asked each other, ‘Who
      is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!’ ” (Mark 4:41, NIV).

     The Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:1-20).
        This is one of those rare places in Mark’s Gospel where he gives
     space to Jesus’ teaching. Elsewhere he presents Jesus as the Man of
     action and does not pause to share specifics of His instruction.
        The parables of Jesus are famous, even among nonbelievers. Drawn
     from the events of everyday life, they are simple in wording and ideas,
     but they teach profound truths. Jesus, the Source of all wisdom, never
     tried to impress people with His knowledge or dazzle them with intel-
     lectual sleight of hand. Instead, He laid truth on the line, presented
     through the disarmingly simple approach of stories from common
     life. The other Gospel writers record many more parables of Jesus,
     and often they have a surprise ending—the first become last and the
     last first. Those in Mark 4, however, do not share this characteristic.

Study Jesus’parable of the sower and the explanation He gave to the
     disciples (Mark 4:3-20). Is this parable really about the sower, or is
     it about the different kinds of soil? What is He talking about here?


       Who are represented by each of the following?

     People
     ________along
             ______the
                   ____path:

                       ____________________________________________________

       Notice that the sower is the same in each case, and so is the seed.
     God’s invitation goes out to all people to accept His salvation and
     become citizens of His kingdom. However, God never compels. He
     gives to everyone the opportunity to refuse Him and His gracious offer.
       The parable also makes clear that following Jesus is much more
     than a single decision. Some Christians like to recount the actual day
     when they were “saved” by accepting Jesus, but the Christian life isn’t
     complete in one day. In this world the Christian’s life is a battle and a
     march; God calls us to grow in grace and in knowledge of Him. As
     Jesus explained in this parable, some people start well but do not
     complete the journey; the seed sprouts but never bears fruit.

      Think about someone you’ve known who fits in each of these cat-
      egories. To the best of your knowledge, what were the deciding
      factors that placed them there?

                                                                           31

     The Kingdom Is Like Seed (Mark 4:21-34).
       In two short but penetrating parables Jesus likens the kingdom of
     God to seed. What a contrast with the empires that proud, ambitious
     humans have endeavored to set up. They took as their symbols
     weapons of brute force, mighty armies, horses and chariots, or in
     these days tanks, rockets, and fighter planes. “The only power that
     counts,” said one political leader, “is the power that comes out of the
     barrel of a gun.” But the Son of God comes to earth, announces that
     the kingdom of God is coming, and He compares it to seed. What
     does that mean?

What characteristics of seed are shown in these parables:

     The parable of the growing seed (Mark 4:26-29)?


     The parable of the mustard seed (Mark 4:30-32)?


        How small is a seed! But it has within it an energy that, released,
     brings life and growth. The magnificent trees—the oak, the red-
     wood—that stretch toward the heavens and make us feel so puny all
     began with a seed.
        Charlemagne, king of the Holy Roman Empire, bowed to no one. It
     is said that when the pope was about to place the crown on his head,
     Charlemagne seized it and crowned himself. Yet this ruler, so strong
     and feared during his lifetime, at last grew old. Facing death, he left
     instructions as to how his remains were to be handled: He was to be
     clad in his royal robes with a crown on his head, scepter in hand, and
     seated on his throne. Then the tomb was to be sealed tight, never to
     be broken. He would reign forever even in death!
        His servants did as he had instructed and closed the tomb. The years
     went by; the winds blew and the showers fell on Charlemagne’s tomb.
     And one day the wind carried a tiny seed, and it lodged in a crack. The
     rain fell, and the seed sprouted. It found a little soil and put down
     roots. Its roots expanded the crack, and the wind carried in more soil,
     and the plant grew larger. It grew and grew until one day the tomb
     cracked open to reveal a skeleton slumped on a dusty throne, robes
     rotted away, crown fallen to the earth, scepter in the dust. The mighty
     Charlemagne’s plans had been defeated by the power of a seed.

      What practical steps can help you keep your focus on God’s
      eternal kingdom, as opposed to earthly temporal things that
      always end in dust and death? How could these texts help? Matt.

     Terror by Water (Mark 4:35-41).
       C. S. Lewis wrote about what a great strain the death of his wife
     placed on his faith in God. “You never know how much you really
     believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life
     and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and
     sound as long as you are merely using it to cord a box. But suppose
     you had to hang by that rope over a precipice. Wouldn’t you then first
     discover how much you really trusted it?”—C. S. Lewis, A Grief
     Observed (Harper, San Francisco, 1996), pp. 22, 23.

Keeping Lewis’s words in mind, read Mark 4:35-41. How is the
     same principle he expressed manifested here by the disciples?
     Why do you think Jesus answered them as He did?

        In verse 38, the disciples asked a question that, no doubt, millions
     of Christians have asked during times of crisis. And, of course, by
     faith we know the answer. Of course He cares. That was the whole
     purpose of the Cross, to save us so that we don’t have to perish (John
     3:16, 10:10, 2 Pet. 3:9). Nevertheless, who hasn’t found themselves
     in a similar situation, where your “boat” is “full” of water and you are
     about to go down and you cry out, God, don’t You care?

      When was the last time you found yourself in a similar situation
      as the disciples? What happened? Would Jesus have been right
      in asking you,“How is it that you have no faith?” What did you
      learn that, you believe, can help you the next time you face
      something like this?

      lessons could you draw from it about the power of God to help you
      overcome, for instance, habitual sin?


        Maybe you focused on the reality of the demons and their power
      over the man. What lessons can you learn from this about the
      great controversy and how we need to rely totally on Jesus?


        Maybe you focused on the reaction of these swineherders to
      what had happened to their herd. What lessons could you draw
      about how worldly considerations can come in and hide the true
      nature and character of God from us?


        Maybe you focused on the reaction of the man to what Christ
      had done for him.What lessons can you learn from this about how
      we should respond to what Christ has done for us?


        Maybe your emphasis was on what Christ told him to do after
      he asked to remain with Jesus.What lessons are there about what
      should motivate us to witness to others about what Christ means
      to us?


       Whatever point you emphasized (and maybe it was another one)
       and whatever practical lesson you learned, go through the Bible
       and see if you can find another story, or other texts, that but-
       tress and affirm your position. Take your point to class and
       share it with others.

     A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman (Mark
     5:21-43).

       Back across the lake, probably in Capernaum, Jesus will manifest
     His power once more in dramatic fashion. His life gives life to the seed,
     where power works silently but marvelously. His power commanded
     the winds and the waves to be still and then brought calm to the trou-
     bled soul of a wild man. Now His power will drive away long-standing
     disease and then will raise a young girl to life from the dead.

Read Mark 5:21-43. What connections do you find between these two
     miracles? How do they show Jesus’interest in all types of people?

       Here are two females, one at the beginning of womanhood, the
     other at the end. One has hemorrhaged for 12 years, the other has just
     reached 12 years of age. Both would be considered insignificant in
     society: One, because of her bleeding, was ceremonially unclean and
     defiled anyone who came into contact with her (hence, according to
     the Levitical law, she made Jesus unclean by touching Him). The
     other was only a girl, considered to be without status in society. Now
     she was dead, and to touch a corpse also brought uncleanness. But
     Jesus, setting aside the misuse of ancient laws took her by the hand
     and raised her to new life.
       Of course, Jesus did this a lot; that is, setting aside misused and
     misinterpreted laws and regulations that, instead of promoting faith,
     worked to hinder it (see Mark 7:13). His Sabbath healings are, of
     course, one of the best examples. What about His driving the money-
     changers out of the temple, where they were used to selling their
     wares? What about His denouncing the practice of “corban” (Mark
     7:11)? Or what about His words about washing or about food? Many
     of these things were, in fact, rooted in the Bible; they had just become
     perverted through human abuses and their true meaning hidden under
     human ideas and traditions.

      What are certain things in your culture, and maybe even in
      some interpretations of our faith,that might, for a greater good,
      be violated? In other words, are there some practices, or some
      beliefs,that are often held as inviolable that,under the right cir-
      cumstances, could be violated? If so, does that mean that, per-
      haps,these practices shouldn’t be there at all? How are we sup-
      posed to know which should stay or which should go?

                                                                           35

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 Have someone in the class who has done gardening explain in
      some detail the principles of what makes soil good for a seed to
      grow into healthy plants. What spiritual lessons can you learn
      from these details?

      ●2 In the New Testament, the existence of demons is readily
      apparent. Some try to argue, however, that these were just mani-
      festations of mental illness and that the Bible writers simply
      did not know any better. How would you respond to such accusa-
      tions? Why is it important that we, as a people, understand the
      reality and power of demons?

      ●
      3 In Mark 5:36, Jesus said, “Be not afraid, only believe.”
      Though He spoke in a specific context, what did He mean? How
      can those words be of value to someone who is now facing a ter-
      rible crisis? Why should we not be afraid? And what should we
      believe?

      ●4 Discuss as a class this whole question of what are inviolable
      practices as opposed to mere traditions. Can traditions, no mat-
      ter how “sacred,” ever work against the truth?

Summary: “Who is this . . .?” cried out the disciples when Jesus
     calmed the storm. That exclamation of amazement and awe applied to
     each part of this week’s lesson. Who is this whose kingdom comes not
     with trumpets blaring and lavish display but silently like the growing
     seed? Who is this whom demons recognize and before whom they
     bow? Who is this whose power flows out from the hem of His garment
     to heal a woman’s suffering? Who is this who takes a dead girl’s hand
     and calls her back to life?
       This is Jesus who turns upside down earthly expectations. This is
     Jesus, the Man extraordinary. This is Jesus, the Son of the living God.

Two Invitations
J. H. Zachary
   The Hungarian Union conducts soul-winning seminars for its members.
Nearly 300 members attended one recent seminar. After discussing how to
share Jesus with others, participants divided into teams and went into the
city to practice what they had learned.
   After some time, two of the seminar participants stepped inside an open
church to rest and pray. They heard someone weeping bitterly in the pew
behind them. Tivadar, an Adventist pastor, stood and walked to the pew
and found an elderly woman weeping. He slipped into the pew and sat
beside her.
   “I heard you weeping,” the pastor whispered. “May I help you?” The
woman told him her name was Eszter (Esther). Then she poured out her
heart to him.
   “A few weeks ago I became seriously ill. I was taken to the hospital,
where the doctor told my children that I was dying. But the Lord healed
me, and I recovered. When I was released from the hospital, I returned to
my apartment to discover someone moving in. I learned that my children
had sold my apartment and all of my belongings. Now I have nothing and
no place to live.”
   Pastor Tivadar answered, “I do not know the solution to these serious
problems, but God does. May I pray with you?”
   “Oh, thank you,” she said. Pastor Tivadar prayed for Eszter, then he
invited her to attend the seminar the next day. “It is a very spiritual meet-
ing,” he encouraged. “You will enjoy it.”
   “You are from the Adventist Church?” Eszter asked.
   “Yes, I am a pastor in the Adventist church,” Tivadar replied.
   “Yesterday, a woman invited me to attend. I must have misunderstood
the address, because I could not find the meeting place. That is why I was
weeping here in the church today. God sent you to give me a second
chance. Yes, I want to come.”
   The next day Eszter arrived at the meetings. She told everyone why she
was there and thanked God for giving her two invitations to the meeting.
“I am all alone in this town, and I need friends. I think God has sent me to
some new friends.”
   Eszter returned the following day and brought two young people with
her. She had already become a missionary to others.
   The church is working to help meet Eszter’s physical and spiritual needs.

      Confrontation
      in Galilee




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS. “In the latter time he [God] will
      make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee
      of the nations. The people who walked in darkness have seen a great
      light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light
      shined” (Isa. 9:1, 2, RSV). Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Coming to a
      people broken by sin, sickness, ignorance, and poverty, He brought
      salvation, healing, and new life.
         Jesus attracted a huge following in Galilee. For a while He was a
      sensation, but the storm clouds were gathering. Indeed, the movement
      reaches a critical point when Jesus feeds the 5,000. Enthusiasm builds
      to a crescendo as the people surge forward to crown Jesus as their
      king, but Jesus spurns the offer. Disappointed, many now turn away.
      And, in a grim foreshadowing of the events that await Jesus, Mark
      reminds us of the fate that befell John the Baptist, who also had been
      popular for a time.

The Week at a Glance: Why was Jesus rejected at Nazareth?
      What parallels existed between the actions of Herod and Pilate? Why
      did so many start turning away from Jesus? Why was Jesus so harsh
      against many of the religious traditions of His time?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 6:1–7:23.

Memory Text: “For they all saw him, and were terrified. But
      immediately he spoke to them and said, ‘Take heart, it is I; have
      no fear’ ” (Mark 6:50, RSV).

     Confrontation at Nazareth (Mark 6:1-5; see
     also Luke 4:16-30).

        News of Jesus and His miracles had spread all over Galilee, so the
     people of Nazareth had certainly heard about what He was doing.
     Nazareth was only a village at that time, with perhaps five hundred to
     six hundred people, and to have one of their number become famous
     must have led to a lot of talk among its inhabitants. Luke records that
     in His teaching Jesus said, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me:
     ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have
     heard you did in Capernaum’ ” (Luke 4:23).

Read carefully Mark 6:3.What are the people saying? Why are they
     saying it? Why do you think they reacted as they did? Didn’t they,
     on one level, have reasons to be skeptical?

     ____________________________________________________________________

Why were they so offended at Him? See Luke 4:16-30.

        Australians have a colorful expression to describe the same sort of
     reaction expressed by the people in Jesus’hometown. They call it “the
     tall poppy syndrome.” In a field of poppies, when one grows higher
     than the rest, people seek to cut it down. They don’t want someone to
     look better or feel better than the rest of them. A similar idea is found
     in Scandinavia in the term Jante law. This expresses an attitude to
     anyone in a leadership position who says: “Don’t think you are any-
     thing special. You are no better than we are. We put you in that posi-
     tion, and we can just as easily remove you.”
        “[Jesus] could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a
     few sick people and heal them. And he was amazed at their lack of
     faith” (Mark 6:5, NIV). The people of Nazareth thought they knew all
     about Jesus: They had seen Him grow up, knew His parents, brothers,
     and sisters. To them He was one of them and not anyone special. They
     thought they knew Him but did not.

      In what ways have you misjudged God? Why is it so easy for us,
      as sinners, to do just that? What lessons have you learned from
      those mistakes?

                                                                           39

      The Death of John (Mark 6:14-22).
        After the account of Jesus sending out the Twelve (Mark 6:7-13),
      Mark adds a detailed record of the circumstances of the death of John
      the Baptist. This is the only place in his Gospel where Mark diverts
      from the straight track of portraying Jesus the Man of action. At the
      outset of his Gospel, Mark gave a brief notice of John the Baptist as
      the messenger whom God raised up to announce the coming of the
      Messiah (Mark 1:2-8), and he does not mention him again until this
      point in his narrative. By the time Jesus sent out the Twelve, John had
      already been murdered, and King Herod speculated that the miracles
      wrought by Jesus were actually being done by John raised from the
      dead. The wicked ruler obviously had a troubled conscience over the
      death of God’s servant.

Contrast the actions of Herod here with that of Pilate at the trial of
      Jesus. See Matt. 27:11-30, Mark 15:2-20, Luke 23:2-25, John 18:28-38,
      19:1-16.

        What role did guilt play in both?


        How did both feel about sentencing to death their prisoners?


        What role did the wives play in both cases?


        What role did worldly kingly power play in both cases?


        How were both men manipulated by others?


        For Jesus, the news of John’s murder and the disgraceful events sur-
      rounding it must have come with searching of heart. Not only was He
      grieved at the loss of His cousin and fellow worker but John’s end
      foreshadowed His own. Ahead of Jesus lay not the executioner’s
      sword but the cross.

       In looking at some of the characteristics that both Pilate and
       Herod displayed, can you see some of the same things in your-
       self? If so,how can you change? How can you be protected from
       letting these weaknesses ruin you too?

     The Turning Point (Mark 6:33-46).

Read Mark’s account of the feeding of the f ive thousand. Study also
      the parallel account of this event in John 6:1-15, noting especially
      verses 14, 15. What additional light do you find? Why did Jesus
      not want them to make Him a king? (See John 3:14, 7:8, 18:36.)
      After all, wasn’t Jesus the King?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        John tells us the result of Jesus’refusal to be crowned king: “From
      this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed
      him” (John 6:66, NIV). In other words, the people became discour-
      aged; their hopes and expectations were dashed; their preconceived
      notions about whom this Man was weren’t fulfilled. And thus, they
      turned away from Him.

Recount a time in which you turned away from either a person,an
     organization, whatever, because your expectations weren’t met.
     Were your expectations wrong, or even unrealistic? Should you
     have done more thinking beforehand? What did you learn from
     this experience?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In our zeal to win converts, are we not in danger of giving people
     false expectations about what being a Christian is all about? Should
     we be promising people that they’ll suddenly be happy, fulfilled,
     healthy, and prosperous if they accept Jesus and join our church? We
     do have wonderful Bible promises, but these must be kept in context
     and oftentimes balanced with other texts that let us know the
     Christian life can sometimes be a struggle, that there are trials, temp-
     tations, and suffering along the way. (See Acts 14:22; 1 Pet. 4:12, 13.)

       What false expectations, if any, did you have regarding what it
       means to be a Christian, a follower of Christ, and even an
       Adventist? How did you work through them? What advice
       would you give to someone who is struggling because of false
       expectations about either the church or God or both?

                                                                         41

     Jesus Walks on the Water (Mark 6:45-56).
Considering the events depicted in yesterday’s lesson, why do
     you think Jesus chose that particular time to do such an incred-
     ible miracle such as walking on the water? What does that tell us
     about how the Lord will give us what we need to have faith, if we
     are open to accept it?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       After Jesus had walked over the water and entered the boat, it says
     that the disciples were astonished at what happened. The Greek verb
     means “astonished beyond comprehension.” According to Mark, they
     didn’t consider the miracle of the fish and the loaves, because their
     hearts were hardened. Even after such an incredible miracle, they still
     didn’t get it.

Review the events in the first six chapters of Mark, up until
     Christ’s walking on the water. What miracles did Jesus perform,
     and why should they have caused His followers to fully believe in
     Him? At the same time, what things happened that could have
     caused them to doubt whom He was? What lessons can we draw
     from this about faith, about how we get it, about how we maintain
     it, and about how we could lose it?


        As sinful human beings, our natural inclinations are toward evil,
     toward selfishness, toward sin; thus, it’s not natural for us to lean
     toward a God who is good, selfless, and sinless. No matter what God
     does for us, no matter how great a view of the Cross we have, no mat-
     ter what miracles He has done for us, if we don’t guard our souls, if
     we don’t cultivate faith, nourish faith, practice faith, and live by faith,
     our hearts can become hard. Our natural trajectory is downward,
     earthward, toward self, toward sin, toward death. Only by daily grasp-
     ing the hand of God, by faith, can we stop the natural downward pro-
     gression.

      Go back over your own walk with the Lord. How were you first
      converted? What has God done for you since then? Dwell on
      these things, cling to these things, and pray for the Holy Spirit
      to purge you of all doubts because of whatever things you don’t
      understand.

       Confrontation With the Pharisees (Mark

      what would you write?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      text?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Oftentimes critics of religion claim that religion is a man-made
      construct used to give a certain class of people power over another
      class. And yet, and here’s the irony, this is exactly what Jesus is deal-
      ing with. These rituals were being used to help consolidate the power
      and wealth of the priestly class over and against others.
        For instance, God had given instructions regarding defilement in
      the book of Leviticus, but many more regulations had been added
      over the centuries. The effect was to exclude more and more of the
      common people—the sick, maimed, infirm, lepers, and those who did
      not measure up to the regulations of ritual purity—from the temple
      services, leaving it, and the power that came with it, in the hands of a
      small select group.
        It’s a scary thought (and it should be) that Jesus spent so much of
      His time fighting, not against pagans or skeptics or agnostics but
      against very religious people who believed that they were defending
      their faith. It’s scary, too, that in their zeal to defend the command-
      ments of God they actually produced traditions and commandments
      that at times nullified the commandments they were supposed to be
      protecting (see Mark 7:1-11).

       The greatest motive in the world is to do things out of love for
       God.At the same time, it’s also potentially the most dangerous
       of all motives.Why is that so? Why must those who believe that
       they are acting in behalf of their God be very careful in what
       they do in God’s “behalf”?



                                                                            43

Further Reading: Read Ellen G. White’s “The First Evangelists,”
     “Come Rest Awhile,” “ ‘Give Ye Them to Eat,’ ” “A Night on the Lake,”
     “The Crisis in Galilee,” and “Tradition,” in The Desire of Ages,
     pp. 349–371, 377–398.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 In class, have people relate some times where they, believing
      they were acting in behalf of God, now believe that they made a
      mistake. What did they do? How did they treat people? What
      might they have done differently if they knew what they know
      now? What lessons did they learn that might be able to help oth-
      ers from making the same mistakes?

      ●2 What did Jesus mean in Mark 7:20 about defilement? How is
      Jesus defining defilement here? How is it different from how the
      rabbis seemed to understand defilement? What principle is
      made manifest by this difference?

      ●3 Jesus spoke very harshly about human traditions. Do you
      think He was against tradition? If not, why the hard words?
      What are some of your traditions? Where did they originate
      from? How do they stand in contrast to the “commandments of
      God”? Might some of your traditions need to be examined in the
      context of what Jesus said in Mark 7? How would they fare?

Summary: For many months Jesus has enjoyed huge popular support
     in Galilee, but a change is coming. We see Him, first of all, rejected
     by His own people and then by even larger crowds. And we see Jesus
     confronting the religious establishment in His strongest rebuke to
     date. No niceties of expression, no mincing of words: These leaders,
     so proud of their strict observances, are really lawbreakers; their pro-
     fession is a sham, a hypocrisy.
       Jesus is indeed heading toward the Cross.

The French Exam
Ludmilla Mladenova
  Lucy is a university student in Bulgaria. She and her brother are the only
Adventists in their family. Sometimes they found it difficult sharing their
faith with their parents.
  Lucy was struggling with a French class that she had to complete in
order to graduate. Many of the students in her class knew far more French
than she did, and she wondered if she would ever catch up. At the end of
the first grading period, the teacher announced that the exam would have
two parts—written and oral. They would take the written exam together,
but each student would take the oral exam individually.
  One of Lucy’s friends in the class asked to take the oral exam first
because she had an appointment. After the exam, she stopped to see Lucy.
She told Lucy that the teacher asked her to choose one of five topics to
discuss orally. She discussed the topic she had chosen and how she
thought she had done on her exam.
  After her friend left, Lucy wrestled with her conscience. Should she
study this one question? No, that would be cheating. She decided to ignore
what her friend had told her and let the teacher choose the discussion topic
for her. Lucy continued preparing for the oral exam as if she had heard
nothing her friend had said.
  When she arrived to take the test, the teacher asked her to discuss the
same question that her friend had been given. She was surprised at how
easily the ideas came to her in French. Words that she had never remem-
bered learning flowed from her mouth. When she finished the oral exam,
she thanked God that she had trusted Him to lead her.
  Later Lucy learned that her friend had told several other students what
                              her topic of discussion was, and the teacher
                              suspected that they knew. She was glad that
                              she had asked the teacher to select the topic
                              for her.
                                When the exam results were posted, Lucy’s
                              grade was near the top of her class. For some
                              students the exam was a disaster; for Lucy, it
                              was a wonderful affirmation of faith and hon-
                              esty.

      The Passion Predicted




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      BORN TO DIE. With all the controversies that have swirled around
      Jesus of Nazareth down through the ages, the one fact agreed upon by
      believer and skeptic alike is that He died on a Roman cross. But the
      Christians never attempted to deny or explain the Cross away. They
      were not embarrassed by it. Rather, they had the attitude of the apos-
      tle Paul: “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
      Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto
      the world” (Gal. 6:14).
         For Paul and the other believers, the Cross was more than a mis-
      carriage of justice. Instead, it was part of the outworking of God’s
      plan to save the world. The Cross was necessary, and indispensable.
      Jesus was indeed born to die. As powerful a witness and example that
      His life provides, it is His dying—and only His dying—that will solve
      forever the problem of sin and evil.

The Week at a Glance: Why did Jesus talk to the Syro-
      phoenician woman as He did? How did Jesus work to remove preju-
      dice from His disciples? How many options does Jesus leave us in
      regard to His identity? What does it mean to “take up the cross”?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 7:24–9:13.

Memory Text: “And when he had called the people unto him
      with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come
      after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
      me” (Mark 8:34).

     Dogs Eat the Crumbs
       The journey to Syrophoenicia was one of the longest that Jesus
     took during His ministry and brought Him to the farthest point north-
     ward. Even here, far from Capernaum and the familiar sights of
     Galilee, Jesus’presence could not be kept secret. Word about Him had
     reached into this region, leading an unnamed Gentile woman to hope
     that He might be able to help her demon-possessed daughter.

Study the incident with the Syrophoenician woman (Mark 7:24-30).
     Compare the parallel account in Matthew’s Gospel (15:21-28).
     Why did Jesus speak to her as He did? What indicates that the
     woman did not understand Jesus’ words to be a rebuke?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Although Jesus’ words about the dogs seemed to slight her, the
     woman must have detected something in His manner and tone of voice
     that made her realize that He did not mean to call her a “dog,” that He
     was responding as the Jews typically would in order to teach His dis-
     ciples a lesson. Indeed, perhaps the saddest part of this whole account
     is what appears in Matthew, with the attitude of the disciples. They, the
     very ones who should have been encouraging her, who should have
     been eager for everyone to benefit from Jesus, were, instead, working
     against the purposes of the Lord. They let their own prejudices and
     preconceived notions of God and truth and faith work against God and
     truth and faith. Hence, Jesus said what He did to the woman probably
     more for the benefit of His own disciples than for her.

      Despite so many factors working against this woman, so many
      reasons to not have hope, Jesus says to her: “ ‘Woman, you have
      great faith!’ ” (Matt. 15:28, NIV). As we look at this woman, we
      can see many great elements of faith being manifested despite so
      many factors working against her.What was working against her,
      and yet, what elements of faith did she manifest anyway? And,
      most importantly, how can we ourselves manifest these elements
      in our own lives even when we face many discouraging things?

      Jesus Feeds the 4,000 (Mark 8:1-22).
         Earlier, Jesus had fed the 5,000 in Galilee. Now He does a similar
      miracle in the Decapolis region, to the east of the Lake of Galilee.
      Notice the attitude of the disciples. Though they had seen Jesus feed
      the 5,000 some months before, they again question His ability to care
      for this situation.
         “Again the disciples revealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they had
      seen how, with Christ’s blessing, their little store availed for the feed-
      ing of the multitude; yet they did not now bring forward their all,
      trusting His power to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover,
      those whom He had fed at Bethsaida were Jews: these were Gentiles
      and heathen. Jewish prejudice was still strong in the hearts of the dis-
      ciples.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 405.

To the disciples the amazing and unexpected thing was not that Jesus
      could supply the bread but rather that He would do so for
      Gentiles.What does their reaction (as seen also in yesterday’s les-
      son) teach us about the power of prejudice to negate the impact of
      the gospel in our lives?

         Probably one of the greatest tragedies in Christian history has been
      the racial bigotry spewing from those who claimed Jesus as their Lord
      and Master. It’s a scary testimony to the evil of prejudice that even
      among churchgoers evils such as racism, tribalism, rampant national-
      ism, and bigotry have remained entrenched. Even worse, people have
      attempted to use the Bible to sanction these attitudes, much to the
      detriment of the Christian witness. It’s one of the tragic ironies of his-
      tory that people should promote prejudice by using a book that was
      meant to expunge it.

       Below are a few texts dealing,in their own way, with the issue of
       bigotry and prejudice. Using them,and whatever other ones you
       can think of, write out a paragraph stating what you believe is
       the Bible’s basic message on this topic. How well do you,or does
       your church, measure up to what the Bible says about this?
       What might need to be changed? Gen. 18:18, Isa. 56:7, Mark
       11:17, Luke 6:27, Acts 10:28, 17:26, 2 Cor. 5:19, Col. 3:11, 1 John
       2:2, Rev. 14:6.

     The World’s Greatest Question
        “Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea
     Philippi. On the way he asked them, ‘Who do people say I am?’
        “They replied, ‘Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and
     still others, one of the prophets.’
        “ ‘But what about you?’he asked. ‘Who do you say I am?’ ”
        “Peter answered, ‘You are the Christ.’
        “Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him” (Mark 8:27-30,
     NIV).

Why is Jesus’question, “Who do you say I am?” (Mark 8:29) the most
     important question in the world? What’s wrong with the logic of
     those who give the following answers to this question? (1) Jesus
     was just a good man; (2) Jesus was just a wonderful teacher; (3)
     Jesus was just the greatest Person who ever lived. See Matt. 18:20,
     26:64; also John 8:58; 10:30; 11:25, 26; 14:6.


        Notice how C. S. Lewis deals with all such answers:
        “I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing
     that people often say about Him: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great
     moral teacher, but I don’t accept His claim to be God.’That is the one
     thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort
     of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would
     either be a lunatic—on a level with the man who says he is a poached
     egg—or else he would be the devil of hell. You must make your
     choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman
     or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at
     Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him
     Lord and God. But let us not come with any patroni[z]ing nonsense
     about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to
     us.”—C. S. Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York: Simon & Shuster,
     Inc., 1996), p. 56.
        In verse 29 the “you” is emphatic in the original text. Jesus asked
     the question in such a way that the disciples were forced to give a per-
     sonal answer. The question comes to every person today with just the
     same force, challenging us all to search our hearts and give an honest
     response. Every one’s eternal destiny hangs on the answer he or she
     gives; for if, like Peter, they acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah,
     their lives cannot stay the same.

      Many people speak highly of Jesus. They take offense at those
      who assert that Jesus is the only way of salvation. How shall we
      help such people to confront the searching question: “Who do
      you say I am?”

                                                                          49

     The Cross, Jesus’ and Ours (Mark 8:31–9:1).
For us, long centuries after the Cross, the idea of Christ, the
     Messiah, suffering and dying is fundamental to our faith. Yet,
     imagine yourself in the role of Peter and the disciples, who have a
     whole other conception of what they believe the Messiah would
     do. How did Peter and the disciples react to the idea that Jesus
     must suffer? (Mark 8:31-33). Why do you think they reacted as
     they did? Might there have been some personal, even selfish rea-
     sons, for their reaction?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “The very vehemence of their opposition is meant to suggest that it
     is more than a matter of the intellect, more than a simple failure to
     understand what Jesus meant; the disciples did not want Jesus to suf-
     fer. And that was because it goes against the grain to be the followers
     of a Messiah who suffers instead of producing spectacular victories
     by an effortless exercise of power; it brings no kudos, and offends the
     pride of the natural man. And judged by ordinary standards, there
     seems no point in the suffering and death of the Messiah. What is
     more, if it is the will of God that the Messiah should suffer, it might
     well be his will that the Messiah’s disciples should suffer a similar
     fate; from that again the natural man shrinks. So by their reaction to
     Jesus’prophecy the disciples reveal even more clearly than before the
     truth about themselves, that their minds and wills are governed by the
     standards of this world, of the unredeemed, natural man—‘ “they
     think as men think” ’ (v. 33).”—D. E. Nineham, The Gospel of St.
     Mark (England: Penguin Books, Ltd., 1963), p. 226.

What does it mean to “take up the cross” and follow Jesus? What
     does Jesus mean by our need to deny self and by losing our lives?
     Most of us find these notions rather unpleasant.Why?

      In this context, read Galatians 2:19, 20. How have you (if you
      have professed Christ) experienced what Paul is talking about
      here? If someone were to look at your life, what examples would
      they see of this principle? If none, what does that tell you about
      your walk with the Lord?

      The Tra n s fi g u ration              (Mark 9:2-13).


Read the account in Mark 9:2-13 and in Luke 9:28-36 about the
     Transfiguration.Who was involved in this incredible scene? Who
     benefited from it, and why? Why do you believe this happened
     when it did?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        How fascinating that the voice of the Father from heaven should say
     to the disciples, “This is my beloved Son: hear him” (Mark 9:7).
     Though they certainly had so many reasons to believe in Jesus and
     His authority, they had a hard time with Him talking about being
     rejected and dying, even the point where Peter rebuked Jesus for talk-
     ing that way (Mark 8:32). Thus, the Voice from heaven, whatever else
     it might have accomplished, certainly gave them more impetus to,
     indeed, “hear him.”

Read 2 Peter 1:16-21, Peter’s later account of the Transfiguration.
     What point was he making by talking about this event?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        At the same time, too, there’s no doubt this experience was a bless-
     ing to Jesus, as well, a reaffirmation of the Father’s love as Jesus, now
     in human form, would soon set His face to go to Jerusalem and cer-
     tain death. Three times the Father audibly declared the divine identity
     of Jesus Christ (Mark 1:11, 9:7, John 12:28), and each occasion
     marked a turning point in Jesus’ ministry, a time when Jesus, in His
     humanity, was to face a great trial.

      No matter who we are or at what stage we are in our walk with
      the Lord, we all face moments of discouragement, moments in
      anticipation of an upcoming trial. What does it say to us that
      even Jesus, the Lord Himself, benefited from an encouraging
      word? How have you been benefited by someone who spoke
      words of encouragement? If you know people who are going
      through a hard time, consider what you could say to help them
      in the same way that the voice of the Father helped Jesus and
      the disciples.


                                                                           51

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White’s “Barriers Broken Down,”
          “The True Sign,” “The Foreshadowing of the Cross,” and “He Was
          Transfigured,” in The Desire of Ages, pp. 399–425.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 The concept of identity is powerful. Human beings want to
           belong to something. Unfortunately, there is a natural tendency
           to deem one’s group,be it racial,national, religious (or any com-
           bination thereof) as superior to others. This, of course, can lead
           to bigotry and even subtle forms of prejudice. The earlier fol-
           lowers of Jesus weren’t immune to this problem. We, no doubt,
           aren’t either. What can we learn from Jesus that can change this
           sinful trait, which, unless checked, manifests itself in all of us?

           ●2 Go back and read from Tuesday’s lesson the quote that C. S.
           Lewis wrote about the identity of Jesus. How, in a parallel man-
           ner, could that logic be used in defense of the prophetic ministry
           of Ellen G. White? What claims did she make about herself?
           What are some of the incredible things she claimed to have seen
           in vision? Why, then (again using the same kind of logic that
           Lewis used), would it be “patronizing nonsense” to simply assert
           things about her like, “Well, she was just a good woman but had
           no prophetic gift”? Does she not leave us the choice of either
           accepting her as someone who manifested the gift of prophecy or
           as a lunatic, a fool, or even worse?
3
    Summary: It is easier to believe in a Messiah who will lead a victo-
          rious army and bring freedom and full stomachs than one whose path
          leads to Calvary. Jesus was not the Messiah of popular expectation.
          His badge was a cross, not a crown. And He was God’s Messiah for
          everybody, not just for the Jews. The disciples had much to learn and
4
          a great deal to unlearn. We see Jesus patiently attempting to set their
          thinking straight, as the shadow of the Cross begins to loom.

“Take Me With You!”
Bartolomé Funez Castellón
   I grew up in a devout family, and as a child I dreamed of becoming a
priest. But because my parents were not married, the church refused to let
me study for the priesthood. Disappointed, I joined the army.
   Through the difficulties associated with military service, I never forgot
God. I carried my Bible with me and read it whenever I had a chance.
   In 1996 I was transferred to the capital city, and there I worked in a mili-
tary office. One day a young secretary in our battalion asked permission
to leave work early so she could attend church. I told her she could go if
she would invite me to go with her. She was surprised, but she quickly
agreed, and we went to church together.
   I noticed the differences between this young woman’s church—the
Adventist church—and the church I had grown up in. I liked the sense of
order and reverence I saw there, and I especially liked the way the people
studied the Bible together. The priest did not tell them what to believe; they
read the Bible and discovered for themselves, as I had been trying to do.
   Two Adventist brothers in my battalion invited me to talk to their youth
group about the rights and obligations of Honduran citizens. After I
accepted the invitation, I began to get really nervous. What had I gotten
myself into? When I arrived at the church, I found not only young people,
but adults were there, too—and the pastor! I was shaking, but somehow I
finished my talk.
   The people thanked me, and some asked me to come back and speak
again. I was impressed with how polite these people were.
   I joined a small group that the Adventist secretary attended. I was more
comfortable there than at the large church. I was learning so much so fast,
and I enjoyed it all very much. I met this girl’s father, and he gave me some
                             Bible study guides that I read and filled out.
                             Before long I was attending the regular church
                             services. I joined the seekers’ Bible study
                             class, and in time I was baptized.
                                I am still in the military, and now I share my
                             faith with other soldiers. Now when I am
                             asked to preach in church, I no longer shake
                             when I stand up front. I thank God for leading
                             this sheep into His fold.

      Teaching the Disciples




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      A MOTLEY BUNCH. A Christian magazine once suggested how a
      consultant team might have evaluated the disciples of Christ: “Simon
      Peter is emotionally unstable and given to fits of temper. Andrew has
      absolutely no leadership qualities. The sons of Zebedee, James and
      John, place personal interests above company loyalty. Thomas
      demonstrates a questioning attitude that would tend to undermine
      morale.
         “We feel that it is our duty to tell You that Matthew has been black-
      listed by the Greater Jerusalem Better Business Bureau. James, the
      son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus definitely have radical leanings, and
      they both registered a high score on the manic-depressive scale.
         “One of the candidates, however, shows great potential. He is a man
      of ability and resourcefulness. . . . We recommend Judas Iscariot as
      Your controller and right-hand man.”—The Baptist Messenger, Sept.
      27, 1984.

The Week at a Glance: What can cause us to be spiritual
      failures? In what ways did the disciples show their spiritual fail-
      ing? What did Jesus say about divorce? Why did Jesus treat chil-
      dren as He did? What crucial point did Jesus make about the
      potential dangers of wealth?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 9:14–10:31.

Memory Text: “ ‘If anyone wants to be first,he must be the very
      last, and the servant of all’ ” (Mark 9:35, NIV).

      A Public Failure (Mark 9:14-32).
        Peter would have liked to have remained on the mountain with
     Jesus, Elijah, and Moses (Mark 9:5). He suggested that he build three
     shelters for the Master, Moses, and Elijah. How nice if Jesus could
     stay a while in that place of glorious light. But Jesus’mission called
     Him to leave the peace, encouragement, and heavenly communion of
     the mountain top and return to the valley. To the people, difficult,
     smelly, slow to learn, but needy—that is where His work lay.
        From the glory of heaven to the pain of a fallen world. From the
     heights to the depths of human depravity. From the fellowship of
     Moses and Elijah to a despairing man with a demon-possessed boy
     who cannot speak and rolls foaming on the ground. From heavenly
     light to the disciples who have failed miserably.

Read Mark 9:14-32. Previously they had gone out without Jesus and
     had been able to cast out demons (see Mark 6:12, 13), but now they
     failed. What do we find in the texts that reveal why they failed?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The disciples had often witnessed Jesus casting out demons and
     healing the sick. They themselves had been able to do the same mira-
     cles when Jesus sent them out two by two. But familiarity had bred
     carelessness. That which was marvelous and accomplished only by
     divine power had begun to seem commonplace.
        “Their unbelief, that shut them out from deeper sympathy with
     Christ, and the carelessness with which they regarded the sacred work
     committed to them, had caused their failure in the conflict with the
     powers of darkness. . . . In order to succeed in such a conflict they
     must come to the work in a different spirit. Their faith must be
     strengthened by fer vent prayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart.
     They must be emptied of self, and be filled with the Spirit and power
     of God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God in faith—faith that
     leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved consecration to
     His work—can alone avail to bring men the Holy Spirit’s aid in the
     battle against principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of
     the world, and wicked spirits in high places.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, pp. 430, 431.

      your spiritual life, and what principles did you learn from today’s

      True Greatness (Mark 9:33-50).
        Mark 9:32 is incredibly instructive, for it gives great insight into the
      minds of the disciples at this point. Here’s their Master, giving them
      words of truth, and yet, because it’s not what they want to hear, they
      make no attempt to learn more. They, in a real sense, are hiding from
      the truth when the truth isn’t exactly what they want to hear. How do
      we, in our own way, do the same thing?

How were the spiritual consequences, the fruits, of such an attitude
      readily seen in the next few verses? How did their words reveal
      just how far they were from the true principles of Christ’s king-
      dom?

      ____________________________________________________________________

Read the whole section for today, focusing in particular on verses 33-
      37 and 42-50.Though Jesus is not talking about the same subject
      in each section,there’s an underlying spiritual theme in His words
      here that are crucial for anyone who claims to be a Christian. It’s
      a theme that goes to the heart of the spiritual problem that was
      revealed by the disciples’quest to be the “greatest.” What is it,and
      why is it so important? What other verses can you find in the
      Bible that express the same idea?

        There’s a branch of philosophy called “ethical egoism,” which
      teaches that each person ought to look after his or her own interests
      and disregard the interests of others, except where the interest of oth-
      ers contributes toward his or her own interests. In other words, people
      ought to look out only for themselves. That’s an attitude which, really,
      doesn’t need to be taught, because it’s already wired in our genes.

       If there were no God, no final judgment and final reckoning,
       what grounds would you have to defend “ethical egoism”? Why,
       though, for the Christian is such a position unacceptable?

      Reformation in Divorce (Mark 10:1-12).
Read Mark 10:1-12.What point is Jesus making here about divorce?
     What message does He have for us today on this painful topic? See
     also Matt. 19:1-10.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Probably no issue causes more debate among Seventh-day
     Adventists today than divorce and remarriage. The same was true of
     Jesus’ time. The Jews had only the Old Testament, but one passage in
     it was fiercely debated. This was Deuteronomy 24:1, 2: “When a man
     hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no
     favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her:
     then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and
     send her out of his house. And when she is departed out of his house,
     she may go and be another man’s wife.” The two schools of rabbis of
     Jesus’ time, the followers of Hillel and the followers of Shammai,
     argued over the meaning of “some uncleanness,” some believing that
     it could mean something as trivial as burning a meal, while others took
     a much more strict approach. Jesus, though, makes it clear that there
     should be no divorce except in the case of marital infidelity.

Notice how Jesus,in the discussion, moves away from Deuteronomy
     and goes back to the early chapters of Genesis as His scriptural
     authority. What point was He making from those texts? (Also,
     what does that tell us about how He viewed, not only the histori-
     cal accuracy of Genesis but also its authority?)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Mark tells us that the disciples asked Jesus for further explanation
     of His answer to the Pharisees (Mark 10:10). Indeed, Jesus’ view of
     marriage, adultery, and divorce ran counter to many of the ideas cur-
     rent in Jewish society, which placed husbands and wives on different
     footings. Christ’s words, however, showed that men as well as women
     can both be guilty of adultery.

        How do we as individuals, and as a church, strike a balance
      between demanding that members adhere to the Bible standard
      about marriage and divorce and yet show mercy toward those
      who fall short?

                                                                            59

       The Children (Mark 10:13-16).
Mark tells us that Jesus was “much displeased” at the disciples’ atti-
      tude toward the little children.The original Greek word is strong,
      suggesting indignation. Considering previous examples of their
      attitude toward each other (Mark 9:33, 34) and toward Gentiles
      (Matt. 15:23), why do you think the disciples reacted as they did
      toward the children?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Our attitude toward children reveals much about us. To communi-
      cate with children requires that we go outside the world of our own
      self; we have to listen and seek to understand a wholly different ref-
      erence point. Thus, people who are wrapped up in themselves cannot
      get close to children. Likewise, people who are always looking to gain
      some benefit or advantage for themselves from any encounter will
      have little time for children. The fact that Jesus was so open to chil-
      dren and they to Him speaks volumes about the Master as One whose
      life flowed out to others, regardless of status. Likewise, the disciples’
      attitude to the children who were being brought to Jesus shows how
      much they need to grow in self-forgetfulness and blessing to others.

Jesus told the disciples, “ ‘I tell you the truth, anyone who will not
      receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it’ ”
      (Mark 10:15, NIV). What did He mean? In what ways were His
      words reflecting a principle that the disciples, by their attitude
      toward the children, really needed to understand? Compare what
      you write with what others in the class have to say. See also Matt.
      6:9, Luke 11:13, Eph. 5:8, 1 Pet. 1:14, 1 John 5:21.


         There’s an innocence to children, an openness, a trusting and humil-
      ity in them that followers of our heavenly Father need to have in their
      own lives. Children, in their innocence, are much less likely than
      adults to judge or to manifest prejudice toward others. Children are
      helpless, totally depending upon the mercy and love of those who can
      do for them what they cannot do for themselves. No wonder Jesus told
      us that we need to be like them.

       Write out a prayer asking God to give you a more childlike
       faith. What things are you asking for? What practical things
       can you do, even now, to help get them?

      Attitudes Toward Riches (Mark 10:17-31).
        In the final area of teaching for the disciples that we study this
      week, we see Jesus trying to correct their wrong views about wealth.
      The disciples at first were “astonished” at Jesus’words and then were
      “greatly astonished” (vss. 24, 26, NKJV). They had accepted the pre-
      vailing understanding—one fostered by the scribes and Pharisees—
      that material prosperity and health were evidence of God’s blessing,
      while poverty and sickness indicated God’s displeasure. The same
      thinking led them, on seeing a man blind from birth, to ask Jesus:
      “ ‘Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?’ ”
      (John 9:1, 2, NIV).

Study the story of the rich young ruler in Mark 10:17-22 (see also
      Matt. 19:16-22 and Luke 18:18-23). Summarize what you think the
      basic spiritual message there is for us today.


        Consider the following characteristics of the young man who had
      so much but lacked the most important quality of all: He was young.
      He was energetic (came running to Jesus). He was respectful (knelt
      before Jesus). He already was in a position of authority. He had great
      wealth. He was concerned about spiritual things. What a great candi-
      date for the kingdom of God!

Is Jesus’ test to the rich young ruler to be applied to everyone who
      would be Jesus’disciple? That is, should everyone be expected to
      sell all their possessions and give to the poor? If not, why not?
      (Hint:Compare Jesus’instructions to other rich people who came
      to Him, such as Zacchaeus [Luke 19:1-9] and Nicodemus [John
      3:1-21].)

        In many ways, the key verse for understanding this chapter, and the
      answer to the above question, is Mark 10:24. The issue isn’t wealth
      but how the one who has wealth relates to it. Jesus, knowing the rich
      young ruler’s heart, knew what his weakness was. Indeed, the fact that
      the rich young ruler turned away from Jesus proved that his wealth
      was an idol. More than likely, if wealth were the man’s problem, Jesus
      wouldn’t have said to him what He did.

       Read again verse 24. What’s wrong with trusting in riches?
       What other word could you replace “riches” with that would
       express the same principle? What point is Jesus teaching us? In
       your own life, what other word might you, if honest with your-
       self, place in there?


                                                                         61

     Greatest?” “Blessing the Children,” and “One Thing Thou Lackest,”
     in The Desire of Ages, pp. 426–442, 511–523.

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 As a class, discuss some of the issues that cause even believers
      to doubt God, to question their faith, to be afraid to trust in the
      Lord. What causes these feelings? Are they ever justified? How
      can you help people overcome their doubts,their fears,their lack
      of faith?

      ●
      2 As a class, pick out a few names of people whom the world
      deems as “great”; that is, they are famous for some “good” rea-
      son or another. What were the qualities that made them “great”
      in the eyes of the world? At the same time, think of someone
      whom God Himself might deem as “great.” What qualities made
      that person “great” in the eyes of God? How differently would
      you define the word great in both cases? What lesson can we
      learn from this comparison?

      ●3 The week’s lesson talked about our attitude toward children.
      What other kinds of people do we interact with who really, in the
      end,can do nothing for us in terms of material or social or politi-
      cal advantage? How do we treat them in contrast to someone who
      can indeed do a lot for us? What does Christ’s example say to us
      about this topic? What can we do to help us treat people the way
      Jesus treated them? What about us needs to change to enable us
      to do just that?

Summary: This week we saw Jesus deal with the wrong attitude and
     behavior of His own followers. And though they often failed, lovingly
     and patiently Jesus tried to correct their wrong thinking and behaviors.

The Prodigal’s Second Chance
Randriamalala Narison Olivier
  I grew up in a Christian home in Madagascar, but I chose a different
path in life. Eventually I became a drug addict and a thief. One day I bor-
rowed a friend’s bicycle to run an errand. I did not return the bicycle but
instead sold it to buy drugs. When my parents learned what I’d done, they
told me to leave their home. I lived on the streets of my city until I was
arrested for the theft.
  Prison was miserable, but there I realized my need of God. I began to
pray. I learned that an Adventist chaplain held services in the prison, and
I decided to go. At the first meeting some prisoners sang a song titled,
“Change Me, Jesus.” The song touched my heart and became my prayer.
  We were given only one meal a day of boiled casava. I was often hun-
gry. But after I began attending the worship services, the Bible became my
food. I knew that if I turned away from God this time, it might be my last
chance. I gave my life to Christ and enrolled in the prison’s Bible study.
  I had been in prison only a month when my friend whose bicycle I had
stolen asked the judge to free me. Upon release, I found an Adventist
church. I attended church faithfully. When I learned that my body is the
temple of the Holy Spirit, I begged God to free me from my addictions to
alcohol and tobacco. I asked the pastor and church members to pray for
me, and after several weeks, I lost my appetite for these drugs. I continued
Bible studies with the pastor and was baptized.
   My parents invited me to return home, and I have. They can see the
changes in me. I want to be an honorable son, to let my parents see the dif-
ference God is making in my life and ask questions about my faith. I want
them to ask questions about what I believe rather than to preach at them.
  I work with my father, who has given me Sabbaths off to worship. My
younger brother goes to church with me and wants to study at the
Adventist college. My father has agreed to send him there.
  “I have returned to my father’s house a changed son,” Olivier says. “I am
determined to remain faithful to my heavenly Father and honor my par-
ents. I am praying for my parents and younger brothers, that they will not
follow my naughty ways but will follow God.”

      The Final Journey




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
      TO JERUSALEM. Through the past several chapters of Mark, Jesus
      has been on a long, meandering journey. Now Mark tells us the goal
      of this trip south from Galilee: “They were on their way up to
      Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were aston-
      ished, while those who followed were afraid” (Mark 10:32, NIV).
        It is a dramatic scene: Jesus going on ahead, the disciples a step
      behind, wondering what is about to happen, and others in back of them
      feeling apprehensive. The last, climactic events are about to begin.
        We have now come to the last seven days or so of Jesus’earthly life.
      As do the other Gospel writers, Mark devotes disproportionate space
      to this short period, 6 of the 16 chapters that comprise his book. For
      Matthew, the numbers are 7 chapters out of 28; for Luke, 6 chapters
      out of 24; and for John, 10 chapters out of 21. The implications are
      clear: As important as the life and teachings of Jesus were, His death
      and resurrection were even more important.

The Week at a Glance: Why do we sometimes pray for
      the wrong things? What does it mean to live in light as opposed to
      darkness? Why did Jesus cleanse the temple a second time? Why
      did Christ curse the fig tree?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 10:32–11:25.

Memory Text: “For the Son of man also came not to be served
      but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mark
      10:45, RSV).

     Foolish Request (Mark 10:32-45).
After reading the entire selection for today, focus on verse 35.
     Considering all the miracles that they had seen Jesus already do,
     why was their request so “reasonable”? How do we, in our own
     way, make “reasonable” requests from God (read also Matthew
     17:20, Luke 1:37) that are not answered as we think they should
     be?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       As humans, we view the world from a very narrow perspective: our
     own. And no matter what light and truth we are given, no matter what
     we learn, we still filter it all through ourselves, through the very nar-
     row and confined view of the world that we, as fallen beings, have.
     Thus, oftentimes we request things that we believe would be good for
     us and yet, in the grand scope of things, aren’t—though we are utterly
     convinced they are and God should give them to us immediately.

How did the request of James and John reveal their ignorance for
     what they were asking?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

How does Christ’s response in Mark 10:42-45 expose their ignorance?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Even the disciples, after all this time with Jesus, revealed their
     blindness to the most important spiritual things. Christ’s words in
     verses 42-45 represent a radically different view of what leadership,
     power, and success mean. It’s a great example of how perverted our
     own views of the world are. No wonder, then, that like the disciples,
     we can pray for things that we think are good and needed when in the
     end we, as James and John, don’t know what we are asking for.

      Are you still waiting for prayers that have yet to be answered?
      What are they, and how can you, by faith, believe that there’s a
      good reason (which you still can’t understand) why they aren’t
      answered as you wish?

                                                                           65

     Blind Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52).
       Jesus was on His way up to Jerusalem, and Jericho was the last city
     or village He would pass through on His way there. His mind must
     have been filled with the events that the next few days would bring.
     He had come to the final week of His life, to the climax of His work
     that would decide the destiny of the world forever and the outcome of
     the long controversy with evil. But with so much to occupy His
     thoughts, He nevertheless took the time to help a blind beggar.

Study the encounter between Jesus and blind Bartimaeus (Mark
     10:46-52). Notice what happened after Jesus healed him. How, in
     one sense, is this incident symbolic of what should be the experi-
     ence of everyone who has experienced the saving power of Christ
     in their lives?


       Numerous times, the Bible talks about those who don’t know the
     Lord as walking in darkness (John 8:12, Acts 26:18, Eph. 5:8, Col.
     1:13, 1 Thess. 5:5, 1 Pet. 2:9, 1 John 1:6, 2:11). The main thing about
     darkness, of course, is that there is no light. Those who move in dark-
     ness stumble, grope, fall, and even if they move ahead, they don’t
     know which direction they are going in.
       All this, though, changes when we come to Jesus, who is light.
     “This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
     unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say
     that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and
     do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we
     have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
     Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:5-7).
       These images, that of darkness and light, are metaphors, symbols
     depicting something else other than themselves. Darkness means
     spiritual ignorance, it means sin, hatred, prejudice, jealousy, greed,
     covetousness. Those who walk in darkness live without the saving
     knowledge of God, without understanding the reality of who God is
     and the love that He has for us. And just as light is the opposite of
     darkness in a literal sense, it’s also the opposite in a spiritual sense, as
     well.

      Before being saved by Christ, you lived in darkness (whether
      you knew it or not). After coming to Christ, you came to the
      light.Write down just what new things you “saw” after coming
      to the light.How did they change your life? Where would you be
      now if you had remained in the darkness?

     The Triumphal Entry (Mark 11:1-11).
       The triumphal entry occurred on Sunday, one week before the
     Resurrection. Christians of various persuasions celebrate the day in
     various ways. For some, it is “Palm Sunday” and is marked by appro-
     priate hymns, Scripture readings, and sermons. Seventh-day
     Adventists do not follow a liturgical year; that is, a worship calendar
     that designates each Sabbath through the year in terms of Scripture
     passages and sermons. However, we are keenly interested in the life
     of Jesus, and especially its closing scenes. Therefore, the events of the
     last Sunday of Jesus’life provide material for deep contemplation.

How did Jesus go out of His way to draw attention to His entry into
     Jerusalem? (Mark 11:1-11).


What was the significance of His riding on a colt and coming from
     the Mount of Olives? (see Zech. 9:9).


       Jesus could have come up to Jerusalem quietly, as He had before.
     But He chose to draw attention to Himself. He sent His disciples to
     obtain a colt, and He entered the city from the Mount of Olives. These
     acts were not lost on the crowd, who already were waiting for Him to
     act as the longed-for Messiah. Although Jesus would not act the part
     of political leader and deliverer that they hoped for, He was the
     Messiah. So, He deliberately entered the beloved city in the manner
     that the prophet Zechariah had foretold. And the crowd went wild!
       “Hosanna. Gr. hosanna, a transliteration of the Aramaic hoshar’na,
     meaning ‘save, now’ or ‘save, I pray thee.’ . . . Here the expression
     may be considered a prayer to God that salvation may come to Israel
     through Messiah King.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 471.
       What a start to the Passover week! But the same crowds who
     shouted “Hosanna!” and spread their garments in the way on Sunday
     by Friday were shouting: “Away with Him! Crucify Him!”

      We all have spiritual highs and lows, times when we feel very
      enthusiastic about God and our faith and times when we are dis-
      couraged, filled with doubt, and barely hanging on. Like the
      crowd, we’re one minute praising God and the next turning away

      A Den of Thieves (Mark 11:12-19).
In the selection for today, read carefully verse 17, the Old Testament
      verse that Jesus quoted. What was the temple supposed to be?
      What had it become? What crucial lesson is in there for us, not
      only as individuals but as a church?

        Just as Jesus had deliberately drawn attention to Himself by the
      manner of His entry into Jerusalem, so His first act in the city was
      certain to arouse the anger of the religious establishment. He publicly
      challenged the practices of those responsible for the conduct of wor-
      ship, setting His authority over against theirs. This act of cleansing the
      temple put on display His role as Messiah, One whose authority sur-
      passed all others.
        In Jesus’ time the priesthood and the temple were in the hands of
      the Sadducees. By controlling the temple services, the Sadducees
      gained great wealth. The pilgrims who came up to Jerusalem three
      times each year could not bring their sacrifices with them. Instead,
      they had to buy them in Jerusalem. The priests controlled this sale of
      animals. Furthermore, the animals could be bought only with using
      the currency of the temple, so the pilgrims had first to change their
      money into the temple coinage and then purchase their animals for
      sacrifice. On both transactions—the money changing and sale of ani-
      mals—the temple authorities benefited handsomely.
        In these ways the temple worship had become corrupted. What
      should have been a house of prayer for all nations had deteriorated
      into a money-making scheme that exploited the common people and
      made the religious leaders rich. No wonder Jesus burned with right-
      eous anger. Words were not enough: He drove out the animals and
      overturned the tables of the money changers. But by so doing, He
      sealed His doom. There could be no way now for the religious leaders
      to tolerate Him any longer. He had touched their wallets, and they
      would not rest until He was out of the way.

       In what ways can we, either as individuals or as a church, turn
       away from our mission and instead focus only on improving our
       own lot, yet doing it all under the cover and veneer of truth?

      Jesus Curses the Fig Tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-
     26 (see also Matt. 21:18-22, Luke 13:6-9).

Read the various accounts of this same story. The Life-Giver curses
     a tree, and then it withers and dies? Why does this seem so out of
     character for Jesus? What message, what warning, is in there by
     this action?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus is hungry, sees the fig tree in the distance with leaves, is dis-
     appointed when He doesn’t find any figs on it, and pronounces a
     curse upon it. The fig tree subsequently withers and dies. The writers
     weren’t embarrassed by what Jesus did, nor did they try to conceal
     this apparently strange act. Instead, the Holy Spirit led them to
     include the account because it had vital teaching for the followers of
     Jesus to the end of time.
       Every word and every deed of Jesus during the last week is
     freighted with significance. We have already studied His dramatic
     manner of entry on Sunday and the very public act of clearing the
     temple. This act was done, not for the general public but for the
     instruction of His disciples. It was probably early Monday morning
     when Jesus cursed the fig tree. But something had taken place the
     previous evening of great significance. Mark does not mention it, but
     Luke records that Jesus looked on the beloved city and wept over it,
     foretelling how Jerusalem would be surrounded by foreign armies
     and broken down (Luke 19:41-44). Then, the next morning, Jesus
     curses the fig tree. The connection should be obvious.

Notice what Jesus says to Peter (Mark 11:22-26) after he asks the
     Lord about the withered tree (vs. 21). How do these words fit in
     with what Peter said about the tree?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      “Have faith in God,” Jesus says to them. That is, trust in the
      Lord,pray to Him, rest in His goodness,and forgive others their
      sins. Jesus points His followers away from earthly, fallen things
      to the great principles of truth.What earthly things and earthly
      principles are you clinging to that, in the end, will shrivel and
      die like the cursed fig tree? What does Jesus say here that can
      help you change?

                                                                            69

Discussion Questions:
      ●
      1 What evidence from this week’s lesson shows that Jesus’ suf-
      ferings and death were not just an accident of history?

      ●
      2 How did Jesus directly challenge the religious establishment
      of His day? Think of other times when He did so,as well.Why do
      you think He did this? Are there ever times when we, too,should
      challenge the establishment? If so, when and under what cir-
      cumstances, and how can we do it in the same spirit that Jesus
      did?

      ●3 As a class,discuss Christ’s words in Mark 11:23-26. Contrast
      them with what we studied in Sunday’s lesson about prayers that
      God doesn’t answer as we wish. How can you reconcile the two
      ideas presented in these sections?

      ●
      4 For those who are willing, talk about prayers asked in faith
      that have not been answered as hoped for or expected. How have
      they dealt with this test of faith? What can others in the class
      share that could help someone struggling with unanswered
      prayers?


Summary: Our study this week has the ring of high drama. For years
     Jesus has anticipated this time and prepared for it. With determination
     He leads the way up to Jerusalem, enters the city in the royal manner
     foretold by prophecy, and exercises the authority of the Messiah. For
     the disciples the few days of the week are filled with eager anticipa-
     tion; for the nation, they are the last, fading opportunities to embrace
     their King.

Facing the Devil’s Wrath
Asav Kumar Valluru
  Asav teaches at an Adventist school in India. He was a Christian, but
he found Adventists strange. They did not smoke or drink or attend festi-
vals. In time, however, he realized that Adventists teach the truth, and he
asked the school staff to hold meetings in his village not far from the
school.
  He invited his neighbors to come and offered a plot of land for the
meetings. During the meetings Asav, his wife, her parents, and 15 other
people took their stand for truth. They built a thatched-roof prayer shel-
ter on the land Asav had donated.
  Asav’s wife operates a small grocery shop in front of their home. One
night rats knocked over a kerosene lantern and started a fire that burned
Asav’s thatched-roof home and his father-in-law’s home next door. The
families escaped with their lives, but they lost everything.
  Asav borrowed 10,000 rupees (about US$225) to rebuild his home and
grocery store and to restock the store. Ten days after they moved back in,
a neighbor poured kerosene over himself and lit a match to commit sui-
cide. The ensuing fire burned 30 homes, including Asav’s home and store
and the believe r s ’p r ayer shelter. Once more Asav was homeless.
  ADRA provided clothes, dishes, and blankets, and the government
offered loans and materials to rebuild. Asav and his in-laws built cement
houses, which would not burn. He invited the believers to worship in his
home. Asav usually preaches, but teachers from the Adventist school help
too.
  Some villagers said that Asav’s troubles came because Asav had left the
Sunday church and had stolen away other members to join the Adventist
church. Asav remained silent when accused and thought to himself, God
will take care of their accusations. I will trust Him.
  Soon after the second fire, Asav was asked to teach full time and on a
permanent basis at the Adventist school. With his increased salary he has
begun to repay part of the loans he took to rebuild.
  Asav has started a Branch Sabbath School in a nearby village. He
teaches the people songs and Bible stories; he preaches to them and prays
for them. The response has been good, and today 20 people worship in
that village on Sabbaths. “God has been good to me,” Asav says, smiling.

Asav Kumar Valluru teaches Telugu at the Adventist school in Ibraihimpatnam, eastern
India.

      Last Days in the                          Temple


      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
      CONTROVERSY. Probably all the events of this week’s lesson
      occurred on the final Tuesday of Jesus’earthly life. These were hours
      of fierce controversy as the religious leaders attempted one time after
      another to embarrass Jesus publicly or to get Him to say something
      they could use against Him with the Roman authorities. Here we see
      various groups (Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians)—normally at odds
      with one another—united in opposition to Jesus.
        In the midst of enemies and controversies, Jesus stands alone. No
      one comes to His defense, but He does not need anyone, for He
      answers every trick question with insight and authority that stumps
      and confounds His accusers. Meanwhile, He takes the initiative
      against them with probing parables and questions that expose their
      hypocrisy.
        At the end of the long, trying day, Jesus casts a last look around Him
      and leaves the temple. He will never return to that earthly structure.

The Week at a Glance: How did Christ respond to those
      who questioned His authority? What was Jesus’ message in the
      parable of the wicked husbandmen? How did Jesus respond to flat-
      tery? For Jesus, what was the essence of all true religion and faith?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 11:27–12:44.

Memory Text: “ ‘ “And you shall love the Lord your God with
      all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all
      your strength.” This is the first commandment’ ” (Mark 12:30,
      NKJV).

      “We Cannot Tell”
By cleansing the temple Jesus had clearly set forth Himself as One
      whose authority was greater than the temple and the chief priests
      and teachers of the law who served at the temple. It’s not surpris-
      ing, then, that their first challenge to Jesus on this final day in the
      temple centered around authority. Study Jesus’ encounter with His
      critics (Mark 11:27-33; see also Matt. 21:23-27 and Luke 20:1-8).
      Why didn’t the critics answer Jesus’ question? Why couldn’t they?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus never resorted to verbal trickery. His speech was always open,
      direct, and pure. In turning the religious leaders’ question back on
      themselves, He was trying to break through the mental barriers they
      had erected against Him. The answer to His question was the same as
      the answer to their question. Both Jesus and John the Baptist spoke
      and worked out of a divine commission; no human agency had given
      them their task and authorized them. If only the critics could see their
      own blindness toward John, perhaps their eyes would be open to Him.
      Jesus, amid such hostility, was, nevertheless, ministering to those who
      were opposed to Him!
         Also, notice their answer to Jesus, “We cannot tell.” That is, we
      cannot tell it out loud, for to do so would ultimately expose ourselves
      to the crowd. Jesus not only confounded them, He gave them another
      opportunity to repent, an opportunity that they apparently didn’t take
      advantage of.

Why else could they not answer Jesus’ question? See Mark 1:7, 8; John
      1:29.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        What a place Jesus put them in. If they acknowledged that John was
      from God, then what were they going to do with John’s testimony
      about Jesus? If they acknowledged John’s divine credentials, how
      could they then explain their hostility to Christ?

       We mustn’t be too quick to judge these critics, though, lest we
       judge ourselves, as well (Rom. 2:1). In what ways, often much
       more subtle than what appears here, do we try to squirm our
       way around God’s authority in our lives?

                                                                           73
               M O N DAY May 23

     The Parable of the Tenants (Mark 12:1-12).
       This is one of the most powerful parables Jesus ever told. Its appli-
     cation was so direct and its message so terrifying that it must have had
     a profound effect on all who heard it. Here Jesus clearly foretells His
     own death and the rejection of the unfaithful in Israel.

What passage from the Old Testament, no doubt familiar to His
     hearers, did Jesus draw upon in presenting the parable of the
     wicked tenants? See Isa. 5:1-7.


       Many of the parables of Jesus teach a single point, and the details
     do not apply. In this parable, however, we see a clear application for
     each of the characters and objects.

Keeping in mind Isaiah 5:1-7, write down what each of the follow-
     ing in Mark 12:1-11 represents:

       The vineyard:

       The householder, owner of the vineyard:

       The tenants (“husbandmen” in the King James Version):

       The servants sent to collect the fruit:

       The owner’s son:

       The wall or hedge (Hint:What did God give Israel to set it apart
     from other people?):

       The tower (Hint: What was the most prominent structure in
     Israel?):

What effect did Jesus’ parable have on the religious leaders? Why
     didn’t they immediately arrest Jesus? Mark 12:12.


        These were strong words indeed from the Master. But time was run-
     ning out—for Him and for Israel. He hoped that this parable with its
     stern warning might yet cause some hearers to change their course.

      Suppose someone came to the Seventh-day Adventist Church
      and gave the same message to us as Jesus gave to Israel. How
      would you respond, and why?

      Smooth Wo rd s (Mark 12:13-17).
        The next plot against Jesus brought together two groups that nor-
      mally did not associate with each other. The Pharisees were strict
      observers of the laws of Judaism—not just what the Lord had given
      through Moses but the multitude of regulations that had been added
      by the scribes over the centuries. The Herodians, however, were a
      political party rather than a religious sect. They supported the royal
      family, which ruled as puppets of Rome.

What trick did these men try to use on Jesus before asking their ques-
      tion? Who tried the same thing on Him once before? See John 3:1, 2.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
      shalt be condemned,” Jesus had said (Matt. 12:37). In this case, these
      men by their words condemned themselves, because they acknowl-
      edged that He was “true” and that He taught the “way of God.” No
      doubt, unless at some point they repented, these men will meet their
      words again in the final judgment.

Look up the following texts.What are they all talking about? Why do
      you think the Bible speaks on this topic as it does? Pss. 5:9; 12:2,
      3; Prov. 20:19; 26:28; 28:23; 29:5.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The Hebrew word for “flattery” comes from a root word that can
      mean “smoothness” or “slippery.” How apt a description of this mis-
      use of language! Indeed, flattering words can be used to slip past a
      person’s defenses and catch them at their weakest point: their ego and
      sense of self-worth. Though flattery might work with others, those
      who tried it on Christ get nowhere with this shameful tactic.

       Though we all need to be on guard against using flattery to
       manipulate others, we also need to guard against being duped
       by it.What was it about Jesus that enabled Him not to fall for
       this trick? How can we, who no doubt like receiving praise, have
       the same protection ourselves?

                                                                         75
         W E D N E S DAY May 25

     A Trick Question (Mark 12:18-27).
        The Sadducees were a religio-political party made up of wealthy,
     liberal, secular-minded people. They accepted only the five books of
     Moses, Genesis to Deuteronomy, as inspired, and did not believe in
     the resurrection of the dead. Now they came to Jesus with a trick
     question that they felt sure would embarrass Him. No doubt it was a
     stock scenario that they had used in arguing with the Pharisees and
     others against the doctrine of the resurrection (yet, if you really look
     at their argument, it was kind of ridiculous: a woman who marries
     seven brothers, one right after the death of the other?). If Jesus dis-
     agreed with them, the Sadducees thought they could hold Him up to
     ridicule; but if He agreed, that would further offend the Pharisees.

Notice Christ’s first words to them. He hit them right where it
     hurt. Why were His words such a rebuke to, of all people, reli-
     gious leaders?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Because the Sadducees accepted only the books of Moses, Jesus did
     not quote from other parts of the Old Testament that point to the res-
     urrection, such as Isaiah and Daniel. So far as we know, His reference
     of Exodus 3:6 is the first time this famous passage was so used. The
     Sadducees, who considered themselves experts in the first f ive books
     of the Bible, suddenly found themselves on the defensive.

Read carefully the verse that Christ quoted.How can we understand
     this in the context of the power of God and the resurrection of the
     dead? See also John 11:26; 1 John 5:11, 12. How does Mark 12:27
     help answer this question?


        In Jesus’ own teachings to the people, He made the same point of
     this argument: Those who believe in Him, such as did Abraham, Isaac,
     and Jacob, have already crossed over from death to life and will surely
     come forth from the grave at His call (John 5:24, 25). Even though
     our body turns to dust, we are bound up in the life of God, and we will
     live again. No wonder, then, for us death is only a sleep, a quiet rest
     for those whom, though in the grave, God considers as “living.”

      If someone were to ask you, “Do you know the power of God?”
      what would you reply, and why?

The Greatest Commandment (Mark 12:28-
34).

   Read carefully and prayerfully Mark 12:28-34. After reading that,
read the following quote from Ellen White:
  “The wisdom of Christ’s answer had convicted the scribe. He knew
that the Jewish religion consisted in outward ceremonies rather than
inward piety. He had some sense of the worthlessness of mere cere-
monial offerings, and the faithless shedding of blood for expiation of
sin. Love and obedience to God, and unselfish regard for man,
appeared to him of more value than all these rites. The readiness of
this man to acknowledge the correctness of Christ’s reasoning, and his
decided and prompt response before the people, manifested a spirit
entirely different from that of the priests and rulers. The heart of Jesus
went out in pity to the honest scribe who had dared to face the frowns
of the priests and the threats of the rulers to speak the convictions of
his heart. ‘And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, He said
unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.’ ”—The Desire
of Ages, p. 608.

 Taking what Jesus said, what the scribe said, and what Ellen
 White said,write what you believe it means for us, today, in the
 twenty-first century, to love God and love our neighbor. How
 can we show this love in a practical way? In what ways might we
 be deceiving ourselves about our so-called “love” for God and
 our neighbors? What changes might we need to make in our
 lives that will allow us to better follow these commandments?

Discussion Questions:
       ●1 Why is the resurrection of the dead something that we need to
       take only on faith? Or is there any evidence from the natural
       world that points to the resurrection of the dead? Do we need any
       natural evidence in order to believe in it?

       ●2 Kathryn Cravens once wrote: “If a man is vain, flatter. If
       timid, flatter. If boastful, flatter. In all history, too much flattery
       never lost a gentleman.” Why do you think that people are so sus-
       ceptible to flattery? How can we as Christians be on guard
       against both giving flattery or being taken in by it?

       ●
       3 When do we cross the line between giving someone valid
       praise and flattering them?

       ●4 Discuss as a class what your church could do, as a church, to
       show the world that you are a congregation of people who truly
       love God and love their neighbors.Are you doing anything as a
       church that would give anyone the idea that you are following
       those commandments, or is your church nothing more than a
       Saturday morning social club?

       ●5 Discuss as a class what Jesus meant by rendering to God
       what’s God’s and rendering to Caesar what’s his. Think of the
       historical context in which Jesus made that statement.Why, if He
       had wanted, could He have justified rebellion against such a cor-
       rupt system? Why do you think He didn’t, and what lessons, if
       any, does that have for us today?

Summary: In this last, drama-filled day in the temple, we find Jesus
      put on the defensive but always in command of the situation, ever
      seeking to reach with His love those who hated Him.

The Datu’s Dream
Letty Jampit
   Datu (chief) Dalangin made it known how he felt about Christians. “The
world is full of different religions,” he would say. “Everyone claims they
have the truth, but who knows which one really does? I will continue to
worship spirit gods of my forefathers, the gods who dwell in the woods
and give us food to eat so we won’t star ve.”
   Sometimes the datu attended the worship in the little Adventist chapel
in the village. But he did not go to listen; he went to ridicule. He laughed
at the stories we told and disturbed the worship.
   So, it was no surprise when the datu and his wife came to worship one
Sabbath. But this time they sat quietly in a corner, listening. They were not
chewing betel nut as they usually did and made no comments about the
songs we sang or the stories we told.
   When testimony time came, the datu stood and spoke. “I often have
dreams, but I don’t see a meaning in them and quickly forget them. But
one night recently I had a dream that disturbed me; I have not been able to
forget it. That is why I am here today.”
   “In my dream I saw 24 churches of different sizes and styles standing in
the heavens. All the churches were dark except one. A small, humble
church was brightly lit, not by candles but by a holy presence, such as the
angels we see in the pictures you show us. I asked the angel what church
this was and why it was the only one lighted. The angel told me gently,
‘This is the Seventh-day Adventist church; it keeps the Sabbath day holy,
                              the day on which your missionary teachers
                               worship. This is the true church that you
                               should join now, before it is too late. Jesus is
                               coming soon.’ ”
                                 The datu paused a moment then he added,
                               “My wife and I have decided to join this
                               church.”
                                 Today Datu Dalangin and his wife and chil-
                               dren are preparing for baptism into God’s
                               remnant church.

      Predictions of the End




      S ABBATH A FTERNOON
      A PEOPLE OF APOCALYPTIC. Seventh-day Adventists are a peo-
      ple of apocalyptic; that is, we believe that this world will not get
      steadily better but instead will come to a sudden, dramatic end. But it
      will not be destroyed in atomic warfare, a meteor from outer space, or
      some other human-made or natural calamity. It will be Jesus who
      brings about the end of all things. He will return to this earth in power
      and glory and will bring down the curtain on the present world order.
      Out of it all and in due time (after the 1,000 years of desolation fore-
      told in Revelation 20), God will make a new heaven and earth for the
      eternal home of His people.
         Our very name, Adventists, proclaims to the world that we believe
      Jesus is coming again. Indeed, we are Adventists because Jesus was
      an Adventist. The scripture passage we study this week, along with its
      parallels in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, gives a sketch, a broad outline
      of the future, from Jesus’ own day until He comes again. And the
      speaker is Jesus Himself.

The Week at a Glance: What was the context of Christ’s
      discourse on the end of the world? What hope did He offer amid
      all these troubling words? How well does the world match Christ’s
      predictions about what it would be like prior to His return?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 13:1-36.

Memory Text: “And the gospel must first be preached to all
      nations” (Mark 13:10, NIV).

      The Disciples’ Questions (Mark 13:1-4).
What was the setting for Jesus’predictions of the end? (Mark 13:1-3).

         Matthew records that, as Jesus ended His teaching in the temple,
      He wept over the beloved city, prophesying: “ ‘Look, your house is
      left to you desolate’ ” (Matt. 23:38, NIV). This remark probably
      prompted the disciples’ comment about the massive foundations and
      magnificent buildings of the temple as they walked away from it.
      Even today, when you visit Jerusalem and walk the site of the old tem-
      ple square, you cannot but be impressed by the size and grandeur of
      what it had been. Some of the stones of the foundation have been
      excavated, and they are huge. No wonder the disciples marveled at
      Jesus’prediction that everything would be thrown down.

Comparing Mark’s account with Matthew’s (Matt. 24:1-3), note
      carefully the questions of the disciples.The disciples thought they
      were asking a single question, but Jesus talked not only about the
      destruction of Jerusalem but about His second coming. Why do
      you think He linked both events?


         To the disciples, it seemed that the events that would lead to the
      destruction of the temple and city could be so calamitous that they
      must be those of the end of the world. For them, the fall of Jerusalem
      would coincide with the return of Jesus to earth. But they were mis-
      taken: Jerusalem indeed would fall and the temple be cast down, but
      many more years would elapse before Jesus would come back. It is
      like people traveling across India who see the Himalayas. They think
      they see the top, but they see only the first ridges. As they climb, they
      see another ridge beyond and another and another, each rising higher.
      Far inside the mountain fastnesses, much farther than they imagined,
      lies the peak, Mount Everest.
         The setting of Jesus’ words is critical for interpreting His prophecies
      of the end. His reply encompassed both aspects of the disciples’ ques-
      tion—the fall of Jerusalem and His second coming. His answer is
      comprehensive: Some predictions are specific to the fall of Jerusalem,
      some to the end of the world, and some apply to both events.

       Having pointed with pride to the most glorious structure in
       their world, as well as the center of their faith, the disciples
       are then told by Christ that it will become nothing but rubble.
       What’s the spiritual principle here that we need to keep con-
       stantly before us in our own lives, as well? See also Job 8:9; Jer.
       7:3, 4; James 4:14; 2 Pet. 3:10-12; 1 John 2:16-17.

                                                                             81

     Signs of the End (Mark 13:5-13).
Study Christ’s words about the signs leading up to the end of the
     world. Amid all the violence, persecution, and bloodshed, He
     nevertheless gives His followers words of encouragement. What
     are those words, scattered through this discourse, and what kind
     of hope do they offer to us amid the terrible events that Jesus pre-
     dicted would take place in the world?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus makes clear that the time of the end will be one of bad news
     and good news. On one hand, His followers can expect upheavals in
     the social, political, and natural worlds, with everything out of course
     and stability a thing of the past. Yet, there will be good news—the
     gospel, the message of God’s love manifested in Jesus, who died for
     our sins—will be proclaimed to all nations.

Even a hundred years ago the prospect of the gospel going to all
     nations would have seemed an implausible, if not exactly an
     impossible, occurrence. What’s changed in recent times that now
     makes the fulfillment of this prediction seem much more likely?
     What do we have now that previous generations didn’t?


       As Christians, we, of course, are always pained and dismayed, as
     are others, over the wars, the natural disasters, and traumas that Jesus
     said would come. And yet, the fact that He told us about them, and the
     fact that even amid all this He gives His followers words of encour-
     agement, should help us maintain faith despite the terrible state of the
     world. This principle is seen through the Old Testament, as well.
     Prophet after prophet, though warning about destruction, judgment,
     calamity, and so forth, almost always, amid the warnings, gave words
     of hope to those who would otherwise have been sorely tempted to
     give up on God (2 Chron. 7:13, 14; Jer. 29:10; 36:1-3; Amos 5:4). In
     other words, as you read this discourse, however depressing in one
     sense it might be, we still have so many reasons to hope.

      Amid whatever struggles, traumas, and trials you are now fac-
      ing, what God-given hope, and promises, are you clinging to
      that, even amid your suffering, keeps you going? Write out a
      paragraph focusing only on the hope you have in Christ.

     The Fall of Jerusalem (Mark 13:11–19).
      While several verses in today’s passage could apply to followers of
     Christ in every age, some are specific to the fall of Jerusalem.

What was the specific sign of the imminent end of Jerusalem that
     Christ’s followers were to watch for? (Mark 13:14; See also Matt.
     24:15, Luke 21:20).


        Jesus talked about the “abomination of desolation.” This is a refer-
     ence to Daniel 9:27, where the prophet is talking about the destruc-
     tion of Jerusalem by the Romans many centuries after Daniel was
     first given the vision. We know this because Jesus Himself, by His
     words here, shows that this is what it means.
        And the Christians took Jesus’ words seriously too. As the storm
     clouds gathered and at last the Roman armies beseiged Jerusalem in
     A.D. 67–70, they were ready. Jesus’ warning indicated that when the
     time came to leave they should do so without delay, and that is what
     they did. But how could they escape from the city when it was sur-
     rounded by foreign soldiers? The Jewish historian Josephus, who
     lived through the fall of Jerusalem, provides the explanation:
     “Josephus says (War vi. 9.3 [420]) more than one million people per-
     ished during and after the siege of the city and 97,000 more were
     taken captive. However, during a temporary respite, when the Romans
     unexpectedly raised their siege of Jerusalem, all the Christians fled,
     and it is said that not one of them lost his life. Their place of retreat
     was Pella, a city in the foothills east of the Jordan River, about 17
     mi. . . . south of the Lake of Galilee.
        “According to Josephus, Titus, commander of the Roman armies,
     confessed that neither his armies nor his siege engines could have been
     successful in breaching the walls of Jerusalem unless God Himself had
     so willed it. The stubborn defense of the city so infuriated the Roman
     soldiers, that when they finally entered, their desire for revenge knew
     no bounds.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 499.

      The siege of Jerusalem was one of the most brutal devastations
      in all history. Women, children, and babies starved to death.
      Families murdered each other over every morsel of food,includ-
      ing pigeon droppings. And yet, God knew it all in advance, as
      shown by both Daniel’s and Jesus’prophecy. How would you, as
      a Christian, explain to a non-Christian how a loving God,know-
      ing what would happen, would let it happen? How do you, in
      your own mind, reconcile these kind of tragedies with an all-
      loving, all-powerful God?


                                                                           83

     The Second Coming (Mark 13:19-27).
       While we cannot pinpoint every statement in Jesus’ predictions in
     Mark 13 as referring either to the fall of Jerusalem or to the Second
     Coming, the overall direction of the chapter is clear. After “signs” of
     a more general nature, He gives specific evidence to indicate the cap-
     ture of Jerusalem (vss. 14-18). Then He moves toward the end of the
     world in which He gives direct, unambiguous statements concerning
     the Second Coming (vss. 26, 27).

Study Mark 13:14-27, bearing in mind that Jesus here has left
     behind discussion of the fall of Jerusalem. Below, summarize the
     essence of what Jesus said would take place in the future but prior
     to His return.Don’t focus on the details as much as on the general
     state of the world.

Compare what you wrote to the state of the world since Christ’s
     words. How well do they match?


        Read carefully and prayerfully verse 23. Look what came before it: a
     depiction of a terrible time, affliction, violence, false christs and false
     signs, and wonders so deceptive that even the elect were in danger of
     being deceived. And yet, after this, Jesus basically says, Look, these ter -
     rible things are happening, but don’t be discouraged or lose faith,
     because I am telling you beforehand that it will happen. Again, even
     amid such a dire warning, the Lord is giving His people reasons to
     hope. If anything, because He said these things would happen, they in
     their own terrible way help prove the truth of what Jesus said (see also
     John 13:19). And we must remember not to focus only on these events
     but on the event they are all leading up to: the second coming of Christ.

      Russian poetess Anna Akhmatova, writing during a terrible cri-
      sis in her homeland (“Everything is plundere d ,b e t rayed,sold”),
      nevertheless aske d ,“ W hy then do we not despair?” Her answer
      was: “By day, from the surrounding woods, / cherries blow sum-
      mer into town; / at night the deep transparent skies / glitter with
      new galaxies.”—Poems of Akhmatova (New York: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1973), p. 73. From what did she derive hope? What
      do we have as Christians that should give us a greater hope?

     Awaiting the Advent (Mark 13:28-37).
What lesson does the fig tree teach us? Why can’t we know the exact
     date of Jesus’ coming? (vss. 28, 29, 32, 33). Why might it not be
     good to know the exact time of Christ’s return?


        Nature itself alerts us to the Second Coming, if we but open our eyes.
     Every year as the earth puts forth new growth, we know that summer is
     coming. We don’t know just when the hot days will hit, but we can be
     100 percent sure that they will come. Even so, the signs of the return of
     Jesus have been accumulating over the centuries, and we can know that
     His coming will follow as surely as spring follows winter.
        During Ellen White’s long ministry, she encountered various
     attempts to set dates for the Second Coming. She refused to be caught
     up in any of these speculations, instead instructing Adventists to
     beware of them. In a sermon preached at Lansing, Michigan, in 1891,
     she counseled us to give more attention to how we live day by day. The
     sermon, titled “It Is Not for You to Know the Times or the Seasons,”
     was based on Jesus’ words in Acts 1:8 and included the following
     counsel: “We are not to know the definite time either for the outpour-
     ing of the Holy Spirit or for the coming of Christ. . . .
        “We are not to live upon time excitement. We are not to be
     engrossed with speculations in regard to the times and the seasons
     which God has not revealed. . . . His followers are to be in the posi-
     tion of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain; they are
     to watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for the com-
     ing of the Lord; but no one will be able to predict just when that time
     will come; for ‘of that day and hour knoweth no man.’You will not be
     able to say that He will come in one, two, or five years, neither are
     you to put off His coming by stating that it may not be for ten or
     twenty years.”—Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 188, 189.

What key word does Jesus use to describe the attitude we need to
     have as we wait for His return? (Mark 13:34-37).


        Jesus’ parable of the householder who goes away and leaves serv-
     ants in charge teaches the lesson as His illustration of the fig tree. The
     Master’s return is absolutely certain, but we cannot know just when.
     Each day that goes by brings the Second Coming one day closer.

      In Jesus’ parable, “watching” meant being ready to open the
      door when the Master returned.What does “watching” mean to
      us today? What things can cause us to fall “asleep,” and how
      can we avoid them?

                                                                            85

FURTHER STUDY: Compare Mark’s account of Jesus’ Olivet
     discourse with the parallels in Matthew 24:1-51 and Luke 21:5-36.
     Read Ellen G. White’s “On the Mount of Olives,” in The Desire of
     Ages, pp. 627–636.
        In the discourse on the signs leading up to the Second Coming, it’s
     important not to get so caught up in all the gloom and doom that we
     forget the great hope awaiting us—eternal life in Christ: “No wonder,
     then, that the New Testament comes laced with promises of eternal
     life (John 3:16, John 6:54, John 10:28, Luke 18:30, Rom. 6:22,
     1 Tim. 1:16, Titus 3:7, 1 John 5:13), for only the eternal guarantees
     restitution. A million years, even a billion years, might not possess
     enough good moments to make up for the bad suffered here. Eternity
     alone can balance all things out, and then some, because the infinite
     is more than the finite, and always infinitely so.”—Adventist Review,
     Feb. 28, 2002, p. 22.

Discussion Questions:
      ●1 Read the above quote from the Adventist Review. What is the
      author saying? As a class, discuss the hope it is talking about.

      ●2 Of all the signs of the Advent given in this week’s lesson, which
      one is clearly yet to be fulfilled? What is our role in that fulfill-
      ment? What can we as a church or as individuals do to help see
      it fulfilled? Are we helping, or are we part of the reason we’re
      still here? Justify your answer.

      ●
      3 How can we maintain a sense of the imminence of the Second
      Coming without getting caught up in end-time hysteria?

Summary: Adventists’ emphasis on the Second Coming is not mis-
     guided. It originates in Jesus, our Savior and Lord, for whom it was a
     vital part of truth. Just before the close of His life He gave a long dis-
     course to Peter, Andrew, James, and John, giving them and His fol-
     lowers in all ages a glimpse into the future. That future would bring,
     first of all, the fall of Jerusalem, but Christians could know when that
     was near and flee for their lives. After that climactic event, a long
     period of distress would take place, but the end would come in God’s
     good time.

“Jail Me Instead”
Serafina Ma’alo
   Serafina and her husband, Ma’alo, live in Samoa. When they began
studying with Adventists, they were amazed to learn that they had believed
so much that was not based on the Bible. After Ma’alo gained victory over
alcohol and tobacco addictions, the couple, along with his parents, joined
the church together.
   Ma’alo’s parents lived in a village that had a small congregation of
believers. But the group met in a member’s home far from where they
lived. Ma’alo’s father wanted to start a Branch Sabbath School closer to
his home. But family members have a say in what happens on family prop-
erty, and Ma’alo’s aunt objected to the family holding religious meetings
on the family land.
   One evening Ma’alo’s uncle became drunk and began throwing stones
and shouting threats at church members. Ma’alo grabbed his uncle to pre-
vent him from hurting anyone. The uncle accused Ma’alo of beating him
up and ordered Ma’alo arrested.
   Ma’alo had planned to leave the island the next day on a trip. His father
begged the police to release his son. “Put me in jail instead,” his father
said. The police released Ma’alo and jailed his father so that Ma’alo could
leave as planned.
   When villagers learned what had happened, they were impressed that
Ma’alo’s father would place himself in jail in order to redeem his son who
had done no wrong. Villagers began asking questions about God, and in
time almost 100 people were baptized into this new congregation. The
members built a traditional hall of thatched roof over cleared land, which
quickly became too small for the number of people attending worship.
   Eventually the village agreed to let the Adventists build a church on
                            Ma’alo’s family property. The church mem-
                            bership continues to grow, even as the village
                            decreases in population.
                              Serafina’s family moved to her home vil-
                            lage, and the couple plan to start another
                            Branch Sabbath School there. “Who knows,”
                            Serafina said, “maybe another church will be
                            born.”


                                Serafina Ma’alo is a homemaker living in Faeapuna,
                                Samoa.

      Betrayed and Arrested




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      CLIMAX OF THE AGES. Our final three lessons in Mark’s story of
      Jesus focus on about 72 hours, the crisis point in the life of Jesus.
        The next three lessons are locked together. Each contains events
      and decisions that affect the final outcome. In this week’s study we
      see Jesus wrestling in the Garden of Gethsemane, struggling with the
      agony of becoming the Sin Bearer for the world. If He turns back, we
      are eternally lost. Next week we will follow Him to the Cross, where
      Satan hurls all his assembled schemes in the greatest effort to defeat
      Him. If Satan succeeds, we are eternally lost. In the final lesson we
      see Jesus dead, laid in a stone-cold tomb. If His body continues to lie
      there, all His life and teachings, all His sufferings and death have been
      in vain—and we are eternally lost. Indeed, the stakes are high.

The Week at a Glance: How did Judas justify his
      betrayal of Jesus? Why did Jesus say that He would not drink of
      the “fruit of the vine” until we were in the kingdom of God? Why
      did Peter deny Christ despite his strong affirmation that he would
      never do that? What does it mean to call God “Abba”? Why did
      the disciples all fail Christ so miserably in His climactic hour?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 14:1-51.

Memory Text: “ ‘Abba, Father,’ he said, ‘everything is possible
      for you. Take this cup from me . Yet not what I will, but what you
      will’ ” (Mark 14:36, NIV).

     The Betrayal Plot                 (Mark 14:1-11).

Read Mark 14:3-10 along with John 12:1-8; from the two accounts,
     piece together the best you can why it was after this incident that
     Judas went and betrayed Jesus.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       What’s so frightening about the story of Judas is how easily a
     human being can be deceived into believing that his or her action, no
     matter how bad, is right.

What was the issue that got some people upset in this account? Was
     it not, in and of itself , a “valid” point?


In Mark’s account, a number of the disciples, not just Judas, were
     upset about the “waste” of the money. How might the fact that
     others complained have helped Judas be convinced that his indig-
     nation was indeed well-grounded?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       It’s interesting how Mark 14 begins: The leaders are looking for a
     way to put Jesus to death. Then, we are given this incident with this
     woman and Christ’s rebuke to those disciples who “had indignation
     within themselves” over what she did. The next thing we know, Judas
     goes to the leaders and gives them what they were looking for. (Luke
     does the same thing but in a different way: see Luke 22:1-4.) Under
     the guidance of the Holy Spirit, Mark apparently wanted to show the
     reader how it was this incident that pushed Judas into his terrible
     betrayal. Notice, too, how the theme of money plays prominently in
     both Simon’s house and with Judas and the leaders. That should tell
     us something about how the devil (Luke 22:3) uses our weak points to
     gain control of our minds.

      We stand horrified at Judas, and yet, none of us are immune to
      the same principle: that of being swept away by cherished sin
      until we, too, betray our Lord. What was the only thing that
      could have saved Judas, and the only thing that can save us?
      Mark 8:34. How do we make this real in our lives?


                                                                       89

     The Last Supper                 (Mark 14:12-26).

       The last meal of Jesus with His disciples has been commemorated
     by Christians from the beginning of the church. Some twenty years
     after Jesus sat down with the Twelve on that last Thursday night, the
     followers of Jesus in Corinth, probably meeting in a house church,
     gathered to celebrate the Lord’s Supper (1 Cor. 11:17-22). Paul wrote
     to them to correct abuses that had come into their practices. Today,
     almost all Christian churches observe the Supper, but the understand-
     ing of its meaning varies considerably.

Read Mark 14:24, 25. What is Jesus saying here? How do you see
     here a clear reference to the Second Coming? Why would He be
     talking about the Second Coming at this time, in the context of
     His own death?

       Look at what Jesus is saying, not just to His disciples but to us, as
     well. His words reveal the closeness, the bond, the unity He feels with
     those who will be with Him in “the kingdom of God.” He’s not going
     to drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God has come
     (see Luke 22:18); that is, until all of us who are saved by this shed
     blood will be there with Him. “But I say unto you, I will not drink
     henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new
     with you in my Father’s kingdom” (Matthew 26:29). In other words,
     not until we are there to drink with him will He Himself drink. Again,
     we have to remember who is speaking to us (John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16,
     17; Heb. 1:2)—and yet, He views us with such a sense of closeness?
     What a testimony to God’s love!
         Notice, too, how Christ places His shed blood at the center of
     everything here; it’s only because of that blood that we can one day be
     with Him in the “kingdom of God” and drink with Him the “fruit of
     the vine,” symbolic of that blood. How inadequate any theology that
     lessens the centrality of Christ’s shed blood to the plan of salvation!

      Think about what Christ said here about not drinking the fruit
      of the vine until we are with Him in the kingdom.What kind of
      comfort, hope, and assurance does that give you? How can this
      wonderful revelation of God’s character help you through a
      present discouragement?

     Peter’s Failure (Mark 14:27-31, 66-72).
       Jesus foretold that Judas would betray Him (Mark 14:21). He also
     predicted that Peter would deny Him (vs. 30). But Judas and Peter
     were not preordained by God to fail. To God, all things past, present
     and future are known; He sees what will happen, but that does not
     negate freedom of choice. Jesus said what He said only because He
     knew what they would do; if Peter and Judas wouldn’t have made
     those choices, Jesus would not have made those predictions.

How far did Peter feel ready to go in following Jesus? Do you think
     he meant what he said? (Mark 14:27-31).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        How like Peter we each are! How quick to affirm, “Although all
     shall be offended, yet will not I” (vs. 29). And Peter meant his words.
     So do we, as we make promises to God, but often we find ourselves
     again with Peter, broken, weeping, having failed the Lord. We each
     have to learn the lesson that Peter learned: to promise does not guar-
     antee victory. We need to learn to look away from our own strength
     and resources and rely wholly on Christ for victory. If Peter had been
     quicker to speak of Christ than of himself, the story might have been
     quite different.
        Notice, too, that Peter wasn’t the only one who claimed that no mat-
     ter what, even death, they wouldn’t deny Jesus (vs. 31). All the disci-
     ples made the same affirmation. However, when things really got hot,
     “they all forsook him, and fled” (vs. 50). Though the focus here is
     particularly on Peter, the others had a lot to learn, as well, about what
     it meant to follow Christ.


      What words might Peter have said, or prayed, that could have
      revealed an attitude that might have spared him this terrible
      failure? Use the following texts to help you formulate the words:
      Ps. 56:1-3; Ps. 119:28; Luke 18:13; 2 Cor. 12:9, 10; Phil. 4:13.
      How might what you write down help fortify you for whatever
      temptations and challenges you face?

      Abba! (Mark 14:32-42).
         The Garden of Gethsemane was a favorite place for Jesus. He had
      often retreated there to find relaxation and respite from the crowds.
      This night, however, the place of peace became a place of agony.
         Ponder the story of Gethsemane, reading and rereading it in the
      Gospel accounts (Matt. 26:35-56, Mark 14:32-42, Luke 22:40-53,
      and John 18:1-12). Notice that in His supplication to the Father,
      Christ used a term of endearment—Abba. It suggests deep affection;
      we could translate it as “Daddy.” Thus, amid the incredible suffering,
      the sense of separation between Himself and His Father, Jesus still
      trusted enough in the Father’s love that He would call Him by that
      term. What a testimony to raw, naked faith amid utter despondency.
         Ellen White describes what Christ was to face on the cross: “Christ
      was now standing in a different attitude from that in which He had
      ever stood before. . . . Hitherto He had been as an intercessor for oth -
      ers; now He longed to have an intercessor for Himself.
         “As Christ felt His unity with the Father broken up, He feared that
      in His human nature He would be unable to endure the coming con-
      flict with the powers of darkness. . . . With the issues of the conflict
      before Him, Christ’s soul was filled with dread of separation from
      God. Satan told Him that if He became the surety for a sinful world,
      the separation would be eternal. He would be identified with Satan’s
      kingdom, and would nevermore be one with God.”—Ellen G. White,
      The Desire of Ages, pp. 686, 687. And yet, even in anticipation of this,
      Christ could still cry out “Abba!”

Paul tells us that, as disciples of Christ who have been adopted into
      the family of God, we, too, cry out to our heavenly Father in this
      term of trust and affection—“Abba!” Read Romans 8:15 and
      Galatians 4:6 (and don’t forget to read them in context).What are
      they saying? What happened so that we, too, can call God
      “Abba?”

     Jesus Arrested (Mark 14:43-52).
       In the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus struggled with the future that
     the plan of redemption laid out for Him—and accepted it. Not His
     comfort but the bearing of humanity’s sins, not His will but the
     Father’s became His choice.

What was especially despicable about the manner in which Judas
     betrayed his Master? (Mark 14:44-46).


       The enemies of Jesus came after Him in the dead of night when the
     common people would not be present to oppose their efforts.
     However, they were concerned that the shadows of night might afford
     an opportunity for Jesus to escape; and once again Judas aided their
     purposes. Following a prearranged signal, he went ahead of the mob
     and kissed Jesus. The original text indicates that Judas didn’t just give
     Jesus an embrace, but he kissed Him several times so that Jesus’ene-
     mies could move quickly to arrest Him.
       But Judas and the mob need not have worried about Jesus’ escap-
     ing. Jesus had long foreseen this moment, had prepared for “this
     hour,” had made His decision during the preceding struggle in earnest
     prayer. Jesus made no attempt to escape or resist arrest.

How did the other disciples react when the mob arrested Jesus?
     (Mark 14:47-50). Why did they fail miserably when the test came
     to them? Was there any reason, given their past performance, to
     expect anything different from them?


       During the Last Supper Jesus had warned the disciples about the
     coming test. He singled out Peter, warning that Satan intended to
     make him an object of special attack (see Luke 22:31-34). But in the
     Garden the disciples slept instead of praying. Again Jesus tried to pre-
     pare Peter for what was coming (Mark 14:37, 38), but His warning
     went unheeded. When the test came, the disciples at first attempted to
     meet force with force. Peter’s response was to draw his sword and
     begin flailing about with it (John 18:10, 11). He and his companions
     were not in touch with their Master, whose kingdom is not of this
     world and who rejected physical force. So, the disciples’ feeble,
     worldly efforts failed, and they all fled.

      All through the Gospels, the disciples make one mistake after
      another; yet, with the exception of Judas, God used them to form
      the core of the Christian church. What message of hope does this
      offer you?

                                                                           93

    Further Study: Study the parallel accounts of Jesus’ betrayal and
         arrest in Matthew 26:1-56, 69-75; Luke 22:1-62; John 13; 18:1-11.
         Read Ellen G. White’s “A Servant of Servants,” “In Remembrance of
         Me,” “Gethsemane,” and “Judas,” in The Desire of Ages, pp. 642–661,
         685–697, 716–722.

            “The awful moment had come—that moment which was to decide
         the destiny of the world. The fate of humanity trembled in the balance.
         Christ might even now refuse to drink the cup apportioned to guilty
         man. It was not yet too late. . . . Will the Son of God drink the bitter
         cup of humiliation and agony? Will the innocent suffer the conse-
         quences of the curse of sin, to save the guilty? The words fall trem-
         blingly from the pale lips of Jesus, ‘O My Father, if this cup may not
         pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done.’
            “Three times has He uttered that prayer. Three times has humanity
         shrunk from the last, crowning sacrifice. But now the history of the
         human race comes up before the world’s Redeemer. He sees that the
         transgressors of the law, if left to themselves, must perish. He sees the
         helplessness of man. He sees the power of sin. The woes and lamen-
         tation of a doomed world rise before Him. He beholds its impending
1        fate, and His decision is made. He will save man at any cost to
         Himself.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 690–693.

    Discussion Question:
2         Dwell more on this idea of Christ’s not drinking of the fruit of
          the vine until we are all in the kingdom. What does it tell us
          about the character of God? Share with the class other examples
          of this same principle, that of someone not doing something until
          someone else could do it with them (for example, Uriah’s not
          wanting to spend the night with his wife while his troops were
          still in battle; see 2 Sam. 11:11). How do these stories illustrate
          the point that Jesus was making?

    Summary: Jesus has come to the last moments of His earthly life
         before His crucifixion. The plan first thought out in the days of eter-
         nity was now coming to fruition. With everyone else failing around
         Him, Jesus alone stood firm. The fate of the world depended upon it.

“Where Is My Church?”
Adela Amariutzei
   Adela was born to Jewish parents in Romania. When she retired she
immigrated to Israel, where her children lived. Adela had become an
Adventist and quickly began looking for a church. But she did not speak
Hebrew and knew few people in Tel Aviv, where she settled. She tried con-
tacting the Adventist field office in Jerusalem, but no one there spoke
Romanian.
   She asked friends in Romania for the address of an Adventist church in
Tel Aviv but could find none. However, they did send her Sabbath School
quarterlies when they could. She spent Sabbaths studying her Bible and
reading her lesson. Her children were not Adventists and she had few
friends, so Adela spent her Sabbaths alone in her little room. Her constant
prayer was, “God, where is my church?”
   One day while waiting for a bus, Adela met 15-year-old Katalina.
Realizing Katalina was a Romanian, Adela did not waste time. “I am an
Adventist, and I am looking for the Adventist Church in Tel Aviv,” she
said.
   Katalina smiled. “I am an Adventist too! We have a church in Tel Aviv!
I can tell you where it is. No—” Katalina stopped. “Tomorrow I will come
and take you to my family’s house to meet them. Then on Sabbath I will
take you to church!”
   Katalina kept her promise. She took Adela to meet her family. Adela
was so excited to meet fellow Adventists that she could hardly stop talk-
ing. “I have been here for so many years and did not know where to find
the church! This is wonderful!”
   On Sabbath Katalina took Adela to her first worship with fellow
Romanian Adventists in Israel. During church Adela shared her story of
years of loneliness, praying to find fellow believers. Adela learned that
Romanian Adventists did not own a place to worship. The church moved
from one rented building to another when a landlord or the neighbors
objected to Adventists meeting in the area. It was difficult to let people
know where the church was located.
   Today the church rents a large hall in a good building. But the congre-
gation is growing, and members want to open a second church closer to
where Adela lives. Now that Adela has found her church, she is working
to win others to Christ, the Messiah.

Adela Amariutzei lives in a small apartment in Tel Aviv, Israel.

      Tried and Crucified




      SABBATH A FTERNOON
      ALL ROADS LEAD TO CALVARY. We have traced the footsteps of
      Jesus of Nazareth from Galilee to Jerusalem, and they inevitably lead
      to Calvary, His place of rejection, shame, suffering, and death; but to
      our place of victory, hope, and eternal life.
        Calvary, and what followed, sets Jesus of Nazareth apart from all
      other religious teachers the world has known. Others left wise teach-
      ings, did kind deeds, gathered a band of followers, and became the
      center of movements that persisted and grew after their deaths, some
      into world religions. But only Jesus, after His death, was resurrected
      and reigns as a living Savior. And that difference makes all the differ-
      ence in the world.

The Week at a Glance: What reasons did the high priests
      think they had for putting Jesus to death? How did they influence
      Pilate? What was the significance of Jesus’ being crucified
      between two thieves? How central is the idea of substitution in
      understanding the death of Jesus? What happened to the
      Godhead at the Cross?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 14:53-65, 15:1-41.

Memory Verse: “And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
      loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being
      interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”
      (Mark 15:34).

      Before the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:53-65).
         The trials of Jesus were a farce. They were not intended to impar-
      tially examine the evidence but to trump up charges that would result
      in Jesus’condemnation and death. The religious leaders had reached
      their decision before any trial began: They wanted Jesus dead. While
      they attempted to maintain the appearance of legality, the whole
      process—a hastily called “court” in the middle of the night—made a
      mockery of justice.
         By piecing together the accounts of Jesus’trials in the four Gospels
      and additional comments by Ellen G. White, The SDA Bible
      Commentary concludes the following: Jesus was given two prelimi-
      nary hearings, one before Annas alone and another before Annas and
      Caiaphas. He was arraigned twice before the Sanhedrin, first by night
      and then by day. Jesus appeared twice before Pilate and once before
      Herod, between the two appearances before Pilate (see vol. 5, p. 528).

As you read this account in Mark,put yourself in the place of the high
      priest. Why would he want Jesus dead? How could he have “jus-
      tified” his own course? After the texts, write out what “justifica-
      tion” he believed that he had.

        We’re often astonished, and rightly so, at the blindness of the
       leaders in their attitude toward Jesus.Yet,after summarizing in
       your own mind their rationale from the above texts,can you see
       how easy it was, even despite the evidence, for them to do what
       they did? What lessons might there be here for us, we who also
       have a capacity for justifying whatever we do, as well?

                                                                          97

      Pilate and the Religious Leaders                              (Mark
      15:1-19).

        Study the accounts of Jesus before Pilate in Mark 15:1-15 and the
      other Gospels (Matt. 27:11-26, Luke 22:66–23:25, John 18:28–19:1-
      16). How incredible that a pagan ruler was trying to save Jesus while
      the religious leaders, supposedly the guardians of the faith, wanted
      Him dead. How incredible that Jesus would be called “King of the
      Jews” by a pagan ruler and his soldiers while His own people, who
      long professed to be waiting for Him, shouted, “Crucify Him!” How
      incredible that Pilate offered to release Jesus, the Life-Giver, and the
      crowd wanted Barabbas, a murderer, instead. What a frightening tes-
      timony to the power of Satan to deceive hearts that are not surren-
      dered completely to the Lord.

Who was more guilty in the eyes of God, Pilate or the religious lead-
      ers? What justification do you have for your answer? See John
      19:11.

         Religion can be a powerful tool either for good or evil. In this
      account, we see it used for a terribly evil purpose. When people, like
      the religious leaders here, do things under the idea that they are doing
      it for God, what can stop them? The notion that one’s actions are being
      done under a divine impetus can lead one to do a whole host of things
      that, otherwise, would not be done. After all, if God is leading some-
      one, who or what should be allowed to stand in the way?

We never sin in a vacuum, do we? That is, our sins never just impact
      ourselves.Reread the account for today. Who else was impacted in
      a very negative way because of what the religious leaders did?
      What’s the message for us here? What other examples can you
      find in the Bible of how quickly the influence of sin can spread to
      hurt others?



       Put yourself in the place of Pilate during the final judgment
       (Eccles. 12:14, Rom. 3:6). What kind of arguments might he try
       to use to justify his actions? How many times in the last month
       or so have you used the same principle to justify your own

     Golgotha (Mark 15:16-37).
       Of all the scenes from the life of Jesus, this is the one that most
     demands our prayerful contemplation. See Him hanging on the cross,
     bruised, bowed, and bloody, God’s only begotten Son. His back is lac-
     erated, His hands and feet pierced with nails. All night He has been
     up; He has had neither food nor drink since the meal the night before.
     Now He hangs helpless, skewered between felons, exposed to sun and
     wind, flies and ants.

Read carefully Mark 15:27, 28.What significance do you find in the
     fact that not only was Jesus crucified as a common criminal, but
     that he was placed there amid two criminals? How does the Old
     Testament text (Isa. 53:12) quoted there by Mark help answer
     that question? What point is being forced home here to us about
     what happened to Jesus on the cross?

        At the Cross, Christ became our Sin Bearer. That is, He became so
     closely associated with sin that, according to Paul, God “for our sak e
     . . . made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might
     become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor. 5:21, RSV). Without quite
     saying that Jesus was a sinner, which would have, of course, been
     wrong, Paul came as close as he possibly could, instead bringing out
     the idea that God regarded Him as a sinner, a transgressor, and thus
     treated Him as such. In a way that we can barely understand, Jesus—
     the only One who never sinned—took the place of every sinner.

Read John 1:29, Galatians 3:13, Hebrews 9:28, and 1 Peter 2:24.
     What are they saying that helps us understand the relationship
     between Jesus and sin at the Cross?

      The Meaning of Calvary (Isaiah 53).

In the texts we looked at yesterday, Mark quoted from Isaiah 53. Read
      that chapter and list the phrases that explicitly suggest that
      “Christ died for our sins”—that is, in our place (see Isa. 53:4-12).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

In what ways can you see the idea of “substitution,” that Jesus died in
      our stead? Why is this so important for understanding the plan of
      salvation?


         Christians have tried to explain just how God in Christ provides the
      way of salvation. They have set forth the various theories of the atone-
      ment. Some explanations or suggestions are as follows. How do they
      work, or not work, for you?
         1. The Father was reluctant to save humanity, but Christ’s love pro-
      vided the answer.
         2. Christ’s death was a ransom price paid for the devil to free human-
      ity from his clutches.
         3. God’s honor was offended by sin, and Christ had to die to satisfy
      that offended honor.
         4. Christ had to die as an example to the rest of the universe of the
      effects of sin.
         5. Christ died in order to manifest God’s love so that we might be
      softened and won to Him.
         6. On the cross the Father was punishing the Son.
         No one theory is sufficient to explain how God provides a way of
      salvation in Jesus Christ. Many of the various “explanations” worked
      out—sometimes in great detail—by Christian thinkers over the cen-
      turies contain elements of truth, but the full story is much greater. The
      answer lies in God, who Himself provides the atonement. Note the fol-
      lowing truths set forth in the Bible.
         1. In the plan of salvation, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are One
      in love and action. We must avoid portraying the Father as cruel or
      merciless and the Son as merciful by contrast. (See John 3:16.)
         2. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself (2 Cor.
      5:19).
         3. The death was necessary (Rom. 3:24-26, Heb. 9:22).
         4. Christ died in our place (2 Cor. 5:21, 1 Cor. 15:3).
         5. The Cross is the supreme evidence of divine love (Rom. 5:7, 8).

     The Death of Jesus (Mark 15:33-41).
       “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34).

       “Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The
     Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did not
     present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell
     Him of the Father’s acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was
     so offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt
     the anguish which the sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer
     plead for the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father’s
     wrath upon Him as man’s substitute, that made the cup He drank so
     bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, p. 753.

Dwell on this Ellen White quote. How does it help us understand
     what happened at the Cross? What does it tell us about the char-
     acter of sin? Of God? How does it help us understand what our
     salvation cost God?

       Although Jesus tapped the depths of despair in His cry of woe—
     “My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”—His final words,
     “It is finished” (John 19:30), expressed confidence, hope, and trust
     anyway. He declared that He had won the last decisive battle with
     Satan; the outcome of the great controversy with evil was assured.
     The war isn’t over yet, but we know how it will end, because Jesus
     won the victory on Calvary. Finally, commending Himself into the
     Father’s keeping, Jesus bowed His head and died.

      Think about it. Jesus was One with the Father from eternity
      (John 1:1, 2); He and the Father were One in unity, action, and
      purpose (Gen. 1:26, 3:22, John 10:30); and yet, there, at the
      cross, Jesus felt this overwhelming sense of separation because
      of sin! There was a sundering of the Godhead itself there at
      Calvary! Have you ever been separated from someone that you
      love and feel very close to? How did that separation make you
      feel? How could those experiences, in a small way, not only help
      you appreciate what Jesus did for us but also help you live in
      loving obedience to the God who went through all this for you?

FURTHER STUDY: Compare the parallel accounts in Matthew
      26:57-68; 27:1-56; Luke 22:66–23:49; John 18:12-14, 19–19:37.
      Read Ellen G. White’s “Before Annas and the Court of Caiaphas,” “In
      Pilate’s Judgment Hall,” “Calvary,” and “It is Finished,” in The Desire
      of Ages, pp. 698–715, 723–764.

        “The Captain of our salvation was perfected through suffering. His
      soul was made an offering for sin. It was necessary for the awful dark-
      ness to gather about His soul because of the withdrawal of the Father’s
      love and favor; for He was standing in the sinner’s place, and this
      darkness every sinner must experience. The righteous One must suf-
      fer the condemnation and wrath of God, not in vindictiveness; for the
      heart of God yearned with greatest sorrow when His Son, the guilt-
      less, was suffering the penalty of sin. This sundering of the divine
      powers will never again occur throughout the eternal ages.”—Ellen G.
      White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 924.

Discussion Questions:
       ●
       1 Write out a small narrative, putting yourself in the place of
       Caiaphas. Justify why you had to have Jesus put to death. Bring
       it to class and have members read their accounts and then dis-
       cuss whatever you can learn from this exercise.

       ●
       2 Why did Jesus have to die in order to save us?


       ●
       3 As a class, discuss the implication of the statement: “The
       whole purpose of the Cross was merely to help us learn to trust
       God.” Why do you agree or disagree with it?

       ●
       4 What could you do, as a church, to be more Cross-centered?
       How can you make sure that when people think of your church,
       they first and foremost think of a community whose individual
       lives have been changed by Christ’s death on the cross?

Summary: Christ died for our sins. Only as we see ourselves at
      Calvary—see and confess that Jesus died for me, in my place—does
      the Cross reach us with its full import. “If we would be saved at last,
      we must learn the lesson of penitence and humiliation at the foot of
      the cross.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 83.

What Changed Michael?
Ohemaa Akyaa Archin
   “Michael. . . . Michael!”* Mother called.
   “I’ll be with you in a minute, Mum!” Michael called back. “I’m having
quiet time.”
   “What?” Mother said, surprised. Michael had avoided family worship and
hadn’t read his Bible in months. Mother decided to go see what he was really
doing. She peeked through the half-open door.
   She saw Michael sitting on his bed reading his Bible. Then she noticed
that the posters of rap stars were gone. In their place was a large picture of
Jesus with a message under it that read, “I love you for saving my life. I will
serve you forever.”
   Mother quietly walked to where her husband sat and shared what she had
seen. A few minutes later Michael came into the room. His hair was
combed, he was neatly dressed, and he smiled.
   Michael was the eldest son in an Adventist family in Ghana, West Africa.
He was outgoing and much loved. He grew into a strikingly handsome
teenager. But when he entered senior high school, something happened to
him. This once obedient son became disobedient. He no longer came when
he was called, no longer willingly took part in family worship or church
activities. He smoked, hung out with the wrong crowd at school, and wor-
ried his parents to tears. His behavior became so bad that his parents wor-
ried about his influence on the younger children. They prayed daily for their
wayward son.
   When December break approached, the young people in the church began
talking about the upcoming youth camp. As the time drew near, more and
more young people talked enthusiastically about youth camp, and to
Michael’s parents’ surprise, Michael decided to go. Even the youth leader
wondered whether it was a good idea to let Michael go. Would the other
children be influenced by his behavior?
   The youth arrived at camp and were assigned their housing. The days
were so packed with activities that there was no time for mischief. Michael
                       took part in the games, the singing times, and he even
                       listened during lectures. “No matter who you are or
                       how sinful you have been,” the speaker said, “God can
                       wash you clean and pure.” During the call of dedica-
                       tion, Michael gave his life back to God. Michael
                       returned home a changed boy, and the change lasted.
                          * Michael is not his real name.

      Buried—But Risen!




      S ABBATH AFTERNOON
      A TOMB UNIQUE: Some of the most famous structures on this
      earth are tombs. Consider the great pyramid of Egypt: 100,000 men
      are supposed to have worked for 20 years to build it. To this day we
      do not know how the 23 million massive stone blocks, weighing an
      average of two and one half tons, were set in place. But the great pyra-
      mid, like the others in its class, was built out of a concern for death.
      It provided burial chambers for the Pharaoh; it is a monument to
      death. So is the beautiful Taj Mahal of India, built by Shah Jahan for
      his favorite wife, Mumtaz. With its gleaming white marble, inlaid pre-
      cious stones, gardens, and reflecting pools, the Taj Mahal indeed is a
      magnificent monument. Inside the Taj Mahal repose the bodies of
      Shah Jehan and Mumtaz. How different is the story that we celebrate
      in this week’s lesson. The simple, rock-cut garden tomb of Joseph of
      Arimathea, the tomb where Jesus was laid, is more wonderful than the
      pyramid of Cheops or the Taj Mahal. And that’s because—His tomb
      is empty!

The Week at a Glance: Why is it important to know that
      Jesus truly died on the cross? Who were the first ones to know
      that Christ had risen? What is the evidence that He rose from the
      dead? How do the arguments against the Resurrection used by
      skeptics fail?

      Scripture Passage for the Week: Mark 15:42–16:20.

Memory Verse: “ ‘Don’t be alarmed,’ he said.‘You are looking
      for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not
      here. See the place where they laid him’ ” (Mark 16:6, NIV).

      “He Was Buried” (Mark 15:42-47).
         The Scriptures had predicted that God’s servant would make “his
      grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death” (Isa. 53:9, NIV).
      Jesus was a poor man who owned only one item of value—the seam-
      less tunic for which the Roman soldiers gambled (John 19:23, 24). It
      seemed highly unlikely that He would be buried in a rich person’s
      tomb, but so it turned out. Two members of the Sanhedrin, the high-
      est council of the Jews, came forward after Jesus’ death to publicly
      identify themselves with Jesus. Mark mentions Joseph of Arimathea,
      but John’s Gospel tells us that Nicodemus—he who had secretly
      talked with Jesus under cover of night—accompanied Joseph (John
      19:38-42).

In 1 Corinthians 15:3,4 Paul quotes an early formulation of the gospel.
      This statement includes the words “he was buried.” Why was it
      important to the first Christians to include this fact?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The New Testament throbs with the certainty that Jesus rose from the
      dead. Throughout the book of Acts the preaching of the apostles comes
      back to two ringing affirmations: Christ is risen, and He has poured out
      the Holy Spirit. So, the formulation of the gospel in 1 Corinthians 15:3
      ties together three facts: 1. Christ died for our sins. 2. He was buried.
      3. He rose again.
         Thus, the burial of Jesus is not a minor matter. It underlines the
      truth that He truly died—did not merely faint or swoon (as some crit-
      ics and skeptics have suggested)—and thus makes the resurrection a
      glorious miracle. Only in the context of His death can we understand
      the importance of His resurrection.

Read the following texts.What common point are they all emphasiz-
      ing, and is that important to our faith? Lev. 17:11, Matt. 26:28,
      John 19:40, Rom. 5:6-8, 6:4, 1 Cor. 5:7.


        The Bible is clear: Christ died for our sins, and His death is a cru-
      cial component for the plan of salvation. Without it, there would be
      no atonement, no redemption, no eternal life for those who, other-
      wise, would be forever lost. That’s how crucial His death is to us and
      to our hope for the future. It’s His death that helps guarantee the final
      annulment of ours.


                                                                          105

      He Is Risen! (Mark 16:1-11).
Who were the first people to be told that Jesus had risen from the dead?
      What effect did the empty tomb have on them? (Mark 16:1-8).


         In Jesus’ time women had a lower status in society, but not before
      God. Mark singles out the women who ministered to Jesus, first in
      Galilee and then in Jerusalem. They stood looking on the cross as He
      died; they were not ashamed to be identified with Him (Mark 15:40,
      41). Some of these women bought spices to anoint His body and came
      early on Sunday morning to the tomb for this purpose. These devoted
      followers became the first to hear the incredible news that Jesus had
      risen from the dead.
         For many scholars the fact that women were the first to see Jesus
      helps affirm the authenticity of the accounts. If they wanted to make
      up the story, why have not some powerful religious or political leader
      in Palestine, as opposed to a few “lowly” and “unimportant” women
      of no real social class, first taken notice of the empty tomb? Would
      not that have been a more powerful way of making their point?
         Note, too, how the effect on the women of the news of the resur-
      rection of Jesus corresponded with the impression made by Jesus
      throughout the Gospel of Mark. Over and over we have seen how
      people were amazed at His miracles and teaching. Now came the
      crowning miracle, the supreme proof that He was what He claimed to
      be. Although the women did not yet understand fully, the sight of the
      empty tomb filled them with wonderment.

To whom did the risen Lord first appear? Again, how does this help
      affirm the authenticity of their accounts of Jesus? (Mark 16:9-11,
      John 20:1-18).


        As women were the first to be informed of the Resurrection, so it
      was to a woman that Jesus first appeared. And what a woman!
      According to the views of many people, her past excluded her from
      polite company. But she who had been forgiven much loved much;
      thus it is not surprising that Mary Magdalene was first at the tomb
      that Sunday morning. And to her, Jesus chose to reveal Himself.

       We are all, to some degree, impacted by the social prejudices
       against certain people. Which ones poison your soul? From what
       you’ve seen today (women of no great class being the first ones
       privileged with the news of a risen Savior), how do you think
       God views those prejudices, and what can you do through God’s
       grace to be purged of this unholy and un-Christian attitude?

106
               T U E S DAY June 21

     Appearances of the Risen Lord (Mark 16:12-18).
       Jesus appeared not only to people who feature prominently in the
     Gospel account but also to some about whom we would know noth-
     ing had He not chosen to reveal Himself to them. In this regard we see
     another instance of Jesus’interest in all His disciples, whether or not
     they were leaders or well known.

To whom did Jesus appear as they were walking along the road?
     (Mark 16:12, 13). Study the extended story in Luke 24:13-32.
     What lessons can you learn from it?


To whom else did Jesus reveal Himself as the risen Lord? (Matt.
     28:16, 17; Mark 16:14; Luke 24:33-49; John 20:19-29; 21:1-3; 1 Cor.
     15:4-8).


        Each Gospel writer supplies information about the appearances of
     the risen Christ that the others do not. The four accounts, however,
     confirm that Jesus truly rose from the dead. Differences in some
     details are minor and consistent with what might be expected from
     eyewitness accounts. While we probably cannot be sure as to the exact
     order of events, we may be confident of the following list of appear-
     ances of the risen Lord:
        1. To Mary Magdalene (Mark 16:9, John 20:15-17).
        2. To the other women after they had left the tomb (Matt. 28:9, 10).
        3. To Peter prior to the walk to Emmaus (Luke 24:34, 1 Cor. 15:5).
        4. To two disciples on the way to Emmaus (Mark 16:12, Luke
     24:13-32).
        5. To the disciples in the upper room (Mark 16:14, John 20:19-24.
     But Thomas was not present.
        Additional appearances after the Resurrection day:
        6. To the eleven, Thomas being present, in the upper room a week
     later (John 20:26-29).
        7. To seven of the disciples as they were fishing on Lake Galilee
     (John 21:1-3).
        8. To about f ive hundred (1 Cor. 15:6).
        9. To James (1 Cor. 15:7).
        10. To the eleven immediately prior to the Ascension (Mark 16:19,
     20; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:4-12).

      Notice the variety of the appearances of Jesus. What does this sug-
      gest about the certainty of His resurrection? What does this tell us
      about the evidence God has given to us for belief? How do these
      accounts help strengthen your faith in the whole plan of Salvation?

                                                                       107
          W E D N E S DAY June 22

      The Crowning Miracle
What was the earliest attempt to refute the Resurrection? (Matt. 28:11-
      15). What answer would you give to those who bring it up today?


        As we studied in last week’s lesson, the religious leaders took steps
      to see that Jesus’ disciples would not be able to steal the body. With
      Pilate’s permission they sealed the tomb and posted a guard (Matt.
      27:62-66).

How did this attempt to prevent the Resurrection only strengthen the
      evidence for it?


        During the course of the centuries, other “explanations” have been
      advanced to explain the empty tomb, such as (1) Jesus did not die on
      the cross; He merely swooned and later revived in the coolness of the
      tomb; and (2) His “appearances” to the disciples did not actually hap-
      pen—the disciples longed so badly for Him to rise again that they
      imagined they saw Him risen from the dead. This psychological expla-
      nation is a “wish-fulfillment” theory, because it argues that the disci-
      ples’wish led to fulfillment of their hopes.

What evidence of Scripture disproves the theory that Jesus did not
      really die? (John 19:31-35). How might you defend the
      Resurrection with someone who argues that the disciples only
      imagined that He came back to life? (Acts 1:3, 4).


         The Gospel accounts of the Resurrection repeatedly emphasize that
      the disciples’frame of mind was just the opposite of that demanded by
      the “wish-fulfillment” theory. Jesus’ followers did not expect Him to
      rise again, and they did not believe those who brought reports of His
      resurrection (see Matt. 28:17; Mark 16:11, 13; Luke 24:11; John
      20:24-29).
         Two great facts help refute all attempts to explain away the resurrec-
      tion of Jesus. First, the body of Jesus disappeared; something happened
      to it, despite the tomb’s being sealed and a guard in place. The easiest
      way for Jesus’ enemies to debunk the new religion would have been to
      point to Jesus’ corpse—but they could not. Second, after Calvary, the
      disciples were broken and dispirited. After His resurrection, they were
      filled with confidence and power and went out in the name of Jesus.
      What made the difference? They had seen the risen Lord.

       Why is Christ’s resurrection so important to you?

     The Commission (Mark 16:15-20).
       We have been referring to the “appearances” of the risen Lord, but
     that term is inadequate to describe what happened. Jesus not only was
     seen, He spoke, answered questions, even ate with the disciples.
     These were meetings with His followers rather than appearances.

Over how long a period did these meetings of the resurrected Jesus
     and His followers take place? (Acts 1:3).
       Think about how long that time is. How did this time help
     strengthen them for their mission?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        According to Mark (16:14), even after the Resurrection Jesus had
     to “upbraid” them for their unbelief and hardness of heart toward
     those who had first reported His resurrection. The Greek verb means
     more literally “to reproach” or “to disparage”; that is, He had to speak
     firmly to them for their doubts. How little humanity has changed!
     Probably every one of us could give accounts of how God has worked
     marvelously in our lives, only to have us a short time later manifest-
     ing “unbelief and hardness of heart.”

According to Mark, what commission did Jesus give to His disci-
     ples? How does that commission parallel what we as Adventists
     believe is our commission? See Rev. 14:6.


        The last two verses of the book of Mark present an interesting con-
     trast. Jesus has now ascended to the Father in heaven, sitting down at
     the “right hand of God,” a phrase that means His position of author-
     ity. And yet, at the same time, the texts talk about “the Lord” working
     with His church, “confirming the word with signs and wonders.” In
     other words, though up in heaven, through His power and authority
     Jesus is still close to His church, close to His people, giving them
     what they need, to do what He asks of them. Those words should have
     been a comfort to the early church, just as they should be to us now.

      Notice the phrase “confirming the word.” How has God con-
      firmed “the word” in your own life and experience? Share with
      the class how He has done that for you. It would be interesting
      to compare accounts. What can you learn from one another’s
      experiences?

Further Study: Study again Mark 15:42–16:20, along with the par-
      allel accounts in Matthew 27:57–28:20, Luke 23:50–24:52, and John
      19:38–21:25. Read Ellen G. White’s “In Joseph’s Tomb”; “The Lord Is
      Risen”; “Why Weepest Thou?”; “The Walk to Emmaus”; “Peace Be
      Unto You”; “By the Sea Once More”; “Go Teach All Nations”; and “To
      My Father and Your Father”; in The Desire of Ages, pp. 769–835.

Discussion Questions:
       ●
       1 We’re given a great deal of evidence for the resurrection of
       Jesus, evidence that should strengthen our faith.What other evi-
       dence have we been given that helps “prove” the truth of
       Christianity? How much evidence do we ultimately need? If we
       have evidence, why then the need for faith? Discuss in class.

       ●
       2 Christianity would seem to have a most unpromising founda-
       tion for a world religion—a founder who died young and whose
       work was rejected by much of the prevailing religious establish-
       ment.Nevertheless,it is the world’s greatest religion, and Jesus is
       the most influential Person who has ever lived.Why?

       ●
       3 Mark 16:19 talks about Jesus up in heaven.What other verses
       talk about Him there? What do they tell us that He’s doing in
       heaven, now that His earthly work is over?

       ●
       4 How well is your church fulfilling the commission that Jesus
       gave at the end of Mark? What can you do, personally, or as a
       church, to be more involved in this divine commission?

Summary: What a close to this fast-moving, action-packed account.
      The greatest miracle, the most incredible act comes at the end of the
      story. His enemies crucify Jesus, and He is buried, but He comes back
      to life. As the risen Lord, He has all power and all authority, over all
      the earth, to the end of the age. And we, His followers, carry on His
      work as we eagerly await His return.

Finding God in the Qur’an
J. H. Zachary
   Amin picked up his Bible and his Qur’an and went to visit an Adventist
pastor. “Pastor, I have spent a lot of time studying these two books. After
reading a Protestant pamphlet describing the salvation that comes to sin-
ners through Jesus’death on the cross, I took a series of Bible studies and
was baptized.”
   “The more I have compared the Bible and the Qur’an the more discour-
aged I have become. The Bible clearly teaches about clean foods and the
seventh-day Sabbath. My church friends worship on Sunday and eat pork.”
   “Why did you come to me?” the pastor asked.
   “A friend told me that I should go to the Adventist church if I wanted to
find someone who follows the Bible’s teachings.”
   Amin told the pastor how his family and neighbors forsook him after he
became a Christian. His family disowned him, took away his portion of the
family land, and cut him off from sources of cash. Now he wondered
whether he had done the right thing to become a Christian.
   The pastor spoke with Amin at length about God’s plan of salvation,
God’s laws, and the grace of Jesus that saves sinners. Amin began study-
ing the Bible with the pastor. For a year they met together and discussed
what the Bible really said. Then one day Amin told the pastor that he was
convinced that Adventist Christians follow God’s teachings. He asked the
pastor to rebaptize him, this time into the Adventist Church.
   Amin shared the good news of salvation with others. “I now understand
how anyone can know that God has forgiven him, how we can know we
are saved. Because of Jesus, I know I am ready to meet Jesus in the final
judgment. Jesus is my Savior, my Lord, and my Judge. He has given me
assurance that I am accepted into His family and one day will live with
Him in heaven,” he testified.
   Village friends who once rejected Amin now listened to his enthusiastic
testimony. Amin showed them basic truths about God from the Bible and
the Qur’an. Before long Amin had organized a small group of believers.
He taught them how to share the good news about forgiveness and salva-
tion through Jesus, and the Sabbath. Today a group of 50 believers meets
in Amin’s village.

J. H. Zachary is a coordinator for outreach among the Muslim and Jewish populations in
North America. Amin continues to witness in an unnamed country in the Middle East.
