                             Divine Surprises



      A
                farmer every morning went out to feed his chicken. Each
                morning, when it saw the farmer approach, the bird got ready
                for breakfast. This scenario happened over and over until,
      one morning, the farmer arrived and, instead of feeding the fowl,
      wrung its neck.
          The point is this: The past is no guarantor of the future. Though
      things that have happened before, even regularly, can and often do
      happen again, they don't, automatically, have 10. The unexpected
      does arise and often when least expected (which is part of what
      makes it unexpected).
          This concept was hard for many seventeenth- and eighteenth-
      century Europeans to grasp. The tremendous advances in science,
      particularly through the seminal work of Isaac Newton, led many to
      believe that all of nature works through cold, uncaring, and unvary-
      ing laws. Once these laws were understood, it was conceivable (if
      enough other information were given) that a person could know
      everything that would happen in the future because everything—
      from what the king would want for dessert on New Year's Eve to the
      number of hailstones in the next hailstorm over Paris—could be
      predicted with unerring accuracy.
          By the early twentieth century, however, scientists like Niels
      Bohr, Max Planck, and Erwin Schrodinger—with their discoveries in
      quantum physics—brought these deterministic assumptions into great
      question. According to quantum theory, reality at its most fundamen-
      tal level reveals itself in a transitory, elusive, even statistical, man-
      ner, so that we can know only the probability of events, nothing
      more. Gone, now, was the clockwork universe of the previous few
      centuries. Einstein, responding incredulously to quantum uncertainty,
      once said, "I shall never believe that God plays dice with the world."
         No, God doesn't. But He can be full of surprises, and some of His
      most unexpected ones appear in the topic for this quarter—the book
      of Jonah, which on the surface seems filled with the uncertainty and
      surprise of the quantum realm, though, in fact, it is based on a
      certitude more solid and constant than the physics of seventeenth-
      and eighteenth-century Europe.
          First, there's Jonah, a prophet who refuses to accept his call—
      hardly the usual biblical paradigm, to be sure. Though a Daniel he
      isn't, a prophet he, nevertheless, is: "He restored the coast of Israel
      from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to
      the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his
      servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher"
      (2 Kings 14:25, emphasis supplied). This is the same Jonah, son of
      Amittai (hard as it, at times, might be to believe), whom we'll be
      following for the next few months.
         Next, this prophet flees from the Lord in a boat (A prophet fleeing
      the Lord?), only to have the Lord send a storm that threatens to sink
      2
                                                                   INTRODUCTI




the vessel. Amid the storm, it's the pagans, not the Hebrew, who pray
for deliverance (another surprise), and Jonah is thrown overboard,
only to get swallowed alive by a big fish that holds him in its stomach
for three days before spewing him out, alive, on the land.
    Jonah, finally, after all this prodding, delivers the message of
warning to the Ninevites, who en masse repent from their evil ways,
sparing themselves divine condemnation (a rather surprising turn of
events, as well). But the greatest surprise comes next, because Jonah
becomes saddened, even angry, over their repentance. A prophet
angry over those who repent and turn away from sin? (As said
before, this book is full of surprises.)
    Yet, the most important point of Jonah isn't found in the surprises
that spill out of its 48 verses but in the one thing that's constant all
the way through those verses, and that is, God's incredible grace
toward wayward, erring people, even wayward, erring prophets like
Jonah. If the Lord would continue to work with someone who squan-
dered privileges and ignored light, then there's hope for us,
we who surely have done as badly as this weak-willed, spiritual
pipsqueak of a prophet who should have known better than to do
what he did, even though he did it just the same. Of course, grace is
 the most gracious when bestowed upon those who know better but do
wrong anyway (Who among us can't relate?).
     The focus of Jonah, then, really isn't on the "great fish" that
 swallowed Jonah alive but on "the great God" who prepared that fish.
 The great God who never manifested His greatness more than when
 He was the most "helpless"; that is, when in the person of His Son He
 was nailed to the cross, His life crushed out for the sins of those who
 don't know better and even, maybe especially, of those who do. In
 one sense, it hardly matters which, because we're all spiritual charity
 cases, taking where we don't give, receiving what we don't deserve,
 and getting what we don't earn . . . like Jonah.
     Many thanks to this quarter's able author, Dr. JoAnn Davidson,
 assistant professor of theology, in the Department of Theology and
 Christian Philosophy, at the Andrews University Seminary. Her
 love for the book of Jonah, and especially for the God revealed in
 that book, is apparent all through this Bible Study Guide.
     Challenging, baffling, even occasionally disturbing, the book of
  Jonah, with all its surprises—maybe even through those surprises—
  reveals one truth that never changes: God's love, for even the most
  unlovable, which, at times, is all of us.

    Biblical Prophets, Modern
              Critics




Sabbath Afternoon

       OME GUY GETS SWALLOWED by a big fish, spends three

S     days and nights in its belly, and then is cast alive on the shore!
      We're supposed to believe this?
   Of course we are. After all, the story of Jonah is included in the
Bible, and if the Bible is the Word of God, then Jonah is part of that
Word too. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness" (2 Tim. 3:16). This includes the book of Jonah and
the account of the reluctant prophet who becomes fish bait.
    Some scholars seek to dismiss Jonah, and the book bearing his
name, as a myth, a parable, a nice story that expresses a theological
point, nothing more. They couldn't be more wrong. The book of Jonah
was placed in the canon, and—as we'll see this quarter—with good
reasons too. This week we'll take a look at some facts about Jonah
that, purely from a scholarly perspective, show he was a historical
figure who did an important work for the Lord.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: How is the book of Jonah intro-
duced? Why were Jonah's experiences central to the book? Why
do some scholars dismiss the authenticity of Jonah? How has the
modern worldview impacted our Christian faith? Should the su-
pernatural occurrences included with a prophet's life surprise us?

    MEMORY TEXT: " 'Surely the Lord God does nothing, unless He
    reveals His secret to His servants the prophets' " (Amos 3:7, NKJV).

PROPHETIC AUTOBIOGRAPHIES.



T
      he Bible is composed, basically, of prophets and their mes-
      sages. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel are "major" prophets;
      Jonah is one of twelve "minor" ones.
   "Major" or "minor," the prophets all exhibit some similar features.
Like other prophetic books, Jonah includes both a prophet and his
message. However, most prophetic books are composed chiefly of the
sacred messages from God delivered by the prophets. Though varying
from book to book, generally just a slight amount of biographical
material is included. In most cases, the focus is on the message, not
the messenger. In contrast, most of the book of Jonah deals with him,
personally, while the message itself consists of less than ten words.
Yet, as we'll see, the story of Jonah, and his exploits, is, in many
ways, the message itself.

  Read Jonah 3:4. What is the essence of Jonah's message to
Nineveh?


   Though not a lot of words, they're packed with what's essentially
the message found all through the Bible, and that is consistent with
other prophets, as well—prophets whose lives and ministries are not
questioned for their historicity.

  Skim through some of the "minor" prophets: Micah, Nahum,
Zephaniah, Obadiah. What information do you learn about the
prophets themselves?




   It's clear from reading these other prophets that only a tiny bit of
information is given about them or their exploits. We learn their
names, where they are from, who their fathers are, but not much else.
In contrast, though we don't know much about Jonah's background,
his experiences themselves play a central role. This is the exception
with the minor prophets, rather than the rule.

     As the lesson stated, little emphasis is usually placed on the
 life of the prophet as opposed to the message the prophet bears.
 Why do you think that is so, and what point should that make
 for those of us who often tend to focus too much on people
 themselves as opposed to the Lord? See Pss. 118:9; 146:3.

                                                                       7

"AND THE WORD OF THE LORD . . ."



T
       he book of Jonah begins, in the Hebrew, with a phrase that is
       often translated "And it came to pass." This same phrase
       appears in these texts: Joshua 1:1; Judges 1:1; Ruth 1:1; 2 Samuel
1:1; Esther 1:1; and Ezekiel 1:1.
   Different translations of this Hebrew expression may not always
reveal the use of this specific phrase (such as the King James Version,
with Jonah, which simply uses the word now), but the identical phrase
is used throughout the Old Testament to begin historical narratives.
The phrase itself indicates both a continuity with what has already
happened and the factual nature of the account that follows. In other
words, nothing about that particular Hebrew phrase indicates, in any
way, that the author means to express anything other than factual
history.

  What other specific phrase does the book of Jonah open with?
Jon. 1:1.


   It's not the only time that phrase is used in a prophet's ministry. "The
word of the Lord came to him [Elijah], saying 'Arise, go to Zarephath' "
(1 Kings 17:8, 9, NKJV, emphasis supplied). "Then the word of the
Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 'Arise, go down to meet Ahab
king of Israel' " (1 Kings 21:17, 18, NKJV, emphasis supplied). "The
word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 'Arise, go to
Nineveh' " (Jon. 1:1, 2, NKJV, emphasis supplied).
   Notice how this introductory phrase or "formula" is identical in the
calling of other prophets: Jeremiah 1:4; 2:1; Ezekiel 1:3; Joel 1:1;
Micah 1:1; Zephaniah 1:1; Haggai 1:1; and Zechariah 1:1.
    This phrase alerts the reader to the biblical record of God calling a
prophet in the Old Testament. In fact, to receive the "word of the
Lord" was a mark of a true prophet. It also authenticates that the
spoken message does not originate with the prophet but comes from
God Himself. In Jonah's case, the text states that it is "the word of the
Lord" that comes to Jonah. This is a holy introduction. It should
remind us each time we encounter it in Scripture that we need to bow
before the God of heaven, with a prayer for the Holy Spirit to bless us,
as we study such sacred words. It should also fill us with awe that the
God of heaven still communicates with sinful humans.

    Describe what you understand the phrase "and the word of
 the Lord came" to mean. How do you understand that in rela-
 tion to John 1:1-10? Can "the word of the Lord" come to only
 prophets? In what ways can we receive "the word of the Lord"?

MORE HISTORICAL POINTERS.

  Skim over the following texts. What is happening here that
parallels the story of Jonah? Who is the Lord warning here?

  Isa. 13:1

  Jer. 25:20-27

   Ezek. 21:28-32

    n these cases, and others, the Lord is specifically trying to reach

/   Gentile nations with warnings about what their sin and iniquity
    will bring. The book of Jonah, which is also focused on a non-
Israelite nation, is, in this sense, no different from some of the other
messages in the Bible that do the same thing. Thus, whatever else it is,
the book of Jonah has a crucial message about God's grace, extending
beyond the borders of ancient Israel and Judah. This is, contrary to the
arguments of some critics, more evidence for its authenticity.


   Look at the following texts: Matthew 12:39-41 and Luke 11:29-
32. Who is speaking, what is being said, and what do these words
tell us about the historicity of Jonah?




   Look at how the Lord not only speaks of the reality of Jonah and of
his experience in the "whale's belly" (the Hebrew reads, "big fish")
but how closely He ties His own mission to the experience of Jonah.
Certainly, as far as Jesus is concerned, there is no question regarding
the historicity of Jonah.

    There are many who profess to be Christians yet who dismiss
 some stories in the Bible, such as Jonah, as nonhistorical. What
 are the implications of that kind of thinking? For example, as we
 just saw, Jesus clearly believes in the story of Jonah. Those who
 don't believe that story must, then, dismiss the words of Jesus.
 And if we can't trust what Jesus says here, why trust Him in
 another place? And if we can't trust the words of Jesus, then
 what in the Bible can we trust? What other dangers can you see
 from this notion of picking and choosing which parts of the
 Bible we accept or reject as historical?

                                                                       9

THE MIRACLES IN JONAH.



M
           odern critics tend to dismiss the historicity of the book of
           Jonah, especially because of the miraculous happenings
           found there.

  Do a quick read through the story of Jonah and write down the
supernatural things that happened there.




   It is important to notice that the miraculous events in the book of
Jonah are referred to always very briefly and in a low-key manner.
They are not the great focus of the story. The "great fish" is mentioned
in only three verses. The supernatural events are referred to as though
one should not be surprised at all with God's power in the natural
world.

   A man swallowed alive by a big fish only to be spat out alive
three days later however miraculous, isn't the only miraculous
story in the Bible. Look up these texts and the stories surrounding
them. What miracles do they depict?

     Gen. 21:2

     Exod. 13:21, 22

     Dan. 5:5, 24-29

     Matt. 1:20

     Mark 6:44

   How can these accounts be explained other than by the super-
natural intervention of God? Thus, how foolhardy to dismiss
any part of the Bible because of supernatural acts that go be-
yond what our basic logic, reason, and science tell us. If any-
thing, these stories should show us just how limited our science,
our logic, and our reason can be when it comes to the things of
God.

THE MIRACLES IN JONAH (CONTINUED).



A
         mong ancient Jewish writers, the authenticity of Jonah was
         not questioned. Even Josephus, the Jewish historian who lived
         around the time of Jesus, viewed Jonah as historical and incor-
porated the story into his history of the Jewish people. The historicity
of Jonah is further established by the fact that it's flanked by two
unquestioned prophetic books. Also, it has always been included in
the minor prophets. The fact that many generations of earlier biblical
scholars were convinced that the author of Jonah was not writing
fiction is impressive.

   It has been only relatively recently that the historical accuracy
of the book has been questioned. Why do you think that is so?
What is it about the modern era and the success of science that
would cause people to question the story of Jonah?


   Years ago, Thomas Jefferson decided to edit the Gospels. In them
he expunged from the texts anything he believed went contrary to
reason, common sense, and rational thought. The result was the Jefferson
Bible, a version of the Gospels in which the virgin birth, the miracu-
lous healings, the raising of the dead, Christ's claims to divinity, the
Resurrection, and Christ's ascension to heaven were—among other
things—edited out. According to Jefferson, these things could not be
true. Why? Because, in his thinking, they went against common sense
and reason.

   What does the story of the Jefferson Bible tell us about the
limits of logic and reason in attempting to understand the ways of
God? How does the answer help us respond to modern attacks on
the authenticity of the story of Jonah?


    How do these following texts help us understand that Jefferson's
 problems were the same problems many modern critics of the
 Bible have, as well? Job 11:7; 1 Cor. 1:21; 2:14; 3:19; Heb. 10:38.
 Most important, how can the points brought out in these texts
 help protect us from the kind of skepticism so common today?

FURTHER STUDY:



R
        ead 2 Kings 14:23-25. This reference provides the informa-
        tion that Jonah ministered God's Word to King Jeroboam II of
        Israel (782/781-753 B.c.). During the reigns of his immediate
predecessors, the Aramean states headed by Damascus had made
savage attacks on Israel, inflicting terrible suffering on the population
(2 Kings 13:3-5; Amos 1:3). Jehoash (798-782/781 B.c.) succeeded in
recovering the cities of Israel (2 Kings 13:25), and Jonah predicted
that Jeroboam would restore Israel's borders to their Davidic limits.
   The prediction was fulfilled (2 Kings 14:25-27). Israel prospered
once more but not for long. Both Hosea and Amos severely rebuked
the northern kingdom as early as Jeroboam's reign (Hos. 1:1; Amos
1:1). But whereas Amos was a southerner from Tekoa, not far from
Bethlehem, Jonah was a northerner. It would not be surprising to learn
his family suffered during the Syrian incursions into Israel. This might
explain some of his intense antagonism toward Nineveh of Assyria, an
even more menacing country at the time than Syria.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think about what would happen to Christianity if, indeed,
     Jefferson's Bible provided the most accurate historical ac-
     count of the Gospels. What then would we be left with?
     What hope would we have? What are the implications of
     the thinking that would limit the Bible—any part of the
     Bible—to the confines of modern science and reason? Why
     have so many people who have gone down this road ulti-
     mately abandoned their faith entirely?

     2. Look again at these texts: Job 11:7; 1 Cor. 1:21; 2:14; 3:19;
        and Heb. 10:38. Are they saying that worldly wisdom or
        reason or science is bad or that they cannot of themselves
        lead us to the things we really need to know? See John 17:3.

SUMMARY: God had a good reason for putting Jonah in the Bible.
And with the book, He shows us that He is more than willing to do the
unexpected in order to fulfill His purposes for us.

                      The Tenacious Sister
                             John Ash HI

    When Lin,* a 39-year-old Chinese woman from Inner Mongolia,
became a Christian three years ago, she began inviting people to her
home to study the Bible and worship. Within a short time, many of
her neighbors had joined her worship group.
    The Chinese officials and religious authorities began watching
Lin's activities. As attendance at her weekly meetings climbed to
nearly 100 people, the authorities ordered her to disband the group.
She refused, so the police began intimidating those who attended the
meetings. "If you keep going to these meetings, we'll throw you in
jail!" they warned. The threats worked, and the attendance at the
house-church meetings dropped to about 40. But additional intimida-
tion had little influence on the remaining believers.
    The authorities decided to jail Lin. But publicly arresting her was
not so easy. So they persuaded her to come to the police station to fill
out some paperwork. Once she was at the police station, she was
arrested and jailed without filing charges or going through the proper
channels.
     The authorities made it difficult for her husband to visit her, and
she was not allowed to have a Bible or any other religious material.
But her husband wrote Bible texts on a blanket and sent it to her. The
officer who delivered the blanket to her had no idea what it contained.
     While in jail, Lin made friends with other prisoners. As the months
passed and their relationships deepened, she began sharing her faith.
Soon a large number of the prisoners accepted Jesus as their personal
Savior and changed their disruptive behavior.
     The authorities had planned to keep Lin in prison for a year, but six
 months after her arrest she was released. She asked the officer in
charge why she was being released halfway through her sentence, and
 he admitted that if she had stayed in the jail any longer, all the
 prisoners would be converted to Christianity.
     Soon after her release the group of believers was meeting in her
 home again, and on any given Sabbath at least 50 people attend. The
 government officials have not changed their stance toward house
 churches and small groups, but they have learned by experience that
 jailing Lin will not stop her, for even in prison she will share her love
 for God with others.

Sabbath Afternoon

         NE OF THE GREAT TRUTHS of the Christian faith isn't

0       just the teaching that God exists but that He is a personal
        God, a God who is intimately involved with His creation.
What Christianity doesn't teach is that we have been created and then
left on our own to do the best we can with what we have been given.
On the contrary, the clear, explicit testimony of Scripture, from Eden
onward, is that our God and our Creator is also our Provider and
Sustainer. God knows about each of us and about our personal situa-
tions. He cares about us, as well. This great truth has been best
revealed in the life and ministry of Jesus, in which the Lord became
one of us in order to bond with us, now and for eternity. This week,
we'll see how the first verses of Jonah give another example of God's
knowledge of individuals and the places where they live. In a subtle
way, these verses tell us something of God's love for humanity.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: How does God reveal His concern for
people? How does the Bible show us God's intimate knowledge of
us? How did Jesus reveal the fact that God knows so much about us?
How does the book of Jonah instruct us about this aspect of God's
amazing grace? Why did God send Jonah to Nineveh? Which of
Nineveh's sins spurred Jonah's prophetic call?

     MEMORY TEXT: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee;
     and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I
     ordained thee a prophet unto the nations" (Jeremiah 1:5).

THE PERSONAL TOUCH.

   "Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
their wickedness is come up before me" (Jon. 1:1, 2).



T
       hink about the implications of the words. God, the Creator of
       the universe, the One who sustains the cosmos, is now in
       communication with a single human being, a mere speck on a
planet that itself is a mere speck in an entire galaxy that is a mere
speck itself, as well.
    The universe, at least what we know about it now, extends more
than 20 billion light-years across. This means that, traveling at the
speed of light (186,000 miles, or 300,000 kilometers, per second), it
would take 20 billion years to go from one end to the other. The God
who created this immense cosmos, who stands above and beyond it,
and who upholds it by His power, nevertheless, now contacts a single
person, giving him a message to deliver to other human beings.
   Perhaps, you think that you aren't important or that nobody cares
about you. But here in the book of Jonah (and all through Scripture,
actually), we see a picture of God that is amazing, for it reveals a God
who not only knows about us but cares about us, as well, a God who
has stretched across the vast expanse of the cosmos to touch each of
our lives.

  Read Psalm 104. How does this passage illustrate God's provi-
dence and power in the world and in our lives? What comfort can one
derive from this psalm? What is the essential message of the psalm?


   This psalm is an extended picture of God's personal involvement in
His creation. Notice how its verses follow the basic order of the Genesis
Creation account (see Genesis 1 and 2); notice, however, in the psalm
how, the verbs connected with God's power shift to the present tense
(vss. 6-10). Thus, God is seen here in His ever-continuing roles as both
Sustainer and Provider of His creation. According to the consistent
testimony of Scripture, God did not create this world and then depart to
a distant realm, leaving it to operate solely by the natural laws He
established. Rather, Scripture portrays a God who remains vitally in-
volved, not only in nature but also in the lives of His creatures.

    Read Psalm 104:35. What is the author saying here? In other
 words, after talking about God's creative and sustaining power,
 he introduces another facet of God's activity. What is that, and
 what comfort can we draw from it? Or does it scare us?

                                                                      15

THE HAIR ON OUR HEADS (Matt. 10:30).



T
       he book of Jonah helps show us that God, though invisible to
       us, is intimate with His creation. Moreover, His knowledge of
       us, His human creatures, is personal and inclusive. God knows
details about us that we wouldn't even consider important to know
about other people.

   How does Matthew 10:30 illustrate God's personal involve-
ment in our lives? What is Jesus saying with those words? Does
the thought of God knowing so much about you make you com-
fortable or fearful? What reasons do you have for whatever an-
swer you give?


   In this context, that of God's knowledge regarding each of us,
look at Psalm 139:1-18. After reading and praying over it, answer
the following questions: What are the parallel thoughts between
these texts and the texts we saw in Psalm 104? What differences
are there? Together, what are both telling us about God? Accord-
ing to these texts, when did God's knowledge of us begin? What
does that mean? What are the specific things about us the psalmist
says the Lord knows? How should the realization that God knows
these things impact how we live? What do you think the phrase "0
Lord, thou hast searched me" means? What moral implication
can you find in that text?


    It's one thing for God to know all about us—about where we go,
what we say, think, and do. That, in and of itself, might not be
necessarily good news. In fact, it quite easily could be bad news; that
is, if this all-knowing God had malevolent designs on us. In this case,
though, the psalmist is so clear. In the midst of all these verses about
God's omniscience, His total power over us, the psalmist writes:
"How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, 0 God! how great is the
sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the
sand" (Ps. 139:17, 18).
    Thus, the crucial thing to remember as we study about God's power
and knowledge, as presented in Jonah, is that this God is a God of love
and that He has our best interests at heart. How important that we
never lose sight of this crucial point.

    Dwell upon some of the specific manifestations of God's love
 that you have experienced in your own life. Write them down,
 pray over them, and (if comfortable) share them with others.

"HEY, YOU!"



A
       11 through the Bible, we are given examples of God's intimate
        knowledge of people, whether heathen or faithful. Time and
        again we see that God knows things about individuals that,
perhaps, they don't even know about themselves.

    Read 1 Samuel 16:1-3. What is happening here, and what does
it teach us about God's knowledge of what's inside us?


   In Luke 19:1-10, Jesus is traveling through Jericho and is sur-
rounded by a crowd. Yet, He pauses at a sycamore tree and notices a
man sitting in the branches. Jesus doesn't just say "Hey, you, up there
in the tree." Instead, He called to the man by name: "Zacchaeus, I
want to go to your house today" (see Luke 19:5). In other words, Jesus
knew the man by name.
   Ellen White, in The Desire of Ages, reveals that Zacchaeus, how-
ever abhorrent his life on the outside, was open to the influence of the
Holy Spirit, which had already been working on him. Jesus, of course,
knew all this about him beforehand and used this opportunity to
minster to Zacchaeus in a big way. See Luke 19:9.

   Read John 4:4-19. How do you see the same principle revealed
there? What intimate, secret knowledge does Jesus know about the
woman of Samaria, and how does He use it for her eternal good?


   God's involvement in human lives is not limited to merely His
covenant people. In Isaiah 44:28 and 45:1, even a non-Israelite ruler is
divinely predicted by name.
   Involvement with humanity is a notable attribute of God in Scrip-
ture. It gives us a crucial insight into the attitude God has toward
human beings. When God summons people, He doesn't just say "Hey,
you." Rather, He comes to them with intimate knowledge of who they
are, what's inside them, and what their circumstances happen to be. In
the case of Jonah, God knows him as an individual, not just some
obscure face in the sea of humanity.

    If you look at many of the texts for today, you can see that not
 only does God have intimate knowledge about each of us but He
 uses that knowledge for our benefit. God meets us where we are.
 If someone, then, were to ask you the question, "How can I
 surrender to Him so that He can take me from where I am to
 where He wants me to be?" how would you answer?

                                                                      17

PEOPLE AND PLACES.

         od knows not only people but places, as well. This makes

G        sense, because the people whom God loves, and whom He
         died for, live in places; and often, their particular situations are
directly linked to the places in which they live. Thus, God knows
cities by name but, more important, He knows what's happening in
them. His concern, of course, isn't for the inanimate buildings or the
streets or the rocks but for those who have made their homes and lives
among them.

  What do the following texts indicate about God's familiarity
with this world? Gen. 11:1-9; 18:20; Luke 19:41-44.


   Let's look at Luke 19:41-44. We can see that God loves Jerusalem,
even though Jerusalem rejects Him. He expresses that love with His
tears as He stands over the city and weeps, for He knows of its terrible
future at the hands of Rome.

   However prominent Jerusalem and the Hebrew nation are in
the Old Testament times, after the death of Jesus, the geographical
center of God's plan for humankind's salvation shifts away from
one specific geographical locality. Why is that so? See Matt. 21:43;
24:14; Gal. 3:28.


   Cities, towns, and other places all over the ancient world become
prominent in the New Testament biblical narrative. The letters to the
seven churches that open the book of Revelation are linked to seven
different cities (Rev. 1:4-3:22). All Paul's great missionary journeys
are linked to different cities (Acts 17:1-4; 16-34; 18:1-11). Many of
Paul's letters, which make up so much of the New Testament, are
directly tied to prominent cities and territories (Gal. 1:1, 2; Eph. 1:1, 2;
Phil. 1:1). Thus, we should not be surprised with the mention of a city in
Jonah's prophetic call. The book of Jonah opens with God's appoint-
ment of a person named Jonah, who is given the divine command to go
to a specific place, Nineveh, an ancient and populous city on the fertile
banks of the Tigris. This is a city founded by Nimrod, who went forth
from the land of Shinar about the time of Babel's dispersion.

    No question, God knew all about each of those places men-
 tioned in the Bible. Was He involved in what happened in and to
 them? If so, how did He express His involvement? How can you
 see God's involvement in the locality where you live?

NINEVEH—THAT GREAT CITY.

  What is the first scriptural mention of Nineveh? Gen. 10:11.




A
          rchaeologists have excavated the outline of the walls of an-
         cient Nineveh. The chief palace in existence when Jonah was
         sent to Nineveh (eighth century B.C.) was probably that of
Ashurnasirpal, a king whose name means "the god Assur is guardian
of the heir." The buildings alone occupied six acres.
   Ancient documents from the first century B.C. describe Nineveh as
a quadrangle, measuring a 150 x 90 stadia, with a total perimeter of
480 stadia, or about 60 miles. This agrees favorably with the record of
Nineveh in the book of Jonah as a "city of three days' journey" (Jon.
3:3).
    In view of Jonah's experience, it is interesting to note that the
Hebrew "Nineweh" is a translation of the Assyrian "Ninua." This, in
turn, is a rendering of the earlier Sumerian "Nina." Nina was a name
of the goddess Ishtar, represented with a sign depicting a fish inside a
womb or some sort of enclosure.
    Nineveh was 500 miles to the northeast of Israel (near the city of
Mosul in today's Iraq). To obey God's commission, Jonah would have
had to make a tremendous journey across the desert on foot or in a
camel train. This meant traveling to the capital city of what would
become one of Israel's most menacing enemies, Assyria.

   Read Jonah 1:2. Why does God send Jonah to Nineveh?


   Nineveh was a citadel of heathen glory and violence. In the time of
its greatest prosperity, it was also a city of crime and wickedness.
Jonah is not the only prophet who warned Nineveh. More than a
hundred years after Jonah, Nahum was commissioned by God to
confront the citizens of Nineveh with divine judgment. And he pro-
vides graphic details of the violent wickedness found there, probably
not much different from what was happening in Jonah's day.

    Skim through the book of Nahum to get an idea of the wick-
 edness of the city of Nineveh. Here is Nineveh, a heathen city
 steeped in wickedness. And yet the Lord sends to those people a
 Hebrew prophet, a Jew, to call them to repentance? What mes-
 sage should this send to us, as a church today, regarding the
 importance of spreading our message everywhere? How can you
 parallel what's happening here with the three angels' messages
 of Revelation 14?

                                                                     19

FURTHER STUDY:

           hile Peter was in Joppa, he was called by God to take the

W          gospel to a Roman centurion named Cornelius. Cornelius
           was a Gentile by birth, training, and education. Ellen White
describes this meeting between the apostle Peter and Cornelius: "The
angel appeared to Cornelius while he was at prayer. As the centurion
heard himself addressed by name, he was afraid, yet he knew that the
messenger had come from God, and he said, 'What is it, Lord?' The
angel answered, 'Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a
memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one
Simon, whose surname is Peter: he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner,
whose house is by the seaside.'
   "The explicitness of these directions, in which was named even the
occupation of the man with whom Peter was staying, shows that
Heaven is acquainted with the history and business of men in every
station of life. God is familiar with the experience and work of the
humble laborer, as well as with that of the king upon his throne."
—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 133, 134.
   "As regards this earth, Scripture declares the work of creation to
have been completed. 'The works were finished from the foundation
of the world.' Hebrews 4:3. But the power of God is still exercised in
upholding the objects of His creation. It is not because the mechanism
once set in motion continues to act by its own inherent energy that the
pulse beats, and breath follows breath. Every breath, every pulsation
of the heart, is an evidence of the care of Him in whom we live and
move and have our being. From the smallest insect to man, every
living creature is daily dependent upon His providence."
—Ellen G. White, Education, pp. 130, 131.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
    The modern philosophical movement of "Atheistic Existen-
    tialism" says that there is no God and no ultimate purpose
    to life. There is NOTHING outside ourselves. We are alone
    in the universe. Those who believe this worldview are called
    "Atheistic existentialists." They insist human life is mean-
    ingless, pointless, and absurd. How does what we've read
    this week show not only how wrong that view is but why the
    biblical worldview offers us something so much more hope-
    ful?

SUMMARY: The first few verses of the book of Jonah exemplify a
truth found all through the Bible: There is a God who not only knows
each of us personally but is interested in our affairs. The story of
Jonah is, simply, one example of God's work in our lives.

            "Before They Call, I Will Answer"
                             J. H. Zachary

     When Galina Veretennikova was 18 years old an Adventist pastor
lived next door. Several times she watched as the secret police came
to the pastor's home. She saw home meetings broken up. Why would
the police do this to these lovely people? she wondered.
     Galina graduated with a degree in electronics and became attrac-
tive to the communist officials. Little by little she gained their confi-
dence until she became a member of the communist governing body
for the entire province in which she lived in the former Soviet Union.
     She enjoyed the position. Everyone knew her. She also had a good
job and good income. Everything seemed to be going her way.
     During all this time Galina's Adventist neighbor befriended her and
her family. Pastor Bolebrukh shared his joy in the Lord with Galina. In
her heart she knew that he was telling the truth, but pressures from the
popular church officials in town kept her from acting upon her under-
standing of truth. She did not want to become associated with a "cult."
     When Galina's daughter turned 18, she suddenly disappeared.
Galina asked the local police to search for her, but the girl was not
 found. Galina asked the secret police to help her find her daughter, but
they turned up no clues. Next Galina turned to her church. Frequently,
she went to pray for her daughter. But still no one turned up any sign of
 her daughter.
     One day her neighbor invited Galina to attend a Bible seminar that
was being conducted in the local palace of culture. At first she refused.
 She still thought that this group was a cult. But finally she agreed to go
  \v ith her neighbor. One of the lessons dealt with prayer.
     Galina asked the group to pray for her daughter, who by then had
 been missing for two years. Galina found comfort in the earnest
 prayers that her new friends offered for her daughter's safe return.
  Fwo hours after Galina returned home from the meeting, she heard a
 knock at her door. She unbolted the door and found her daughter
 standing there.
     Galina learned that her daughter had been taken by force to another
 country. She managed to escape and return home, even without
 money or passport. Galina realized that God had begun to answer her
 prayer even before the Bible study group prayed.
      Galina joined the "cult" she had avoided for so long. Later her
 daughter also joined the church. They sponsor a small Bible study
 group in their home. Six people are preparing for baptism.

          Jonah and Judgment




Sabbath Afternoon

          S THE FIRST VERSES OF JONAH reveal, this book is set

A         against the background of judgment, God's judgment. Of
          course, that's nothing particularly unique or novel, not for the
Bible, which is filled with different examples, warnings, and promises
of God's judgment in the Old Testament and in the New.
   God, we know, is a God of love; nothing proves that better than
Jesus on the cross, the greatest example of God's judgment. We can
trust that God's judgment will be fair and righteous. We don't have to
worry about jury tampering; we don't have to worry about judges
being bribed; we don't have to worry about being given an unfair trial.
This week we'll continue to look at the concept of judgment in Jonah,
for it reveals that God is concerned about the evil that has brought so
much pain, suffering, and havoc to this world.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: Why is God concerned about the
wickedness of Nineveh? Or of any place? What examples can we
find in the Bible regarding God's divine judgment? What evi-
dence exists that the Ten Commandments were known before
Sinai? How can God judge people who never have been given a
clear presentation of Bible truth?

     MEMORY TEXT: "Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of
     a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in
     every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is
     accepted with him" (Acts 10:34, 35).

NINEVEH UNDER JUDGMENT.

  Look again at Jonah 1:2, particularly the phrase that reads, in
the Hebrew, " 'for their wickedness has come up before me' "
(NKJV). Of course, God is in heaven, the Ninevites were on
earth, so their deeds didn't literally rise to heaven (see also Gen.
4:10). What do you think the phrase, therefore, means? More
important, what does it tell us about God's concern about our
moral actions? See also Judg. 21:25; Eccles. 12:13; Matt. 12:36;
25:45; Heb. 5:14. How do these texts help answer the above
question?




T
        he Bible is very clear that God has created a moral world. In
        other words, despite the claims of many to the contrary, right
        and wrong, good and evil, do exist as moral absolutes placed
upon humanity by God. We are all moral creatures, and we all have
moral responsibilities, whatever our station or position in life. Though
God ultimately will be the final judge of us and our actions, Jonah 1:2
proves that even the heathen, such as the Ninevites, must answer for
their deeds before God.
    And, apparently, they will have plenty to answer for too. The
Assyrians were known for their extraordinary cruelty and violence.
Numerous ancient Assyrian tablets and inscriptions have been found
and translated from Nineveh. The following translation of a document
from the reign of Ashurnasirpal II, 884-859 B.C., is one reminder: " 'I
built a pillar over against his city and I flayed all the chiefs who had
revolted, and covered the pillar with their skin. Some I walled up
within the pillar, some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes, and others I
bound to stakes round about the pillar. . . . And cut the limbs of the
officers, of the royal officers who had rebelled. . . .
    " 'Many captives from among them I burned with fire, and many I
took as living captives. From some I cut off their noses, their ears, and
their fingers; of many I put out the eyes. I made one pillar of the living
and another of heads, and I bound their heads to tree trunks round the
city. Their young men and maidens I burned in the fire.
    " 'Twenty men I captured alive and I immured them in the wall of
 his palace.' "—D. D. Luckenbill, Ancient Records of Assyria and
 Babylon, Ancient Records Series 1, in Geoffrey T. Bull, The City and
 the Sign: An Interpretation of the Book of Jonah (London: Hodder and
 Stoughton, 1970), pp. 109, 110.

DIVINE JUDGMENT—A SERIOUS MATTER.



I
    n spite of those who seek to soothe human consciences with an
    almost exclusive focus on God's love, we observe here, in the first
    few verses of Jonah (and all through Scripture), that God is con-
cerned about human wickedness. Interestingly enough, this concern
isn't something that's in opposition to His love but, instead, stems
directly as a result of that love.
   When studying the Bible, one must take careful notice of the choice
of words and their repetitions. Biblical writers do not use modern
techniques of emphasis, such as underlining or italics. Instead, they
carefully select their vocabulary in light of what they intend to com-
municate. Within the four chapters of the book of Jonah, the word evil
or wickedness is used ten times, two times referring to the Ninevites
(Jon. 1:2; 3:8). There's a reason for this emphasis. The Lord wants us
to know how bad a place this city is.

   What are some of the other occasions in Scripture when God's
indictments against human wickedness have been issued?

     Gen. 6:5

     Gen. 18:25

     Ezek. 7:10, 11

     Hab. 1:1-3

     Rev. 16:1-7

   God condemns wickedness. God also has pronounced judgment on
countries beyond Israel. Ultimately, as the book of Revelation in-
structs us, the whole earth will fall under God's judgment. Much of
Isaiah is filled with warnings to many nations at that time. (See Isaiah
13; 14:24-28; vss. 29-32.) Jeremiah, too, is filled with one warning
after another to the pagan nations around Israel that they will be
judged for their evil.

    Though the Bible is clear that God brings judgments against
 nations, why do we have to be careful in how we—as mortal
 sinners, whose understanding of issues is very limited—determine
 what is or isn't God's judgment? Just because a nation faces
 calamity doesn't automatically mean that God is somehow pun-
 ishing it. Ultimately, all we can do, in every situation, is call people
 to repentance, confession of sin, faith, and obedience.

GOD'S STANDARD OF MORALITY.



B
       ecause of the overpowering pronouncement of the Ten Com-
       mandments from Mount Sinai, many people have decided that
       the Decalogue was initially given by God to the Israelites and
that the moral law it reveals didn't exist until that time. However, a
careful reading of Genesis and the early chapters of Exodus reveal a
prior knowledge of these commandments and universal human ac-
countability to them.

   What are the indications that, long before the time of the
prophets, even before the pronouncement of the Decalogue on
Sinai to the Israelites, people were held accountable to the same
moral standard as those in the Covenant Line?

   Gen. 12:10-20

   Gen. 20:1-14

   Gen. 39:1-9

   With evidence for its antiquity within the text itself, the book of
Job is recognized as the oldest book in the Old Testament. However,
Job himself is not of the Covenant Line, and he lived before the Sinai
Decalogue was proclaimed to the Israelites.

  Which commandments (or at least the basic principles found in
those commandments) are seen in the following texts found in
Job? See also Exodus 20.

   Job 31:5,6

   Job 31:9-12

   Job 31:16-23

   Job 31:26-28

   Job 31:38-40

    How would you explain to someone the necessity of the exist-
 ence of the law before Sinai? If, as John (1 John 3:4) wrote,
 "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
 the transgression of the law," why did the law have to predate
 Sinai?

                                                                    25

MORAL KNOWLEDGE OF GOD.

   "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness; because that which may be known of God is
manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the
invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse"
(Rom. 1:18-20).

  Read over these verses and, using whatever reference material
you can find, summarize what they are saying, particularly in the
context of what we have been studying this week:




    Whatever else these texts are saying, they are clear that God isn't
going to judge the evil and unrighteousness of humanity in an unfair
or arbitrary manner. God is a God of love; Christ's death encompassed
all humanity, every person who has or ever will live (John 3:16; Rom.
5:18; Heb. 2:9). God's desire, from the beginning, was that all human-
ity would be saved, including the heathen. According to these texts,
enough about God has been made known so that these people will be
"without excuse."

   What do you think the phrase "without excuse" means? What
does that thought tell us about God's fairness and justice in bring-
ing judgment upon all unrighteousness?


    The crucial thing we need to remember is that the same God who
brings this judgment is the same God who died on the cross for the
sinners whom He, of necessity, must judge. Only as we keep the
Cross, and what it represents, before us can we truly begin to under-
stand God's righteous judgment upon evil.
    "But even this final revelation of God's wrath in the destruction of
the wicked is not an act of arbitrary power. 'God is the fountain of life;
and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates from God, and
thus cuts himself off from life' (DA 764). God gives men existence for
a time so that they may develop their characters. When this has been
accomplished, they receive the results of their own choice."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, on Romans 1:18, vol. 6, pp. 477, 478.

NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS (Acts 10:34, 35).

      cripture reveals that both the prophet Jonah and the nation of

S     Israel had proven unfaithful to their destined role of being a
      light to the nations. Both had forgotten how God always has
expressed His concern for all humanity, not just those whom He
specifically called out to be His people. Indeed, it was precisely
because the Lord wanted to reach other people, the heathen, that He
called out Israel to be a special treasure unto Himself.

   How does even the ancient Abrahamic covenant pointedly in-
clude people beyond the Covenant Line? Read Genesis 22:18.
How were all nations to be blessed by what God did through
Abraham? See Gal. 3:26-29.




   Divine love, transcending Israel's borders, surely is not an un-
known idea to Jonah. But it is easy to choke the channels that God has
ordained to flood the world with His grace. No person is immune to
this possibility. During New Testament times, on a sunlit rooftop,
Simon Peter struggled with the same issues as did the Old Testament
Jonah. And in the same town of Joppa!

  How does God instruct Peter regarding His compassion for all
people? Acts 10:9-16, 34, 35; 11:4-10.


   Repetition in biblical narrative writing is a significant pointer of
emphasis. Modern writers now use italics or underlining to give em-
phasis to an important point. But biblical writers use repetition. In this
case, Peter is told three times that what God has declared clean he
must not call common.
   Peter's own explanation of this vision makes it clear he realizes
that his vision is not instructing him about proper eating habits but
about God's compassion for all nationalities of people. Even so,
people do reject the God of heaven's grace.

    Imagine, if as Adventists, we thought salvation belonged only
 to us. Even worse, imagine if we didn't want to give it to those
 who were "unclean"! It's hard to think of a greater way to be
 unfaithful to our calling. And yet, in what ways, however subtly,
 do we face the danger of having that same attitude?

                                                                       27

FURTHER STUDY:



H
        owever much God wants those who hear the messages of
        warning and judgment to repent, He does not force the will.
        "The exercise of force is contrary to the principles of God's
government; He desires only the service of love; and love cannot be
commanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is
love awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be
manifested in contrast to the character of Satan. This work only one
Being in all the universe could do. Only He who knew the height and
depth of the love of God could make it known. Upon the world's dark
night the Sun of Righteousness must rise, 'with healing in His wings.'
Mal. 4:2."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 22.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
    One argument for the existence of God is known as the
    "Moral Argument," and it goes like this: Suppose, hypo-
    thetically, some world ruler arose who decided that, for
    the benefit of all humanity, all red-haired people had to be
    exterminated. Suppose, too, that through a very elaborate
    and sophisticated propaganda machine, he convinced
    everyone that, indeed, killing every red-haired person was
    the only moral and right thing to do. Now, if everyone in
    the world were convinced that it were morally justifiable
    to kill all red-haired people, would that act be wrong?
    Most people, from our perspective now, would believe it to
    be wrong, regardless of how many people believe it to be
    right. But why? If moral values arise only from within
    individuals, instead of coming from some outside, tran-
    scendent source, such as God, why would it be wrong?
    How could it be wrong? And yet we know that it is, even
    should everyone at that time think it were not. For many
    people, the answer to this dilemma is easy: Those moral
    values do come from an outside Source, one that goes
    beyond humans, and it's called God. Discuss the strong
    and weak points of this argument.

SUMMARY: God is a God of love, but He's also a God of justice,
and just as His mercy extends to all nations, so does His divine
judgment.

                         A Voice for God
                     Luis Amilcar Cano Navarro

    Ever since his childhood, music has been a part of Luis Cano's life.
But music did not always draw him closer to God. He grew up
attending church and singing in the choir, but as a teenager he became
disenchanted and left the church.
    People praised his musical ability, and Luis dreamed of becoming
famous. When church members told him that his voice was a gift from
God and should be used only for God's glory, he began to resent God.
    Luis drifted away from church. He wanted to live his own life, a life
in which God did not play a large part.
    After college he began studying voice with a well-known voice
teacher, Dorm Isabel, and the two developed a friendship. When he
married, Dofia Isabel invited Luis and his wife, Vicky, to join a small
group that met near their home. Luis did not want to go, but Vicky
yearned for a closer walk with God. Finally Luis accepted Dolia
Isabel's invitation to attend the small group meeting.
    Luis was impressed with the speaker's understanding of the Bible.
Luis and Vicky continued attending the small group meeting. Luis
liked the group Bible study, but Vicky was concerned that he might
want to change religions. But when the leader invited those present to
surrender their lives to Christ, both Vicky and Luis stood.
    Luis realized that he had never really understood God before.
Every day he fell more deeply in love with God. God began filling
every aspect of the Cano's lives. Soon they were baptized.
    When they learned about tithing, Luis was not convinced that they
could survive on less than their full income. They prayed to know
                                  God's will, and soon Luis received a
                                  raise, which convinced him that God
                                  was leading them to trust Him.
                                     Luis began singing in church again,
                                  but this time it was different. "No mat-
                                  ter what happens, I will continue to
                                  sing praises to God," he said. "I want
                                  to sing for God's glory, not my own,
                                  to exalt Christ, not myself."

              The "Dove" Flees




Sabbath Afternoon

THUS FAR, THE BOOK OF JONAH has portrayed a familiar
pattern in the Old Testament: a prophet receiving a divine call. "Arise,
go to Euphrates" (Jer. 13:4, 5), God told Jeremiah. "Arise, get thee to
Zarephath" (1 Kings 17:9, 10), God told Elijah. As expected, both
prophets did what they were told.
   The reader is led to expect from Jonah a similar response to God's
call, "Arise, go to Nineveh." However, the book of Jonah defies
conventional ideas about God's prophets and how they act. How dare
Jonah upset the usual paradigm! Far from obeying God, he flees in the
opposite direction. Hardly the best start for a prophet of God.
   Why be surprised? Prophets are people, too, touched with our fears,
insecurities, and doubts. Surely, we don't expect perfection from the
Lord's prophets. Based on what example? Noah? David? John the
Baptist? Peter? Hardly. Maybe we don't expect perfection, but we
certainly didn't expect a prophet to flee from a direct command of
God! This week we'll look a little more at what happened.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: How do we appraise the prophet's
disobedience? What is God's response to Jonah's attitude? What
does this teach us about God? How does God's grace respond to
Jonah's disobedience?

     MEMORY TEXT: "Elias was a man subject to like passions as
     we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it
     rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six
     months" (James 5:17).

"HERE AM I, DON'T SEND ME!"

  "But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the
Lord. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship which was going to
Tarshish, paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to
Tarshish from the presence of the Lord" (Jon. 1:3, NASB).

    onah's name means "dove," and we find him next in an unusual

J   "flight pattern."

  How is Jonah's response to his divine summons unusual? Jon. 1:3.


   Thus far, the book of Jonah has opened with a recognizable situation
seen in Scripture of a prophet receiving a divine call. What happens
next, however, is not the usual. The shocking surprise involves the
detailed description of what Jonah did to escape his task. Though hardly
the usual paradigm, this isn't the only time we see the example of
someone not exactly thrilled about his or her divine calling.

  Who else initially was not willing to accept God's call, and
why? Exod. 4:1, 10, 13.


   When Moses was enlisted by God to return to Egypt for the
purpose of leading the Israelites away from slavery, he drew back in
amazement and terror at the command. He even offered several
reasons why he thought he should refuse the task. But, ultimately, he
accepted the task. Ellen White eloquently describes this situation:
"The divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful,
slow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his
incapacity to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having once
accepted the work, he entered upon it with his whole heart, putting
all his trust in the Lord. The greatness of his mission called into
exercise the best powers of his mind. God blessed his ready obedi-
ence, and he became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, and well
fitted for the greatest work ever given to man."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 255.

    What possible reasons could Jonah have had for not wanting
 to do what the Lord asked? Could those have even been "valid"
 reasons? Also, is it possible that, perhaps, the very traits that
 caused Jonah to want to flee from this task could be the very
 traits that, if rightly channeled, would have made him qualified
 for that task? If so, how so? What does this say to me about my
 own gifts and what the Lord asks me to do with them?
                                                                      31

THE "DOVE" FLEES.

        od gives Jonah a command, and Jonah, rather than obeying

G       the Lord's command, attempts to flee. It is hard to imagine a
        more determined antagonism than is indicated here in this one
verse (Jon. 1:3). Every verb in the verse reveals what Jonah is doing in
order to get away from the Lord and from what the Lord asks him to
do.
   Look at the verbs in Jonah 1:3. Jonah rose up to flee. (The verb for
"arose" here comes from the same root word that was part of his
divine commission, when the Lord told him to "Arise, go to Nineveh.")
He went down to Joppa, he found a ship, he paid the fare, and went
down into the boat. All this flurry of activity for the express purpose
of evading God's command. The writer of the narrative subtly sug-
gests the determination of Jonah to flee.

   In Jonah 1:3, what phrase is given at the beginning of the verse
and then repeated at the end of the same verse? What do you
think that means?




   This single verse says two times that Jonah flees "from the pres-
ence of the Lord." A single indication would have been enough.
However, the duplication of this phrase in just one verse compels the
reader to consider the irony of anyone, let alone a prophet, thinking to
flee from the presence of the Lord!
   Of all people—as someone who knows the Lord, who worships the
God of Israel, who knows that the Lord was the Creator of the heaven
and the earth and the sea (see Jon. 1:9), Jonah should have known the
futility of his actions. It's not as though he were following some local,
pagan deity whose "power" ended at the border.
   On the contrary, by his own confession, he knows the power of the
God he professes to serve—and, though knowing all these things, he
flees anyway!
   What could he have possibly been thinking?

   Of course, it's easy for us to look at Jonah and shake our
heads in disapproval. How could he have done something so
stupid? However, in what subtle ways do we attempt do to the
same thing? Maybe we don't flee, at least physically, from "the
presence of the Lord" (for that's impossible), but how do we
openly or inadvertently "separate" ourselves from the Lord?

GOING DOWN.



T
       hree times the text found in Jonah 1:3 says that Jonah is going to
       Tarshish. That's three times in one verse. Notice this character-
       istic repetition in Hebrew narrative writing. The writer is not
sloppy, nor is he stuttering. Rather, we are being alerted to an impor-
tant issue the writer wants us to ponder. In this case, the thrice-
mentioned city of Tarshish is important because Tarshish, in fact, is in
the opposite direction of where the Lord wanted Jonah to go. Nineveh
is east, Tarshish is west. Jonah's rebellion couldn't be made more
explicit.

  What other examples can we find in the Bible of God giving
someone (not necessarily a prophet) explicit instructions and he or
she doing the opposite?

   Gen. 2:16, 17                                             Gen. 3:6

   1 Sam. 15:3                                       1 Sam. 15:21-23

   Exod. 20:4-6                                           Ezek. 8:10

   What other verb is used two times in Jonah 1:3?




   Two times in this verse we are told that Jonah "went down," along
with one additional use in verse 5. Jonah "went down" to Joppa; Jonah
"went down" into the ship; Jonah had "gone down" into the lowest
parts of the ship. Three times in close succession the reader is told that
Jonah "went down." The writer carefully structures the narrative to
focus on Jonah's downward journey away from his divine commis-
sion. Indeed, before it's all over, Jonah goes down much farther than
even he imagines at this point, for he will go all the way to the
"bottom" before the Lord is through with him.
   The use of that specific verb isn't by chance. In this context, it has
negative connotations. In fact, in modern Hebrew, the same verb "go
down" can carry with it a negative meaning, while the opposite, "go
up," carries a positive one.

    Are you going down or up? The answer is easy. Are you doing

GOD'S PATIENT GRACE.

           hen Jonah flees from the presence of the Lord, that might

W          have finished everything. When Jonah pays the fare to
           Tarshish, that could have been the end of his call. When we
disobey, when we try to escape what God has convicted us about,
when God says one thing and we do another, that could be the end of
us too. God is not obligated at all to keep on dealing with us, espe-
cially when we mess up, even in a big way. However, out of a love
that's too big for us to understand, He keeps working with us, despite
our repeated and colossal blunders. And for this, God's patient grace,
we all should be immensely grateful. After all, imagine if all it took
were one big mistake on our part for the Lord to cast us off. Who, even
the most saintly among us, could ever hope for salvation if that were
the case? Grace is nothing if not the chance—indeed, many chances—
to start over.

   What examples from the Bible show God still working with
those who have sadly and grossly failed in what the Lord had
asked of them? What lesson can we learn from these stories about
God's grace with those whose faith and trust fail them, even at
crucial times?

     Genesis 3

     Genesis 16

     2 Samuel 11

     Matt. 26:74, 75

   God calls Jonah, but Jonah rejects that call. It's that simple. But
what happens next? Does the Lord simply leave Jonah to his rebel-
lion? Does He simply cast him off, because he has made this tremen-
dous blunder? Not at all. Though Jonah, overtly and blatantly, chooses
to run away, the Lord pursues him. In other words, despite Jonah's
rejection of the Lord, God doesn't reject him, at least not yet. Here is
this man, given a divine call by the Lord, and though this man rejects
that call, God's Spirit still strives with him, anyway.

   What does this fact say to us, personally, in our own walk
with the Lord? However much hope it should give us, we should
also be careful about being presumptuous. How can we know
the difference between having hope despite our failures and
being presumptuous about them?

THE COD OF NATURE.

  What is God's response to Jonah's disobedience? Jon. 1:4, 17; 2:10.


       oth the Old and the New Testament are remarkable for their

B      unfaltering and continual ascription of the control of nature
       to God. At times, He uses nature as a means of instruction in
righteousness and discipline. In contrast to some contemporary think-
ing, which views the universe as a closed and finite system, allowing
no place for the action of God, the Bible's consistent confession is that
the functioning of all nature is under God's control.

  Read Job 38. In the context of today's lesson, what's the crucial
point made in this chapter?


   God has established laws in nature. But they do not administer
themselves. The Lawgiver administers them. He has arranged a series
of causes and effects. But according to Scripture, He supports, main-
tains, controls, and moves them at His own pleasure.

  What is the first action God takes in response to Jonah's cruise?
Jon. 1:4.


   The storm is not attributed merely to the elements of nature but to
the God of nature, to Him who is over all and above all things. But this
is no mere display of power. It is for Jonah's sake that a tempest is
unleashed. Verse 4 teaches us that this storm is there because of Jonah
and for Jonah. The elements of nature and many innocent sailors are
engaged in the adventure of Jonah, with him and because of him. The
storm is sent to pursue a petulant prophet and, in the process, involves
many others on board the ship.

   These "innocent" sailors were suffering because of someone
else's sin. In what ways do we see this principle operating all the
time? What does it tell us about the horrible nature of sin?


   The book of Jonah reveals the seriousness of a God-given vocation.
God regards His choice of messenger as so important that He brings
nature into play in order to nudge Jonah to fulfill his task. As God
wrestled with Jacob, so now He begins to wrestle with Jonah, employ-
ing the elements of nature to get his attention.

                                                                       35

FURTHER STUDY:

            hat picture do the different Bible writers give concerning

W           God's sovereignty over His creation?

     Amos 4:13;
     Job 9:5; Amos 1:2; Mic. 1:3, 4;
     Judg. 5:5; Pss. 18:7; 68:8; 114:4-6; Isa. 64:3; Ezek. 3:12; Hab. 3:6, 10;
     Exod. 23:25, 26; Lev. 25:18, 19; Deuteronomy 28; 30:8-14;
     2 Chron. 31:9, 10; Isa. 58:9-11; Amos 4:6-8; Hag. 1:9-11; 2:17.

   Ellen White's graphic description of the plagues in Egypt is in-
structive: "Ruin and desolation marked the path of the destroying
angel. The land of Goshen alone was spared. It was demonstrated to
the Egyptians that the earth is under the control of the living God, that
the elements obey His voice, and that the only safety is in obedience to
Him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 269.
   The book of Revelation instructs us that the whole world will be so
involved in a similar situation before the second coming of Christ.
Ellen White draws this lesson in her chapter on Jonah in Prophets and
Kings, p. 277:
   "The time is at hand when there will be sorrow in the world that no
human balm can heal. The spirit of God is being withdrawn. Disasters
by sea and by land follow one another in quick succession. How
frequently we hear of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by
fire and flood, with great loss of life and property! Apparently these
calamities are capricious outbreaks of disorganized, unregulated forces
of nature, wholly beyond the control of man; but in them all, God's
purpose may be read. They are among the agencies by which He seeks
to arouse men and women to a sense of their danger."—Emphasis
supplied.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Do you think there could have come a point when God
     would have finally stopped pursuing Jonah? If so, when
     might that point have been? Compare the situation of Judas
     to that of Jonah. What was the crucial difference between
     the two?

     2. How should the humanity of Jonah help us understand the
        humanity of all God's prophets, including Ellen White?

SUMMARY: God sought to use Jonah despite the prophet's faults.

                  A Young Man's Journey
                              Y11i Peco

    I am a new believer living in Tirana, Albania. When I was
about 14 years of age, I often saw my grandma going to church.
Sometimes I went with her, and eventually I signed up to attend
some religious classes that were being held in the church. But to
be frank, I could not understand most of what they taught there.
    During my second year of high school a friend invited my
group of friends—there were five of us—to his chruch. We had
never heard of this church, but we decided to go. I thought the
services were weird because they were so different from my
grandmother's church. But I really liked the Sabbath School class
with so many people taking part in the discussion, teaching and
learning together about the Bible lesson.
    For awhile I attended this church occasionally, then started
going every week. When I went, I felt a peace in my heart that I
could not understand. I got to know everybody, and I felt as if I
were part of a large Christian family.
    Some church members encouraged me to take my stand for
Christ and be baptized, but I was not ready yet. I did not know a lot
about God's Word, and I was not sure about some things. Besides,
I had problems at home.
    From the beginning my family opposed my going to this church.
They insisted that the only true church was the Orthodox church,
and they tried every way they knew to help me find my way back
to the family's religion. I knew they wanted what was best for me,
but I was convinced that I had found what was best. Sometimes we
argued, and they tried to convince me that I was wrong. And
sometimes I tried to convince them that they were wrong. Some
Sabbaths were peaceful; others were full of arguing. After some
time, however, they gave up trying to change my mind.
     My knowledge of God was increasing, and I felt the Holy Spirit
 very close to me. It was as though I were talking to Him, and I felt
 He was guiding me. I wish everybody could experience the same
 thing in his life.
     When I knew I had gained sufficient knowledge about God and
 His Word, I was ready to be baptized. The day of baptism was
 really wonderful, so filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit that I
 wanted to share the good news with everybody.

Lesson 5                                          *October 25-31

       A Hebrew Prophet and
         Heathen Mariners
       z




Sabbath Afternoon
IN SOME WAYS, THE STORY line that unfolds this week (basi-
cally, Jon. 1:4-13) is a small example of what happened to ancient
Israel. God originally designed that, had the nation been obedient, the
heathen would have come from all around to learn about the God who
had done so much for His chosen people. Unfortunately, that wasn't
how things turned out. Because of Israel's disobedience, instead of
those pagans coming to the Hebrews, the Hebrews went to the pagans,
often in chains. That is, they witnessed for the Lord, as He said they
would, but they did so amid great calamity and distress.
   This week we'll see, on a minor scale, a similar paradigm. It's in
the midst of great trial and calamity that Jonah, surrounded by "pa-
gans," is put into a situation in which he has to witness for the Lord,
even if it's upon a ship sinking amid a terrible storm.
   Yet, even despite Jonah and his faults, the message gets through.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What is it about tragedy that often
helps us put things in perspective? What powerful irony appears
in this part of the book of Jonah? Why does Jonah identify his
God as the Creator of the earth and the sea? How was God able to
use Jonah as a witness, despite the prophet's stubbornness?

     MEMORY TEXT: "Your faithfulness endures to all genera-
     tions; You established the earth, and it abides. They continue
     this day according to Your ordinances, for all are Your
     servants" (Psalm 119:90, 91, NKJV).

STORM AT SEA.



I
    n Jonah 1:4, 5, the narrative continues. The Lord sends a mighty
   storm, the ship is in danger of sinking, the pagan sailors are
   praying to their respective gods, and Jonah had "gone down into
the hold of the ship" (vs. 5, NRSV), where the captain found him
sleeping. The captain was, obviously, quite vexed to find someone
snoozing in such an emergency.

   Notice, too, what happens among these pagan sailors. The text
says they started casting their "wares" overboard. These were
things that, in normal circumstances, would be of great value to
them. This even could have been the cargo. Now, however, in such
an emergency, they are willing to cast it all into the sea! What's
the spiritual lesson here? (See also Eccles. 2:11; Matt. 16:26;
1 John 2:15-17.) How many of us have ever found ourselves in a
situation in which, suddenly, many of the things we deemed so
important become less so? How can the Lord use such situations
to teach us about what's truly of value?




  Read what the captain says to Jonah. Why was he so upset?
What did he want from the sleeping prophet? Was this an appeal
made by faith or simply by desperation? Jon. 1:6.


   Note the striking similarity of the captain's summons to Jonah—
"Arise!" (Jon. 1:6), and Jonah's original summons from God in verse
2—"Arise." Moreover, the captain begs Jonah to "cry" unto God,
using the same verb that God had when He called Jonah to "cry"
against Nineveh (Jon. 1:2). Now, however, the summons to arise and
to cry comes from a pagan sailor who doesn't even worship the God of
heaven.
   Jonah, a prophet of the true God, is asked by a pagan to pray. The
irony of this situation shouldn't be missed.

    What spiritual significance can you find in the irony of this
 pagan asking a Hebrew prophet to pray? Do we as Christians
 ever find those not of our faith, or those of even no "faith," who
 are more "spiritual" or "moral" or even more faithful to what
 they believe than we ourselves are to what we know? What can
 we learn from these situations?

                                                                  39

PAGAN MARINERS CONTINUE THEIR INITIATIVE.



T
      he sailors continue to struggle against the alarming storm
      while Jonah remains detached. The mariners are convicted
      that the violence of this storm is evidence the gods were angry.

   In reality, of course, the storm was brought, not out of anger
but out of love. We know that, because we know the ending of the
story and what was happening behind the scenes, something the
sailors didn't know. What does this tell us about how careful we
need to be about drawing the wrong conclusions regarding what-
ever terrible problems we might be facing at the moment? (See
also Proverbs 3; Rom. 8:28; 1 Pet. 4:12.)


   The mariners assume that a storm of this magnitude is closely
bound up with someone's guilt. The outcome of finding the culprit
would put matters right. Though not often used today, casting lots
was generally regarded in ancient times in Israel and by other na-
tions as a method of resolving conflicts. (See Num. 33:54; 1 Sam.
14:41, 42; Esther 3:7; Prov. 16:33.) In the book of Jonah, God allows
the casting of lots to implicate Jonah as the cause of the storm (Jon.
1:7).

   Though we have clear-cut Bible examples of someone's evil
bringing calamity (Joshua 7), what danger exists in assuming that
calamity must result from someone's specific transgression? (See
Job 1; 2.)


   After the lot falls on Jonah, the sailors pepper him with numerous
questions, obviously attempting to find out why the lot fell his way
and why he was the cause of the storm (Jon. 1:7, 8).
   Up to this point in the narrative, Jonah has not been heard talking.
Now, in response to all the many pressing questions put to him, he
answers selectively. In fact, he ignores the question about his occupa-
tion, about where he came from, and about his country. The only
question he answers is regarding what ethic background he has. He
tells them that he is a "Hebrew." Then he answers a question they
don't even ask, which is who his God is.

   The phrase to "fear God" is a common Hebrew expression
that implies the idea of worshiping and serving the Lord. What's
so ironic about Jonah's answer in this specific situation?

WITNESS AT SEA.



I
   mmediately after identifying himself as a Hebrew, Jonah then
   offers some information the sailors hadn't specifically re-
   quested: " 'I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea
and the dry land' " (Jon. 1:9, NKJV).

   What other prophet uses the title "the God of heaven"? Dan.
2:19.


   Daniel blesses the "God of heaven" when God reveals Nebuchadne77Ar' s
dream and spares the lives of the Babylonian wise men. This phrase, "the
God of heaven," appears numerous times in the Old Testament in refer-
ence to the Lord.
   Perhaps, though, what's most interesting is that not only does
Jonah name Him "Yahweh, the God of heaven"; he immediately
describes him as the Creator, the One who made the sea and the dry
land, an unmistakable reference to the Genesis Creation account.

   What are these texts (Exod. 2:11; Pss. 100:3; 146:5, 6; Mal.
2:10; Acts 4:24; Col. 1:16, 17; Rev. 4:11; 14:7) saying that is so
important to our faith as Seventh-day Adventists?




    Jonah knows that the power and authority of his God come from
the simple, yet crucial, fact that the Lord is the Creator, the Source of
all that is, the foundation of truth, the One who has made reality. Our
whole faith is based on the notion that we are worshiping the God who
created all things. It's a fact that He, alone, is the Creator, and that
makes Him, alone, the only true God. If He's not the Creator, then
why worship Him, for He would be, just as we are, merely a product
of something even greater than He is?
    Thus, Jonah isn't wasting time here on any long theological excur-
sions on the essential nature of his God. Instead, He gets right to the
heart of the issue, telling them what they need to know.

   God commands that every week (no exceptions) we devote
 one-seventh of our lives as a reminder that He is our Creator.
 What does this tell us about how important the doctrine of
 Creation is?


                                                                      41
Wednesday                                           October 29
"WHY HAST THOU DONE THIS?"

      he irony here is outrageous. Jonah did not want to testify to the

T     pagans in Nineveh. But now, in his mad flight from that
     assignment, he is forced to testify to the pagans on this ship.

   What did Jonah say to the men (Jon. 1:9, 10) that made them so
fearful?


    Jonah's proclamation causes the sailors to be "exceedingly afraid."
They were already "afraid" of the storm (1:5) to begin with; now, they
are "exceedingly afraid" (vs. 10). They react even more fearfully to
Jonah's confession about God than they had to the perilous storm.
And no wonder: It's one thing to worship the powerful God; it's
another to flee openly from Him. No doubt, not knowing much about
this God, the pagans must have assumed that He brought the storm in
order to destroy Jonah for his disobedience. And, because they had the
unfortunate luck of being with him, they were going to be destroyed,
as well.
    There is a signal contrast between these pagan seamen and Jonah.
While Jonah, the prophet of God, dares to act contrary to the God he
fears, the mere mention of the mighty God of heaven causes great fear
in the sailors' hearts. The violence of the storm is all the testimony
they need to the power of the God whom they believe Jonah has
angered.
    This conviction didn't happen because Jonah consciously testified
for God. No, he was forced to make his confession because of the
storm. But through this unplanned disclosure, the mariners' hearts
were stirred. They expressed horror at Jonah's flight from the God of
heaven and earth. Thus, even in disobedience, Jonah was used by the
Lord as a witness.
    Indeed, what impressed the sailors about the terrible storm took
place despite Jonah. They certainly saw nothing particularly virtuous
in him. God, however, was able to work around Jonah's disobedience.
It's kind of ironic, too, that it was through his testimony that they
learned something about the true God.

   The sailors, after learning about Jonah's flight, said to him,
"Why hast thou done this?" What do we say when, after being
caught in sin, we are asked, "Why hast thou done this?" Do we,
as born-again Christians—who have been promised so much
power from above (Rom. 6:1-12; 1 Cor. 10:13)—ever have a
valid excuse to sin?

THE EMERGENCY WORSENS.

  What phrase is repeated in Jonah 1:10 for the third time in this
chapter?




T
      his phrase "from the presence of the Lord" has appeared in
      this first chapter almost like a refrain. We already have seen it
      twice in verse 3. The author of the book of Jonah—as are all
writers of biblical narrative—is deliberate in his choice of words.
Repetition in Hebrew narrative is a technique employed to emphasize
something important. In this case, our attention is deliberately focused
on Jonah's obstinate attitude.

  Why do you think that phrase is used again? What point is the
author trying to make? What irony is found in its use? Can
anyone ever really flee from the presence of an all-knowing God
(Prov. 5:21)? In what ways can we attempt to flee from the pres-
ence of the Lord?


   The sailors grow more desperate as the storm worsens. Now they
realize something must be done, or everyone will perish.
   Notice how the sailors continue to take the initiative. They ac-
knowledged the God Jonah worshiped. Now they ask him what action
they should take. The sailors admit their acute fear, and they beg of
Jonah the remedy: What can we do that God should not be angered?
You tell us, and we will obey. In other words, you got us into this mess,
now you tell us what to do to get out of it.

   Look at Jonah's response (1:12). How would you characterize
it? Was Jonah, admitting his guilt, ready to sacrifice himself for
the good of others? Was he playing the role of the pious martyr?
Or was he still continuing in disobedience? What does the fact
that there's no record of Jonah repenting or confessing to the
Lord tell us about his attitude, at least to this point?


   At this point in the story, we see, perhaps, a bit of softening in
Jonah. He admits that he was fleeing from the Lord, admits that he is
the cause of their present suffering, and is willing to be cast into the
sea in order to spare them sure destruction. Whatever his ultimate
motives, Jonah is showing some signs of character development, how-
ever extreme the circumstances needed to bring it out.


                                                                      43
Friday                                               October 31
FURTHER STUDY:

        ontrast Jonah's response with the apostle Paul's experience of

C       a terrible storm on board a ship in the same body of water:
        Acts 27:21-25.
   Consider how Paul takes command of the situation and declares
that God will save all those on board. Courageously he exhorts them
not to despair. " 'Last night there was standing beside me an angel of
the God to whom I belong and whom I serve, and He said, "Do not be
afraid, Paul. You are destined to appear before Caesar, and for this
reason God grants you the safety of all who are sailing with you." So
take courage, friends; I trust in God that things will turn out just as I
was told' " (Acts 27:23-25, Jerusalem). Imagine had Jonah displayed
a similar faith in the same God.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What might have happened had Jonah repented of his de-
     fection right there and called for God to save him, the crew,
     and the ship?

     2. Read Jonah 1:13. What is the text saying? What's implied
        in there about the character of these "pagans"? Was there
        something already there that made them open to the mov-
        ing of God's Spirit upon them?

     3. Jonah was acting not out of disbelief but out of ... what? He
        clearly believed in the existence of the Lord. Otherwise,
        why would he have fled after receiving the "word of the
        Lord"? Why flee from "the presence" of a God you don't
        believe in to begin with? When confronted by the sailors, he
        instantly confessed his belief in the Lord. And He knew of
        the power of his God, for Jonah admitted that it was be-
        cause of his fleeing from the Lord that this terrible storm
        had come. What, then, was his problem? Why would any-
        one openly disobey a God whom they were so sure existed?
        In what ways do Christians do the same thing? It's one
        thing to disobey the commands of a God whom you don't
        believe even exists; it's another thing to disobey openly the
        commands of a God whom you do believe in. Discuss.

SUMMARY: God used Jonah, despite himself. How much better the
outcome would have been had Jonah cooperated right from the start.

                      A Soul Winning LE
                             J. H. Zachary

    Josue Mpwatsibenikanka was raised in an idol-worshiping family
in southern Rwanda. When he heard the call of Christ and followed
Him, his family persecuted him.
    During the Rwandan civil war soldiers accused him of collaborating
with the "enemy." They were about to execute him when a soldier
standing on a hill nearby called out, "We have more traitors over here."
When the soldiers ran toward the hill, Josue escaped. In gratitude to God
he promised that for the rest of his life he would work for God. Although
he had been a farmer, he became a literature evangelist.
    Josue and a friend were concerned that there were no
Sabbathkeepers in a village near their own. Josue visited every home
in the village and gave interested people a small gift book. Later he
returned and sold many copies of The Great Controversy.
    In Rwandan churches music is an important part of the worship
experience, and every church has at least one choir. Members often
spend several hours on Sabbath afternoons enjoying the music of their
choirs. So Josue and his friend began inviting choirs from nearby
Adventist churches to sing for their targeted village. Crowds came out
to listen.
    As interest grew, the two men began teaching the Bible in connec-
tion with the choral programs. They spent many days visiting the
homes of people who had come to hear the choirs. As they opened the
scriptures and prayed with these families, attendance at the concerts
and Bible studies grew.
    Each evening they would close their Bible study with a call to
accept Jesus and follow Him in a new life. This community had lost
 many during the civil war that ravaged Rwanda. The survivors were
 seeking comfort and spiritual support. Bible studies on the return of
 Jesus and the glorious resurrection encouraged people to respond to
 the call to come to Jesus.
    Soon Josue and his friend began Sabbath services with about 40
 persons. However, after he had canvassed every home in the village
 and the nearby area, his work took him to another community. He
 asked one of the elders from a nearby congregation to lead the new
 group.
     Josue continues to work in this region praying for more persons
 whom he can lead to Jesus.

      Salvation Is of the Lord!




Sabbath Afternoon


T
       HE DRAMA HAS CONTINUED TO mount in the first
       chapter of the book of Jonah. A prophet, presuming to shirk
       his divine mission, has found himself facing death in a storm.
Yet amid all this turmoil, it is the heathen sailors, not the prophet
Jonah, who pray to the Lord (see Jon. 1:14).
   What irony: Non-Israelites, face to face with a disobedient prophet
of God, pray that they will not acquire guilt through his death. It's not
a scene dramatized that often in the Bible—pagans praying to the Lord
while one of the Lord's servants keeps silent. The pagans were doing
what Jonah should have been doing. Moreover, these sailors pray to
Jonah's God with the special covenant name given to Israel, having
accepted Jonah's testimony, as expressed in verse 9. They might be
acting under duress, but sometimes that's what it takes to get someone's
attention. Let's follow the narrative to see what happens next.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What did the sailors do after the
storm ended? What finally caused Jonah to pray? What did Jonah
pray for? What does the story teach about the futility of profes-
sion without corresponding works? What does it teach about God's
grace for those whose works don't equal their profession?

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'But I will sacrifice to Thee with the voice
     of thanksgiving. That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation
     is from the Lord' " (Jonah 2:9, NASB).

THE FEAR OF THE LORD.



L
       ast week, we left off with Jonah telling the sailors to hurl him
      overboard and save themselves. Finally, the sailors, desperate,
      did just that. Only then "the sea ceased from her raging" (Jon.
1:15). Again, we find the God who created the sea unambiguously in
control of it.

  What was the reaction of the sailors after the storm ceased?
Jon. 1:15, 16.


   Notice, the sailors didn't attribute the change in weather to some
coincidence of unguided nature. They didn't view it as pure chance or
luck. Instead, they "feared the Lord exceedingly" (see vs. 16). Earlier
they had feared the storm, but now they feared the God of the storm,
even more so than the storm itself. Seasoned mariners who earlier had
worshiped a collection of false gods came to worship Yahweh and
make vows to Him. The sailors come into contact with the living God.
They make offerings to God, vows to the true God, the One who not
only created the sea but controls it (Jon. 1:16).

   God gave them a miraculous deliverance, and as a result, they
rendered Him homage. In what ways does this mirror the basic
plan of salvation, particularly as seen through the life and minis-
try of Jesus? See, for example, John 9.




   Are we not saved, delivered from death by Jesus, and then, as a
result of that deliverance, worship and obey Him? Of course. That's
what happened with these sailors. Homage, worship, and obedience
can never save; these things come only as a result of being saved, of
having obtained the miraculous deliverance that is ours by faith alone.
See also Galatians 2:20.

    Perhaps the most striking contrast in chapter 1 is also the
 most spiritually instructive. In verse 9, Jonah the Hebrew prophet
 professes to "fear the Lord" but doesn't act as though he does;
 in contrast, the pagans, too, "feared the Lord" and then cer-
 tainly acted as if they did, even though their knowledge of the
 Lord was much more limited than that of Jonah, a Hebrew
 prophet. What warnings should we take from this contrast?

                                                                     47

IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST (Jon. 1:17).



F
      or all the sailors know, Jonah has drowned, a victim of the
      waves and storm. However, at this very moment, we are again
      confronted with God's complete control over nature. We already
have seen God causing the great wind of a storm (vs. 4), controlling
the casting of the lot (vs. 7), and then suddenly causing the storm to
cease (vs. 15). What comes next?

     How is God's sovereign power displayed now? Jon. 1:17.


   A man being swallowed alive and living for three full days in the
belly of a fish is a remarkable event in any era, not just in our
sophisticated twenty-first century. Even back then, it was incredible.
And yet, the Bible makes no attempt to explain or justify how some-
thing like this could happen. It's just assumed to be true, because it's
assumed the Lord can do it.
   The book says the Lord "had prepared" a great fish to swallow up
Jonah. It could also have been translated "had appointed." The verb
comes from a Hebrew root word that can mean, among other things,
"to appoint" or "to prepare," "to count" or "to reckon." The use of the
verb here stresses God's sovereign rule over His creation for the
accomplishment of His purpose. In fact, the narrator will couple this
same verb with God's directives three more times in the book of Jonah
to underscore the Lord's omnipotence. See Jonah 4:6, 7, 8.

  What other verb is used to describe what the fish does to
Jonah?


   The verb "to swallow" appears in various forms in the Old Testa-
ment (see Pss. 21:9; 35:25; Jer. 51:34) and often in the context of
Israel's captivity. It's a word sometimes used to describe God's judg-
ment upon His people. Thus, how well it fits this story here. After all,
so many of God's judgments upon His people were nothing more than
the means employed to turn them away from evil. The judgments had
redemptive intentions. The Lord must have had that in mind for Jonah,
as well; otherwise, the fish, instead of swallowing him whole, would
have chewed him up.

    Dwell on some of the miracles in the Bible. What do they tell
 us about God's power, and what kind of hope do they offer us
 now, if any?

JONAH'S UNDERSEA LAMENT.

   How long does Jonah survive in His new method of transpor-
tation in the Mediterranean? Jon. 1:17. Where else in the Old
Testament do we find this same time phrase used? 1 Sam. 30:12;
2 Kings 20:5, 8; Hos. 6:2. Note how this expression of time is also
used in the New Testament. Matt. 12:39, 40 (see also Luke 11:30).


    esus relates Jonah's miraculous deliverance from death as a sign

J   of His own passion, death, and resurrection. The prophet Hosea,
    speaking within a general time frame when Jonah's experience
would still have been talked about, takes the timing of Jonah's experi-
ence and places it within a context that talks about resurrection (Hos.
6:2). Thus, when Christ compares His death and resurrection experi-
ence to that of Jonah, He is linking it with an understanding already
found in the Old Testament.
   Back in the Mediterranean, meanwhile, Jonah hardly could have
known what suddenly caused the dramatic change from drowning in a
wet, choking darkness to an even greater darkness. It would have
taken some time to realize that the all-enveloping blackness was not
that of Sheol (Jon. 2:2), the Hebrew word for the "grave." And when
Jonah grasped that he was actually preserved alive, he regarded this as
a pledge of his deliverance.

   What does he finally do? Jon. 2:1.


   Jonah's prayer puts into words the anguish he felt as he was drown-
ing, the reactions he felt on the brink of death, along with his experi-
ence and reflections within the "great fish." He borrows many phrases
from the book of Psalms as he prays. Using phrases from the book of
Psalms in praying is not an unlikely thing to do. Even today, Chris-
tians often take at least parts of their prayers from the different psalms
in the Old Testament Psalter. The psalms also are used often today in
worship, as prayers of invocation and benediction.

    It has been said there's no such thing as an atheist in a
 foxhole (maybe also in the belly of a great fish). The sad thing is
 that Jonah was no atheist to begin with. He not only knew the
 Lord, he knew the Lord's power and had even been given a
 special calling. Why is it that so often we wait for calamity
 before availing ourselves of the divine power that's always there
 for us? Perhaps, if Jonah had been in an attitude of prayer all
 along, he would have been spared all these trials.

                                                                       49

THE EARTH AND HER BARS.

  Read Jonah 2:2-9, Jonah's prayer in the belly of the fish. Sum-
marize the essence of that prayer. What was Jonah saying?


       ompare the beginning of Jonah's prayer to Psalm 18:6 and

C      120:1. Some commentators even refer to Jonah's prayer as a
       psalm, a psalm of thanksgiving to the Lord for deliverance
from a terrible situation.
   What's fascinating, too, is that here he is, swallowed alive by a
fish—and yet he's praising God for his deliverance and salvation?
Apparently, once he realized what had happened, Jonah must have
seen the hand of the Lord and knew God was going to save him,
despite himself. Thus, even though Jonah rebelled against the Lord,
even though he attempted to flee from known duty, the Lord wasn't
through with him yet. He was still going to give this reluctant prophet
another chance.

  Read Jonah 2:4, where Jonah says, "I am cast out of thy sight."
Compare that to 1:3 and 4, when Jonah attempts to flee from the
"presence of the Lord." What's the irony there? How does Jonah's
prayer, which begins in distress, conclude? Jon. 2:9.


   Many have seen this closing declaration of God's mercy as the very
center of the book of Jonah, the central point the writer wishes to
emphasize. Jonah is constrained to admit God's saving mercy. How-
ever, the heathen mariners already have done this! In promising to
sacrifice and in making vows, the Hebrew prophet, Jonah, declares his
intention to do what the pagan sailors had already done. Again, the
irony of this situation shouldn't be overlooked.
   Chapters 1 and 2 in the book of Jonah both end with the theme of
sacrifice and vows, drawing for the reader a parallel between the
prophet's experience and that of the pagan seamen. Both faced an
extreme crisis—peril from the sea storm. Both cried to Yahweh,
acknowledging His sovereignty. Both were physically saved. Both
offered worship. Jonah comes at last to the same point the Gentile
mariners had already reached, even though it took a bit more divine
prodding to get him there.

   What we see here in Jonah is an example of God's grace,
mercy, and favor to those who don't deserve it. How have you
seen this grace manifested for you, either by God or by other
people? In what ways have you manifested grace to others?

PRAYING IN ONE'S EXTREMITY.

     onah ends his prayer by exclaiming, "Salvation is of the Lord."

J    The Hebrew word for "salvation" means not only immediate
     physical salvation but also eternal salvation, as in ultimate re-
demption (the word for "salvation" comes from the same root letters
that make up the name Jesus. Of course, Jonah's problem hasn't been
his belief in the Lord. All through chapter 1 it was clear that Jonah had
been doing what he was doing despite his belief in God. So, again, for
him to make so wonderful a proclamation about the Lord and His
power means nothing in and of itself. Jonah is one of the best ex-
amples of what is meant by "faith without works" (see James 2:18-
20). Even then, the Lord was still willing to try to turn him around.

   What other examples can we find in the Bible of faith without
works? Who comes to mind? Judas? Saul? The 12 spies? In what
different ways is this workless faith manifested?


    In his entire prayer, Jonah never confesses his rebelliousness. There
is no indication that Jonah is truly penitent. Of course, the fact that it is
not mentioned there doesn't mean that at some point, in the belly of
the fish, he didn't confess his sin. Nevertheless, the omission here
shouldn't be overlooked. And even if he didn't confess and even if he
wasn't truly penitent, it just goes to show that despite these things, the
Lord was still willing to try to work with him.

   Compare Jonah's prayer to David's in Psalm 51. What are the
similarities? The differences?


   The prayer of Jonah should encourage us that we can pray in the
midst of failure, even when our distress has been caused by our own
disobedience. This is a critical lesson to learn, because that is when it
seems the most difficult to pray. That is when we feel we have no right
to call on God. Or even if we wanted to pray, we feel we surely don't
deserve God's help. More than likely, we don't. But then again,
what's grace if it's not getting something we don't deserve?

    "When Satan comes to tell you that you are a great sinner,
 look up to your Redeemer and talk of His merits. That which
 will help you is to look to His light. Acknowledge your sin, but
 tell the enemy that 'Christ Jesus came into the world to save
 sinners' and that you may be saved by His matchless love.

B
        ut, having confessed your sins, believe that the Word of God
        cannot fail, but that He is faithful that hath promised. It is just
        as much your duty to believe that God will fulfil His word, and
forgive your sins, as it is your duty to confess your sins. You must
exercise faith in God as in one who will do exactly as He has promised
in His Word, and pardon all your transgressions."—Ellen G. White,
This Day With God, p. 89.
   "Are you one that makes mistakes? Go to Jesus, and ask Him to
forgive you, and then believe that He does. 'If we confess our sins, he
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness' (1 John 1:9). Ask the Lord to pardon your errors.
Then rejoice in Him."—Ellen G. White, The Upward Look, p. 132.
    "It will not help you in the least to keep mourning over your
defects. Say, 'Lord, I cast my helpless soul on Thee, and Thee alone. I
will not worry, because Thou hast said, "Ask, and ye shall receive." '
Believe that you do receive. Believe that your Saviour is full of
compassion, full of tender pity and love. Let not little mishaps trouble
you. Small mistakes may be ordered by the Lord to save you from
making larger mistakes."—Ellen G. White, The Upward Look, p. 132.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What would you say to someone who dismisses, out of hand,
     the Jonah story because he or she can't believe a human
     could survive inside a fish for three days? What might be
     the only answer you could give this person?

     2. Twice in Jonah's undersea psalm he makes mention of the
        temple (Jon. 2:4, 7). What is it about the temple and what it
        stands for that would make this Hebrew refer to it? Think
        of the context of his words.


SUMMARY: Swallowed alive by a big fish, Jonah is being forced to
learn the hard way what he should have known a long time earlier: that
faith without works is dead.

                         Charlotte Ishkanian

   Linda Delower's life was typical of many Aborigines. She grew
up on a sheep station in northern Australia. The family moved
from one station to another as work demanded.
   As a teen Linda started drinking and smoking with her friends;
after she married, she drank with her husband. The couple worked
for a time at an Adventist mission, and the couple put away their
destructive habits. Then Linda's husband was offered a job some
distance from the mission. The promised job did not work out, and
Linda's husband started drinking again. The couple began fight-
ing. Life became so bad that Linda finally left her husband.
    She wandered from place to place. She lost her faith, her self-
esteem. She was searching for something, but she did not know
what. She still believed in God, but she had lost her hold on Him.
She was angry about what had happened to her. For more than 10
years she was adrift in a sea of uncertainty.
    Then she met another man, Michael, and they married. Linda
felt a strong pull to return to God. She began praying, and God
gave her the victory over alcohol and tobacco.
    An Adventist who lived in the same town as Linda had a small
worship room on his land. She began attending worship with other
Aboriginal Christians and was rebaptized.
    One day Linda heard about an Adventist-operated Bible school
for Aborigines. She decided to attend the school to learn more
about the Bible. When she told her husband of her decision, he was
sad that she wanted to go, but he gave his blessing. She attends
school two weeks every two months and studies on her own be-
tween intense sessions.
    Linda loves the Bible school and the truths that God is teaching
her there, even though such intense study is difficult for her. She is
 learning how to share her faith with others, principles of health,
and lifestyle changes along with Bible study.
    During the months Linda is at home, she visits her neighbors
 and patients in the hospital, sharing with them her love for the
 Lord.
    Today Linda is a leader in her little congregation in northern
 Australia. She preaches when a preacher is needed and leads out in
 Bible study time. Some of her relatives are studying the Bible with
 the pastor and plan to become Adventists.

               Second Chances




Sabbath Afternoon


I
     T'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT so much has happened so far
     in Jonah (and we've covered only two chapters and even did so
     somewhat sparingly). Of the many points brought out, perhaps one
of the most important is this: The same God who was working in
Jonah is the same God who is working in our lives today. Our trials,
adventures, and experiences might not be as dramatic, our call might
not be as intense, but God's concern and love for Jonah is no different
from His concern and love for us. If only we had the faith to believe
that! Look what the Lord did for Jonah, all in order to bring the
reluctant prophet to where He wanted him to be. Will He not do as
much for us, if that's what it takes (let's hope, though, that it doesn't
take that much)?
    What we see here, in Jonah, is a unique expression of what we see
all through the Scriptures—God's amazing grace working upon hearts
open to receive it, even if it takes a bit of prodding along the way.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: How did Jonah get out of the fish?
Why did God give him a second chance? How do we see God's
grace expressed in this story?

     MEMORY TEXT: "0 Lord, Thou hast searched me and known
     me! Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up; thou
     discernest my thoughts from afar. Thou searchest out my path

THE "WORD" REAPPEARS.

  "And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
upon the dry land" (Jon. 2:10).



M
          any translations of the above text miss a certain nuance in
          the language. Translated in a moral literal fashion, the
          verse reads, "And the Lord said to the fish, and it vomited
out Jonah." The phrase "and the Lord [or God] said" is exceedingly
common throughout the Bible.
   All through the Genesis Creation account, for example, there is the
phrase "and God said." "And God said, Let there be light. . . ." "And
God said, Let there be a firmament. . . ." "And God said, Let the earth
bring forth grass. . . ." and so forth (see Genesis 1). In Jonah, we have
the same verbal form used in a manner that, again, shows the Lord's
power over His creation. Indeed, if He could speak the world and
nature into existence, there's no question He can control it, too, as
we've seen all through the first few chapters of Jonah.

  Read Jonah 3:1. What do we see in this text, that reflects what
we've seen in Jonah 1:1?


   Here, too, we see God's actions manifested through His "word."
Look up these verses and see how the "word" of the Lord appears in
the Bible: Psalms 33:6; 107:19, 20; Isaiah 55:10, 11. These texts show
how God carries out His will on the earth. It is through His "word"
that He gets things done on the earth.
    There is an ancient Jewish translation of the Bible into Aramaic
called the Targums, which was highly influential in the synagogues.
Look at how closely it relates the "word of the Lord" with the Lord
Himself: The Bible says, "God created man" (Gen. 1:27); the Targums
translates it, "And the Word of the Lord created man." The Bible says,
"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth" (Gen.
6:6, 7); the Targums translates it, "And it repented the Lord that
through His Word He made man on the earth." The Bible says that
Abraham "believed in the Lord" (Gen. 15:6); according to the Targums,
Abraham "believed in the Word of the Lord." There are many other
examples, as well.

    Concepts like "the word of God" are hard for us to understand
 completely. The important point is that God is at work in
 this world. He still manifests His power here, and the greatest
 manifestation of that was through Jesus, the Word. What comfort
 do we get from the fact that we are not alone, not abandoned, not
 left to our own devices in this harsh, sinful planet?
                                                                       57

SECOND CHANCES.

     onah is back where he started from. In the Hebrew, the first

J    words of chapter 3 are almost an exact repetition of the opening
     words in chapter 1. Jonah is given a second chance, despite his
initial disobedience. He deliberately and stubbornly rebelled against
God. The marvel is that his actions are not enough to make God turn
His back on him. It should cause great wonder in our thinking that,
despite his rebellion, God still calls Jonah another time. The God of
the Bible is the God of second chances. He doesn't just dismiss Jonah
in his petulant disobedience. However, this aspect of God's grace is
not rare or unusual.

     Whom else has God offered a second chance to? Gen. 22:1-10.


   "God had called Abraham to be the father of the faithful, and his life
was to stand as an example of faith to succeeding generations. But his
faith had not been perfect. He had shown distrust of God in concealing
the fact that Sarah was his wife, and again in his marriage with Hagar.
That he might reach the highest standard, God subjected him to another
test."—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 147.

     Who else got another chance? Gen. 28:10-22.


   "Threatened with death by the wrath of Esau, Jacob went out from
his father's home a fugitive. . . .
   "The evening of the second day found him far away from his
father's tents. He felt that he was an outcast, and he knew that all this
trouble had been brought upon him by his own wrong course. The
darkness of despair pressed upon his soul, and he hardly dared to pray.
But he was so utterly lonely that he felt the need of protection from
God as he had never felt it before. With weeping and deep humiliation
he confessed his sin, and entreated for some evidence that he was not
utterly forsaken. . . .
   "But God did not forsake Jacob. His mercy was still extended to
His erring, distrustful servant. The Lord compassionately revealed
just what Jacob needed—a Saviour."—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 183. And thus God gave Jacob the vision of the
heavenly ladder filled with angels.

   How many times in your own life has the Lord given you
"second chances"? How is confession and repentance an expres-
sion of the second chances we've been given, again and again?

THE GIFT OF GOD.

        o question, this picture of God, as presented here in the Old

N       Testament, reveals a great deal about His divine character.
        Our God is a forgiving God, a pardoning God, a God of love
and mercy. The whole plan of salvation rests upon the idea of forgive-
ness, of us having done something terrible, deserving of death, and yet
God, through Christ, offering us life.

   Look up these texts. What are they all basically saying about
us, about our nature, about our characters, and about our deeds?
Isa. 53:6; 64:6; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 3:23; 5:12?




   As we look around in the world, who can deny the truthfulness of
these Bible texts? In fact, we don't have to look around; looking inside
ourselves is more than enough.
   Yet, what we see with Jonah, with God giving him another chance,
is a small object lesson of what God has done for the whole human
race because of Jesus on the cross. Through Him, we have all been
given a second chance at life; we have all been given the opportunity
to receive for ourselves the glorious redemption that Christ offers the
world.

   Read carefully and prayerfully Ephesians 2:1-10. How do these
verses encapsulate the essence of what was written above? As you
read, notice how the words sins, dead, trespasses, disobedience,
lust, flesh, and wrath are used to describe us, our actions, and our
character. In contrast, what words are used in those verses to
describe the Lord, His actions, and His character?




    Take a look at your own life. In what ways can you see
 yourself mirrored in those verses written by Paul? Trace in your
 own mind where you once were and where the Lord has now
 taken you. Compare yourself with Jonah, at least as we see him
 so far. What parallels can you see?

                                                                      59

SECOND CHANCES AGAIN.

       otice the title of this week's lesson. It's not called "Second

N      Chance" but "Second Chances." And with good reason.
       Though the book of Jonah presents him as being given a
second chance, in reality, who of us doesn't need more than a second
chance? If all we had was a second chance, as opposed to many
second chances, who would be saved?

   Read 1 John 1:8-2:1. How do these verses exemplify the idea
that we, even as followers of Christ, need more than one "second
chance"? To whom are these words addressed? Believers or non-
believers? What point does John make about the actions of those
to whom he is writing? Focus carefully on verse 8 (the Greek verb
have appears in the present tense).




   Can any of us seriously claim that once we accepted Christ and
were given a chance to start over, we never had to go back to the Cross
and ask for forgiveness again? This doesn't mean that each time we
sin we are lost; it means only that we need to be forgiven more than
once.
   Indeed, if we are honest with ourselves, we have to admit God has
been even more gracious and forgiving with us than the two times we
have seen in Jonah's life. And when we aren't so focused on the sins
of others and the work God needs to do in their lives, we become more
sensitive to just how many times God has given grace to us.
   "Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. You may say, I am
sinful, very sinful. You may be; but the worse you are, the more you
need Jesus. He turns no weeping, contrite one away. He does not tell
to any all that He might reveal, but He bids every trembling soul take
courage. Freely will He pardon all who come to Him for forgiveness
and restoration."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 568.
   When we are honest enough with ourselves to recall how God has
brought us up out of the pits we have dug for ourselves, we can better
appreciate God's grace to His recalcitrant prophet Jonah.

   Go back to 1 John, the verses we looked at today. Then read
1 John 2:3-6. How do you understand the relationship, the
balance, between these two blocks of text, one stressing the
reality of sin in our lives, the other stressing the need for
obedience to the law?

ANOTHER TRY.

   The "word of the Lord" came to Jonah again. What did He say
to him? Jon. 3:2.




T
      he divine directive, "Up! Go to the great city of Nineveh," is
      identical with the first one God gave Jonah before his amazing
      adventure in the Mediterranean Sea. Nineveh is still the me-
tropolis God wants him to reach. He will not be frustrated by the
impudence of His prophet.

   What is Jonah's response this time? Jon. 3:3.


   As in chapter 1, Jonah went. But this time, instead of trying to
"flee . . . from the presence of the Lord," he obeys "according to the
word of the Lord." Notice how the text describes what happened to
Jonah next (Jon. 3:3, 4). Jonah is told to go, and the next thing we
know, he's there. No mention is made of the long journey Jonah
would have had to make. This is in direct contrast to his initial travels
in the first two chapters. Instead, our attention is now taken immedi-
ately to the city of Nineveh. There was a reason for the description of
Jonah's first journey: It exposed the nature of Jonah's rebellion against
God. But now that Jonah obeys, the journey is not important to detail.

   How is Nineveh described? Jon. 3:3.


    As in Jonah 1:2, Nineveh is again described as a great city. (The
literal meaning of the phrase is: "a great city to God.") And indeed,
it was large and important by the standards of the time. We can also
be sure that Nineveh is "great" to God in light of all the trouble He
takes to get Jonah there! The size of Nineveh is suggested by the
final phrase in verse 3: "three days' journey." The words in the
original language read more literally as "a walk of three days." Such
a designation in ancient records can suggest a day's journey in from
the suburbs, one day for business, and one day for the return. This
interpretation fits well with verse 4.

    God commissions a Hebrew prophet to go to the capital city
 of Assyria, taking a message of judgment. At a time when Israel-
 ites were no doubt praying that the Assyrians might be de-
 stroyed, God is extending a hand of mercy to them. What's the
 message for us? (See Matt. 5:44; Luke 6:27, 35.)

                                                                      61

duty done. There is a work to be done in foreign fields, but there is a
work to be done in America that is just as important. In the cities of
America there are people of almost every language. These need the
light that God has given to His church."—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 8, p. 36.
   "While plans are being carried out to warn the inhabitants of
various nations in distant lands, much must be done in behalf of the
foreigners who have come to the shores of our own land. The souls in
China are no more precious than the souls within the shadow of our
doors. God's people are to labor faithfully in distant lands, as His
providence may open the way; and they are also to fulfil their duty
toward the foreigners of various nationalities in the cities and villages
and country districts close by."—Ellen G. White, Christian Service,
p. 199.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Look up other texts in the Bible in which the phrase the
     "word of the Lord" is found. Examples are Genesis 15:1,
     Numbers 36:5, Psalm 33:4, Isaiah 1:10, and 2:3. In many
     cases, you can replace that phrase with the name "Jesus,"
     and it makes perfect theological sense. What important
     truth does this teach us?

     2. The Bible teaches that we can be given many chances, even
        after we blow it. However, we must remember that God is
        not mocked; those who presume upon the grace of God are
        in danger of facing the wrath of God. At what point can we
        step beyond the bounds of forgiveness? Obviously, we can,
        because there will be professed Christians who are lost
        (Matt. 7:22). When this happens, is it because God has
        changed His mind about us, or does it happen because
        we've become so hard in our sin that we no longer turn
        back to God for forgiveness? Discuss your understanding of
        this process; be prepared to talk about it in class.

SUMMARY: Jonah is given a much-needed second chance. Who,
among us, can't relate?

                    I'll Kill That Teacher!
                           Peter Sinagpulo

    An epidemic of German measles struck the isolated Manobo village
in the mountains of southern Philippines. Already two babies had died,
and many more children were sick. These people are not vaccinated
against childhood diseases, because their villages are too isolated, too
dangerous and too difficult to hike 10. The nearest hospital was a day's
hike down the mountain, and my student-missionary partner and I had
no medicines to help the sick ones.
    We went from one hut to another, praying and offering what help
we could. In one hut we found a baby lying on a mat, gasping for
breath. The family had gathered to watch, weep, and wait for death.
    We had no medicines, but we offered to pray. We wet a small towel
and bathed the baby, then we asked God to heal the child. The father
stared silently at us, his face crowded with worry and puzzlement.
"How can a wet towel heal our baby?" he asked, agitated.
    We explained that it could help bring down the baby's fever. We
prepared to leave, sure that God would answer our prayer. We shook
hands with the family members, but the father refused and stared at us
coldly.
    "What is wrong, sir?" I asked. But he said nothing. We felt sure that
if the child died, the father would blame us.
    We had barely reached our cottage when somebody ran toward us.
"Sir! Sir! The father is very angry. He knows that the wet towel is not
medicine, and he has threatened to kill you both!"
    We entered our cottage and knelt to pray once more. "Lord, our
Great Physician, there is nothing else we can do to save the baby.
Please spare her life as well as ours. Amen." We claimed promises of
God's protection, then we prepared for bed.
    Through the spaces between the boards of our hut, we saw some-
thing move. Figures silhouetted in the moonlight walked toward our
 hut. It was the family of the sick baby. They walked past our cottage
toward a relative's hut, but the father kept staring at our cottage. All
 was quiet again, and we fell asleep.
    The next morning someone knocked at our door. It was the baby's
 father. This time his face wore a smile, and in his hand he carried some
 sweet potatoes. "Thank you, teacher," he said. "My baby is well now!"
    We pray that the father and others in this village will learn to love
 and trust the Great Healer whom we worship.

           Jonah, the Amazing
               Evangelist




Sabbath Afternoon

     ONAH ARRIVES IN THE Assyrian capital city of Nineveh. He

J    proclaims the announcement that God has given him. What
     happens in the city is remarkable. We find a picture of true repen-
tance from people whom we would not expect to be repentant. In fact,
their repentance far exceeds anything seen so far in the prophet Jonah.
    What accounted for this remarkable turnaround? The text really
doesn't say. When we consider that conversion is personal and often
rare, the fact that a whole city of pagans undergoes such an experience
is amazing. No doubt here, as in many Bible narratives, a lot of details
are missing; thus, we can go only with what we have, which is enough
to give us another view of God's love toward sinners.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What was the essence of Jonah's
message? What didn't Jonah's message say? How long were the
people given before judgment would fall? How did the people
respond? How did the king respond? In what ways does their
action reveal the link between faith and works?
   What lessons can we, as a church, learn about faith, repentance,
and obedience from the experience of the Ninevites?

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'So shall My word be which goes forth
     from My mouth; it shall not return to Me empty, without
     accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding in the
     matter for which I sent it' " (Isaiah 55:11, NASB).

PREACHING IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF ASSYRIA.

   "And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown"
(Jon. 3:4).

   t would be fascinating to have Jonah's sermon outlines or sermon
   notes; that is, to know what Jonah preached that had such a
Ipowerful impact upon this pagan nation.
   All we know is what we have been told here in the text, and notice,
according to the text, what his sermon notes probably didn't contain.
He wasn't preaching monotheism (that there is only one God) or about
God's infinite love or about the hope and promise of eternity. Nor was
Jonah commissioned to seek ecumenical unity. Instead, Jonah had one
specific message for the Ninevites. Turn from your evil ways or face
divine judgment.

   What did Jonah specifically warn them about? Jon. 3:4.


   Judgment is a key theme in the Bible; it's as pervasive in Scripture
as is the theme of salvation, which makes sense, because both con-
cepts are related. For the wicked, judgment leads to death and destruc-
tion; for the righteous, judgment promises vindication, justice, and
salvation. Either way, in the end, no one—neither the righteous nor
the wicked—escape judgment.

   The concept of judgment appears in various ways in Scripture.
Look up these texts. Taken together, what do they tell us about
judgment? Gen. 15:14; Pss. 1:5; 19:9; Eccles. 3:17; 12:14; Dan.
7:22; Luke 21:36; John 12:47; Acts 17:31; 1 John 4:17; Rev. 20:12.


   Theologians say that God's last word isn't judgment but salvation.
Look at John 12:47: Here is the essence behind all God's judgments,
which is His desire to save. He judged Egypt only after its continued
rebellion; He judged the world with the Flood only after people
refused to hearken to His words; and even now, with Nineveh, He uses
the warning of judgment in order to save them. In other words, He
threatens them with destruction as a means of preserving them.

    Though we don't have the details of what Jonah presented to
 the Ninevites, why did it appear to be a gloom-and-doom mes-
 sage? Unless you obey, you will be destroyed. How do we recon-
 cile that idea with the notion of God wanting us to serve Him
 only out of love, not fear?
                                                                     65
Monday                                           November 17
YET FORTY DAYS.

  How long does God give the Ninevites before the city will be
overturned? In what other instances is that same number used?
Gen. 7:17; Exod. 24:18; Num. 14:33, 34; Matt. 4:2; Mark 1:13;
Luke 4:2; Acts 1:3. Are there any parallels to the uses of that
number in these texts and what happens here in the book of
Jonah? If so, what are they?




    Whatever Jonah said, in detail, to these people, there's no question:
It worked. The phrase in Jonah 3:5 "from the greatest of them even to
the least of them" (literally, "from their greatest to their least") is a
common way to express totality in Hebrew. The entire city of wicked
Gentiles accepts what Jonah says about judgment as the truth.
    As we saw with the pagan mariners of chapter 1, here again non-
Israelites turn to the God of heaven. The notoriously wicked pagan
citizenry of Nineveh accept Jonah's judgment message with all seri-
ousness. They believe he is proclaiming the words of God.

  When Jonah presents the dire warning to the city of Nineveh,
what is the astonishing result? Jon. 3:5.


   Notice, the Ninevites didn't just believe Jonah; they believed God
(Jon. 3:5). In this case, worshipers of other gods are not necessarily
unaware of or resistant to the one supreme Deity and Judge, and when
confronted with His word, they respond.
   In this case, the Ninevites accept that the threatened judgment is
deserved. This reminds us of the biblical perspective that there is in
each person, whether a pagan or a believer, a conscience that can be
touched by the power of God.

   Look again at Jonah 3:5. The people "believed God." The
Hebrew word there for "believed" comes from the same Hebrew
word found in Genesis 15:6, regarding Abraham and his faith.
Though the book of Jonah isn't talking about any kind of deep
Pauline conception of justification by faith, it still, nevertheless,
stressed their belief. Do you think this "belief," as expressed
here in Jonah, is the same thing as faith, as commonly under-
stood in Christianity? (See also Heb. 11:6.) Give reasons for
your answer.

A PAGAN CONVERSION EXPERIENCE (See Jon. 3:5-8).



T
       he Ninevites admit the divine judgment is deserved. And
      they display their conviction through outward signs of repetance:
      fasting and wearing sackcloth. This self-humiliation is a means
of expressing submission to God. When we think of all the work often
needed to bring one soul to genuine repentance, it's amazing here to
see a whole city (pagans, no less) doing it, as well.

  Who else besides the general population heard the call to judg-
ment? Jon. 3:6.


   The kings of these ancient Near Eastern nations weren't known for
their humility or attitude of repentance, especially before a "foreign"
God. However, something powerful happened to this one here.
   The title "king of Nineveh" would more generally be described as
the "king of Assyria." But Assyria is never mentioned in the book.
Thus, the writer underscores how the book of Jonah is concerned
specifically with Nineveh. This also accords with the accepted prac-
tice of permitting the name of a chief city to stand for a country in
written documents. In the city of Nineveh, we find the king including
himself in the earnest supplication of God.

   What does the king do in response to Jonah's message?


    Notice the movement of the unnamed king. He goes from sitting on
a throne and wearing his royal robe to being covered in sackcloth and
sitting in ashes. From a throne to ashes, from a royal robe to sackcloth.
If this doesn't sound like true repentance, what does?
    This heathen ruler does not use modern techniques of denying
culpability. He has been wrong, and he is honest enough to admit it.
Far from considering himself in a category apart from the morality of
the citizenry of Nineveh, the king sets an example to his people by
acknowledging his own need to repent. He does not doubt that God is
right to be angry with Nineveh. And thus, this pagan king repents
before the King of kings.

    However dramatic the king's example, what happened to him
 that needs to happen to all those who would become true follow-
 ers of the Lord? Why, in a sense, does what happened to the king
 need to happen to us every day? (See Luke 18:13; 1 Cor. 15:31;
 Col. 2:6.)


                                                                      67

THE KING CALLS NINEVEH TO REPENTANCE.

  What is the remarkable pronouncement the king then issues?
Jon. 3:7-9.




A
        fast is one thing; to not drink is another. And when one
        usually thinks of a fast, one doesn't usually think of it apply-
         rig to animals, as well. However, for whatever reasons, even
the beasts aren't to eat or to drink. Whether the Lord required that or
not is questionable. What isn't questionable is that the Ninevites take
Jonah's words very seriously. Also, mention of flocks and herds
suggests that the heralds journey beyond the city walls to the rural
areas generally surrounding major walled cities then.

     What else does the king urge the people to do? Jon. 3:8.


   The king urges the Ninevites to "call insistently/mightily to God"
in earnest prayer. Both humans and animals are to be clothed in
sackcloth, the garb of penitence. Sackcloth expresses witness for grief
of sin that makes a person vile. Wearing it gives evidence of the
bankrupt state that sin brings. Its coarseness reminds the wearer of the
vulgarity of transgression. It prompts remembrance as to how a sinner
appears in the presence of a holy God. The ashes speak of the fire that
consumes and what the ultimate end of sin will be.

  What further action does the king urge upon the people of
Nineveh? Jon. 3:8.


   Note the striking picture of a pagan king urging pagan people to
call upon God earnestly (the pagan sailors had done this already). The
king also singles out a particular vice prevalent in Nineveh. Of all the
spectrum of evils that could have been cited, the king singles out
violence. God had not been mistaken in His call to judgment. Violence
was a characteristic of the Assyrians. It still is graphically visible in
carefully carved granite panels archaeologists have found, that portray
Assyrian violence in military conquests. The king himself readily
acknowledges the violent nature of Nineveh's culture.

   Why is the call to change their actions so important here?
The people believed God (faith), and they covered themselves in
sackcloth and fasted (repentance). But what would their
repentance have meant if they didn't change their ways, as well?

A PICTURE OF TRUE REPENTANCE.

  What urgent motivation does the king now add to his procla-
mation? Jon. 3:9.




T
       he king realizes that forgiveness for their sin was dependent
       upon the mercy of the great God of heaven and earth. The king
       is as perceptive as is the sea captain during the terrifying storm
in chapter 1, when he implores Jonah to pray: " 'Arise, call on your
God; perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish —
(Jon. 1:6, NKJV, emphasis supplied). Notice how this parallels what
the king himself is thinking (Jon. 3:9). In both cases, neither the king
nor the sea captain are sure what is going to happen; in both cases,
they rely totally on the mercy of a God more powerful than they. And
in both cases, only by God's grace do they have any chance at all.

   What was it about their actions that causes God to "repent"
(actually, the Hebrew word often, and unfortunately, translated
"repent" carries with it the idea of "feeling compassion")? In
other words, of all the things the previous texts say the Ninevites
did (believed, fasted, put on sackcloth, had their animals fast),
what does the text specify that the Lord "saw," which causes Him
not to do what He said He would do? What point should that make
for us? (See also James 2:2-26.)


  How is the depth of their repentance later recalled? Matt.
12:41.


   Their repentance is later mentioned by Jesus. Jonah's own people,
the Israelites, despite their special covenant relationship with God,
don't have this same kind of corporate experience. Ultimately, they
fail to repent and, therefore, experience judgment.
   We are thus reminded once again that God deals with all humanity
on the same basis, without partiality. Ultimately, both Nineveh and
Jerusalem are destroyed. God deals evenly with the human race.

    It is remarkable and sadly ironic how much more trouble
 God has had with Jonah, one of His own people, than with the
 worst of the heathen world! How amazing the willingness of the
 Ninevites to turn away from and forsake their evil ways. What
 specific lesson should we, as Seventh-day Adventists, learn from
 this point? Is not there some Jonah in us, as well?

         ineveh, wicked though it had become, was not wholly given

an unmistakable manner, to lead them, if possible, to repentance."

   " 'And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men everywhere to repent.' In the ages of darkness
that had preceded the advent of Christ, the divine Ruler had passed
lightly over the idolatry of the heathen; but now, through His Son, He
had sent men the light of truth; and He expected from all repentance
unto salvation, not only from the poor and humble, but from the proud
philosopher and the princes of the earth. 'Because He hath appointed a
day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man
whom He hath ordained; whereof He hath given assurance unto all
men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.' As Paul spoke of the
resurrection from the dead, 'some mocked: and others said, We will
hear thee again of this matter.' "—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 239.
   "The pardon granted by this king represents a divine forgiveness of
all sin. Christ is represented by the king, who, moved with compas-
sion, forgave the debt of his servant. Man was under the condemnation
of the broken law. He could not save himself, and for this reason
Christ came to this world."—Ellen G. White, Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 244.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Someone once said, "How can we tell when a sin has been
     pardoned? By the fact that we no longer commit that sin."
     Nice thought, but do you agree? Support your answer.

     2. Look again at Jonah 3:10. It says that God decided not to do
        what He said He would do. What does that mean, and what
        implications could it have for us, both as individuals or as a
        church body? How does this quote help us understand this
        principle? "It should be remembered that the promises and
        the threatenings of God are alike conditional."—Ellen G.
        White, Evangelism, p. 695.

SUMMARY: The Ninevites bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.
What a lesson for those quick to judge the spiritual state of others.

                      Transformed Lives
                            J. H. Zachary

   Willie and Charlotte Walkus are native Americans living on
Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. They had let alco-
holism rob them of a meaningful life, dignity, and happiness. "For
20 years I lived only for the next drink," Willie said. "I slept
wherever I could find shelter, often on the city streets."
   Charlotte remained at home with their children, but she, too,
struggled with alcohol. "I often verbally and physically abused my
children when I was drunk," she admits.
   In sober moments Willie remembered his godly grandfather,
who prayed every day. "I knew that there was a God somewhere,
but I did not know where to find him," Willie said.
   Willie had a Christian aunt who fasted and prayed for him. One I
day while the aunt was praying, Willie reached for a bottle of
alcohol and held it to his lips, "but I could not swallow," he said.
Then a strange sensation moved through his body, and he became
paralyzed; he could not even speak. Someone called an ambu-
lance, and Willie was rushed to the hospital. He thought he would
die there.
    Lying in the hospital, Willie prayed, "God, if you are there,
please help me. I will serve you the rest of my life." God saved
Willie's life. But Willie returned to the streets and soon was
drinking again.
    Willie realized that in his own strength he could never keep his
promise to God. One day he prayed a different prayer, "Lord, I am
yours, please help me." About the same time Charlotte also turned
her life over to God.
    The couple began attending the Adventist church and started on
the long journey of spiritual growth. "Our lives have been totally
changed," she says. "God has freed me from evil habits, made me
a better mother and a good example to my children." The trans-
 formed Walkus family is a powerful example to others of what
 Jesus can do in their own lives.
    "My family has felt the precious love of God," Willie said.
"I want everyone to know that no matter who you are or how
 far you have fallen into sin, God will hear your cry and come to
 help."

         Conversing With God




Sabbath Afternoon
    ONAH HAS COMPLETED A MOST successful preaching

J    mission. The citizens of the capital city of Nineveh, from the
     least to the greatest, accepted his judgment message and turned in
repentance to the God of heaven. Jonah can now travel home, full of
joy and thanksgiving for the mighty power of God to change even
violently wicked pagan hearts. This is what one might expect. But the
book of Jonah has still more surprises.
   All through the book of Jonah God has far more trouble with His
prophet than with the most profligate of the heathen world. The
wicked Ninevites in chapter 3 respond in repentance to the call of
judgment from God. Jonah obeys God only after being subjected to
the most extreme divine measures. Even the pagan king humbly sub-
mits to God's sovereign authority, recognizing that God is not obli-
gated to spare the city. Jonah presumes upon God's mercy.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: How did Jonah respond to the
amazing repentance of the Ninevites? What was it about Jonah
that made his attitude even more repugnant? What was this prophet's
problem? By his attitude, whom was Jonah emulating? What does
this story reveal to us about God's grace and about the limits of
humans to understand that grace fully?

     MEMORY TEXT: "For I have no pleasure in the death of
     anyone,' says the Lord God. 'Turn, then, and live" (Ezekiel
     18:32, NRSV).

UNEXPECTED RESPONSE.

         ne of the most unexpected verses in Scripture is Jonah 4:1. In

0        the Hebrew, the text reads: "And it was evil to Jonah, a great
         evil, and he was furious at it." Furious at what? What was
this "great evil"? It was that the Ninevites had turned from their sin
and violence, and, therefore, the judgment that was to fall on them
didn't.
    Imagine an evangelist holding a series in a city known for wicked-
ness and then getting depressed when the whole city turns out and
accepts the message!
    What's going on here? Why would Jonah feel this way?
    Perhaps he felt that these wicked Assyrians had done so much evil
that they deserved punishment and that the grace God extended to
them violated the basic forms of justice. Maybe feeling purely nation-
alistic, he wanted God's judgment to fall upon these heathen. Maybe
he felt that because the judgment hadn't fallen, he would be viewed as
a false prophet. Whatever the reason, here's the situation: A prophet
of God is angry that the Lord has shown mercy to repentant people.
It's hard to imagine a worse sin.

   However bad Jonah's reaction, what happened to him person-
ally that made his reaction even worse? See Jon. 1:17-2:10.




   Perhaps one of the greatest lessons we can learn from Jonah's
reaction is that it reveals, in a unique way, the grace of God—not as it
was expressed toward the Ninevites (though it was) but how it was
expressed toward Jonah. The Lord knew Jonah's heart, knew how
Jonah would react, and yet chose him anyway and was still willing to
work with him, despite his bad attitude. All through the Bible, we see
this principle at work.

    Look up these texts. Make a list of the character flaws they
 reveal. Gen. 9:20, 21; Gen. 16:1-4; Num. 20:11, 12; 2 Sam. 11:4;
 Matt. 11:3; Acts 15:35-41; and Gal. 2:11-14. What do they tell us
 about God's willingness to work with us, and even to use us,
 despite our faults, as he did with Jonah?




                                                                     73

JONAH'S SIN (Jon. 4:2).



T
       he first time we see Jonah praying is in the belly of the fish,
      when he's asking for deliverance from destruction; the next
      time we see him praying is here, in chapter 4, where he's
angry because God delivered others from destruction. Talk about
hypocrisy!
   Basically, Jonah was saying that the reason he didn't want to go to
Nineveh was that he knew God was merciful. Thus, he's confessing,
clearly, that he didn't want God to spare these people. If that's not
amazing enough, the Lord, knowing his attitude, used him anyway.
Surely, God's grace is greater than human wisdom allows for.

   Look at the content of what Jonah says is the character of God
(Jon. 4:2). What are the attributes listed there? (See also Exod.
34:6, 7; Num. 14:18; Ps. 86:15; Joel 2:13.) What is the great irony
here of this confession? (Who, in many ways, was the greatest
recipient of God's grace, mercy, and kindness, Jonah or the
Ninevites?) On the lines below, write out each characteristic Jonah
mentions and then a sentence in your own words describing what
you think each one of those characteristics means.




   For Christians, the concept of God's mercy, grace, and patience
isn't just theological doctrines. They should be part of the experience
of what it means to be a Christian, of what it means to walk with the
Lord. After all, if we have a relationship with God, if we love God, we
should have experienced, for ourselves, what His mercy, grace, pa-
tience, and so forth are like.

   How have you experienced these aspects of God's character
in your own life? What kind of personal testimony could you
give to the reality of these attributes of God?

THE MYSTERY OF GOD'S GRACE.

           hat we see with Jonah is a small example of how limited

W          humanity is in its understanding of God's grace, which—in
           its greatest expression—was revealed at the Cross. How can
we, as humans, understand the love of a God who would do this for
beings who are such a tiny—at least in a physical sense—part of His
creation? We can't—at least not fully; that's why we have to (1)
experience this love and grace ourselves and (2) take it on faith.
    In the context of Jesus, of His death providing a sufficient atone-
ment for the world as being something that modern men living in the
scientific age could no longer take seriously, Richard Tarnas wrote:
"The sheer improbability of the whole nexus of events was becom-
ing painfully obvious—that an infinite eternal God would have sud-
denly become a particular human being in a specific historical time
and place only to be ignominiously executed. That a single brief life
taking place two millennia earlier in an obscure primitive nation, on
a planet now known to be a relatively insignificant piece of matter
revolving about one star among billions in an inconceivably vast and
impersonal universe—that such an undistinguished event should have
any overwhelming cosmic or eternal meaning could no longer be a
compelling belief for reasonable men. It was starkly implausible that
the universe as a whole would have any pressing interest in this
minute part of immensity—if it had any 'interests' at all."—The
Passion of the Western Mind (New York: Ballantine Books, 1993),
p. 305.
    In contrast, Ellen White wrote: "It will be profitable to contemplate
the divine condescension, the sacrifice, the self-denial, the humilia-
tion, the resistance the Son of God encountered in doing His work for
fallen men. . . . Angels marvel, as with intense interest they watch the
Son of God descending step by step the path of humiliation. It is the
mystery of godliness. It is the glory of God to conceal Himself and His
ways, not by keeping men in ignorance of heavenly light and knowl-
edge, but by surpassing the utmost capacity of men to know. Human-
 ity can comprehend in part, but that is all that man can bear. The love
 of Christ passes knowledge. The mystery of redemption will continue
 to be the mystery, the unexhausted science and everlasting song of
 eternity. Well may humanity exclaim, Who can know God? We may,
 as did Elijah, wrap our mantles about us, and listen to hear the still,
 small voice of God."—The Bible Echo, April 30, 1894.

    Using these verses (1 Cor. 2:7; 3:19; Eph. 3:9; Phil. 4:7; Col.
2:2; 1 John 4:10) and any others you find relevant, as well as
 what Ellen White wrote above, pen a paragraph answering
 Tarnas's challenge to the Christian faith.

                                                                      75
Wednesday                                      November 26
GOD TOO IS MERCIFUL?

         pparently, not only a modern like Richard Tarnas has trouble

A        understanding God's grace; poor Jonah did, too, which is why
         he didn't want to preach to Nineveh. He didn't want them to
get something they didn't deserve. But that's always what grace is
about: getting what we don't deserve.
    One of the Lord's early expressions of profound grace was pro-
claimed to Israel following their great apostasy worshiping the golden
calf in the wilderness (see Exod. 34:6). At that point, they might
rightfully have been forsaken by God. As a result, this revelation of
God's mercy, and grace, was especially precious to Israel.

   Read over Exodus 32. In what ways was Israel's guilt worse
than that of the Ninevites? Contrast the attitude of Moses to that
of Jonah. What could have caused such a profound difference?


   However grateful Jonah was for God's mercy toward him, he was
upset that these marvelous, gracious attributes of Israel's God were to
be shared with a wicked people like the Ninevites. He is now highly
critical of these divine qualities of grace and lovingkindness. He
thinks that God should reserve His salvation for the righteous and that
judgment should be the destiny of the wicked.

  Who else manifests this same spirit as Jonah? (see Zech. 3:1-7;
Rev. 12:10). How does this show how bad Jonah's attitude was?


   Jonah sees the deferment of judgment on Nineveh as a mistake. He
disapproves strongly of wasting the Lord's compassion on these people.
His reasoning reveals how he presumes to govern God's world better
than God Himself! Ultimately, Jonah's underlying reason for running
away from God's commission has less to do with Nineveh's vile
sinners than with the character of God.
   However, the wicked Ninevites are really no different from Jonah.
The Ninevites and Jonah are all rebellious sinners deserving only
punishment. Yet, God graciously decides to show them mercy. Jonah
is willing to accept this mercy for himself but not for Nineveh.

    Geraldo's unbelieving brother had been murdered by a man
 who, subsequently, went to prison, where he was later converted.
 Geraldo, however, struggles with what he believes is a great injus-
 tice: salvation for a murderer and death for his brother. How
 would you answer his questions about God's justness?

GOD'S PATIENCE WITH JONAH.

  How does God appeal to Jonah after the prophet, so upset over
God's mercy, asks to die? Jon. 4:4.


    onah's gracious and merciful God quietly asks Jonah a searching

J   question. With only three words in Hebrew, God urges Jonah to
    reconsider.

   Compare and contrast what the Lord says to Jonah in verse 4
with what He said to Cain (Gen. 4:6). What are the parallels in the
issues addressed in both incidents?


   God's response to Jonah is surprisingly mild. He yearns for Jonah
to come to see the childishness of his behavior. Helping this stubborn
person become a more mature believer seems to be one of His main
goals. In light of this amazing conversation with Jonah in chapter 4,
this goal seems equally as important to Him as was the salvation of
Nineveh. God challenges Jonah to think about his reaction and to
analyze his thinking. God is gently suggesting to Jonah that he might
not be correct in his estimate of the situation. Jonah is not the only
person in Scripture who has been troubled by the ways of God.

   Think of others in Scripture who experience deep agony as they
wrestle with God's ways. Job 7:17-21; Jer. 15:15-18. What is the
essence of their complaints, and how do those complaints differ
from Jonah's? Read also Luke 9:52-56. Compare what happened
there with what happened with Jonah here in chapter 4.


   No other nation, corporately, ever wrestled with God with the same
depth or intensity as Israel did. All through the Old Testament, a rich
tapestry of such encounters displays rage, despair, and anguish. The
Psalter is a prime collection of such struggles.
   Though Christians today generally prefer the praise psalms, many
of the 150 psalms are filled with pain and protest. And recall that these
were sung by the Israelites even in worship. The intensity of the
relationship with God in the Old Testament seems irreverent to some
now. But, perhaps, it is more a matter of our own immaturity in our
relationship with God. God does not chide hurting believers. In fact,
He always shows amazing respect with all such expressions, Jonah
included. God apparently values honesty in our relationship with Him.
We do not have to deny reality when praying reverently to God.

                                                                      77

FURTHER STUDY:



T
        here are mysteries in the plan of redemption . . . that are to the
       heavenly angels subjects of continual amazement. The apostle
       Peter, speaking of the revelations given to the prophets of 'the
sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow,' says that these
are things which 'the angels desire to look in10.' "—Ellen G. White,
Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 702.
    Ellen White eloquently works through the issues of God's justice
and mercy as worked out in the history of Israel.
   Regarding Jeremiah's ministry: "The unwillingness of the Lord to
chastise is here vividly shown. He stays His judgments that He may
plead with the impenitent. He who exercises loving-kindness, judg-
ment, and righteousness, in the earth' yearns over His erring children;
in every way possible He seeks to teach them the way of life everlast-
ing. Jeremiah 9:24. He had brought the Israelites out of bondage that
they might serve Him, the only true and living God. Though they had
wandered long in idolatry and had slighted His warnings, yet He now
declares His willingness to defer chastisement and grant yet another
opportunity for repentance."—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings,
p. 413.
   "Once more he yielded to his inclination to question and doubt, and
once more he was overwhelmed with discouragement. "Losing sight
of the interests of others, and feeling as if he [Jonah] would rather die
than live to see the city spared, in his dissatisfaction he exclaimed,
`Now, 0 Lord, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better
for me to die than to live.' "—Page 271.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Study the parable in Matthew 18:23-35. How do you under-
     stand this in contrast with what's happening so far in Jonah?

     2. Read Psalm 10. What is going on there, and how can it be
        explained in the context of what happened with what we
        have studied so far in Jonah?

     3. French writer and Christian Blaise Pascal once wrote that
        "the heart has its reasons that reason knows nothing of."
        What do you think he meant by that? Do you agree? And
        how does a thought like that fit in with the Christian faith?

SUMMARY: Jonah has a lot of lessons to learn about the love and the
mercy of the God he professes to serve.

                         A Difficult Life
                         Charlotte Ishkanian

   Florentine's life has never been easy. As a child she was shifted
from one relative to another to live and work. By age 13 she worked as
a servant. She married young and had five children, before her hus-
band left her. She supports the family by washing clothes.
   When her youngest child was admitted to the hospital, Florentine
met a woman, who invited her to church. Florentine believed in God,
but she was not interested in the woman's invitation, because she did
not know which church was God's true church. The woman urged her
to ask God to show her the church she should attend.
   Florentine began to pray, "God, I know You want me to attend
church. Please show me the church where You want me to worship
You, so I and my children can be saved."
   The next day an Adventist woman visited her home and invited her
to attend evangelistic meetings. Florentine felt this woman's visit was
an answer to her prayer. She took her children to the meetings. She
wrote down the Bible references that the pastor quoted, but she had no
Bible to look them up. So she borrowed a Bible. Soon she realized that
this was the church that taught all of God's commandments.
    Florentine asked for prayer to quit smoking and to find work that
allowed her to keep the Sabbath. The unskilled work she did required
that she work every day in order to feed her family. If she did not work,
they did not eat.
    Following the prayers on her behalf, Florentine was able to quit
smoking. The evangelist asked her to work in his garden to earn a little
money. Soon she began washing the family's clothes too.
    Some weeks later Florentine and two of her five children were
baptized. Then one of her sons left home to stay with his father. But his
                                  father sent him back to her. Florentine
                                  believes that God sent the boy back in
                                  answer to her prayers, so that he would
                                  remain in the influence of a Christian
                                  home.
                                     Florentine still does not have her
                                  own Bible. But her faith is strong that
                                  one day soon God will provide one for
                                  her.

                                    Florentine Ravaonasolo (left) lives in

Sabbath Afternoon

          ARD AS IT IS FOR US to understand (we who believe that

H         our purpose as a people is to bring the good news of salvation
          to the "heathen"), the disgruntled prophet Jonah has expressed
deep dissatisfaction with God's mercy to the wicked Ninevites. He is
sorry they listened to his warnings and repented. God then asks him to
reconsider his sullen attitude as Jonah sits under a booth he has built for
shade. Jonah and God continue their dialogue. Though some of the most
profound theological concepts of the Old Testament are recorded in this
final chapter of the book, what we see more than anything is a manifes-
tation of God's grace toward sinners. This week, keep in mind who
Jonah is, the privileges he has been given, what the Lord has done for
him . . . and yet still this attitude?
   This should give us hope for ourselves, if nothing else.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What was the symbolism of the
booth Jonah had built for himself? What is the irony there? Why
did God grow the plant for Jonah and then take that plant away?
Was Jonah facing a judgment of his own? What was the Lord
teaching Jonah? How do we see here a powerful manifestation of
God's grace in the life of this prophet? In what ways can we be in
danger, like Jonah, of taking God's grace toward us for granted?

     MEMORY TEXT: "Good and upright is the Lord; therefore
     He instructs sinners in the way. He leads the humble in justice,
     and He teaches the humble His way" (Psalm 25:8, 9, NASB).

JONAH'S BOOTH.

   "Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born
shall dwell in booths: that your generations may know that I made
the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out
of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God" (Lev. 23:42, 43).

       od now prepares an "object lesson" for Jonah (Ellen G. White,

G      Prophets and Kings, p. 272). Like the "great fish" in the
       Mediterranean, a plant, a worm, and a strong wind become
God's instruments. And, like the "great fish," they obey. This adds
more emphasis to the recurring theme of the Lord's control over what
He Himself has created.

   In Jonah 4:5, Jonah goes outside the city and makes for himself
"a booth." Look up these texts, in which the same word appears
(though in the plural): Leviticus 23:39, 44 and Nehemiah 8:14-16.
What is the significance in the use of that word, in Jonah, based on
what it means in these other texts?




   The booths were to remind the children of Israel of their miracu-
lous deliverance from Egypt and of God's care for them after that
deliverance. Apparently for Jonah, deliverance was desirable for the
Hebrews but not for the pagans. Perhaps Jonah, whose only concern
now was his personal comfort, missed the irony of his act.



    T   he Hebrew word for "booths" sukkot, the plural of sukkah
        (the word that appears in Jonah), is also the name for the
   Jewish festival of Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles. During
   it, even today, traditional Jews live in a hut, a sukkah, as a
   reminder of the temporary dwellings in which their ancestors
   lived after their deliverance from Egypt.



    Read the last part of Jonah 4:5. What was Jonah waiting for?
 Did he still, perhaps, harbor some hope that the city would
 nevertheless be destroyed? What does this tell us about his

GOD'S APPOINTMENTS.

   What verb reappears, in the opening of Jonah 4:6, that we have
seen before?


         erse 6 opens with the phrase—"The Lord God prepared." This

V        is the second of four occurrences of this verb in the book of
         Jonah (see lesson 6); the last time it had been used was when
the Lord had "prepared" the fish to swallow Jonah. Each time it is
used (Jon. 1:17; 4:6-8), God is the subject of the verb, the One who is
doing the preparing, or appointing. Its use highlights, again, God's
sovereign rule over all nature in the accomplishment of His purpose.
   It's clear (from what happens next) that God still has not given up
on Jonah, even though the prophet was so discouraged over the Lord's
grace toward the heathen that Jonah wanted to die.
    While Jonah sits in a booth he had built to await Nineveh's out-
come, God causes a plant to grow and bring extra shade (apparently
the booth wasn't enough) "to deliver him from his grief." And, obvi-
ously, it worked.
   Just as with the "great fish," the writer doesn't identify the species;
nor does the author spend any time on the miracle that caused it to
grow so quickly. It's just assumed that the Lord can do these things.

  Read Jonah 4:6-8. Summarize in your own words what hap-
pens.


   Here's Jonah, depressed over the deliverance of Nineveh from
destruction but now joyous because of a plant that gives him some
shade. What are we to make of this guy?
   In the course of events, God "appoints" the plant, then the worm to
destroy the plant, and then the vehement wind. Instead of Nineveh,
Jonah himself seems to be facing some sort of divine punishment; he's
getting only a small taste of what he, apparently, wanted in a big way
to happen to these Gentile pagans. The grace that brought the plant,
which made him exceedingly happy, is now taken away, and he's
miserable.

   Jonah is afflicted with one of the most common maladies that
impacts the human race: selfishness, one of the deadliest sins.
Look up these texts: Luke 9:23; Romans 6:4-7; 1 Corinthians
9:19; and Philippians 2:1-7. What do they tell us and promise us
that can help us overcome the sin that made Jonah such a moral
and spiritual wretch?

JONAH'S RETURNING WRATH.

    onah has demanded of God that He destroy. God does just that.

J   He destroys but not what Jonah wanted Him 10. God sends a
    worm, and Jonah's shade plant withers, perhaps blown away
(along with his booth) by the wind the Lord brought next. Jonah has
some hard things to learn; he needs hard lessons to learn them.
   Jonah again wants to die; this time, though, he doesn't directly ask
God to kill him (maybe he figures that such a request is futile). Never-
theless, his morbid desire to die, stated for the second time, suggests a
deep spiritual malaise. These are Jonah's last words in the narrative
(Jon. 4:8, 9). He continues, as he has from the beginning, opposing God.
But Jonah does not have the last word. God again asks a question.

   What does the Lord say to Jonah? Jon. 4:9.


   Divine questions keep mild pressure on Jonah to expose his atti-
tude. This is the second time God asks Jonah to analyze his anger,
using now the issue of the wilted plant.
   Notice that, in verse 4, God asks Jonah whether it is right to be
angry over the act of deliverance of Nineveh. Now, in verse 9, He's
asking Jonah whether it's right to be angry over the destruction of the
plant. Perhaps the Lord was showing Jonah the contrast between a
whole city and a plant, wanting Jonah to see just how his own perspec-
tives were so imbalanced and his priorities so off: angry that the Lord
didn't destroy a city, angry that the Lord did destroy a plant. Jonah has
some problems, to be sure.

   How does Jonah respond to the Lord's question? Vs. 9.


    Imagine this scene. Here is this mortal, this sinner deserving of
death—openly defiant of the Lord, the Creator, even after seeing all
these miracles, one after another, and even himself being delivered by
one of the most amazing miracles in sacred history. And, yet, the Lord
still is working with him! There's no question, what we see here in
Jonah is a small example of what the Lord has been doing with His
people all through history: showing them more grace, more mercy,
and more patience than they ever have deserved.

    From our perspective, Jonah's anger seems ludicrous. Look
 up these texts. What are they saying that can help us put our
 trials into proper perspective? Isa. 55:8, 9; Luke 11:9-13; Rom.
8:32; 1 Cor. 13:11, 12.

                                                                       83

PITY FOR WHAT?

  "Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came
up in a night, and perished in a night" (Jon. 4:10).



L
        ook at how the Lord answered Jonah in the above verse. God
        uses the verb "pity" as He describes Jonah's sympathy for the
        plant (in vs. 10); He used the same word for Himself, in verse
11, regarding His attitude toward Nineveh, inviting a comparison
between the two. Jonah has pity on a plant; the Lord has pity on the
inhabitants of Nineveh. Could the contrast between a holy God and
fallen humanity be any greater?
   It is remarkable that God uses the same word, pity, for both His and
Jonah's attitudes, seeking to help Jonah realize what he is doing.
Jonah is grieving over the plant only because he misses its shade.

  Note the choice of the verb perish in verse 10, which brings to
mind the earlier occurrences of the word in the narrative. How
was it used earlier?

     Jon. 1:6

     Jon. 1:14

     Jon. 3:9

    Jesus uses the Greek equivalent in John 3:16, where the "perishing"
of the whole world is at stake. By the narrator's careful writing,
Jonah's concern for the shade plant is trivialized when compared with
all that would be at stake if God's judgment against Nineveh were
fulfilled. And, in a real sense, the issues faced by the sailors and the
inhabitants of Nineveh, and even Jonah himself (most people thrown
overboard in a storm die), are, of course, those faced by everyone: life
or death. In fact, the issue goes even beyond life or death in this
immediate existence, where life is only a vapor (James 4:14) and
death only a temporary sleep (1 Cor. 15:51); rather, the real issue
comes down to eternal life (John 3:15) or to eternal destruction (vs.
16).

    We need to remember that every person we see is facing
either eternal life or eternal damnation (John 5:29). What ways
can we avoid being like Jonah; that is, getting so caught up in
our concerns that we forget what really matters and what our
purpose as Seventh-day Adventists is?

A QUESTION OF GRACE.



L
       et's look again at what the Lord had said to Jonah in Jonah 4:10.
       Jonah just gets done saying, basically, Yes, I have the right to be
       angry, even unto death, because You took away my plant. But
the way God responds shows Jonah the true situation: that he really
didn't have any claim to that plant or any right to that plant or any
authority over that plant. He didn't work for it, earn it, or even grow it.
The plant, when it gave him shade, was purely the supernatural act of
God in behalf of Jonah.

   Something we can't earn, can't labor for, can't create our-
selves, yet is totally a gift of God in our behalf? Sounds like what?
See Job 4:17-21; Rom. 3:28; 4:13-16; Eph. 2:5-10.




   Again, how much different is Jonah from the rest of humanity?
How often do we take the gifts of God for granted? God shows us
mercy and grace, and we almost can get used to them, as though they
were our due. We forget that not only are they gifts of grace (How can
grace be anything other than a gift?) but what it cost for us to have that
grace granted to us. All of us, every moment of our lives, are recipi-
ents of God's grace, probably in more ways than we realize. And,
perhaps, that's the problem: Like Jonah, we don't realize it.
   Look at 2 Timothy 1:8-10. Notice what it says about what had been
given us in Christ "before the world began." If something were given
to us before the world began, it was given to us before we asked for it
or even before we could earn it. That's why it has to be grace.

   Summarize 2 Timothy 1:8-10, paralleling it with what we can
here in God's dealing with Jonah. What are those verses saying?
List the things that, according to those verses, God has done for us
solely by His grace. Why does Paul specify that it's not of works?


    A young family ate out every Sunday night. One Sunday, for
 whatever reason, they decided not to go. One of their children,
 age six, upon hearing the news, exclaimed, "Well, I expected to
 go out to eat!" In what ways are we in danger of doing the same
 thing with God's grace: Because it has been given so freely to us,
 and in abundance, we assume that we have it coming or that it's
 owed us?

                                                                         85

N
        ineveh finally was reduced to ruins in 612 B.C. But the genera-
        tion that heard Jonah preach experienced a wonderful deliver-
        ance, and the God of the Hebrews "was exalted and honored
throughout the heathen world, and His law was revered."—Ellen G.
White, Prophets and Kings, p. 271. And the book of Jonah records one
of the grandest events in the history of redemption!
   "The Son of God gave all—life and love and suffering—for our
redemption. And can it be that we, the unworthy objects of so great
love, will withhold our hearts from Him? Every moment of our lives we
have been partakers of the blessings of His grace, and for this very
reason we cannot fully realize the depths of ignorance and misery from
which we have been saved."—Ellen G. White, God's Amazing Grace,
p. 185.
   "It was God's purpose that His grace should be revealed among the
Gentiles as well as among the Israelites. This had been plainly out-
lined in Old Testament prophecies. The apostle uses some of these
prophecies in his argument. `Hath not the potter power over the clay,'
he inquires, 'of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and
another unto dishonor? What if God, willing to show His wrath, and to
make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels
of wrath fitted to destruction: and that He might make known the
riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore
prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews
only, but also of the Gentiles?' "—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 376.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
1. What other prophet wanted to die over discouragement?
    (1 Kings 19). Are there any parallels between Jonah's
    situation and that of Elijah's? If so, what? What are the
    differences?

     2. Ellen White, in one of the above quotes, said that every
        moment of our lives we have been partakers of God's
        grace. Even while we were unconverted or unbelievers or
        in open rebellion? How do you understand what that state-
        ment means? In what ways are even the unconverted par-
        takers of this grace?

SUMMARY: God loves us, despite our hypocrisy.

                             Sonia Santos

   "That boy of yours is a lost cause," the teacher told Lorene. She
hung her head as she listened to a list of Femando's latest misdeeds.
The story was all too familiar to her. The family lived in a poor
neighborhood with a lot of crime in southern Brazil. Lorene prayed
constantly for her son and was sure God had a plan for his life.
   Fernando seemed to find trouble. When he was 8 years old he
grabbed onto the back of a moving truck. The driver did not see the
boy, and as he sped around a corner, Fernando fell off. Someone found
the boy lying beside the road and they took him to the hospital.
    Fernando lay unconscious in intensive care for three days. The
doctor told his mother that there was little chance for the boy to
recover. But Fernando's mother was not willing to give up on him.
She begged the doctor to give the boy more time to come out of the
coma, and reluctantly the doctor agreed to give her one more day.
    Lorene went into the bathroom and begged God to save her son. The
next day the doctor was surprised to find that Fernando was beginning to
respond to touch. His reflexes were improving, and soon he awakened
from the coma. Soon after his recovery, Fernando returned home. But
his life was not easy, and he needed constant medical care.
    Fernando caused problems in school, and often his mother was
called to the school to deal with him. His teachers sometimes said he
was a lost cause, but his mother refused to give up on him. Often she
reminded the boy of the miracles God had done in his life.
    When Fernando was 13 years old a neighbor invited him to attend
 Pathfinders. He loved it and began attending regularly. As he attended,
his behavior began to change. He attended an evangelistic series and
asked his mother to allow him to be baptized. But his mother thought he
 was too young. Besides, the family attended another church.
    The night before the scheduled baptism, Lorene dreamed that Jesus
 was coming. She saw other people going to heaven, but she and
 Fernando remained on earth. When she awoke she realized that she
 must allow her son to be baptized.
    Today Fernando is a faithful young member of the local church in
 southern Brazil. He no longer causes problems in school. Those who
 thought he was a lost cause now are convinced that God has changed
 him. His parents, who thought he was too young to decide for Christ,
 now attend church and are preparing for baptism as well.

                 The Last Word




Sabbath Afternoon


T
       HE FOUR-CHAPTER NARRATIVE OF the book of Jonah now
       closes. God has the last word, even though that last word is a
       question. The question is presented, however, not as God wanting to
learn from Jonah but as God wanting to teach him.
   Because the book doesn't tell us whether Jonah ever understands
the point or not, it must not be that important for us to know. Instead,
what's important is, Do we get the point? Sure, we know about God's
love, mercy, and compassion; and we are glad to have these things for
ourselves. But are we willing to allow God to work in us so we can
have love, mercy, and compassion for others? Are we willing to make
the self-sacrifices needed in order for us to teach modern-day Ninevites
the truth that judgment is coming and that one day they will have to
answer for their sins?

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What does God say to Jonah about
the Ninevites? How does the Lord express their moral ignorance?
Why does the Lord talk about the animals in the city? What lesson
is the Lord trying to teach Jonah? How does Jonah respond? In
what ways is Jonah a model of ancient Israel? Or even the modern
church? Why does the Lord end the book of Jonah with a question
that remains unanswered?

     MEMORY TEXT: "And the times of this ignorance God winked
     at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent" (Acts
     17:30).

ONE LOST SOUL.

   "And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between
their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?" (Jon.
4:11).



H
        ow can the Lord impress upon this poor man's mind which things
        are important and which things aren't? Jonah lived in a world,
        much like ours, where human life often seems cheap. Yet, the
Lord died for all humanity, because He loves all humanity. In fact, we
are told that He would have died for just one soul. "In the parable the
shepherd goes out to search for one sheep—the very least that can be
numbered. So if there had been but one lost soul, Christ would have
died for that one."—Ellen G. White, Christ's Object Lessons, p. 187.

   In the context of the last verse in the book of Jonah (and of
Jonah's attitude), read Matthew 18:11-14. What kind of contrast
does it create between God's attitude toward people and Jonah's
(whose attitude might differ from ours only in degree)? What kind
of rebuke do these words of Jesus have for us and for our coldness
and for our lack of zeal for souls?




   The thought of Christ dying for this whole planet, as small as it is
in contrast to the size of the universe, is amazing enough. But for
one person? Who can grasp that kind of love? Though we don't
know in the end how many ultimately will be saved (Isa. 66:23;
Rev. 21:24), it certainly will be more than one. And yet, even if only
one, Christ would have died anyway! No wonder the secular mind
has a hard time grasping the gospel. Even those of faith can barely
wrap their minds around such a powerful concept.

    Think about who God is, who we are, and how small and
 wretched we are in contrast; and yet, look what God did for us,
 anyway. Dwell on what that thought tells us about God's love.
 Write a paragraph expressing what this truth means to you and
 the hope it gives. What does this concept say to us about the
 assurance of salvation? Ask this question too: How, in the face
 of such love, are souls ultimately lost?

                                                                     89

LIVING IN IGNORANCE.

  "And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men every where to repent" (Acts 17:30).

   Notice the expression in Jonah 4:11 the Lord uses to describe the
Ninevites. Obviously, it's a metaphor. What is the Lord saying with
that description? What other point does He wish to convey to this
Hebrew prophet (notice the emphasis on the adjective Hebrew)?




T
        he Lord talks to Jonah, a Hebrew, someone who comes
       from the nation whom the Lord called out to be a special
       people, those who were given great light and understanding of
not only who God is but of His eternal, moral principles (see Exod.
19:5; Exodus 20; Deut. 4:7; 12:8; Pss. 19:7-11; 37:31; Jer. 31:33). So
much of Hebrew history is defined by their understanding of the law
and the moral precepts found in the law. In this way, the Hebrew nation
stood far in advance of all the pagan societies around them.
     In contrast, God describes the Ninevites as not being able to
discern between their right hand and their left. Obviously, these people
didn't have the same kind of moral direction the Lord had given to
Israel. A similar phrase appears in the Bible (Deut. 17:20; 28:14; Josh.
1:7), referring to the moral issue of not deviating from the divine law
and from revelation. Thus here, in the book of Jonah, we are instructed
that the Ninevites lacked the knowledge of the law of Yahweh. The
use of the phrase "right hand and left hand" is also found in Babylonian
texts as a synonym for "truth and justice" or "law and order." Thus,
God instructs Jonah that in the case of Nineveh He defers judgment
for the sake of the morally ignorant, for those who don't understand.

   Maybe the Ninevites didn't have the same knowledge of God's
law as did the Hebrews; nevertheless, the actions of the people
and the king, as expressed in Jonah 3:10, show that they had some
moral conscience and some understanding of good and evil. Look
again at what the Lord says to Jonah in the last verse about the
Ninevites. What does that tell us regarding God's fairness in
dealing with those who don't have a deeper revelation of moral
truth? Are they, therefore, not accountable to God for their ac-
tions? Or, will they be accountable to God in a different way?

ANIMALS TOO? (READ JOB 39).

A,      11 through chapter 4 God has kept gentle pressure on Jonah to
        reconsider his evaluation of God's treatment of the Ninevites.
          nd in a book of surprises, one of the most surprising is the
final question to Jonah.

  What is the last phrase of the final verse in the concluding
chapter in the book of Jonah? Jon. 4:11.


   The rather cryptic ending of Jonah concludes with God showing
His compassion not only on the pagan Ninevties but, apparently, on
their cattle, as well (the Hebrew word there can mean not just cattle
but "animals" in general). Though the recorded ending is quite abrupt
(one would love to know how the conversation ultimately concluded),
and the precise meaning isn't absolutely clear, it seems as though the
Lord tells Jonah it wasn't only the people He had wanted to have pity
on but their animals, as well.
   This really shouldn't be that surprising, should it?
   Throughout the four chapters in the book of Jonah, the " 'Lord God
of heaven who made the sea and the dry land' " (Jon. 1:9, NASB) is
seen in His sovereignty over all His creation. This is also regularly
expressed by many of the Bible writers, in both Testaments. And we are
often reminded in Scripture how all the created world is part of God's
concern. Even the heavens are included in this divine perspective.

   Read Job 39. Notice the focus the Lord has on the creatures He
refers 10. What does that tell us about God's interest and care
about animals, as well? Also, no matter how greatly different the
situations, what parallels can you find between what the Lord says
here to Job and what He says to Jonah?




   Jewish tradition teaches that God takes note of those who are kind
to animals, because animals can't return the favor, as humans can.

    One of our greatest dangers is going to extremes. We can take a
 good thing so far that it becomes a bad thing. How can Christians
 strike the right balance in their attitude toward animals (or nature,
 in general) so that, on one hand, they don't treat animals cruelly
 nor, on the other, become fanatical in devotion toward them?

                                                                    91

QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS . . .



T
        he book of Jonah comes to a sudden halt with a probing question
        that is left unanswered. We are never told whether or not Jonah
        finally admits to his self-centered enjoyment of God's favor
while begrudging it to the Ninevites. Nor whether he was ever able to
grasp that God's generous love for all people far surpassed his own idea
of fairness. We are left wondering whether Jonah ever would appreciate
God's forgiveness of those who don't deserve that forgiveness.
   It is very unusual for a book in the Bible to end with a question, a
most surprising question at that; yet, there is really no reason why a
book cannot end that way. In fact, this ending is not an example of
unfinished thinking and careless writing. On the contrary, by ending
this way, the book sharply contrasts Jonah's attitude to God's.

  Though it's not common for a book of the Bible to end with a
question, it is common for the Lord Himself to ask questions. Do
two things with these questions God asked: First, ask yourself,
Why did He ask them? Second, write down what you think the
answers are (and give reasons for your answers):

     Exod. 4:11



     Job 40:1, 2



     Jon. 4:11



     Mark 8:36



     Luke 6:9



  Take your answers to these questions and summarize in a
short paragraph what they teach us about the character, mercy,
and power of our God.

THE OX KNOWS.

   "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider" (Isa. 1:3).

   Read the first three verses of Isaiah 1. What parallel can you see
there with the story of Jonah and his attitude toward the Lord?




        s we've seen all through the book of Jonah, nature is under the
        Lord's control. This teaching, of course, is nothing new (see
A att. 21:18, 19; 17:24-27; Mark 4:35-41). If human beings
were only just as obedient. The difference, however, is that God didn't
make nature morally culpable, as He made humanity. God forces
nature; He doesn't force humanity. In order for us to be moral beings,
we have to be free beings. Sadly, we often abuse that freedom.

  Survey, again, the book of Jonah. What and who obeyed the
Lord, and who didn't? What irony can you see in the answer?




   Nature obeyed, the pagans obeyed; only Jonah, the Hebrew, didn't,
or at least to the degree that, no doubt, the Lord wanted him 10. In a
sense, Jonah typified the nation of Israel during various times in its
history. What it could have done in peace and prosperity (1 Kings
8:60; Isa. 27:6; 56:6; Zech. 8:23), it was forced to do under terrible
circumstances—that of captivity, slavery, and exile. The same with
Jonah. The storm, the fish, and the three days and nights all could have
been avoided had he obeyed when first asked. What's sad, too, is that
although we don't know, ultimately, what happens to Jonah, the book
ends with him seemingly still not being where the Lord wanted him to
be. In other words, he still doesn't get it. Historically, it seems that
much of ancient Israel didn't, either.

    Keeping this day's lesson in mind, what do you think Ellen
 White meant when she wrote: "The work which the church has
 failed to do in a time of peace and prosperity, she will have to do in
 a terrible crisis, under most discouraging, forbidding, circumstances"?

          individuals and as a nation God proposed to furnish the
        people of Israel 'with every facility for becoming the greatest
As       ation on the earth' (COL 288; see Deut. 4:6-8; 7:6, 14; 28:1;
Jer. 33:9; Mal. 3:12; PP 273, 314; Ed 40; DA 577). He purposed to
make them an honor to His name and a blessing to the nations about
them (Ed 40; COL 286).
   "As the nations of antiquity should behold Israel's unprecedented
progress, their attention and interest would be aroused. 'Even the
heathen would recognize the superiority of those who served and
worshiped the living God' (COL 289). Desiring the same blessings
for themselves, they would make inquiry as to how they too might
acquire these obvious material advantages. Israel would reply, 'Ac-
cept our God as your God, love and serve Him as we do, and He will
do the same for you.' The blessings thus assured Israel' were, 'on
the same conditions and in the same degree, assured to every nation
and to every individual under the broad heavens' (PK 500, 501; see
Acts 10:34, 35; 15:7-9; Rom. 10:12, 13; etc.). All nations of earth
were to share in the blessings so generously bestowed upon Israel
(PK 370)."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol 4, p. 28.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. C. S. Lewis wrote: "There are only two kinds of people in
     the end, those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those
     to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.' All that
     are in Hell, choose it. Without that self-choice, there could
     be no hell."—The Great Divorce (New York: Simon and
     Schuster, 1974), p. 72. However deficient C. S. Lewis's
     understanding of the nature (and timing) of hell, dwell on
     this quote. Do you agree with him or not? Give reasons for
     your answer.

     2. Read Luke 4:24-28. How does what Jesus is saying here
        parallel somewhat the situation displayed in the book of
        Jonah? What warnings should we, as Adventists, take from
        what Christ said to those in the synagogue?


SUMMARY: The book of Jonah ends with a theme seen all through
the Bible: the love and greatness of God contrasted with the pettiness
and sinfulness of humanity.

        Witness In a Drug Rehabilitation Center
                             J. H. Zachary

    The Dominican Republic government operates a drug rehabilita-
tion center in Azua City. The director, cured of an addiction to crack
cocaine in 1993, is convinced that spiritual therapy must be part of the
help offered to the youthful patients in the rehabilitation center. He
invited Pastor Daniel Sanchez to come to the center and conduct Bible
studies and hear presentations by medical and other specialists for the
35 in-patients.
    The government has found that of 30,000 persons this facility has
treated for addictions, only 30 have relapsed.
    During a visit to the Azua center in August 2001, I met 36-year-old
Rafael Rosario, who was introduced to drugs by his own mother, who
gave them to him to sell. He began taking cocaine, and before long he
was addicted. His life became focused on getting his next fix. But his
wife and children left him, and his life fell apart.
    It took 10 years for Rafael to realize that he was trapped by the
chains of drugs. At this low point in his life he learned about the Azua
center. Rafael asked to be admitted to the program. His heart was
touched by the religious services and the kind pastor who listened to
his troubles. Rafael remembered the many occasions when he had
spurned his brother's invitation to attend the church. But in the Wednes-
day spiritual therapy meetings, Rafael began to understand what his
brother had been trying to tell him.
    For years Rafael had rejected his brother's religion. Now he real-
 ized he needed spiritual help. Rafael recently testified to the other
 patients, "I am happy, for I have accepted Christ as my Savior."
                                       Rafael's family visits him, and his
                                  children are delighted to see the
                                  changes in their father. When he com-
                                   pletes his treatment program he plans
                                   to find honest work and support his
                                   family, as a Christian father should.
                                       "The Lord has given me to a new
                                   life," Rafael says. "I thank God for the
                                   ministry of Pastor Sanchez, which
                                   helped me find this new life in Jesus."

       The Sign of the Prophet
               Jonah




Sabbath Afternoon

AT THIS POINT IN OUR STUDY, the narrative, the story of Jonah
and his exploits, has ended. It was quite a story, with some amazing
exploits, to be sure. However, while the narrative portion of the Jonah
story is now over, the message of the story, and the reasons it was
included in the biblical canon, still aren't.
   Jesus Himself, during His earthly ministry, is recorded three times
talking about Jonah, all in the same context: that of Jonah in the belly
of the fish. Obviously, for Jesus, the story of Jonah, particularly the
parts He specifically mentions, is pertinent and, obviously, because
His words regarding Jonah are recorded in two of the Gospels, Mat-
thew and Luke, there must be something there for us, as well.
   This week we'll take a closer look at what Jesus said about Jonah, the
reluctant prophet, and the reasons He used Jonah to relay an important
message, not only to those listening to Him speak but for us, as well.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What is asked of Jesus that causes
Him to refer to Jonah, and who asks it? Why does Jesus speak
such a sharp rebuke to them over what they ask? Why will there
always be room for doubt? How does Jonah's experience prefig-
ure Christ's death, burial, and resurrection?

     MEMORY TEXT: "For as Jonas was three days and three
     nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days
     and three nights in the heart of the earth" (Matthew 12:40).

*Please study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, December 20.

"THIS ADULTEROUS GENERATION."

   "For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth" (Matt. 12:40).



A
        s shown in the first week's lesson, Jesus believes in the
        truth of the Jonah story, particularly the most "unbelievable"
        part; that is, Jonah's undersea excursion in the belly of the big
fish. In fact, Jesus refers to Jonah, not just in Matthew 12 but in
Matthew 16:4; meanwhile, Luke (11:29-32), as well, records Jesus
referring to Jonah. All these references are in the same context too.

   Read Matthew 12:38-45; Matt. 16:1-4; and Luke 11:29-36, the
three times Christ mentions Jonah. What is the background of His
response? What do all three accounts have in common? Why does He
refer to this "wicked" or "adulterous" generation? What's the point
of the reference to the Queen of Sheba? And to the Ninevites?




   In many ways, particularly given the context, we see here a repeat
of what happened with Jonah. All through the book it was the pagans,
the non-Hebrews, who were responding to the signs, the warnings, as
well as the expressions of God's grace, while Jonah, the only Hebrew
in the book, seems hardened to them all.
   Jesus is dealing with a similar situation here: Those who, like
Jonah, should know better, don't. By referring to Jonah, Jesus points
to a story that, if heeded in faith and submission, would provide them
with a clear object lesson.
    This should teach us that to be given great light and the great
privileges that come with that light are no guarantee of salvation. To
know "truth"—that is, a series of propositions and statements about
God or the nature of God—in and of itself, means nothing. The pages
of the Bible are crammed full of people who are given truth but don't
bear the fruit of that truth in their own lives.

    Read carefully Matthew 12:43-45, keeping the context in mind.
 What point does the Lord make here? What message should
 there be here for us, as Seventh-day Adventists?
                                                                       97

SEEKING A SIGN.

 What question prompted Jesus' strong response regarding Jonah?
Why would Jesus have reacted as He did? See Matt. 12:38; 16:1.


      kim through the first 16 chapters of Matthew, events that pre-

S     ceded these questions, and what do you see? Lepers healed
      (Matt. 8:2-4); a centurion's daughter healed (vss. 5-13); a para-
lyzed man healed (Matt. 9:1-8); the blind receiving sight (vss. 27-31),
and so forth. And yet, some of these people still wanted a sign?

  How do all these signs explain why Jesus reacted to their re-
quest as strongly as He did? See also Luke 16:31.


   Ultimately, those who don't want to believe in God, or in Jesus,
will always find reasons for the unbelief. In fact, it's hard to think of
anything God could do to get someone to believe if that person really
doesn't want to believe.
    Imagine if, suddenly, the words JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF
GOD, DIED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD! were written every
day across the sky in every land, in every language, by a means that
eluded rational, scientific explanation. However miraculous, however
great a sign these words would be, belief that JESUS CHRIST, THE
SON OF GOD, DIED FOR THE SINS OF THE WORLD! would still
require faith. Even such a powerful sign would not be absolute proof,
and those who still don't want to believe would not be persuaded,
even with something like this heralded across the sky.
   After all, Christ's atoning death on the cross was a historical event
that happened in the past. It's gone. The only way we could ever know
about it is to be told about it, and, because we weren't there and didn't
see it happen, we can take what we've been told only on faith. How
else? Faith, because it's belief in what's not "proven," always comes
with the potential for doubt, and all the signs, miracles, and wonders
in the world will never erase all doubt. Thus, those who want to cling
to doubt will always have something to cling to, no matter the signs.

   What are the things that have caused you to believe in the
Lord Jesus? Would you like something else to happen that could,
you think, strengthen your faith? If so, what is it? Now, imagine
that what you ask for is given to you.
   Do you imagine, then, that all your questions and all your
doubt will completely vanish? Certainly not. The question is,
What do you do with that doubt?

"A GREATER THAN JONAS IS HERE."

           hen we read what Jesus says to the people in Matthew 12:41,

W          42 (see also Luke 11:31, 32), in both accounts Jesus utters an
           interesting and important phrase: "Behold, a greater than
Jonas is here"; "behold, a greater than Solomon is here." The context of
these utterances shows Jesus comparing the attitude of these people to
that of the Ninevites and the Queen of Sheba.

   Read 1 Kings 10:1-13, about the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon.
What was her reaction, and why? What was it about Solomon that
made her act as she did? What does this teach us about what
Israel, had it been faithful, could have accomplished for the Lord?
See also Deut. 4:5-8; 8:17, 18; 28:11-13.




    Notice also in Christ's words the other comparison He's making; that
is, not just the comparison between "this generation" and the pagans but
between Himself and both Solomon and Jonah. He's saying, essentially,
that the Ninevites repented at the words of Jonah, who is hardly the
greatest example of fidelity, faith, and zeal; and yet, here He is, the Son
of God Himself, doing all that He has done, and you still refuse to
repent? And here's the Queen of Sheba, a pagan ruler, who, of her own
choosing, came to hear Solomon, a mere sinful mortal; and yet, here He
is, the Son of God, who came to you, and you still wouldn't listen?

  In what ways is Jesus greater than either Solomon or Jonah?
See John 1:1-4; 8:58; Col. 1:16.


   Of all the truths we ever can know, the most profound and wonder-
ful is that God Himself stepped into the garb of humanity in the Person
of Jesus Christ. No matter how big and scary the world, God through
Christ has reached down and linked Himself to sinful, dying mortals
in a way that should give us incredible hope and comfort, for our God
has been among us, as one of us, and thus He knows us better than we
can know ourselves. Even more so, He loves us too.

    How does the deity of Christ give you comfort personally?
 Why do you think the deity of Christ is so important? What
 would it mean if Jesus were a created being like us, as opposed
 to being the Creator Himself?

                                                                        99

STRONG WORDS.

       hough we're used to the gentle Jesus, the kind, loving, forgiving

T      Jesus, the Jesus presented in these episodes comes across a bit
     differently, at least on the surface. Matthew 16:1, by elaborating
on the motives behind those who ask the question, helps us understand
why Jesus speaks as He does.
   Of course, this wasn't the first time Christ spoke strong words of
rebuke and censure during His earthly ministry.

   Read Matthew 23. Who is Jesus rebuking, and why? What
parallels exist between His rebuke there and what we've seen in
the texts regarding Jonah for this week?




   Notice, too, in His discourse in Matthew 23 that He more than once
calls the leaders "blind." Thus, how fruitless it would be to give them
the sign they asked for in Matthew 12, because the blind can't see. No
matter what Jesus does—healing lepers, raising the dead, casting out
demons—these scribes and Pharisees refuse to see, and that's because
they don't want 10. And Jesus, by pointing out their sins and corruption
(in Matthew 23), shows why they don't want to: If they had, if they
would have accepted Him by virtue of the signs and wonders He
performs, then they would have had to reform radically their lives and
practices, something that many of them, apparently, didn't want to do.
   For many people today, the same principle applies: They reject
truth, not so much on an intellectual basis, not so much because their
mind rejects it, but because their flesh does.

    Though Jesus refuses to give them, in this situation, the kind
 of sign they want, He, nevertheless, amid the rebuke, gives them
 a "sign" anyway. Look, again, at Matthew 12:39, 40. Jesus uses
 the Jonah story, a past event, to talk about something that would
 happen soon. What is that event? How does the Jonah story
 prefigure this event? How, even here, is Jesus saying something
 to these people, that, if they listened, could have opened their
 eyes to Him and who He was?

"IN THE HEART OF THE EARTH."



E
       ven amid His strong rebuke of their spiritual blindness, Jesus still
       seeks to win their allegiance, for though He is God, He will
       not force anyone to follow Him. Then, as now, service to the
Lord must be given freely; otherwise, it's slavery, and God doesn't want
slaves. (If He had wanted slaves, He wouldn't have made us free moral
agents.) Thus, Jesus uses the story of Jonah to describe what would
happen to Him; that is, His death, burial, and resurrection; the idea
being that, after it happened, they—remembering what He said—would
have more reason to believe in who He was.
   In Jonah 2:2, Jonah says that "out of the belly of hell cried I." The
word for "hell" there comes from the Hebrew sheol, which means "the
grave" or the "underworld." In Hebrew, it's often synonymous with
death. Jonah, in the belly of the fish, saw himself as "dead," only to be
resurrected; that is, saved from his fate, and only by the power of God.

  What does each verse say that helps explain why Jesus would
use the Jonah story as a "sign" of His own experience?

   Matt. 26:61; 27:62-64; Mark 14:58



   Matt. 28:6; Mark 16:6; John 21:14



   Acts 2:15; Rom. 4:24, 25; 1 Cor. 15:3-5; 2 Cor. 4:14; Eph. 1:20



    However poor a symbol of Jesus that Jonah was, the Lord uses the
story of Jonah, his descent to "sheol" and then his ascent back to
"life," as a symbol of what would happen to Him, when—having died
under the crushing weight of the world's sins—He would descend to
"sheol," only to be brought back to life by the same God who brought
Jonah back from "sheol," as well. And just as Jonah's "resurrection,"
in a small way, would lead to mercy given to the heathen, Christ's
resurrection would, as well, only, of course, on a much greater scale.
Jonah was a poor man's example of what would happen to Christ.

    Christ's resurrection from the dead leads to the promise of
 ours, as well (see 1 Thess. 4:14). Why is the promise so impor-
 tant to us as Christians? What would our faith mean without it?

                                                                       101
Friday                                             December 19
 FURTHER STUDY:

       he important point is that the Ninevites 'repented' in spite of the

T      fact that Jonah worked no miracles for them. They accepted his
      message on his own authority, because it carried conviction to
their hearts (see Jonah 3:5-10). The same should have been true in the
case of the scribes and Pharisees, for the message Christ bore certainly
carried with it convincing evidence of His authority (see on Mark 1:22,
27). But in addition to the words He spoke He wrought many wonderful
works, and these constituted an additional testimony that His words
were true (see John 5:36). Yet in spite of all this evidence the scribes
and Pharisees still obdurately refused to believe the evidence afforded
them."—The SDA Bible Commentary on Matthew 12:41, vol. 5, p. 398.
   Jesus said that He would spend "three days and three nights" in the
heart of the earth; yet, He was buried late Friday and rose Sunday
morning, which isn't three full days and nights; that is, a complete 72-
hour cycle. Obviously, then, the phrase "three days and three nights"
doesn't automatically mean exactly 72 hours. Instead, it's simply an
idiomatic expression meaning just three days, such as (in this case)
Friday, Sabbath, and Sunday (see Luke 23:46-24:3, 13, 21). It doesn't
have to mean a complete 24-hour Friday, a complete 24-hour Sabbath,
and a complete 24-hour Sunday. In other places, Jesus said that "in
three days" He would raise His body temple (John 2:19-21) or that He
would be "raised again the third day" (Matthew 16:21). These refer-
ences mean the same thing as the "three days and three nights"; that is,
Jesus would be crucified and raised from the dead over a three-day
period, even if only one of those days, the Sabbath, encompassed a
complete 24-hour day. He was crucified late Friday, spent Sabbath in
the tomb, and rose Sunday.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
    George Washington was the first president of the United
    States, right? Yet, who alive today ever met him? Who ever
    saw him in his office? Alexander the Great was a powerful
    leader of the ancient Greek Empire. But how do we know?
    Has anyone in your class ever met him or seen him in his
    role as leader? In other words, all these things, like the life
    of Jesus, require some amount of faith, do they not? Dis-
    cuss.

SUMMARY: Jesus used the Jonah story to give a stern warning. Who
will heed it?

                    One Person's Influence
                             John Ash III

   When Chan, a young bride, moved with her husband to his
hometown some 200 miles southeast of Hangzhou, China, she was
baffled that she could not find any Adventists living there. She
continued her search until she found a small group of Sabbathkeepers
who met in the home of one of their members. But the congrega-
tion was not Adventist. As she visited the little group of believers
she discovered their interesting origin.
    During World War II the United States offered the assistance of
military specialists to help the struggling Chinese army. Appar-
ently a Seventh-day Adventist military chaplain was assigned to
the region where this little group of believers lived. The chaplain
did more than just meet the needs of the military personnel; he
shared his faith with the local people, and eventually he led seven
of them to Christ. Shortly after he baptized the new believers, the
chaplain and his unit left the area.
    The little group of believers managed to build a tiny chapel, but
it burned down shortly after completion. Through the stormy
decades of Communism, atheism, and the stifling pressures of the
Chinese Cultural Revolution, the little group of believers managed
to continue worshiping, perhaps because they were isolated from
large population centers. But over the years, without the presence
of a minister, the little group lost nearly all of the Adventist
beliefs, but it managed to cling to the Sabbath and their belief that
 Jesus is coming soon. They thought they were the only
 Sabbathkeeping Christians in the world.
    Chan rejoiced to tell the little congregation that they were a part
 of a worldwide group of believers. She helped them contact an-
 other congregation of Adventists in a city two hours away. Today
 this larger congregation has begun to nurture the faithful little
 group, and today they have grown to more than 100 believers.
 They were excited to relearn biblical truths that they had lost over
 the weary decades. The larger church helped the little group buy
 and remodel a house for a chapel.
    The chaplain who led those first seven Chinese believers to
 Christ may never know this side of heaven what a powerful influ-
 ence his simple act of faith has made on the people with whom he
 shared his faith.

headquartered in Hong Kong.

              A Picture of God




Sabbath Afternoon

       HIS WEEK BEGINS THE END of our study on Jonah. Hard

T      to believe the book itself is only 48 verses. But brevity shouldn't
       be mistaken for shallowness. On the contrary, some of the most
profound concepts in Scripture can be expressed quite succinctly
("God is love," for instance). The book of Jonah might be short, but
its message touches themes we'll spend eternity trying to fathom.
    Of those themes, however, the most amazing is God's grace. We
really can't appreciate it fully, because we really can't see just how
fallen we are. The very thing we use to understand the world and our
place in it is our minds—and our minds, more than anything else, have
been tainted by sin. It's like asking someone in the midst of a drunken
stupor to explain the evil of alcohol use. Nevertheless, God has re-
vealed enough to us so we can learn to love Him and to express that
love in faith and obedience, which is all He asks.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE: What does the book of Jonah teach
about God's forgiveness? About His power over the world? How
does it reveal God's desire to have a personal relationship with us?
What role does morality play in Jonah or in the Bible, as a whole?

   MEMORY TEXT: " 'Comfort, 0 comfort My people' says
   your God. 'Speak kindly to Jerusalem; and call out to her,
   that her warfare has ended, that her iniquity has been re-
   moved, that she has received of the Lord's hand double for all
   her sins' " (Isaiah 40:1, 2, NASB).

GOD'S FORGIVENESS.



T
       he book of Jonah has something in common with all the
       biblical books: None of them ever tries to prove the existence
       of God. Not one of them ever expresses any doubt that God
exists. Nor do they merely speak of Him out of their imaginations.
Instead, without hesitancy, they fill the pages of Scripture with de-
tailed pictures of God in action within human history. The book of
Jonah is part of this vast panorama.
    And one picture, drawn very clearly from this book, is seen all
through the Bible (however uniquely presented in Jonah): our God's
willingness to forgive. God is always surprising human beings in His
capacity and inclination to forgive. Jonah, as with so many people,
has a hard time grasping this profound aspect of God's character. It
must be a difficult thing for sinful human beings to appreciate God's
radical grace. In the New Testament, the four Gospels frequently
recount that God is far more generous with His forgiveness than
most of us think.

  How do the following words of Jesus illustrate this aspect of
God's character; that is, His willingness to forgive?

   Matt. 7:7-11



   Matt. 20:1-16



   Luke 15:11-32



   The book of Jonah presents a profound picture of God's forgive-
ness. Perhaps this is the reason it is read by Jewish people at Minchah,
the afternoon service of the Day of Atonement, near the holiest hour
when Yom Kippur is nearing its peak. In the final hours, when judg-
ment is about to close, the book of Jonah is opened, with its powerful
emphasis on God's mercy.

    Do you harbor anger? Does it seethe within you (and maybe
 with good reason too)? How can dwelling on Jesus and His atti-
 tude of forgiveness help? Also, how can concentrating on what
 God has forgiven you for help you to learn to forgive others?

                                                                    105

GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE.



I
    n the book of Jonah, we are dramatically reminded that the extent
    of God's sovereignty is far more vast than merely a narrow focus
    on only believers. Even the pagan mariners of chapter 1 recognize
the power of the "great storm" involves more than just natural causes,
and it draws their attention to the great God of heaven and earth.
   Without exception, all the Bible writers allow no serious point of
comparison between the true God and any false gods. The decisive
and powerful actions of Yahweh are seen throughout Scripture in
stark contrast to all other gods, which are no gods at all.

  Review, again, the attributes of God's power over nature that
are portrayed in the book of Jonah. Then read Isaiah 40. In what
ways do we see the Lord do some things in the book of Jonah that
are expressed about Him in Isaiah 40?




   Notice especially verses 26 and 28 in Isaiah 40, because they both
make references to the Lord's creative power. It is because He is the
Creator and the Sustainer that He has such control over the world.
Hard as it might be for us to see at times, particularly in times of pain,
turmoil, and suffering, we, nevertheless, have the assurance that our
God is ultimately in control. We also have the promise that, in the end,
He will make all things right, if not now and not in this life then in the
life to come—the one life, that really matters, because it's eternal,
while our existence here is only a vapor.
   There's so much we just don't, and can't, understand. That's how it
always has been. But what the Lord teaches us through His Word and
also in the story of Jonah is that however much we don't understand,
we can know enough about God, about His character, about His
power, and, most important, about His love that we can trust Him
enough to love Him and stay faithful to our divine calling, which will
allow Him to work in us so others can learn about Him and His love,
as well. Only to the degree that we love and trust Him can He do this
through us.

   Wherever you live, as far as possible, step outside, read Isaiah
40 out loud, and look at the marvels of creation. What do you
see, and what does it tell you about the power of God?

GOD'S MORALITY.



H
        owever different the book of Jonah is from other books of the
        Bible, its message is consistent with them. And like the
        others, Jonah is very clear that God is a moral God, that the
Lord has a standard of morality that applies to all the world. However
differently the Lord might judge people, depending upon how much
light they've had, the world will, nevertheless, be judged by God's
standard of righteousness.

   Look up these texts. What is the essential message in them?
How do these texts relate to the story of Jonah? Pss. 9:8; 96:10, 13;
98:9; Acts 17:31; Rom. 3:6.


   In all of Scripture, religion and morality are related in the closest
possible way. The Bible knows nothing of morality apart from reli-
gion (the idea that you can have morality apart from religion is a
modern one). In Scripture, we find God consistently evaluating hu-
man history on a moral basis, no matter which person and no matter
which people group. This makes perfect sense, because just as He
created all human beings, He has placed them all under His moral
order, as well.

   Note how God speaks of Egypt and of the Amorites in Genesis
15:13-16. What is implied in these words regarding not only the
moral state of these pagan nations but their own personal respon-
sibility for their moral actions?


   In the book of Jonah, we observe further that even the wicked
Ninevites, when falling under the judgment of God, were convicted of
the correctness of God's sentence. Even more, a relationship with God
in the book of Jonah, as in all Scripture, is expressed in a moral life.
"Walking uprightly" before the Lord is a common expression in Scripture
for moral living. The importance of doing righteousness is constantly
stressed throughout the entire canon.

    As Seventh-day Adventists, we've often heard the statement
 made to us by other Christians, "Well, the law was done away
 with at the Cross," meaning, of course, that we no longer need to
 keep the Sabbath commandment. In light of today's study, in
 particular (not to mention the Bible, as a whole), why is that
 statement so erroneous? What would it mean if the law were
 done away with?

                                                                    107

GOD IS A PERSONAL BEING.

        od is pictured involved in personal relationships in the book

G       of Jonah. He is not just an abstract idea or some vague
        impersonal power. Neither is He a distant Being, barely in-
volved with the people on this earth. Nor is He a cosmic dictator who
seeks uncomprehending, speechless submission on the part of His
subjects. All through Scripture, we find Him pleading and reasoning
with human beings. One whole chapter in the book of Jonah is a
conversation between God and Jonah. In many ways, the whole life of
Jesus was a manifestation of God coming down and talking face-to-
face with us.

  Look up each of the following texts, in which God is speaking to
people. What, if anything, do they have in common?

   Gen. 4:1-7

   Exod. 3:1-8

   Job 38-41

   Jonah 4

   Acts 9:3-8

   Notice, in every one of these examples, God is seeking either to
warn, to inform, to teach, or to reveal Himself and His love to
sinful human beings. What these accounts show us is that God
deals with us as we are, beings with free wills who need to be
wooed away from evil choices or, in the cases of Cain and Jonah,
of wrong attitudes, which can be an evil choice, just as well. In all
these examples, we see a Lord who is working only for the benefit
of humanity, the same Lord who is working in our behalf today, as
well. Again, what's amazing is to think of the size of the universe,
at least the known universe (there's so much out there we don't
even know about), and then to realize that the God who created all
this wants to enter into a personal relationship with us! It is a
thought that defies the imagination.

   If someone were to ask you, How can I have a personal
relationship with the Lord? how would you answer? What are a
few of the crucial steps we must take in order to have that
relationship?

JESUS IS A PICTURE OF GOD.



T
       he God of the Old Testament, who sought a personal relation-
       ship with human beings, is the same God of the New Testa-
       ment. This is clearly seen through the life and ministry of Jesus.
   A preacher once described it like this: Imagine you are watching a
group of ants cross a street. Knowing that they are going to be squished
by the first vehicle that comes down the road, you stand above them
and shout, "Hey, ants, get out of the road!" More than likely, it
wouldn't work. So, instead, you become an ant, get down on their
level, and, speaking their language, lead them from the path of de-
struction. A bit fanciful, yes, but it does make the point: Jesus became
one of us in order to best communicate with us and, of course, in order
to redeem us from the path of destruction.

  What are some of the conversations of Jesus recorded in the
Gospels? What do they all have in common? In other words, what
was Jesus seeking to do in each of these conversations?

   Matt. 19:16-22

   Mark 7:24-37

   John 3:1-21

   John 4:1-27

   Christ gives human beings time and room to listen thoughtfully and
answer honestly. He allows people to dispute His Word or simply not
to listen. He never communicates in a way that forces anyone to
assent. That's simply not God's way. He wants us to obey Him
because we love Him, and love cannot be forced.
   In the book of Jonah, the Old Testament reaches one of its loftiest
points of revealing God in His relationship to creation and history and
His tender concern for all His creatures.
   With God's final question to Jonah—Should I not pity Nineveh,
and what about the animals?—we find one of the most amazing
biblical glimpses of the Personhood of God and His entanglement in
our human situation. What Jonah tells us is what all the Bible tells us:
We are not alone. Our God cares, however difficult it might seem to
appear to us on the surface. But that's part of the problem. We see
only on the surface. The Bible has been given to help us see, in a
sense, the formula behind the ferment.



                                                                     109

FURTHER STUDY:



D
         ivine love has been stirred to its unfathomable depths for the
         sake of men, and angels marvel to behold in the recipients of
         so great love a mere surface gratitude. Angels marvel at man's
shallow appreciation of the love of God. Heaven stands indignant at
the neglect shown to the souls of men. Would we know how Christ
regards it? How would a father and mother feel, did they know that
their child, lost in the cold and the snow, had been passed by, and left
to perish, by those who might have saved it? Would they not be
terribly grieved, wildly indignant? Would they not denounce those
murderers with wrath hot as their tears, intense as their love? The
sufferings of every man are the sufferings of God's child, and those
who reach out no helping hand to their perishing fellow beings pro-
voke His righteous anger. This is the wrath of the Lamb."—Ellen G.
White, The Desire of Ages, p. 825.
   "The Lord is in active communication with every part of His vast
dominions. He is represented as bending toward the earth and its
inhabitants. He is listening to every word that is uttered. He hears
every groan; He listens to every prayer; He observes the movements
of every one."—Ellen G. White, My Life Today, p. 292.
   "In Christ is the tenderness of the shepherd, the affection of the
parent, and the matchless grace of the compassionate Saviour. His
blessings He presents in the most alluring terms. He is not content
merely to announce these blessings; He presents them in the most
attractive way, to excite a desire to possess them. So His servants are
to present the riches of the glory of the unspeakable Gift."—Ellen G.
White, The Desire of Ages, p. 826.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
    Philosopher Bertrand Russell had been thrown in jail for
    antiwar activities. One of his jailers, wanting to start a
    conversation, asked Mr. Russell what his religious beliefs
    were. "I'm an agnostic," Russell replied. The jailer, looking
    puzzled (as if not quite sure what an agnostic was), finally
    answered with a big smile, "Oh, well, it really doesn't mat-
    ter. We all worship the same God anyway." From what you
    have learned this quarter, what's wrong with that answer,
    and why should we as Seventh-day Adventists, of all people,
    know why that answer is wrong?

SUMMARY: Let us praise God that He's more kind, loving, and
forgiving than we as human beings are.

           Prayer, the Chief Evangelistic Tool
                            J. H. Zachary

   Valli faced a huge problem. For years her husband had been
falling ever deeper into alcoholism. Often she suffered great pain
from his drunken blows. Valli and her children often tried to
escape his drunken wrath. When an evangelistic meeting was
advertised in her village she decided to attend.
   This was a difficult decision because the political party that
administered her village was determined that everyone should sup-
port the national religion. Her attendance brought extra burdens to
her personal life. Those who attended were forbidden to draw water
from the village well. Valli had to walk more than a mile (two
kilometers) to fetch water. However, as she began to experience a
new outlook on life, the long hike for water became bearable.
    As Valli surrendered her life to Jesus, her life took on new
directions. Old ways of thinking and acting disappeared. The
Holy Spirit was performing a spiritual miracle in her life. Her
drunkard husband began to see these changes in his wife and was
impressed by the power of the God that Valli so often referred 10.
    Out of the depths of discouragement Valli's husband accompa-
nied his wife to the evangelistic service. His life began to change.
When the couple's six adult children saw what was happening to
their parents, they, too, began to attend. The entire family has
been baptized.
    Villagers were deeply impressed by the power of Jesus to
change lives. The prejudice against Christians began to wane.
    Then a 6-year-old boy fell ill. The family could not afford medical
care, so they turned to the visiting teachers for help. The team
                                 gathered around the child in earnest
                                  prayer, and he was healed. The boy's
                                  miraculous recovery changed the atti-
                                  tude of the people in the village. At-
                                  tendance at the meetings grew, and as
                                  the meetings progressed, a baptismal
                                  class was organized.
                                     Today there is a new church with
                                  70 believers in this village.

In the biblical mosaic of God,
Jonah provides a major piece of the puzzle. Jo Ann Davidson,
assistant professor of theology at the Seventh-day Adventist
Theological Seminary, guides us through this carefully crafted book.
Analyzing the text as literature, she exposes hidden literary patterns
that provide clues to the meaning of the text.

Davidson shows how Jonah is full of contemporary themes that teach
us about our own human nature, and about a God who, if He loves
disobedient prophets and even wicked cities, must surely care for us.
