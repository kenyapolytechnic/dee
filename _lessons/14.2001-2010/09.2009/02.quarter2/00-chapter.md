            ne of the great eighteenth-to nineteenth-century thinkers,
            Pierre Laplace, wrote a book about the motion of the planets.
            He called it Celestial Mechanics, and he presented a copy of
  the book, in person, to Emperor Napoleon. Someone had told
  Napoleon beforehand that the book never mentioned God. The
  emperor took the book and said, ‚ÄúMr. Laplace, they tell me you have
  written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never
  even mentioned its Creator.‚Äù Laplace, unflinchingly, responded, ‚ÄúI
  have no need of that hypothesis.‚Äù
     This story is a metaphor for what‚Äôs been known as ‚Äúthe modern era,‚Äù
  an era in which logic, reason, and science have formed the foundation
  of all truth. According to this view, all reality can be reduced to for-
  mulas, to laws, and to scientific predictions. If it can‚Äôt be explained
                                   through logic, reason, and science, it

                                   alone. There‚Äôs something about us that
  no formula, no test tube, and no scientific law ever could capture.
     This backlash has spilled over into all realms of life, including reli-
  gion; however, as with most reactions, it has in some cases gone too
  far, even to the point of pushing aside or ignoring the concept of doc-
  trinal truth. What‚Äôs important, we‚Äôre told, isn‚Äôt teachings or doctrine
  but experience. What does your faith do for you now‚Äîthat‚Äôs what
  matters. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúHere are compelling reasons to believe in
  Jesus Christ and His promise of salvation,‚Äù the trend (again, a back-
  lash) is to say, ‚ÄúOur community of faith invites you to join us in our
  venture of trust and commitment.‚Äù
     Now, this doesn‚Äôt have to be all bad. Did not Jesus say that His truth
  would have concrete and practical results in our lives (John 8:32)? Of

course. Truth is not just knowledge of doctrines and texts but some-
thing that influences the believer on a personal level. Truth affects the
spiritual life and impacts how a person will relate to the challenges of
daily living. There is a practical, life-changing aspect of our religion
that never should be denied or denigrated. At the same time, the role
of experience never should take away from the importance of correct
biblical teachings.
  This quarter we want to look at both aspects of our faith: doctrine
and experience. In our study during this quarter we will focus on 13
essential themes of the Christian faith, 13 essential teachings. Each
week‚Äôs lesson will attempt to maintain a careful balance between a cor-
rect biblical understanding of these various elements of our faith and
how they impact our daily experience. It‚Äôs our hope that at the end of
the quarter you not only will understand these themes better but also
have been enriched as far as your Christian experience is concerned.
Each lesson is not just about truth but about ‚Äúthe truth as it is in
Jesus.‚Äù
  After all, He is the One who is the Alpha and Omega of our faith.
There may be 13 different themes, but they will have one focus: the
One in whom ‚Äúwe live, and move, and have our being‚Äù (Acts 17:28).

      Love




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Isaiah 53, Matt. 22:37‚Äì39,
      1 Corinthians 13, 1 John 3, 1 John 4.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and
      love. But the greatest of these is love‚Äù (1 Corinthians 13:13, NIV).

          t is only fitting that a study guide dealing with key concepts of the

      I   Christian faith should start with the topic of love. The apostle Paul
          points out that however important faith and hope and other ele-
      ments of Christianity are, it all starts with love. Without love, we are,
      as he said, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù (1 Cor. 13:2).
         Some five centuries before Christ was born, the Greek philosopher
      Sophocles said, ‚ÄúOne word frees us of all the weight and pain of life.
      That word is love.‚Äù True as these words are, this Greek sage still was
      ignorant about the depth of love that was to be proclaimed and mod-
      eled by our Savior.
         God is love. Whatever else God is, and whatever He has done, is
      doing, and will do‚Äîeverything is a manifestation of His love. This love
      is as comforting as it is difficult to comprehend. God‚Äôs love far exceeds
      what human beings usually label as love, which is sometimes a mere
      shallow feeling or temporary infatuation that‚Äôs often mixed with self-
      ishness and greed. God does not just have love or show love. He is love.

The Week at a Glance: God‚Äôs love for humanity has been
      revealed in numerous ways, the greatest being the cross. As fol-
      lowers of Jesus, we respond to His love by loving others as Christ
      loves us.

      Love‚Äîthe Fabric of Life
         We need to eat and drink in order to stay alive. Without liquid to
      drink or food to eat, we come to an end soon. But in order to live in
      any real sense of the word, we also need love. Life without love is a
      subhuman kind of existence. There is a built-in need in us to receive
      love. We need the love of parents. We need the love of family and
      friends. We need to be part of a loving community. But just as much
      as we need to receive love, we also need to give love. We are not truly
      human if we cannot love. But let‚Äôs be clear: True love does not begin
      with us. The capacity for love is created in us by our Creator. (See
      Gen. 1:26 and John 3:16.)

How all-important is love in the life of the follower of Christ? Matt.
      22:37‚Äì39, 1 Cor. 13:1‚Äì3, 1 John 3:14.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        God‚Äôs love always precedes our love. Whatever else we say about
      love, this point is crucial. True ‚Äúlove is not an impulse, but a divine
      principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart cannot origi-
      nate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it found.
      ‚ÄòWe love Him, because He first loved us‚Äô [1 John 4:19]. In the heart
      renewed by divine grace, love is the ruling principle of action.‚Äù
      ‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 551.
        The famous British author C. S. Lewis uses the terms ‚ÄúGift-love‚Äù
      and ‚ÄúNeed-love‚Äù to differentiate between God‚Äôs love and human forms
      of love. While God wants our love more than anything else, He does
      not need our love in the same way in which we need love from Him
      and from fellow human beings. ‚ÄúWe [must] begin at the real begin-
      ning, with love as the Divine energy. This primal love is Gift-love. In
      God there is no hunger that needs to be filled, only plenteousness that
      desires to give.‚Äù‚ÄîC. S. Lewis, The Four Loves (London: HarperCollins,
      1998), p. 121. Our human love needs to be transformed by divine love,
      so that‚Äîwhile we will continue to yearn for love from others‚Äîwe
      will be able to give love in a truly Christlike manner.

       From your own experience, what is the difference between
       human love and God‚Äôs love? What kind of human love best
       exemplifies God‚Äôs love? How can we better manifest God‚Äôs love
       in our own lives?




                                                                           7

      The Old Testament God‚Äîa God of
      Love
        It is often said that God‚Äôs love is clearly manifested only in the New
      Testament, while the ‚ÄúOld Testament God‚Äù is a God of justice and
      wrath. But careful study of the entire Bible shows that God does not
      have such a split personality. Though God‚Äôs love was manifested in the
      fullest measure in Christ (as portrayed in the New Testament), the God
      of Old Testament times is just as much a God of supreme love. God
      does not change (James 1:17). He does not gradually evolve from a
      God of wrath or a God of justice into a God of love. God‚Äôs love is eter-
      nal. The words to His Old Testament people apply to all times: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI
      have loved you with an everlasting love‚Äô ‚Äù (Jer. 31:3, NIV).

Take a look at a few important evidences of God‚Äôs love in Old Testament
      times as listed below and add a few other clear evidences of His
      love found elsewhere in the Old Testament.

      ‚Ä¢ God‚Äôs love in creation (Gen. 1:26‚Äì31, 2:21‚Äì25).

      _______________________________________________________

      ‚Ä¢ Providing a solution for the sin problem (Gen. 3:15, 22:8, Isaiah
      53).

      _______________________________________________________

      ‚Ä¢ The gift of the Sabbath (Exod. 31:12‚Äì17).

      _______________________________________________________

      ‚Ä¢ The continuous gift of prophecy (Amos 3:7).

      _______________________________________________________

         There are stories and statements in the Old Testament that are, at least
      on the surface, difficult to understand. It is true that we read about blood-
      shed and war. But never forget that God is consistently portrayed as the
      covenant God who draws people to Himself and does not forsake them,
      in spite of the fact that they turn their backs on Him time and again.

       What do you answer when confronted with questions about war
       and bloodshed in the Old Testament? How do you reconcile the
       divine commands to eliminate entire nations (for instance,
       Israel taking possession of the land of Canaan) with the concept
       of a God of love?

     The New Testament God‚Äîa God of
     Love
        Why did Jesus Christ come to the world? Why did He have to suf-
     fer, and was it necessary for Him to die on a cross? And why will He
     come again and restore this world to its original unblemished condi-
     tion? Was there no other way? And if not, why does it take so long
     before the sin problem is fully dealt with? We are in no position to
     answer these questions. In His infinite wisdom God devised a plan to
     deal with the predicament of sin in the best possible way. Being a holy
     God, He could not overlook the rebellion against His perfect law;
     being love, He could not stand back and let His creatures perish with-
     out doing His utmost to save them.
        ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs holiness is his majestic purity that cannot tolerate moral evil.
     God‚Äôs love is his outgoing, tenderhearted embrace of the sinner. God‚Äôs
     holiness is his separateness from what is unclean and profane. God‚Äôs
     love is his willingness to identify with those who are unclean in order to
     help them. . . . [But] God‚Äôs wrath is provisional whereas his love is eter-
     nal.‚Äù‚ÄîDonald G. Bloesch, God the Almighty: Power, Wisdom, Holiness,
     Love (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1995), pp. 140‚Äì143.

What do the following texts tell us about the New Testament message
     of God‚Äôs love?

     ‚Ä¢ God‚Äôs gift of His Son (John 3:16)
     ‚Ä¢ The Son‚Äôs giving of Himself (Phil. 2:5‚Äì8)
     ‚Ä¢ The gift of the Holy Spirit (John 14:15‚Äì18, Acts 2:1‚Äì4)
     ‚Ä¢ The availability of spiritual gifts (Eph. 4:11‚Äì13)
     ‚Ä¢ The certainty of salvation (1 John 3:1‚Äì3)
     ‚Ä¢ An eternal future in an environment of love (2 Peter 3:13)

How would you summarize the New Testament message about the
     love of God?

      How do the three angels‚Äô messages of Revelation 14:6‚Äì12 fit in
      this overall New Testament theme of divine love? Ellen White
      speaks about the message of the third angel as the good news of
      justification by faith ‚Äúin verity.‚Äù How does that all fit in with the
      theme of God‚Äôs love for humanity?

     A Response of Love
       The tragic reality of this world is one of self-love, blind ambition,
     hatred, competition, corruption, and war. As long as the citizens of
     this world let themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, be guided by the
     principles of the prince of darkness, love will have no chance to blos-
     som. Mother Teresa once said, ‚ÄúIf you judge people, you have no time
     to love them.‚Äù
       If we truly have been converted and become disciples of the Lord,
     the principle of love will reign in our lives. Whatever our weaknesses,
     we will steadily grow in our love for God and for our fellow human
     beings. In a very real sense conversion is reorientation‚Äîa shift away
     from the love of self to the love for God and to the love of others.

What underlying principle should we discern as we study the com-
     mandments that God has given us? Has this principle been oper-
     ating differently since Christ came to this world? Deut. 6:5, 6;
     Matt. 22:37‚Äì40.

       If we truly have been changed by Jesus Christ, His love will char-
     acterize our dealings with other people. Though we may not like some
     people, we are called to love everyone, even our greatest enemy. This
     not only will benefit the people we associate with but will also prove
     an enormous blessing for ourselves. Give love and unconditional
     acceptance to those you encounter and notice what happens.

How should love permeate what we say and do? Matt. 5:44, 25:31‚Äì46,
     1 Pet. 1:22.

       ‚ÄúIf church members will put away all self-worship, and will receive
     in their hearts the love for God and for one another that filled Christ‚Äôs
     heart, our heavenly Father will constantly manifest His power through
     them. Let His people be drawn together with the cords of divine love.
     Then the world will recognize the miracle-working power of God, and
     will acknowledge that He is the Strength and the Helper of His
     commandment-keeping people.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White Comments, The
     SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 940.

      Are you naturally loving or naturally selfish and self-centered?
      What practical steps can you take to move away from self and
      manifest love toward others?

      Love Personified
         Jesus Christ is our ultimate Role Model. If we wonder what our love
      should be like, we need to look only at our Savior. In Him we see the
      perfect example. Humanly speaking, Christ had every reason to dis-
      like or even hate a lot of people. The spiritual leaders were so envious
      of His success that they constantly harassed Him and eventually
      decided to eliminate Him. Why should He have loved these people?
      His own family was at times less than supportive. His disciples often
      fought among themselves and were absent when their presence would
      have counted most. How could He love them at those moments when
      they totally forsook Him?
         Besides all this, Jesus also manifested His love in particular toward
      those who would not get much positive attention from the spiritual
      leaders of His day: women (including prostitutes), those who suffered
      from leprosy, people from Samaria, members of the occupying force,
      and tax gatherers.
         Take a careful look at some concrete examples of Jesus showing
      unselfish love, in circumstances in which most people would have
      found it difficult to do so.

                 1. Luke 17:12‚Äì19
                 2. John 13:1‚Äì17
                 3. John 19:25‚Äì27

How should the manifestation of divine love in the ministry of Jesus
      impact our discipleship? 2 Cor. 5:14, Phil. 2:2.

        The love of Christ compels us, the apostle Paul says (2 Cor. 5:14).
      The English translation is somewhat ambiguous, for the original
      Greek construction may be translated as the love that comes from
      Christ, as well as the love that we have for Christ. Both meanings are
      grammatically justified and also are theologically correct. When we
      grasp something of the magnitude of Christ‚Äôs love, it will create a lov-
      ing response, and this will give us the intense desire to share that love
      with others.

       Jesus also loved those who were despised by most other people
       and were generally considered rather unlovable. He went out of
       His way to show them His love. How do I show my love to the
       homeless, to people who live at the fringes of society, and to those
       who do not in any way represent the values that I treasure?




                                                                           11

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Love for Man,‚Äù
          pp. 9‚Äì16, in Steps to Christ. Also read ‚ÄúCalvary,‚Äù pp. 741‚Äì757 and
          ‚Äú ‚ÄòIt Is Finished,‚Äô ‚Äù pp. 758‚Äì768, in The Desire of Ages, which deal
          with the final moments of Christ‚Äôs earthly life. The book The Four
          Loves, by C. S. Lewis, is an inspiring essay on the various kinds of
          human and divine love.

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè1 One cannot escape the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù question: If God is love, why is
           there so much suffering? It is not only the scale of suffering that
           causes people to question God‚Äôs love but also the fact that so
1          much appears to affect innocent people, and so much appears
           utterly senseless. How do we, as Seventh-day Adventist
           Christians, deal with this reality? How does our understanding
           of the great controversy help us understand this difficult topic?

           ‚óè2 How can one love an abusing parent, a serial killer, or a totally
2          selfish person? How did Jesus love those who were totally unlov-
           able?

           ‚óè3 How can one continue loving if there is no response to that
           love? Again, how did Jesus continue to love those who would
           never love Him back?

           ‚óè4 Who are the outcasts, the despised, and the reviled in your own
3          society? What kind of outreach and ministry does your church
           have for those people? What would it take to get yourself and
           your church involved in such a work?

           ‚óè
           5 In a real sense, true love demands a death to self, a willingness
           to put self aside for the good of others. What choices do we have
           to make in order to experience that death ourselves?

           ‚óè6 Besides the Cross, what are other ways that we can see God‚Äôs
           love for humanity?

    Summary: God is love. This characteristic is the basis for everything God
       is and does. This loving God is already revealed in the Old Testament,
       but His love is seen in its ultimate form in the gift of His Son, Jesus
       Christ, for our salvation. This divine love finds a response in the love
       of the Christian. If we profess to be disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ,
       our life will be marked by unconditional love toward our Maker and
       unselfish love for others.

Mad Man Goes to Church
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Mekonin lived in a farming village in Ethiopia. Many people in this vil-
lage didn‚Äôt like Adventists, and some even wanted to destroy the local
Adventist church.
   One day people noticed that Mekonin was behaving erratically. He became
angry easily and even tried to kill his wife. Fortunately, she and their children
fled to her parents‚Äô home. As Mekonin‚Äôs behavior became more demonic, the
neighbors feared for their own safety. They chained him to a pillar in his home
and stayed a safe distance away.
   Then someone mentioned that when the Adventists pray for people, they‚Äôre
healed. The next Sabbath morning several strong men bound Mekonin in
chains and led him to the Adventist church. The men sat down on a bench near
the back surrounding Mekonin, ready to subdue him if he became aggressive.
The visitors sat quietly through Sabbath School and church. Then the pastor,
deacons, and church elders gathered around Mekonin and prayed for him.
   ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you throw water on him?‚Äù one of the neighbors asked. The pas-
tor explained that the power to heal Mekonin was in Christ, not in the water.
The pastor asked the men to bring Mekonin back the next day for prayer.
   On Sunday the neighbors returned to the Adventist church with Mekonin,
but this time he came without the chains. About 60 people came to pray for
Mekonin or to watch what happened.
   The following Sabbath, Mekonin visited the Adventist church again. He
walked with some Adventist members and was not bound by chains. Mekonin
took part in the worship service. The pastor knew of another Adventist church
nearer to Mekonin‚Äôs home and asked the local elders to go to Mekonin‚Äôs home
and pray with him. Other Adventist groups learned about Mekonin‚Äôs condition
and joined in praying for him. Within two weeks Mekonin was healed of the
demons who had possessed him.
   Mekonin‚Äôs wife learned that her husband had been healed; she and her chil-
dren returned home.
   Mekonin and his wife joined the Adventist church, along with neighbors
who had once wanted to destroy the church but had seen God heal Mekonin
in answer to the believers‚Äô prayers. Today six Adventist churches stand in the
area near Mekonin‚Äôs home, testimonies of God‚Äôs goodness and power to save.
   Your mission offerings help spread the gospel in farming villages and large
cities around the world so that people chained by darkness can be freed by
Jesus, the Light of the World.

      Faith




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Eph. 6:10‚Äì18; Hebrews 11;
      James 2:18, 19; 1 Pet. 1:3‚Äì8.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúFor it is by grace you have been saved, through
      faith‚Äîand this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äînot by
      works, so that no one can boast‚Äù (Ephesians 2:8, 9, NIV).

             aith is not to be confused with rational conviction. Faith in the

      F      biblical sense is not based primarily on our reason (even though
             it is not unreasonable or irrational!); nor is it based on our emo-
      tions (though emotions do play a role). Faith is a deep-rooted assur-
      ance that affects the entire person. Faith is a principle that governs the
      life. Faith is the means by which we reach out and grab hold of the
      promises of a God we can‚Äôt see yet we know is there.
         Hebrews 11:1 speaks about the ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù of our faith. William G.
      Johnsson, an expert on Hebrews, suggests that the best translation is,
      ‚ÄúFaith is the title deed to what we hope for, the certainty of what we
      do not see.‚Äù‚ÄîHebrews, The Abundant Life Bible Amplifier (Boise,
      Idaho: Pacific Press¬Æ Publishing Association, 1994), p. 204.

The Week at a Glance: Faith is the guiding principle in
      the life of a Christian. It‚Äôs how we are to live and to relate to God
      and to others. However important an intellectual assent to doc-
      trines is, faith is so much more than just that. This week we‚Äôll look
      at how much more.

      Faith‚Äîa Gift From God
        What is faith?
        A simple definition could read something like this: ‚ÄúFaith is a con-
      fident and obedient trust in the reality, power, and love of God as
      revealed in His acts and in His promises to us.‚Äù
        What a wonderful gift to have in a terribly fallen and broken world
      such as ours. No wonder many believe that faith is the most wonder-
      ful of all gifts humans could have.
        Now, the question is, Have you ever tried to discover where your
      faith originated? Why is it that you have faith in God and in others you
      know don‚Äôt? Was it your upbringing? Did you have believing parents?
      Have you always attended church? Did your study of the Bible, and
      your reading of books about the Bible, convince you that there is a
      God who loves you? Did you find satisfying philosophical arguments
      that prepared you for the ‚Äúleap‚Äù of faith? In the final analysis, faith is
      a miracle, a gift from God.

How does the apostle Paul underline the gift-character of faith? Eph.
      2:8.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         One thing is sure: Just as we cannot be fully human without love, we
      cannot be what we are intended to be without faith. ‚Äú ‚ÄòWithout faith it is
      impossible to please God.‚Äô . . . Note that Hebrews does not teach that
      without faith it is difficult to please God, or that without faith it will take
      a long time to satisfy Him. To the contrary, it claims that it is impossible.
      In short, faith has no substitute. It is by faith that God‚Äôs heroes lived in
      the past, and it is by faith that His people must live today.‚Äù‚ÄîGeorge R.
      Knight, Exploring Hebrews: A Devotional Commentary (Hagerstown,
      Md.: Review and Herald¬Æ Publishing Association, 2003), p. 198.

How can we position ourselves in a way that prepares us for the gift
      of faith? That is, what changes can we make in our lives to make
      us more receptive to that gift? Rom. 10:17; see also Heb. 11:6.

       Sometimes you hear people say that they wish they had faith.
       What would you advise such people? What kind of changes
       might they need to make in order to be more receptive to receiv-
       ing the gift? See Mark 9:24.

                                                                                 15

      The Basis of Our Faith
         A famous English hymn that has been translated in countless lan-
      guages reminds us, ‚ÄúMy hope is built on nothing less / Than Jesus‚Äô
      blood and righteousness‚Äù (The Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal, no.
      522). It is important that we never forget this truth. Jesus Christ is the
      ultimate foundation and source of our faith. But even though the gift
      of faith is a mystery that remains beyond our comprehension, we have
      been given some insights into how faith is awakened and strength-
      ened. Some men and women in Bible times had a sudden experience
      that started them on the journey of faith. Paul is probably the most
      prominent example. Others tell of a much more gradual awareness of
      God‚Äôs leading in their life, which brought focus and direction in their
      pilgrimage of faith. No doubt, experience is an essential and powerful
      component of our spiritual life. But faith also must have content, and
      the revelation provided in the Scriptures plays the major role in estab-
      lishing us in our faith.

What role do the Scriptures play in the faith experience of the
      believer? John 5:39, 2 Tim. 3:15.


        Clearly, the Scriptures are of extreme importance, and if we neglect
      them it will be at our own peril. But how the Scriptures exactly help to
      awaken and build our faith cannot be expressed in any human formula.
      Not even the famous faith definition of Hebrews 11 provides this.
      ‚ÄúHebrews 11:1 doesn‚Äôt give us a definition of pistis [the Greek word
      for faith] so much as a description of the way faith works. Certainly the
      apostle isn‚Äôt advancing a psychological explanation of faith. Rather, he
      sets out the two cardinal abilities that faith makes possible‚Äîturning
      hope into reality and the unseen into sight.‚Äù‚ÄîWilliam G. Johnsson,
      Hebrews, The Abundant Life Bible Amplifier, p. 205.

What does James 2:18, 19 tell us about the character of faith? Why is
      faith more than intellectual assent to belief in the existence of God
      and other doctrines?


       Why is Bible reading a life-changing experience for some people
       while others claim that it ‚Äúdoes nothing‚Äù for them? What would
       you advise a person who reads the Bible and enjoys it as litera-
       ture but claims not to hear the voice of God speaking in it?

     Exercising Faith
        In their telling of the stories of Christ‚Äôs healing miracles, the Gospel
     writers emphasized that the underlying factor was not magic but faith.
     The people who were healed were challenged to exercise their faith.
     ‚Äú ‚ÄòAccording to your faith will it be done to you,‚Äô ‚Äù Jesus said (Matt.
     9:29, NIV). Extraordinary experiences that carry an undeniable stamp
     of miraculous divine intervention do not always result in faith, how-
     ever. The truth is that many people find ways of explaining such
     divine interventions away.

Read Luke 16:30, 31. What important point can we take from here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Our faith will be strengthened by the experience of seeing God at
     work in our own lives and in the lives of others, but our faith often will
     precede God‚Äôs interventions in our life. Faith will expect God to show
     His hand. God has promised that He will act through us and on our
     behalf if we have faith in Him. In that trusting faith we must take Him
     at His word.

How do Romans 1:17; Galatians 5:6; James 2:17, 18; and 1 John 5:4,
     5 reflect various aspects of this ‚Äúliving through faith‚Äù?

     ____________________________________________________________________

What is, on the other hand, the tragic result when faith is absent?
     Rom. 11:20, Heb. 3:19.

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The context of Romans 11:20 makes it clear that Paul was speaking
     about the ancient Hebrews, who had received the promise of salvation
     in a covenant relationship with Him. They could have experienced the
     abundant life in Christ that faith brings to all who exercise it, but their
     experience, and failure, is a clear reminder to us that ‚Äúwithout faith it
     is impossible to please God‚Äù (Heb. 11:6, NIV).

      Though your faith is a gift, what good reasons do you have for
      it? Also, even more important, what are practical ways in which
      you can strengthen your faith? At the same time, what are sure
      ways of losing it?




                                                                            17

      Growing in Faith
         Faith will increase if, when brought in contact with doubts and obsta-
      cles, we press on ahead, claiming the promises of God regardless of how
      we might feel at any given moment or regardless of how hostile the cir-
      cumstances might be. Faith is more than a feeling; it‚Äôs a principle that
      transcends the fickleness of human emotions. Faith is doing what we
      know God asks us to do even though we don‚Äôt feel like doing it.
         If you are growing in grace and the knowledge of Jesus Christ, you
      will improve every privilege and opportunity to gain more knowledge
      of the life and character of Christ; that is, you will do everything you
      can to grow in grace and increase in faith.
         Faith in Jesus will grow as you become better acquainted with Him.
      This can happen by dwelling upon His life and love. You cannot dis-
      honor God more than to profess to be His disciple while keeping your-
      self at a distance from Him.

What challenge did Peter hold out to the believers? 2 Pet. 3:18.


How had the church in Thessalonica lived up to that challenge?
      2 Thess. 1:3.


And how does the ‚Äúshield of faith‚Äù help you to grow spiritually? How
      does faith relate to the rest of the ‚Äúarmour of God‚Äù as described
      in Ephesians 6:10‚Äì18?


         The goal of the Christian is to become ‚Äúmature‚Äù in faith. This is a
      lifelong process. While we experience the blessing of growth and
      ‚Äústand firm in the faith‚Äù (1 Cor. 16:13, NIV), we may at times wonder
      why others are still ‚Äúweak‚Äù (Rom. 14:1). There is often a tendency to
      forget that it also has taken most of us considerable time before we
      arrived at where we are today spiritually. But whatever our reaction
      may be, it never should be one of pride and judgment (1 Cor. 10:12).
      God is the One who makes every seed of faith sprout, and He also is
      to be credited for any growth that takes place in our spiritual life. Yet,
      while that is a truth that must never be forgotten, we also must remem-
      ber that by our personal choices we can help create the right kind of
      environment in which spiritual growth can take place.

       Are there associations you have, places you visit, or certain
       kinds of media you expose yourself to that negatively impact
       faith? If so, how willing are you to give them up? The answer
       depends on how important your faith really is to you.

      Faith in a Person
         Doctrines are important. When we say that we believe in God, we
      will want to know more about God, and we will be eager to absorb
      what He has revealed to us. It only is natural that we want to provide
      a structured account of what we believe about our Creator and His
      dealings with us, and we want to be sure that we know His will. But
      though we believe that the doctrines of our church are true, our faith
      is anchored, not in a doctrinal system alone, but in Jesus. The doc-
      trines are not an end in and of themselves. The doctrines help us bet-
      ter understand Jesus and what He has done for us.
         In a sense, the role of doctrines in the Christian faith may be com-
      pared to the role of grammar. We can communicate through language
      only because there is a grammatical structure in the words we say and
      write. Similarly, we give a structure to the content of our faith through
      the doctrines. Anselm, a medieval theologian, spoke the famous words
      that theology is faith that seeks to understand itself.

What does the New Testament tell us about the importance of sound
      doctrine? 1 Tim. 4:16, Titus 2:1.


         Sound doctrine is essential, but doctrine and theology that remain life-
      less theory can save no one. One even can be a theologian without being
      a believer. Faith, ultimately, is not just holding a number of beliefs as bib-
      lically correct but is trust in the Person of whom these doctrines speak.

How is salvation in this life and the life beyond connected with faith
      in the Source of life? John 3:36, 6:35.


What is the fundamental conviction on which the church is built?
      Matt. 16:13‚Äì19.


        The passage in Matthew 16 often has been used as proof that the
      apostle Peter should be considered the founder of the Christian
      church. This idea finds no biblical support. On the contrary: Christ is
      the Stone on which the church is built. (See 1 Pet. 2:4‚Äì8.) And it is the
      faith in this Stone‚Äîthe unshakable conviction that Jesus, the Son of
      God, is our Savior‚Äîthat makes the church what it is, not a human
      institution but the church of God.

       Someone says, ‚ÄúI believe in Jesus, believe in the teachings, yet
       sometimes I can‚Äôt help struggling with doubt.‚Äù What would you
       say to that person? What help and counsel could you give?
                                                                                19

    Further Study: ‚ÄùPeter exhorts his brethren to ‚Äògrow in grace, and
          in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.‚Äô 2 Peter 3:18.
          When the people of God are growing in grace, they will be constantly
          obtaining a clearer understanding of His word. They will discern new
          light and beauty in its sacred truths. This has been true in the history
          of the church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the end. . . .
             ‚ÄúBy faith we may look to the hereafter and grasp the pledge of God
          for a growth of intellect, the human faculties uniting with the divine,
          and every power of the soul being brought into direct contact with the
          Source of light. We may rejoice that all which has perplexed us in the
1
          providences of God will then be made plain.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, Steps
          to Christ, pp. 112, 113.

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè1 Hebrews 11 provides a gallery of heroes of faith. Notice,

2
           though, how flawed in character and actions just about every one
           of them were. What encouragement can you draw from their mis-
           takes and sins when you yourself are tempted to give up faith
           because of your own sins and flaws?

           ‚óè
           2 Many of us have at some time or another gone through a cri-
           sis of faith and have come out of this experience renewed. If this
           has happened to you, how did you survive the crisis? What can
3
           you do when it appears that members of your family or local
           church members are in the midst of a similar struggle? What did
           you learn from your own experience that could help them?

           ‚óè
           3 What are the challenges to your faith? Are they of an intellec-
           tual nature, that is in the area of science versus religion? Or are
           they related to the environment in which you live and work, or
           where you find your recreation? Or possibly in the area of rela-
           tionships? Why is it important to meet these challenges head-on?

           ‚óè4 You don‚Äôt need faith to believe in what you can prove; you
           need faith to believe in what you can‚Äôt prove. Why is it important
           to realize that regardless of all the evidence we have for our
           beliefs, there will be things we just don‚Äôt understand?

    Summary: Faith is experience. It has to do with certainty. And with trust.
       The Scriptures play a role in the awakening, the strengthening, and the
       sustenance of faith. But faith isn‚Äôt just belief; it is a principle that
       guides how we live our lives before God and others.

A Place to Call Home
by ZHANA SEDYSHEVA
   I live in Vladivostok, the large seaport on the eastern coast of Russia. My
young daughter was seriously ill, and I began to despair that she would
recover. I prayed to the great God above, and He healed her! I wanted to
thank Him for this miracle by worshiping in a church, but I didn‚Äôt know
which church I should pray in. My friend suggested that I worship at the
Adventist church in another part of the city.
   I was impressed by the simplicity of the worship service I found there, and
I left feeling calm and at peace. I continued worshiping there and eventually
joined the Adventist Church. The congregation was growing, and eventually
the rented room where we met could not hold everyone who wanted to wor-
ship there. We prayed for another place to worship, and I hoped it would be
closer to where I lived.
   We rented a restaurant where we could hold our worship services. The
restaurant was quiet, but a tourist club next door was so noisy that it dis-
rupted our worship. We prayed for a more suitable place to worship, a place
large enough to hold all of us, a place away from the noise of other busi-
nesses.
   I worked in a kindergarten and asked the manager whether we could rent
the large kindergarten hall for our worship. We were permitted to use the
hall on Sabbaths. It was light and roomy‚Äîand quiet! But before long some-
one wrote an anonymous letter filled with angry criticism that the kinder-
garten would allow a religious group to meet in the building on Sabbaths.
   I felt sick that our worship could cause problems for this school, which
had a fine reputation in the city. I tried to put the matter into God‚Äôs hands,
but again and again we were attacked. I was so troubled that I became phys-
ically sick. The church members prayed for me and for the kindergarten, and
God answered. I recovered my health, and the criticisms against the kinder-
garten were dismissed when the parents of children in the kindergarten
defended us.
   Now the city of Vladivostok has given permission for our mother church
to build a new church and evangelistic center. Although we see no human
means to build this church, we know that God will provide for us. I am on
fire with a renewed desire to share His message with my colleagues and
friends.
   Your Sabbath School mission offerings help us spread God‚Äôs message in
difficult-to-reach areas such as Russia. Thank you for your prayers and your
support.

      Hope




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Luke 21:25, 26; John 5:24;
      1 Cor. 15:20‚Äì26; 50‚Äì55; Revelation 21.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúAlways be prepared to give the answer to every-
      one who asks you to give a reason for the hope that you have‚Äù (1 Peter
      3:15, NIV).

             he twentieth century began in a mood of great optimism. Since

      T      the beginning of the Enlightenment Era, optimism had domi-
             nated the way of thinking in the Western world. As human
      beings, we could not only discover all truth using reason, we also were
      capable of moral perfection. New inventions, new modes of travel, the
      dramatic increase of medical knowledge, the introduction of new
      machines, and the steady advancement of human morals would
      improve all lives. But after two world wars, the holocaust, the nuclear
      threat of the cold war, and worldwide terrorism as an ever-present
      danger, coupled with the realization that humankind is in the process
      of destroying the environment it needs for human survival, little rea-
      son for optimism remains.
        However, there is hope, not in what we see or in what we can do but
      in what God has promised us through Jesus, His Son.

The Week at a Glance: As followers of Christ we can have
      hope even amid a world that in and of itself offers none. And
      that‚Äôs because this hope is not based on ourselves or on anything
      we or the world can offer. This hope is based solely on Jesus and
      His promises to us.

      Hope Amid Our World
        Life after September 11, 2001, has greatly changed. People will
      always remember the images of passenger airliners flying into the
      twin towers of the World Trade Center. We all realize that it can hap-
      pen again. There is no way we can be fully protected from people who
      are prepared to die as they use an airplane, filled with men, women,
      and children, as a flying bomb or are willing to blow themselves up at
      a bus stop or in a supermarket. There is fear everywhere, and consid-
      ering the world we live in, that fear is understandable.

What did Jesus single out as one of the characteristics of the time of
      the end? Luke 21:25, 26.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         ‚ÄúTransgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion fills the
      world, and a great terror is soon to come upon human beings. The end
      is very near. God‚Äôs people should be preparing for what is to break
      upon the world as an overwhelming surprise.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, Child
      Guidance, p. 555. Imagine what she would say were she alive in our
      post-9/11 environment!
         Ours is a world of war, corruption, greed, and terror. And we know
      that many unpleasant things yet will occur in the future‚Äîin the world,
      and even in the church. But whatever happens, we have hope through
      Jesus. There may be anguish among the nations. People may even
      faint from terror‚Äî‚Äúapprehensive of what is coming on the world‚Äù
      (Luke 21:26, NIV)‚Äîbut this will not be the case for those who have
      been expecting their Lord. None of these horrible things should take
      us by surprise. After all, the Bible has warned us all through its pages
      that we should expect toil, suffering, and trouble until Jesus returns.
      The fact that we see these things should only help confirm for us the
      truth of God‚Äôs Word.

Read Luke 21:28. What hope is Jesus offering us amid all the turmoil
      and fear of the world?

      ____________________________________________________________________

       Why is it so fruitless, and empty, to place our hope in this world
       or in what this world offers? Why do we tend to do that, even
       though it should be obvious by now that if we are to have any
       hope, it must be a hope that transcends whatever this world can
       give?

      Hope‚ÄîHere and Now
        The Christian hope has to do with the future: Christ‚Äôs return; the res-
      urrection of God‚Äôs people; a new heaven and a new earth; eternity with
      God. But salvation is also a present reality. That kind of hope sepa-
      rates us from those without the certainty that life has meaning and that
      in Christ humanity has an eternal future. The apostle Paul reminds us
      of the radical change that takes place when we accept Jesus as our
      Lord. As long as we are separated from Christ, we are ‚Äúwithout hope
      and without God in the world‚Äù (Eph. 2:12, NIV). But all this changes
      when we are no longer ‚Äúfar away‚Äù from God but have been ‚Äúbrought
      near through the blood of Christ‚Äù (vs. 13, NIV).

In what terms did Jesus describe the radical change that takes place
      when we ‚Äúhear‚Äù His Word and believe in Him? John 5:24.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

What kind of life can be ours? John 10:10. What does this mean, and
      how should we be experiencing this promise?

        ‚ÄúLife‚Äù is one of the key words of the Gospel of John. In Matthew,
      Mark, and Luke the concept of life is primarily eternal life. ‚ÄúBut in the
      Gospel of John, life is particularly focused on the present reality of
      what Jesus does for those who believe in Him. . . .
        ‚ÄúThere are two keys to attaining life at its best. The first is to know
      that the source of that life is found only in Christ (John 14:6; 6:33‚Äì58;
      1 John 5:11, 12). Wherever Jesus is, life is (John 11:25, 26). The sec-
      ond key to attaining life is believing (1:4, 12). It is through continu-
      ous relationship with Jesus that individuals appropriate the life that is
      ever present in Jesus (3:16, 36).‚Äù‚ÄîJon Paulien, John, The Abundant
      Life Bible Amplifier (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press¬Æ Publishing
      Association, 1995), p. 189.

      Hope Beyond the Grave
         Death comes to all of us (unless we are alive at the moment of
      Christ‚Äôs return). All of us have lost loved ones in death. We are daily
      confronted with the grim reality of death. We see it as we pass ceme-
      teries, see hearses, or switch on the television news. But even worse,
      we face it up close as we say our final goodbye to a friend or relative.
      Death is our archenemy, but it is one that will be defeated.

What is the glorious truth about the reality of death? 1 Cor. 15:20‚Äì26,
      50‚Äì55, 1 Pet. 1:3.

      ____________________________________________________________________

How does the certainty of the resurrection divide humanity? 1 Thess.
      4:14.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The apostle Paul, in his famous chapter about the resurrection
      (1 Corinthians 15), stresses that the hope of the resurrection is an
      essential component of our total faith experience (vss. 12‚Äì19). If there
      is no resurrection, our faith is empty.
         Of course, there are many aspects of the physical resurrection that we
      do not understand. But of one thing we can be sure: Our ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù
      does not depend on the safekeeping of the present material substances
      of our bodies. It depends on the power of our Creator to safeguard our
      identity and to re-create us at a given moment with a new (perfect) body
      that will never need any cosmetic surgery or antiaging pills.
         We have no idea how God is going to perform this miracle. But the
      God who could create life here to begin with certainly has the power
      to re-create the earth and fill it with the people whose identities have
      been safeguarded in the divine memory. Our hope is not based on any-
      thing we can verify with our intellect or our senses. The resurrection
      involves a realm of existence far beyond anywhere science can take
      us. But it is based on the fact that Christ has conquered death. As a
      result, the death of the believer is but a temporary ‚Äúsleep‚Äù from which
      he or she will be raised and given eternal life.

       Even with this great hope, the greatest any of us could have, we
       still hate death, we still fear it, and we still flee from it. This is
       only natural (for death is unnatural). At the same time, what
       can we do to nourish and strengthen our confidence in the great
       promise that we have regarding eternal life, a promise that
       alone can lessen our fear of death now?


                                                                           25

      Eternal Hope
         How can finite beings ever understand what it is to be infinite? How
      can we, as mortals‚Äîmost of whom will not live beyond 80 or 90
      years‚Äîever understand what it is to be immortal and live forever?
      Eternal life is not simply a continuation of our present life. That would
      in many ways more resemble ‚Äúhell‚Äù than ‚Äúheaven.‚Äù Eternal life has an
      altogether different quality. While we are still in our present mortal
      state, we will have to be content with a glimpse of what the future
      holds: We see but ‚Äúa poor reflection‚Äù and ‚Äúknow [only] in part‚Äù (1 Cor.
      13:12, NIV).

In what ways will eternal life differ from our present existence? 1 Cor.
      15:42, 43, 52; Revelation 21. What things will be similar?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         We are left with lots of questions as we contemplate the life that
      awaits us, questions that will never be fully answered here and now.
      But we can learn from Jesus‚Äô own resurrection. It is important to note
      that the Christ who was raised from the dead was the same Person as
      the One who a few days earlier died on the cross. He arose with a ‚Äúglo-
      rified‚Äù body that was no longer subject to the laws of nature in the way
      our present mortal bodies are. Yet at the same time, He possessed a
      continuity with the ‚Äúhuman form‚Äù that He had prior to His death and
      resurrection. He was the same Person, recognizable by His outward
      appearance, His voice, and His gestures. That gives us good reason to
      conclude that in our new ‚Äúglorious bodies‚Äù we will be recognized by
      those we knew in this life and who will enjoy the life in the beyond
      with us.
         And yet, we can also experience some of that eternal life now. Paul
      explains to us (Rom. 8:10) that the Spirit will enter the person who has
      turned to Christ. The believer, therefore, is already touched by the eter-
      nal life that will become a full reality in the world to come. The pres-
      ence of the Spirit is the pledge of our eternal salvation (Eph. 1:13, 14).

       Try to imagine what life will be like in a new heaven, a new
       earth, with new bodies. Let your imagination soar; write out a
       paragraph based on what we find in the Bible, about what this
       new life will be like. How foolish to throw it all away for any-
       thing that this life offers us.

      Christ Our Hope
        Long before Christ entered this world, His coming had been pre-
      dicted. True to those promises, He did indeed come. Manifold are the
      promises that He will come a second time. He said so Himself: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI will
      come back!‚Äô ‚Äù On the final page of the Bible this promise is repeated:
      ‚Äú ‚ÄòYes, I am coming soon‚Äô ‚Äù (Rev. 22:20, NIV). This is the corporate
      hope of Christian believers. It is ‚Äúthe blessed hope‚Äîthe glorious
      appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ‚Äù (Titus 2:13, NIV).

In what sense does the hope of the Christian culminate in the second
      coming of Jesus? (Rev. 22:7, 10‚Äì12, 20). Why are these promises so
      crucial to us?

How does the time aspect mentioned in 2 Peter 3:8, 9 impact our
      understanding of the term soon in connection with the Second
      Coming?


         The ultimate solution for the sin problem and all the misery sin has
      caused is not found in anything humanity can invent or arrange but in the
      intervention of heaven through our Lord Jesus Christ. Our hope is not in
      human technology, clever politicians, or social and moral progress.
      These things never can solve the problem of death. And although it is
      important to know what will precede and accompany the coming of the
      Lord, it is even more important that we are sure of the One we expect.
         Our Lord will come soon. ‚ÄúIt is just a matter of time, that‚Äôs all. And
      no one can change this fact. No tyrant can reach up and grab the world
      from His grasp. It remains firmly and forever in the hands of the
      Crucified One. None can undo Calvary anymore than they can undo
      their birth. . . . Since the cross, we live in time filled by the victory of
      Calvary‚Äîtime determined by that goal. Hence, whether they know it
      or not, humanity does not merely advance toward a hoped-for goal in
      some distant day, with the possibility that it may never come. No!
      Humanity moves triumphantly from a goal Jesus has already
      reached.‚Äù‚ÄîNorman Gulley, Christ Is Coming (Hagerstown, Md.:
      Review and Herald¬Æ Publishing Association, 1998), p. 540.

       A philosopher named Martin Heidegger once said that ‚Äúonly a
       god can save us.‚Äù Whatever he himself might have meant by that
       idea, why is it so true? Where are you placing your hope? If it‚Äôs
       in anything but the true God, why is this hope a false one?

    Further Study: Norman Gulley‚Äôs book Christ Is Coming is prob-
          ably the most complete Adventist book in recent times about last-day
          events and the second coming of Christ. You may want to scan the
          book and read a few chapters, in particular the chapter titled ‚ÄúThe
          Greatest Rescue of All Time‚Äù (pp. 538‚Äì552). For the classic descrip-
          tion of the moment when our hope will be fulfilled, see Ellen G.
          White, The Great Controversy (in particular, pp. 662‚Äì678).
             Try to commit the following majestic words to memory: ‚ÄúThe great
          controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe
          is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast
1         creation. From Him who created all flow life and light and gladness,
          throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to
          the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshad-
          owed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G.
          White, The Great Controversy, p. 678.

            2 How do you respond to those who say that this hope Christians
            have of another existence causes them not to care deeply enough
            about the woes of this existence?

            ‚óè3 How can you remain hopeful, even when everything seems to
            go against you?

            ‚óè
            4 How do we experience, here and now, some of the hope that we
            have in Christ? How should lives differ now because of this hope?
            What can we do, in a real and visible way, to show others the
            immediate fruit and benefits of being a follower of the living
            God?

    Summary: Hope is a vital component of the Christian life. It is firmly
       based on what Christ accomplished on the cross. The Christian‚Äôs hope
       has to do with the here and now, for the kingdom that is to come is, in
       principle, already present in the believer. Yet, the full realization of the
       blessed hope is future. We know that the world is still affected by the
       results of Satan‚Äôs rebellion, but the outcome is secure: Our Lord
       reigns, and His eternal kingdom will soon be realized in all its glory.
       Our hope is to be citizens of that kingdom forever.

Finding the Savior
   Anna* was a new Adventist Christian when she met Ahmet* while work-
ing in Turkey. Since Sabbath was her day off, Ahmet arranged to have
Sabbath off so they could spend time together. Although Ahmet was not a
Christian, Anna sensed that he was searching for faith. In time the two were
married.
   After their son was born, Anna arranged to take him to Germany for vac-
cinations they could not get in Turkey. She was surprised when Ahmet said
that he wanted to go with her, for she knew that he did not like Germany. He
explained that he wanted to get away from his own family who were urging
him to convert her to his family‚Äôs traditional faith.
   While in Germany, Ahmet met many Adventists and was impressed with
how warm and friendly they were. He saw how different Christians are from
other people. His interest in Christianity grew.
   When the couple returned to Turkey, they joined a small group of believ-
ers who worship in a private home. (The Adventist Church in Turkey has
fewer than a hundred members, most of whom are not ethnic Turks.) The pas-
tor welcomed Ahmet and asked him to help translate Sabbath School lessons
into Turkish. Ahmet agreed. Anna noticed that Ahmet often read her Bible
and her religious books when he thought she was not watching.
   As Ahmet translated the lessons, questions sometimes arose regarding the
meaning of a Bible text or how to phrase a question. As Ahmet and Anna
talked about such issues, Anna realized that Ahmet was thinking deeply
about his relationship with Jesus. One question they discussed was, ‚ÄúWhat is
Jesus to you?‚Äù Ahmet thought a moment then answered, ‚ÄúJesus is my Savior.‚Äù
Anna praised God for this demonstration of faith in her seeking husband.
   One night Ahmet couldn‚Äôt sleep, so he went to the living room to read his
Bible. That night he decided to be baptized. The next day he called the pas-
tor and said, ‚ÄúIf you have nothing better to do today, you will baptize me?‚Äù
Later that day Anna and Ahmet went to the seashore, where Ahmet sealed his
commitment to Christ in baptism.
   The couple closes their bakery on Sabbaths, which prompts people to ask
why. Carefully Anna shares her faith with a prayer that God will open their
hearts. They also offer guided tours of biblical sites such as Ephesus. Even
the bus drivers notice that Christians are different. They ask questions about
what Christians believe, and this opens opportunities to share God‚Äôs love with
His other children.
   Ahmet and Anna thank God that the world church supports missionaries in
Turkey. Our mission offerings provide resources to help lead searching souls
to Jesus in this great unreached land.

      Life




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Gen. 2:7; Ps. 139:13, 14;
      John 1:1‚Äì3; 3; 10:10; 2 Cor. 5:17; Phil. 2:1‚Äì5.

Memory Text: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI have come that they may have life, and have
      it to the full‚Äô ‚Äù (John 10:10, NIV).

            eople nowadays live much longer than in previous generations,

      P     especially people in the so-called developed world. And that‚Äôs,
            of course, good. Yet, it‚Äôs one thing to live a long time, but what
      about the quality of life itself? Sometimes doctors perform all kinds
      of heroic actions to artificially keep a person alive even if the person
      has very little, if any, quality of life left.
         But quality of life is not restricted to an acceptable level of physical
      well-being; it has a wider application. What do we do with the years
      that we have been given? Do we live with a purpose and in harmony
      with others? Do we live in satisfying relationships with fellow human
      beings and, most of all, with our Creator? These are important ques-
      tions for all who have been given the gift of life.

The Week at a Glance: Life is a gift from God only. Now
      that we have this life, what does it mean for us? How are we to live
      it? Because it‚Äôs a gift, we are under a divine obligation to take care
      of our lives, both physically and spiritually. At the same time, our
      belief in Jesus brings us into the community of other believers,
      and we become part of a new family, both in heaven and on earth,
      all of which should impact the quality of life we have here now.

      The Gift of Physical Life
         How did life originate? Some people point to a godless evolution-
      ary unfolding of human existence. Others argue for a divine role in the
      slow process of millions of years during which ‚Äúsimple‚Äù forms of life
      somehow made their appearance and, subsequently, developed into
      more complex organisms, including humans. This theory, however,
      creates more questions than it answers (and besides, nothing in the
      Bible even hints that God used evolution to create humanity).
      Meanwhile, several renowned scholars have in recent years convinc-
      ingly argued that this theory is in a deep crisis. But even the staunchest
      supporters of evolutionary thinking must admit that life remains as
      great a mystery as ever.
         At the same time, those who believe in God as the Creator of this
      world and of all the universe do not have all the answers either. But
      the creationist approach is far more logical and coherent than the
      improbable theory that human life resulted from chance.

What does divine revelation tell us about the origin of life? Gen. 2:7,
      John 1:1‚Äì3.


        What is true for the mystery of life in general is also true for each
      human life. Although we possess a lot of scientific knowledge about
      the processes involved in the conception and growth of human life,
      each new parent who holds a newborn child in his or her arms knows
      intuitively that this new life is nothing less than a miracle. It is a fun-
      damental Christian conviction that life‚Äîand human life in a very spe-
      cial sense‚Äîis sacred.

In what words does David describe the miracle of human life and the
      magnificent design of the human body? Ps. 139:13, 14.


        Who does not know the words of the well-known song that says
      God has ‚Äúthe whole world in His hands‚Äù? This applies to the universe
      and to our entire planet. But also to each one of us individually; who-
      ever we are and wherever we are, God holds us in His hands. We owe
      our physical life to Him, all of it‚Äîfrom beginning to end.

       What difference does it make that God is the Creator of all life,
       including our own? How should our stance on the origin of life
       impact our views about things such as the death penalty, abor-
       tion, and euthanasia?



                                                                             31

      Physical Education
         If we owe our existence to our Creator, it stands to reason that we
      also owe it to Him to be careful with what He has entrusted to us. There
      is ample evidence in the Bible that God is interested in our physical
      well-being. He manifested His care for the people of Israel time and
      again. He gave His people numerous instructions about healthful eat-
      ing and sanitation. He gave them manna in the wilderness. He looked
      after Elijah when there was famine in the land. These are just a few of
      many examples of God‚Äôs care for our physical well-being.
         This truth becomes even clearer in the ministry of our Lord. Even a
      cursory reading of the Gospels leaves us in no doubt that Jesus‚Äô under-
      standing of religion was very much practice-oriented.

In what ways did Jesus show interest in His own physical well-being and
      that of the people around Him? Take a look at the following pas-
      sages and analyze what implications they have for us today.

        ‚Ä¢ healing (Mark 5)
        ‚Ä¢ rest (Mark 6:30‚Äì32)
        ‚Ä¢ feeding (Mark 6:33‚Äì43; esp. vs. 34)
        ‚Ä¢ Sabbath (Luke 4:16)

In what other areas did Jesus show His concern for the physical well-
      being of people?

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The way we treat our body has everything to do with stewardship.
      Whether our material possessions, our time, our talents, or our body‚Äî
      it is all God‚Äôs property, and thus, we are required as faithful stewards
      to look after these gifts. But care for our body also is intimately
      related to the biblical view of the human person. Many Christians
      believe that we consist of an immortal soul that inhabits a mortal shell
      of flesh and blood. The Bible, however, depicts humanity as a unity of
      body, soul, and spirit, which cannot be separated. Our religion, there-
      fore, does not concern just an immortal ‚Äúsomething‚Äù but our entire
      being. It impacts all aspects of our existence.

       While the Bible indicates that some foods are unsuitable for
       human consumption (see, for example, Leviticus 11), the king-
       dom is not to be reduced to a question of what we eat and drink
       (see Rom. 14:17). How do we strike the right balance, not just in
       diet but in all areas of healthy living?

     Spiritual Life
       ‚ÄúTherefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
     are passed away; behold, all things are become new‚Äù (2 Cor. 5:17).

What is your understanding of what that above text means? How are
     we a ‚Äúnew creature‚Äù in Jesus?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        All inhabitants of this earth, whether they ever realize it or not, are
     God‚Äôs by birth. Yet, life we all share in this world is, as we all know,
     very temporary. Sin has brought decay and death not only to every
     human being but to all life on the planet. Nothing is immune to the
     crushing devastation caused by sin.
        The good news, however, is that we have a choice whether this life is
     all we have or whether we will accept the wonderful gift of eternal life.
        This eternal life, however, demands a turning around, a conversion.
     The Bible uses several metaphors to describe this crucial experience.
     The most graphic is that of a new birth, the image used to depict the
     turning point at which a person accepts the gift of eternal life in Christ.
     When this happens, the ‚Äúold person‚Äù dies, and a ‚Äúnew person‚Äù is born.

Nowhere in the Bible is the need for this new birth described with
     greater clarity than in John 3. Read the section (vss. 1‚Äì21) that
     relates Jesus‚Äô encounter with Nicodemus. What does it tell us
     about the nature of this new birth? What is your own under-
     standing of the new birth?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The new life of the follower of Jesus, who has turned around from
     a life of self-service to a life of commitment to the kingdom, will be
     characterized by growth. The newly born spiritual person needs to
     feed on the right kind of spiritual food and must gradually mature. The
     apostle Peter encourages us to ‚Äúgrow in the grace and knowledge of
     our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ‚Äù (2 Pet. 3:18, NIV).

      If someone were to ask you, ‚ÄúHave you been born-again?‚Äù what
      would you reply? What does your answer say to you about your
      walk with Jesus?

                                                                            33

      Social Life
         Humans are, by nature, social beings. Of course, there are moments
      we like to be alone. We need private time for prayer and contempla-
      tion. Some need more private space and private time than do others.
      But we tend to feel sorry for people who are always alone, and particu-
      larly for those who do not have sufficient social skills to establish
      bonds of friendship and who consistently fail to enter into meaningful
      relationships.
         The Bible pictures people as parts of various social networks. The
      family, friendship, ethnicity, community, and church are dominant
      themes. The Bible points to Jesus‚Äô Father as the Father of all
      humankind, which means we all are brothers and sisters in a very real
      sense (Acts 17:26). Living in relationships is the essence of human
      life. When Adam was created, God immediately created a partner for
      him. Family life was a divinely devised model for human happiness.
      The Bible repeatedly underlines the tremendous value of genuine
      friendship and the blessings of belonging to a wider community.

What is the key to successfully managing of our social relationships?
      How well do you manifest these principles? Phil. 2:1‚Äì5.

        The various aspects of our Christian life are blended in our mem-
      bership to the body of Christ: the church. The church is more than a
      place where like-minded people meet and enjoy fellowship.
      Nonetheless, for many the church is indeed the focal point of their
      social life. This has both positive and negative aspects. Without
      Christian friends we have few, if any, role models. Associating with
      others who also serve God and also have adopted a biblical lifestyle
      will help us to remain faithful and to grow in our Christian relation-
      ship. But if we have no friends outside the circle of fellow believers,
      we will have few opportunities for witnessing. In many parts of the
      world friendship evangelism is the most successful method of church
      growth.

       Studies have shown that most new Adventists lose virtually all
       their non-Adventist friends within seven years. Take a look at
       yourself. Is this the pattern you see? What are the reasons? Why
       is it worth investing time and energy to build friendships with
       non-Adventists, or even with non-Christians?

      Fullness of Life
        John 10:10 records Jesus‚Äô famous statement that He has come to
      give us life ‚Äúto the full‚Äù (NIV). Other Bible translations speak of
      ‚Äúabundant life.‚Äù

        Here is a partial list of important components of this ‚Äúfull‚Äù life.
      Try to add other components to that list and find scriptural sup-
      port for these various aspects:

        1. It is a life full of possibilities.
        2. It is a life with a purpose.
        3. It is a life of inner peace.
        4. It is a life with a mission.

        As we grow in our Christian life, we become more and more con-
      vinced that Christ does indeed offer us life ‚Äúto the full.‚Äù We often
      have, however, a hard time explaining this to those who have not com-
      mitted themselves to Christ. For them the Christian life appears to be
      rather boring. They dislike the fact that it seems to bring all kinds of
      restrictions. But Christians have learned that not all experiences one
      might have actually make our lives richer. Many things we might do
      carry a minus sign rather than a plus sign and contribute to an inner
      emptiness rather than a fullness of life.

What are some kinds of experiences we‚Äôre all better off without, and
      why?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        ‚ÄúLife to the full‚Äù is not a combination of good health, good looks,
      satisfactory education, and a nice income. And although strong, lov-
      ing relationships are certainly part of it, there is considerably more
      than these things. Life ‚Äúto the full‚Äù is the kind of life that has mean-
      ing. It is a life that issues inner peace. Its happiness does not depend
      primarily on external, material circumstances. It is a life that is con-
      nected to the Source of life and will, therefore, be eternal.

       Why does all this talk of an ‚Äúabundant life‚Äù sound pleasing?
       What about those who seem to have an ‚Äúabundant life‚Äù but
       don‚Äôt know Jesus and don‚Äôt seem to have the slightest interest in
       knowing Him? How do we understand this phenomenon, espe-
       cially when we all know Christians who are suffering terribly
       now? See 2 Cor. 4:18.

                                                                           35

    Further Study: Ellen G. White‚Äôs famous book Steps to Christ
          focuses on our life in Christ. If, in the context of this week‚Äôs lesson,
          one has to choose one particular chapter, one might well go to chap-
          ter 8: ‚ÄúGrowing Up Into Christ‚Äù (pp. 67‚Äì76). ‚ÄúA life in Christ is a life
          of restfulness. There may be no ecstasy of feeling, but there should be
          an abiding, peaceful trust. Your hope is not in yourself; it is in Christ.
          Your weakness is united to His strength, your ignorance to His wis-
          dom, your frailty to His enduring might. So you are not to look to
          yourself, not to let the mind dwell upon self, but look to Christ. Let
          the mind dwell upon His love, upon the beauty, the perfection, of His
          character.‚Äù‚ÄîPage 70.

    Discussion Questions:
            ‚óè1 When people are severely disabled or terminally ill, the ques-
            tion often asked is whether their life still has ‚Äúquality.‚Äù Should
            the quality of life be defined primarily in physical terms, or are
            other aspects also important, or possibly even more essential?
2
            How, too, does our understanding of the origin of life influence
            our answer?

            ‚óè
            2 For many people the looming specter of death robs life of all
            meaning and purpose. After all, if sooner or later we‚Äôll all be
            dead and every memory of us forgotten, what can this life possi-
            bly mean? How has Jesus answered that question for us and
            eliminated this concern?
3

            ‚óè
            3 What aspects of your contemporary culture rob life of its full
            meaning? That is, what kind of ideals and moral values are being
            promoted that reduce life to something less than it should be?
            How can we as Adventist Christians respond to these challenges?

            ‚óè
            4 In what ways can our health message and principles of better
            living play into the promise of an ‚Äúabundant life‚Äù? Might we be
            shortchanging ourselves on this promise?

    Summary: This week‚Äôs lesson focused on the ‚Äúfull‚Äù or ‚Äúabundant‚Äù life
       found in Jesus Christ. It is a life lived in a responsible way, caring for
       our physical life as best we can. It is also a life lived in relationships,
       for God designed humans to live in communion with others. Most of
       all, it is a life totally renewed in Jesus, a life that will be changed and
       growing in God‚Äôs grace.

Making Up for Lost Time
by JESSE HURDLE
   I ran away from home when I was 12 and grew up on the streets of Trinidad.
I survived by stealing and fighting and selling drugs. At 18 I returned to
Tobago, where my mom lived. She had become a Seventh-day Adventist and
wanted me to go to church with her, but I wasn‚Äôt interested.
   I married a good woman, but I didn‚Äôt change. She went to church and
prayed for me, and I went out to gamble. Then something happened, and I real-
ized that my life was heading in the wrong direction. I hardly knew my chil-
dren, and I was a terrible example to them. So, one Sabbath I went to church
with my wife and committed my life to Christ. ‚ÄúThis is an answer to prayer!‚Äù
she cried.
   I had a lot to make right with God and my family, but God changed me. He
saved me and my marriage in spite of myself.
   The church members surrounded me with prayer and put me to work. I
grew in Christ and obeyed when He told me to share my faith with others.
   I told my friends, my colleagues, and people on the street how God had
changed me. I challenged them to give God a try.
   Still, I was surprised when God asked me to hold evangelistic meetings, for
I‚Äôd never gone beyond primary school. But we stepped out in faith and made
the meetings a family affair. We pitched a tent and held three weeks of meet-
ings. My wife sang, my daughter helped with the programs, and my son han-
dled the public address system. When the meetings came to a close, the peo-
ple asked for more, so we added another week of meetings. Twelve people
were baptized.
   Ronny was one of my best friends. He helped me repair the church roof and
would do anything I asked. But he refused to let God into his life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go to
church when the undertaker takes me,‚Äù he‚Äôd say. I talked, I prayed, I urged. But
he refused. Then one day he died of a massive heart attack at 45. His death
was a huge blow to me. I felt that I had failed God because my friend refused
                                to accept Jesus as his Savior.
                                   Ronny‚Äôs death made me realize that death is
                                only one heartbeat away. I can‚Äôt let someone go
                                without sharing a word about God. I may not
                                get another chance to speak to them. I think of
                                the people I led into drugs before I was a
                                Christian. Now I want to lead them all to Christ.
                                   Please share your faith with others, and
                                give your mission offerings now. One day it
                                will be too late.
                                 JESSE HURDLE shares his faith with everyone he meets in
                                 Tobago.

      Revelation




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Exod. 7:1‚Äì6, Ps. 19:1‚Äì4,
      Rom. 1:18‚Äì20, 2 Tim. 3:14‚Äì16, Heb. 1:1‚Äì3.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúIn the past God spoke to our forefathers through
      the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last
      days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all
      things, and through whom he made the universe‚Äù (Hebrews 1:1, 2,
      NIV).

             or some people, God is a distant power who at a remote moment

      F      in the past set the world in motion but no longer interferes with
             what happens here. That, of course, is not the God portrayed in
      the Bible, who instead is consistently shown to be a loving Father, the
      Creator who continues to take an intimate interest in His creatures. He
      is the Covenant God, and He seeks to establish a bond between
      Himself and the people made in His image.
         This God is a great Communicator. Human words cannot ade-
      quately explain who and what God is, but the fact that He constantly
      is referred to as speaking to His people is utterly significant.
         As soon as Adam was created, God spoke to Him. Immediately after
      the first human inhabitant of this world had sinned, God called to him,
      Adam, ‚Äú ‚Äòwhere are you?‚Äô ‚Äù (Gen. 3:9, NIV). And ever since, God has
      spoken to humankind in various ways (Heb. 1:1). Even on the final
      page of the Bible we find confirmation of this in the divine appeal,
      ‚ÄúThe Spirit and the bride say, ‚ÄòCome!‚Äô ‚Äù (Rev. 22:17, NIV). This week
      we‚Äôll look at various ways He speaks to us today.

The Week at a Glance: The God who spoke the world
      into existence speaks to all who are willing to listen.

      God Reveals Himself Through Nature
Read Psalm 19:1‚Äì4 and Romans 1:18‚Äì20. These are the two most
      cited texts when the concept of God‚Äôs revelation through nature is
      under discussion. Summarize in your own words what these two
      passages teach us.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         ‚ÄúGod has surrounded us with nature‚Äôs beautiful scenery in order to
      attract and interest the mind. It is His design that we should associate
      the glories of nature with His character. If we faithfully study the book
      of nature, we shall find it a fruitful source for contemplating the infinite
      love and power of God.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 144.
      Those who believe in the Bible will be confirmed in their convictions
      that when they look at the starlit sky or see the majestic trees in the
      forests and the beauty of the setting sun behind snow-covered moun-
      taintops, they are seeing the works of a loving and powerful Creator.
      When they see an eagle in flight, admire a tulip, or marvel about the
      intricacies of the human body, they see evidences of God‚Äôs invisible
      qualities and agree that nature indeed declares the glory of God.
         But the Bible passages take us a step further. They also suggest that
      the nonbeliever, by looking at nature, will somehow catch a glimpse
      of a divine Power that designed and made all that is. In today‚Äôs world
      many close their eyes to this aspect. They have imbibed evolutionary
      thinking and want to explain all that exists in terms of chance and
      necessity. But, increasingly, scholars are admitting that there is so
      much evidence of intelligent design that this can be ignored only by
      those who stubbornly close their eyes to it.

Ask yourself a simple question: What is the more logical and reason-
      able explanation for the beauty and complexity of life: pure chance
      or a purposeful and planned-out creation? Defend your answer.

       Read Psalm 19:1‚Äì4 and Romans 1:18‚Äì20 again. To what extent
       is God revealed in nature? At the same time, what things about
       God does nature not tell us? However revealing nature is, what
       else do we know about God that we can‚Äôt find by looking at the
       glories of creation?

     God Speaks Through Our Conscience
       ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù is sometimes defined as the faculty, or inward princi-
     ple, that helps us decide between right and wrong. Even those who do
     not believe in God usually possess some insight into what is morally
     acceptable and what must be rejected (Rom. 2:14, 15). The Christian
     believes that God is the supreme Lawgiver and that He has placed in
     humanity a conscience, even though sin has blunted this God-given
     tool for moral decision-making. In most Bible translations we do not
     find the word conscience in the Old Testament, though it occurs
     numerous times in the New Testament. But whether or not the term is
     used, the concept is present throughout Scripture.

Name a few stories in which we can see the impact of conscience on
     the lives of people. (See, for instance, Gen. 42:18‚Äì23, Daniel 5, Matt.
     27:3‚Äì5, John 8:1‚Äì9.)

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Important though our conscience is, it is not always totally trust-
     worthy. We notice that people in good conscience often come to very
     diverse conclusions about what to do in particular circumstances. The
     apostle Paul was aware of this, as his remarkable statement in
     1 Corinthians 4:4 shows: ‚ÄúMy conscience is clear, but that does not
     make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me‚Äù (NIV). The same
     apostle also warns that we can resist the pull of our conscience. In
     fact, some people appear to have seared their consciences with a hot
     iron (1 Tim. 4:2) or have corrupted them (Titus 1:15). On the other
     hand, there are ways of sharpening one‚Äôs conscience. Being in tune
     with God by regularly reading His Word and by frequently communi-
     cating with Him in prayer will make us more sensitive to the voice of
     the Spirit, who can speak to us through our conscience.

      How do you arrive at important moral decisions? Do you listen to
      your conscience? How can you be sure that your small, inner
      voice is not overruled by other voices in and around you? How
      can you know whether or not you can trust your conscience?
      When was the last time you let your conscience be your guide and
      ended up making a wrong moral decision? What did you learn
      from that experience that could help you from repeating it?

     God Speaks Through Prophets
       Many people have a very restricted view of the gift of prophecy.
     Prophecy is mainly seen in terms of predictions, and the prophets they
     are aware of are those who have given their names to a number of
     books in the Bible. The facts are different. God used prophets on a
     much wider scale than one would think. And prophecy is not only
     about predictions. It stands for much more.

How does the relationship between Moses and his brother Aaron
     illustrate the key meaning of the word prophet? Exod. 7:1‚Äì6.


        The passage of Exodus 7:1‚Äì6 highlights the true work of a prophet.
     Moses, who himself is referred to as a great prophet (Deut. 34:10‚Äì12),
     was assisted by his brother, who served as his spokesperson. ‚ÄúMoses
     is like God to Aaron, who is like a prophet to Pharaoh. The clear idea
     is that prophets don‚Äôt manufacture their own speeches but only pass
     on what they have heard from God.‚Äù‚ÄîJon Dybdahl, Exodus, The
     Abundant Life Bible Amplifier (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press¬Æ
     Publishing Association, 1994), p. 80.
        A prophet is a man or a woman who speaks on behalf of God. Those
     words have authority because the message comes from God, even
     though the prophet may choose his or her own words to convey that
     message. God used this manner of communicating with His people
     quite extensively, as Amos underlined when he stated, ‚ÄúThe Sovereign
     Lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the
     prophets‚Äù (Amos 3:7, NIV).

What does Scripture say about the continuation of the gift of
     prophecy beyond Old Testament times? Look at the following
     sample of the New Testament evidence. What do you conclude?

       1. Prophets mentioned by name (Luke 1:67, 2:36, Acts 13:1)
       2. The abiding gift (1 Cor. 12:28, 14:1‚Äì5)
       3. False prophets (2 Pet. 2:1, Rev. 2:20)
       4. A characteristic of the remnant church (Rev. 12:17, 19:10)

      What has been the impact of the writings of Ellen G. White
      (who had the gift of prophecy) upon your own life? How has
      God spoken to you through her ministry? In what ways could
      you better avail yourself of the blessings of this gift?




                                                                       41

     God Reveals Himself in His Word
       Many of the things God has revealed through His prophets in the
     past have not been handed down and have not, eventually, found their
     way into the Bible. But some of those revelations from God, which
     were received by a few dozen people during a period of more than fif-
     teen hundred years, were written down. The compilations of these
     writings is our Bible. Jesus and His contemporaries treasured the writ-
     ings that we today refer to as the Old Testament. Today our Scriptures
     include also the Gospels and other apostolic writings from the first
     period of the church.

Paul commended Timothy for his diligent reading of God‚Äôs Word,
     which, he said, has the capacity to make you wise for salvation.
     How does he in this context further describe the influence of the
     Written Word of God? 2 Tim. 3:14‚Äì16.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       ‚ÄúAs we contemplate the great things of God‚Äôs Word, we look into a
     fountain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth and
     depth pass our knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens; stretched
     out before us, we behold a boundless, shoreless sea. Such study has
     vivifying power. The mind and heart acquire new strength, new life.
       ‚ÄúThis experience is the highest evidence of the divine authorship of
     the Bible. We receive God‚Äôs Word as food for the soul through the
     same evidence by which we receive bread as food for the body.‚Äù
     ‚ÄîEllen G. White, My Life Today, p. 26.
       More Bibles are sold today than ever before. New versions for spe-
     cific target groups keep appearing. We have Bible versions that are
     more easily accessible to beginners, while we also have versions that
     lend themselves to liturgical use. And this is a good thing. But that
     does not necessarily mean that the Bible also is more widely read. In
     fact, there are indications that Bible reading among Christians, includ-
     ing Seventh-day Adventists, is on the wane. Many do not know their
     Bible as a former generation once knew it. But only at our own eter-
     nal peril can we ignore the Word of God, which has the power to speak
     to us afresh every time we open it.

      How much time did you spend with your Bible during the past
      week? In the past month? Is Bible reading a prominent feature
      in your daily program? If not, why not? Compare the time you
      spent in front of the TV with the time spent reading the Word.

      Christ‚ÄîGod Comes to Us in Person

        Getting letters from someone on a regular basis can go a long way
      toward getting to know that person more intimately. Receiving a pic-
      ture will reveal another dimension of that person. But you will not
      really know that person until you actually have spent time face-to-
      face.
        Because of sin, God could no longer commune with us as He had
      done with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Though He has com-
      municated with us very effectively in various ways, He wanted to give
      us a fuller picture of Himself. And this He has done through Jesus.

How did God provide us with this full picture of Himself? John 1:1, 2;
      John 14:9; Heb. 1:1‚Äì3.


         The precise wording of John 1:1 is important. John does not say that
      God showed Himself in the flesh, or appeared in the flesh. Rather,
      John says that Jesus became flesh at a definite point in time. Jesus
      came from above and became flesh; that is, He took on Himself our
      humanity. That our Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became
      flesh for our salvation is probably the one tenet of the Christian faith
      that is basic to all Christian denominations.

What relationship is there between God‚Äôs revelation in Scripture and
      His revelation in Jesus Christ? John 5:36‚Äì40.


         For some the study of the Bible is an end in itself. Indeed, many
      gifted Bible scholars don‚Äôt believe in God at all. Yet, reading the Bible
      without seeking to know the Lord whom it reveals can no more lead
      you to salvation than reading a recipe can fill your empty stomach.
         Jesus Christ is the focus of the Scriptures. The Bible is about Him,
      about what He has revealed to us regarding the nature and character
      of God. The Bible doesn‚Äôt save us, but it is the authoritative source of
      truth about the only One who can, Jesus of Nazareth.

       It‚Äôs one thing to read the Bible; it‚Äôs another to know the Bible;
       and it‚Äôs another to recite texts by memory. But do you know the
       Lord revealed in the Bible? What are ways in which you can read
       the Bible in order to come away from it knowing God better?

    Further Study: ‚ÄúMany are the ways in which God is seeking to
          make Himself known to us and bring us into communion with Him.
          Nature speaks to our senses without ceasing. The open heart will be
          impressed with the love and glory of God as revealed through the
          works of His hands. The listening ear can hear and understand the com-
          munications of God through the things of nature. The green fields, the
          lofty trees, the buds and flowers, the passing cloud, the falling rain, the
1
          babbling brook, the glories of the heavens, speak to our hearts, and
          invite us to become acquainted with Him who made them all.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G.
          White, Steps to Christ, p. 85. Read this entire chapter in Steps to
          Christ, titled ‚ÄúA Knowledge of God‚Äù (pp. 85‚Äì91).

    Discussion Questions:
2          ‚óè
           1 To what extent does nature help us find God? Does nature
           teach us anything about the God of the Bible, or does it merely
           impress us that there must be Something or Someone out there?

           ‚óè2 In class, talk about the importance of following one‚Äôs con-
           science. Then talk about the dangers that are involved. What are
           ways we can help others know if and when they can trust the
           prompting of their conscience?
3
           ‚óè
           3 What role do culture and upbringing have on the shaping of
           your conscience? In what ways has your culture influenced your
           concepts of right and wrong? How can you learn to transcend
           culture when you need to, that is, when your culture teaches
           something that is against the clear teaching of the Word of God?

           ‚óè4 If the gift of prophecy is a spiritual gift to God‚Äôs church,
           should we expect it to play a prominent role in our day and age?
           May we expect God to raise up other prophets similar to the way
           He called Ellen G. White more than a century ago? Discuss.

           ‚óè
           5 What are ways that we can study the Bible in order to come
           away knowing God better? What are ways to study the Bible and
           come away not knowing God any more than when we first started
           reading?

    Summary: God wants to communicate with us. He does so through nature
       and by speaking through our conscience. Throughout the ages He has
       used prophets, and He has made the prophetic gift available even for
       His church today. The Bible, God‚Äôs Written Word, remains the divine
       Guidebook for our pilgrimage. Its focus is on what God has done for
       us, most sublimely in entering this world in the Person of His Son, to
       which all Scriptures testify.

God‚Äôs Stubborn Warrior
by SUSAN CASTILLO
   David Ramos is a man of humble origins. Born in Cuba, he finished the
sixth grade before he was taken from school at age 16 to join the Cuban
army. When his commander learned that David was a Seventh-day
Adventist, he did everything he could to force David to give up his faith.
He was mistreated and punished, denied visits from his family, and kept in
solitary confinement. He was subjected to hard labor and was denied
proper food. At one time he was denied food for six days while he was
forced to work hard at night and in the cold.
   After each punishment, the guards would offer him a better education,
a good job, and passes to go home if only he renounced his belief in God.
But David refused to give up his faith. And his refusal infuriated his supe-
riors, who dealt him more serious punishment and worse treatment. For
three years David was persecuted and imprisoned for his faith, but he
refused to renounce his Savior.
   After leaving the military, David returned home and continued serving
God. He was active in his church, giving Bible studies, preaching, and
bringing others to Jesus.
   He rode his bicycle from town to town to visit people and share God‚Äôs
love with them. One day as he rode along a highway, he was struck by a
bus and seriously injured. He endured several surgeries and spent months
recovering from his injuries. But instead of feeling bitter, David thanked
God for saving his life.
   Then an opportunity opened for David to bring his family to America.
Their first home was in a refugee-style camp in Florida, where Cuban
refugees were housed until they could be processed for immigration.
While living in the camp, David continued his work for God and led many
fellow refugees to the Savior. He often took his aging mother with him in
her wheelchair when he went to study the Bible with someone or to
preach.
   Eventually David and his family settled in Oklahoma, where he contin-
ued his mission to share God‚Äôs love with his new neighbors. God has
blessed his efforts, and David has been instrumental in establishing a
Spanish church in Oklahoma City.
   David still suffers from the effects of the persecution he received while
in the military and the bicycle accident. But he continues working tirelessly
to lead others to Christ. He is a stubborn warrior in the army of God.
   Your mission offerings help make it possible for thousands to hear the
gospel and choose to follow the Savior.

band live in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.

      Sin




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Isa. 14:12‚Äì14, Matt.
      23:23, 25:45, Phil. 2:6‚Äì8, Heb. 1:1‚Äì5, Rev. 5:9‚Äì12.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúJust as the result of one trespass was condem-
      nation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness
      was justification that brings life for all men‚Äù (Romans 5:18, NIV).

             he solid optimism of former generations that everything in the

      T      world will get better and better no longer rings true today. Even
             after the cold war, the world is far from being a safe place. The
      threat of terrorism has made us all feel extremely vulnerable. Science,
      which was supposed to be the harbinger of a better world, now threat-
      ens to wreak havoc on that world. The common sources of energy are
      being depleted. The icecaps are melting. Crime is a sad fact of life
      everywhere. Human beings show little, if any, signs of moral improve-
      ment over past generations. The gap between rich and poor constantly
      is widening. Our daily installment of news almost invariably tells us
      about atrocities and moral decay. No wonder someone once said that
      the Christian teaching of human sinfulness is one teaching that is eas-
      ily verifiable. That is, that‚Äôs one doctrine we don‚Äôt need to take on
      faith.
         Yet, as bad as sin is, it‚Äôs not the end of the story. Sure, sin is real, but
      so is divine grace.

The Week at a Glance: Sin, and the results of sin, are a
      painful reality in human life. Thank God for Jesus, who has made
      a way of escape for us all.

      Sin Is Rebellion
         What is the essence of sin? How does the Bible define it? First John
      3:4 (NIV) states, ‚ÄúEveryone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is
      lawlessness.‚Äù The New Living Translation reads, ‚ÄúSin opposes the
      law,‚Äù while the traditional KJV rendering defines sin as ‚Äútransgression
      of the law.‚Äù But it is not just any law that humanity has broken‚Äîit is
      God‚Äôs law. Humans have rebelled against their Maker, pretending that
      they themselves are the measure of all things rather than in humble
      trust submitting to the wisdom and love of God.

What do the following Bible passages reveal about the essence of sin?
      Gen. 3:1‚Äì7, Isa. 14:12‚Äì14, Rev. 12:7‚Äì9.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Why did God punish Adam and Eve for what seemed to be an
      insignificant matter? It may have seemed unimportant, but there was
      a crucial principle involved. ‚ÄúThere was nothing poisonous in the fruit
      itself, and the sin was not merely in yielding to appetite. It was distrust
      of God‚Äôs goodness, disbelief of His word, and rejection of His author-
      ity, that made our first parents transgressors, and that brought into the
      world a knowledge of evil. It was this that opened the door to every
      species of falsehood and error.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, Education, p. 25.

What will be a major characteristic of God‚Äôs people in the time of the
      end? Rev. 14:12. How does the issue of obedience come into play
      here?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        God has done for us all that infinite love could. In return He asks of
      us love and obedience. In a time in which the world is plagued by ram-
      pant lawlessness and a relativistic philosophy‚Äîwhich claims that
      good and evil depend simply on cultural circumstances and commu-
      nal and personal preferences‚Äîthere must and will be a people who
      will staunchly defend God‚Äôs standard of holiness, the Ten
      Commandments.

       We tend to think of rebellion as an outright attack and rejection
       of authority. Yet, it can come in much more subtle forms. How
       could you tell if, perhaps, you yourself are harboring some
       rebellious attitudes toward God?



                                                                             47

      Missing the Mark
        The seriousness of sin is often played down. ‚ÄúAh, we cannot all be
      perfect!‚Äù people say. But sin is serious business. ‚ÄúThe full seriousness
      of sin can only become apparent when we have understood the full
      potentialities of human existence as created in the image of God.‚Äù
      ‚ÄîJohn Macquarrie, Principles of Christian Theology (London: SCM
      Press, 1966), p. 238.
        Sin does not only have to do with wrongfully committed acts. It also
      includes the desire and the fantasizing about things that we know are
      wrong (Matt. 5:28).

What have you fantasized about in the past 24 hours? Would you be
      ashamed to have those thoughts made public? What should your
      answer tell you about where your heart is? See Rom. 8:6.


        There also is a category of sin that usually is referred to as ‚Äúsins of
      omission.‚Äù This refers to the willful neglect of duty, the conscious
      refusal to do something one knows ought to be done.

In Matthew 23:23 and Matthew 25:45 we find statements made by
      Jesus that deal with sins of omission. Read these verses in their
      context. What are the implications of these statements?

      ___________________________________________________________________

Also in chapter 25 of Matthew‚Äôs Gospel, we find the parable of the tal-
      ents (vss. 14‚Äì28). What happened to the servant who had hidden
      his one talent? What is the significance of this for our discussion?

      ___________________________________________________________________

         We all have been given certain talents. It is part of the concept of
      stewardship that we utilize our talents to the full. We must answer to
      God for what we fail to do with what He has given us. Let us remem-
      ber the words of the apostle Peter: ‚ÄúEach one should use whatever gift
      he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God‚Äôs grace
      in its various forms‚Äù (1 Pet. 4:10, NIV).

       Sins of omission, sins of thought‚Äîwho hasn‚Äôt been guilty of
       them all? Dwell on the promise of forgiveness that we can have
       in Jesus. Why should this mean so much to us?

      ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù Sin
         Theologians often distinguish between the sinful acts that we com-
      mit and the sinful nature that we possess. We all have been corrupted
      by Adam‚Äôs fall; we all are deemed sinners even before we sin. The
      widespread rite of infant baptism is linked closely with the acknowl-
      edgment of this belief. The idea is that a newborn child who dies with-
      out having been baptized will be lost eternally because the child is a
      sinner, and if this sinfulness is not somehow taken care of, the child
      loses eternal life.
         There is no scriptural support for this practice, nor for the idea that
      a child who dies is automatically condemned to destruction. Now, it is
      true that the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù sin of Adam and Eve has had all-pervasive
      consequences that impact everyone. Sin entered the world through
      one person, and through this sin death came to ‚Äúall men‚Äù (Rom. 5:12,
      NIV).

How does the apostle Paul describe the powerful tendencies toward sin-
      ful behavior with which all of us are born? Rom. 8:7, 8; 7:21‚Äì24. How
      have you experienced the reality of these tendencies in your own life?

      ___________________________________________________________________

         Through the ages some Christians have declared that they achieved
      a state of perfection. Yet, those who claim perfection delude them-
      selves. It is contrary to the clear words of Scripture. Quoting Psalm
      106:6, Paul stated, ‚Äú ‚ÄòThere is no one righteous, not even one!‚Äô ‚Äù (Rom.
      3:10, NIV). His fellow apostle John is just as adamant: ‚ÄúIf we claim to
      be without sin, we deceive ourselves‚Äù (1 John 1:8, NIV).
        ‚ÄúSanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a day. It is
      a continual growth in grace. We know not one day how strong will be
      our conflict the next. Satan lives, and is active, and every day we need
      to earnestly cry to God for help and strength to resist him. As long as
      Satan reigns we shall have self to subdue, besetments to overcome,
      and there is no stopping place. There is no point to which we can come
      and say we have fully attained.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White Comments, The
      SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 947.

       Suppose you reached a point where you truly had victory over
       sin; that is, you weren‚Äôt committing any known sin. More so, you
       were always kind, loving, generous, and living in accordance
       with all the light you had. Suppose you ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù reflected the
       character of Jesus. Why, though, would you still need a Savior
       whose righteousness alone can allow you to stand with ‚Äúno con-
       demnation‚Äù (Rom. 8:1) before God?

                                                                            49

     Corporate Versus Personal Sin?
        Ever since the Fall, the world has been tainted by sin. The results of
     sin are visible in nature. They are visible also in wars, in the evil of
     slavery and other forms of exploitation, and also in the ways in which
     we ravage natural resources. The world of the past and of the present
     is full of materialism, egotism, injustice, and perversion.
        These facts raise many difficult questions. Foremost among these is
     whether we as individuals carry any responsibility for these things and
     if we should assume any guilt for this corporate state of sinfulness.
     The following considerations may help us to deal with this dilemma.

       1. Consider how corporate wrongs in our world may be seen against
     the background of the great controversy. ‚ÄúBehind the rise and fall of
     nations and the play and counterplay of human interests lies the
     unseen struggle between the Godhead, together with the host of loyal
     angels, and Satan with his hosts of fallen angels‚Äîa struggle that
     directly impacts all human activity.‚Äù‚ÄîFrank Holbrook, ‚ÄúThe Great
     Controversy,‚Äù in Raoul Dederen, ed., Handbook of Seventh-day
     Adventist Theology (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald¬Æ
     Publishing Association, 2000), p. 995.

       2. Consider the totally destructive nature of sin. Sin wants to destroy
     everything that has any value. Sin and death are synonymous, and they
     are everywhere. There is, therefore, no hope for this world without
     divine intervention, because the powers of sin and death far exceed
     our human abilities to deal with them.

        3. But also consider that we all have some influence. We can all
     make small decisions that at times may increase or diminish, however
     slightly, the evil in this world. We can work for peace and justice. We
     can do acts of compassion. We can choose to cooperate with all who
     want to protect the environment. What do such passages as
     Ecclesiastes 9:10, Luke 16:10, and Philippians 4:8, 9 contribute to our
     understanding of this issue?

      It‚Äôs so easy just to throw your arms up in despair and say, ‚ÄúThe
      problems are too great. What can little, old me do to help?‚Äù
      Nevertheless, how should the example of Jesus and the good He
      did healing the sick and comforting the poor (which, consider-
      ing all the sick and the poor in the world at that time, was com-
      paratively small) influence our decisions to try to make the
      world a better place?

     The Only Solution for the Sin Problem
        There is no easy or cheap solution to the sin problem. Sin cannot be
     overcome by human determination and perseverance. Sin is larger
     than we are. The solution must therefore also supersede our possibili-
     ties. There is a lot of confusion among people about the issue of sal-
     vation. Many claim there are many different roads to the kingdom.
     The roads differ, they say, but they all lead to the same destination.
     But they are wrong.

What is the clear testimony of Scripture regarding the one and only
     road toward salvation? John 10:7, 14:6, Acts 4:12.


        We do not know who will enter through the gates of the kingdom.
     Thank God, that decision is in the hands of the One to whom judgment
     has been given, the One who is love and justice personified. But we
     do know one thing: Those who receive eternal life do so only because
     Christ died for them. Some may never have had the privilege of learn-
     ing about their Savior. But that takes nothing away from the fact that
     if they are saved it will be through the name of Christ, even if they
     have never themselves heard that name.

Why was Jesus the only One who could save fallen humanity? Phil.
     2:6‚Äì8, Heb. 1:1‚Äì5, Rev. 5:9‚Äì12.


        ‚ÄúThe divine Son of God was the only sacrifice of sufficient value to
     fully satisfy the claims of God‚Äôs perfect law. . . . Upon Christ no
     requirements were laid. He had power to lay down His life, and to take
     it again. No obligation was laid upon Him to undertake the work of
     atonement. It was a voluntary sacrifice that He made. His life was of
     sufficient value to rescue man from his fallen condition.
        ‚ÄúThe Son of God was in the form of God, and He thought it not rob-
     bery to be equal with God. He was the only one, who as a man walked
     the earth, who could say to all men, Who of you convinceth me of sin?
     He had united with the Father in the creation of man, and He had
     power through His own divine perfection of character to atone for
     man‚Äôs sin, and to elevate him, and bring him back to his first estate.‚Äù
     ‚ÄîEllen G. White, Lift Him Up, p. 24.


      Think of just how bad sin must be that it cost so much, the death
      of Jesus Himself, in order to atone for it. How can keeping this
      amazing truth before you help you in your own struggle with
      sin?
                                                                        51

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè1 As Seventh-day Adventists, we know that the world is not going
           to get better but worse‚Äîmuch worse, in fact. The question is,
           How are we to relate to the world‚Äôs problems? Do we just shrug
           them off, saying, ‚ÄúWell, God said that things were going to be
2          bad, and they are, so what can we do about them?‚Äù Or do we get
           so involved in trying to solve the world‚Äôs problems that we forget
           our calling to point people to the only solution: that is, Jesus
           Christ, who died for our sins and is coming back? How do we
           strike the right balance?

           ‚óè2 Should our church be clearer in its condemnation of the cor-
           porate evils in this world? Or would this have little impact and
3          only detract from the commission to take the gospel to every indi-
           vidual? At the same time, if we keep quiet about many of these
           big issues, where is our moral credibility?

           ‚óè3 Of all the horrible effects of sin, death has to be the worst.
           Absolutely nothing we as humans can do can reverse it. Sin has
           had such devastating effects that only the supernatural interven-
           tion of God can solve it. What should that tell us about how
           important it is that we strive against sin with all our God-given
           strength?

           ‚óè4 As Seventh-day Adventists, central to our understanding of the
           whole question of sin and evil is the great controversy scenario,
           the idea that onlooking intelligences from other worlds are
           watching what is happening here and seeing how God will deal
           with sin and its consequences. Imagine being a sinless being from
           another part of the universe who has seen what sin has done to
           us. What would they see? What would they be thinking? What
           lessons might they be learning from what they see us going
           through here? Imagine how incomprehensible and irrational
           some of our actions must seem to them.

    Summary: Sin has infected all spheres of life. We are faced with the real-
       ity of something that far exceeds our ability to deal with. But it does
       not exceed the power and the love of God. He has decisively dealt with
       the sin problem in His Son, Jesus Christ.

Ministry on the River Bank
by DANIEL JIAO
   Brother Chen is 92 years old and a retired piano tuner. But he‚Äôs not
retired from God‚Äôs work. A few years ago he and his wife moved to her
hometown in China. There they began sharing their faith with their neigh-
bors, and a few people started coming to their home to worship on
Sabbath, in spite of the government‚Äôs warning that this was illegal.
   Brother Chen spent his own money to print some tracts and pamphlets.
Every day he sits on a stool on the walkway beside the river that runs
through his town. He chats with people who pass by and gives those who
seem interested a tract or a pamphlet. If the person responds to the litera-
ture or to Brother Chen‚Äôs testimony, he invites them to his small apartment
on Sabbath to worship.
   Mae had seen Brother Chen sitting beside the river every day. One day
she stopped to talk to him and soon learned that he was a Christian, and
she wanted to know more. After several conversations, she accepted
Chen‚Äôs invitation to visit his house group, and eventually she was baptized.
   Another couple met him at the river and began listening to his testi-
mony. They were moved by God‚Äôs love, and soon they too were baptized.
Eventually this couple became Global Mission pioneers. Today they are
helping to establish the church that meets in the Chens‚Äô home.
   When the little group grew too large for the tiny apartment Chen and his
wife were renting, Brother Chen found a larger apartment, one that would
seat 50 people. He wanted to buy it, but all he had was the money he had
saved for his funeral. He stepped out in faith and bought the apartment.
   Chen‚Äôs money was not enough to pay for the apartment, so a business
friend responded by paying a large sum toward the apartment, and a newly
baptized couple sold a family heirloom and donated the money to pur-
chase the apartment-church. Together the believers were able to pay for the
apartment. Brother Chen, concerned that upon his death the apartment
would be taken from the church, registered the apartment in the church‚Äôs
name instead of his own.
   Currently some twenty people worship in the apartment-church each
week. And Brother Chen still sits on a chair on the riverside ready with a
smile and a tract and a few words about his friend Jesus. And the Global
Mission pioneers who work with him follow up on interests Brother Chen
meets during his riverside outreach.

      Grace




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Exod. 25:8; Isaiah 53;
      Rom. 5:18, 19; 2 Cor. 3:16‚Äì18; Eph. 2:4‚Äì10; Titus 2:11‚Äì14.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúBut God commendeth his love toward us, in
      that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us‚Äù (Romans 5:8).

              uring a British conference on comparative religions, experts

      D       from around the world debated what, if any, belief was unique
              to the Christian faith. They began eliminating possibilities.
      Incarnation? Other religions had different versions of gods appearing in
      human form. Resurrection? Again, other religions had accounts of
      returns from death. The debate went on for some time until Christian
      writer C. S. Lewis wandered into the room. ‚Äú ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rumpus
      about?‚Äô he asked and heard in reply that his colleagues were discussing
      Christianity‚Äôs unique contribution among world religions. Lewis
      responded, ‚ÄòOh, that‚Äôs easy. It‚Äôs grace.‚Äô ‚Äù‚ÄîPhilip Yancey, What‚Äôs So
      Amazing About Grace? (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing
      House, 1997), p. 45.
         Last week we were confronted with the dreadful phenomenon of
      sin, the ‚Äúsecret power of lawlessness‚Äù (2 Thess. 2:7, NIV). In the final
      section we saw that through divine intervention a solution has been
      provided. What that intervention was, and what it accomplished for
      us, will be the focus of this week‚Äôs study.

The Week at a Glance: What are some of the images God
      uses to teach us the plan of salvation? What is atonement? How cen-
      tral is the concept of substitution to our understanding of the Cross?

     God Provides Salvation
       The story of how Abraham‚Äôs loyalty was tested is well known. God
     asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac. Unaware of what God had told
     his father to do, and thinking that they were simply going to offer a
     sacrifice somewhere, Isaac asked why they had not taken an animal
     with them. Abraham then replied with the prophetic words that found
     their echo throughout the pages of the Old, as well as the New
     Testament: ‚Äú ‚ÄòGod himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offer-
     ing‚Äô ‚Äù (Gen. 22:8, NIV).

What was the prophetic significance of Abraham‚Äôs words to his son?

     ____________________________________________________________________

Where else in the Old Testament do we find texts that point to the
     redemption that was to come through Christ? What are those
     texts, and what do they say? See, for example, Gen. 3:15, Exod.
     25:8, Isaiah 53.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus Christ is the center of the Old Testament. Indeed, the whole
     purpose of the earthly sanctuary service was to point to the coming of
     the Messiah (see Hebrews 8, 9). Everything prior to His entrance into
     the world was a mere prelude to the Cross. God waited until the right
     moment. Then, when ‚Äúthe time had fully come‚Äù (Gal. 4:4, NIV),
     Christ came to live among us.
        ‚ÄúThrough every age, through every hour, the love of God had been
     exercised toward the fallen race. Notwithstanding the perversity of
     men, the signals of mercy had been continually exhibited. And when
     the fullness of the time had come, the Deity was glorified by pouring
     upon the world a flood of healing grace that was never to be
     obstructed or withdrawn till the plan of salvation should be ful-
     filled.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 37.

      Think how many long centuries had passed between the prom-
      ises of the coming Messiah and His coming. What should that
      tell us‚Äîbeings who usually live only eighty short years or so at
      best‚Äîabout patience, about trusting in God though things seem
      to take so long?
                                                                       57

      Pictures of the Miracle of Grace
         How do you explain to a three-year-old child what electricity is?
      How do you explain to those deep in the African jungles, who have
      never traveled more than 25 miles from where they live, what traffic
      lights are for and how an elevator works? How can a physicist ever
      hope to explain Einstein‚Äôs relativity theory to a person whose education
      remained limited to elementary school? God faced a communication
      gap that went far beyond these examples of human communication
      barriers. The divine love demonstrated in the life and death of Jesus
      Christ cannot be captured fully in human words. Yet, God wanted us to
      have an adequate idea of what is involved in His plan of salvation.
      God inspired the authors of the Scriptures to use a number of differ-
      ent word-pictures, each of which gives us further insight into the mys-
      tery of His grace. None of these images should be used in isolation
      from the other perspectives. Taken together, however, they will leave
      us with a sense of wonder and immense gratitude.

What is one of the most prominent word-pictures God used to help us
      catch some profound glimpses of the mystery of grace? Isa. 53:7,
      John 1:29.


What other symbolism is used to illustrate a further dimension of the
      truth of the atonement? Matt. 20:28, Acts 20:28, 1 Cor. 6:20.


         We must be careful not to use one particular symbol to the exclu-
      sion of other word-pictures. When we combine everything that is said
      about the atonement, we arrive at as full a picture as we finite human
      beings can absorb. Nevertheless, the image of a ransom, of a high
      price paid for us, is a powerful one. ‚ÄúChrist redeemed us from sin, that
      is, He bought us back from sin. . . . What the metaphor intends is that
      (a) the means of our salvation is costly and that (b) we have passed
      from one state to another‚Äîfrom the state of slavery to the state of
      nearness to God. A redemption means the passing over of ownership
      at a cost.‚Äù‚ÄîEdward W. H. Vick, Let Me Assure You (Mountain View,
      Calif.: Pacific Press¬Æ Publishing Association, 1968), p. 33.

       Dwell on the implications of this idea that the Creator of the
       universe, the One who made all that is (John 1:1‚Äì3), voluntarily
       went to the cross as the only means of saving us from eternal
       ruin. Why should the reality of this truth heavily influence how
       we live? Think how foolish it is to let anything earthly turn us
       away from the Cross.

     What Happened at Calvary?
        There is a lot of discussion among theologians about the doctrine of
     atonement. Two main concepts are promoted. Some opt for an objec-
     tive view of the atonement while others defend a subjective view.
     What does this mean? The first school of thought emphasizes that
     something actually occurred at a historical point in time on a hill just
     outside of Jerusalem, a concrete, historical event that provided the
     basis for our salvation. Other theologians underline the fact that our
     response to the demonstration of Jesus‚Äô love and self-sacrifice on the
     cross is the crucial point: We are changed when we contemplate a love
     so great! Both perspectives are true and, understood together, comple-
     ment each other.

How does the Bible explain the relationship between what Christ did
     for us and what we as sinful beings, in fact, deserve? Isa. 53:4, 5;
     Rom. 5:18, 19.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The idea that Jesus Christ died in our place, so that we will not suf-
     fer eternal death but become partakers of the life that He offers, is usu-
     ally referred to as the concept of substitution. To many this is an
     abhorrent idea. They do not like the legalistic language often used or
     the concept of divine wrath against sin. But whatever we may like or
     dislike, the grandiose truth is that God has dealt with the sin problem
     in the way He decided was suitable. Being just, He could not ignore
     sin; being love, He could not abandon the sinner. We should have paid
     the penalty of eternal death ourselves because we are the guilty ones.
     But Jesus was willing to take our place! That‚Äôs what happened at the
     cross. This actual event, that of His substitution in our stead, became
     the basis for our redemption.
        Then, as a result of what Christ has done for us, as a response to His
     substitution in our place, we are drawn to Him, we respond to Him, we
     change our attitude toward Him and other humans beings, as well.
     This is the complementary, subjective side to the plan of salvation
     (John 12:32, Rom. 5:1).

      Think about all the bad things you have done and (perhaps)
      might still do. Then realize that Jesus, at the cross, suffered the
      punishment that you deserve for those actions. How do you feel,
      knowing that He suffered in your stead? What should your
      response be, knowing what Jesus went through on your behalf?

                                                                           59

     A Change of Heart
       The unparalleled manifestation of divine compassion and grace on
     Calvary has changed millions of hearts. From the very moment He
     hung dying on the cross, people were changed by beholding the love
     of Christ. One of the criminals crucified with Him noticed that Jesus
     was someone special, with a future beyond this ignominious death
     (Luke 23:39‚Äì43). And even the Roman centurion noticed that Jesus
     was no criminal (vs. 47).

How should our lives be changed by beholding Jesus and what He has
     done for us? 2 Cor. 3:16‚Äì18; Heb. 12:2, 3.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       ‚ÄúLet the repenting sinner fix his eyes upon ‚Äòthe Lamb of God, which
     taketh away the sin of the world‚Äô (John 1:29); and by beholding, he
     becomes changed. His fear is turned to joy, his doubts to hope.
     Gratitude springs up. The stony heart is broken. A tide of love sweeps
     into the soul. Christ is in him a well of water springing up unto ever-
     lasting life. When . . . we behold Him in Gethsemane, sweating great
     drops of blood, and on the cross dying in agony‚Äîwhen we see this,
     self will no longer clamor to be recognized. Looking unto Jesus, we
     shall be ashamed of our coldness, our lethargy, our self-seeking. We
     shall be willing to be anything or nothing, so that we may do heart
     service for the Master.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 439,
     440; italics supplied.

How well do her words reflect your own experience with Christ?
     What could be holding you back from a deeper experience with
     Him? How much time do you spend contemplating Calvary?


       Theologians propose various theories of the atonement. But when
     everything is said and done, there is no one theory or combination of
     theories that will do justice to the marvel of God‚Äôs grace (see 1 Cor.
     1:20‚Äì25). It is good to talk together about the passages of Scripture
     that reveal different aspects of Jesus‚Äô sacrifice. But what Jesus did for
     us should be not only a topic of debate but prayerfully contemplated
     and experienced. Though there‚Äôs much we can‚Äôt understand, we have
     been given enough so that we should marvel at what God has done for
     us in Christ.

      Christ Our Salvation
         It‚Äôs easy for Christians to get sidetracked. For some, the focus of
      their faith is either on the Bible, or on the church, or on the traditions
      or doctrines of their church. While all these have their role, they can
      be very problematic if they turn us away from Jesus, who alone is the
      Source of our salvation.
         As Seventh-day Adventists, we often refer to the ‚Äútruth‚Äù as the focus
      of our faith. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as we do not
      reduce our concept of truth to a list of doctrines to which we intellectu-
      ally ascribe. Our faith should find its center in the truth as we find it in
      Jesus. We believe in a Person who has revealed our God to us, who has
      come to redeem us, who presently is our heavenly Mediator, and who
      will return to take us home. This must be of primary importance to us.

What do such passages as Ephesians 2:4‚Äì10 and Titus 2:11‚Äì14 teach
      us about the centrality of Christ in our faith?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Ephesians 2:4‚Äì10 is an extraordinarily rich passage. It underlines sev-
      eral times that we are saved by grace. This grace is described as ‚Äúincom-
      parable riches‚Äù (vs. 6, NIV), which issue from God‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat love for us‚Äù
      (vs. 4, NIV). This grace is gratis, free. It cannot be earned. Our works
      do not bring us eternal life. If they did, we would have reason to boast
      about our own goodness. It is God‚Äôs grace that will bring visible changes
      in our daily lives and that will enable us to do ‚Äúgood‚Äù works (vs. 10).
      But even these good deeds are, essentially, God‚Äôs work in us.

What magnificent description of the centrality of Jesus Christ to our
      faith do we find in Paul‚Äôs words as recorded in Acts 17:28? See
      also Gal. 2:16‚Äì20.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       How should the doctrines we have as Adventists help us better
       understand what Christ has done for us? Suppose, for instance,
       that you believed in eternal torment in hell. How would that, or
       other false teachings, impact your understanding of Christ?
       Why then are correct doctrines so important in helping us come
       to know Jesus better?
                                                                              61
                       F RIDAY May 15

    Further Study: The book Seventh-day Adventists will almost
          automatically refer to when asked about the atoning work of Christ is
          Ellen G. White‚Äôs The Desire of Ages. Chapters 78 and 79 (pp.
          741‚Äì768) are particularly relevant in the context of this week‚Äôs study.
          Note the statement on page 751: ‚ÄúAs Jesus, crucified with the thieves,
          was placed ‚Äòin the midst,‚Äô so His cross was placed in the midst of a
          world lying in sin. And the words of pardon spoken to the penitent
          thief kindled a light that will shine to the earth‚Äôs remotest bounds.‚Äù

1   Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè
           1 Some people are offended by the idea that God demanded the
           life of His Son as a ‚Äúpayment‚Äù for the sins of humankind. That,
           though, is one of the images used by the Bible, so we must take it
           for what it says. What should the image tell us about the serious-
           ness of sin and how costly our redemption was?
2
           ‚óè
           2 If there is one doctrine many contemporary people object to,
           it is the atonement. Many do not accept the idea that our prob-
           lem should be solved by an intervention from the ‚Äúoutside.‚Äù
           Should not each person accept responsibility for what he or she
           has done? How do you explain the need for divine intervention to
           such people? Also, ask these people about the problem of death.
           How is that problem going to be solved if not by divine interven-
3          tion?

           ‚óè
           3 Those who are saved by grace must also show grace to those
           around them. How do we as individuals show that our lives are
           embedded in grace? How does a church model this divine grace?

           ‚óè
           4 Why is the ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù side of the Cross so important, as
           well? That is, how should the realization of Christ‚Äôs death for us
           change us? What should it teach us about forgiveness, about
           humility, about patience, about love for the unlovable? What are
           some concrete and practical ways we can reveal the reality of
           what the Cross means to us?

    Summary: Theologians have developed many theories about the atone-
       ment. Most are deficient or at least one-sided. They may be compared
       with pictures taken from different sides of the Himalayas. They all
       show the mountains but do not provide a complete picture. The mira-
       cle of grace must not be reduced to a formula to which we give intel-
       lectual assent. It is the ground of our faith. Christ died for us so that
       we can have eternal life. Without Him, we are lost. With Him as our
       Savior, our future is secure.

Ooha‚Äôs Fervent Faith
by Y. S. METHUSELAH
   Eight-year-old Ooha looked longingly out the door of her grandmother‚Äôs
small house in the village of Venkatapuram, in southeastern India. She
scanned the empty plot of land across the road and then closed her eyes in
prayer. Ooha, like the other new believers in her village, has a wish. No,
it‚Äôs more than a wish; it‚Äôs a passion. She wants to worship God in a church,
a real church.
   When Adventist lay workers held evangelistic meetings in Ooha‚Äôs vil-
lage, hundreds of people attended. And when they were invited to follow
Jesus, many left their other gods and accepted Jesus as their Lord and
Savior. Their faith is fervent, and their determination to be true to God‚Äôs
commandments is strong. Every Sabbath and often during the week they
gather in homes to worship and pray, for they, like many congregations
throughout India, have no church in which to worship.
   The church members are farmers. They don‚Äôt earn a lot. But they give
what they can to buy bricks for the church that one day will stand in the
empty lot. Progress is slow, and others in their village‚Äîmostly non-
Christians‚Äîurge the new believers to find a stronger god, for their God
must not be very powerful if He cannot provide a temple in which to wor-
ship Him. The believers understand how their neighbors think, but it stings
to hear the words, ‚ÄúYour God must not be strong.‚Äù
   Ooha hears the words too. She has no money to add to the church‚Äôs
building fund, but she is doing her part. Ever since the missionaries told
them about Jesus, Ooha has prayed for a church. Every Sabbath she fasts
and prays for the church that she is sure God will provide. She refuses to
miss a single Sabbath, and she plans to continue fasting and praying until
the church becomes a reality and is dedicated. So on Sabbath, while other
children run after morning worship, Ooha fasts and prays that God will
                               provide a way for them to have a church in
                               which to worship and bring their friends to
                               meet God.
                                 Your mission offerings have helped lead
                               thousands of people in India to the Savior.
                               Your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings have
                               helped build hundreds of churches there, as
                               well. Thank you for sharing so that others may
                               meet Jesus.

      Rest




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Gen. 2:2, 3; Deut.
      5:12‚Äì15; Isa. 58:12‚Äì14; Ezek. 20:12; Heb. 4:9‚Äì11.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúThen he said to them, ‚ÄòThe Sabbath was made
      for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the Son of Man is Lord even
      of the Sabbath‚Äô ‚Äù (Mark 2:27, 28, NIV).

          f there is anything in the Christian faith relevant for people living

      I   at the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is the Sabbath. It is
          the medicine badly needed by millions in societies plagued by
      stress, heart problems, and burnout. It offers escape from the never-
      ending pressures of modern life. It provides a possibility to recharge
      our empty batteries and to refocus on the real priorities in life. The
      Sabbath tells us that there is a time to close the door of our home and
      our mind to the clutter and noise of the world and to come into the
      presence of the One who made us and who knows what we need.
         ‚ÄúIf there is any command hurried and hassled modern people need, it
      is the Sabbath. We are so busy trying to create meaning in our own life
      and serving ourselves that we forget that God is the only One who can
      give meaning to our lives. We show our ‚Äòresting‚Äô in Him by resting on
      His day.‚Äù‚ÄîJon L. Dybdahl, Exodus, The Abundant Life Bible Amplifier
      (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press¬Æ Publishing Association, 1994), p. 186.

The Week at a Glance: Why is the Sabbath so important
      for us? Why did God institute the Sabbath? What is holy time?
      Who or what makes the Sabbath holy? How can we make Sabbath
      keeping a delightful and meaningful experience?

      God‚Äôs Gift for Busy People
        Two basic institutions for all humankind date from the first week of
      earth‚Äôs history: marriage and the Sabbath. They are an intrinsic part of
      the divine program for human happiness. No wonder that both have,
      through the ages, been so much under attack from the evil one. God
      knew what humanity would need, and He therefore created time with
      a perfect cycle of six ‚Äúnormal‚Äù days plus one extraordinary day: the
      Sabbath. And ever since, those who have respected this divinely insti-
      tuted rhythm have been blessed by it.

Why did God Himself rest on the seventh day after the creation of the
      world? Gen. 2:2, 3.

      ____________________________________________________________________

With what term does the prophet Ezekiel refer to the Sabbath? What
      do you think that means? Ezek. 20:12.

      ____________________________________________________________________

        ‚ÄúAfter resting upon the seventh day, God sanctified it, or set it apart,
      as a day of rest for man. Following the example of the Creator, man
      was to rest upon this sacred day, that as he should look upon the heav-
      ens and the earth, he might reflect upon God‚Äôs great work of creation;
      and that as he should behold the evidences of God‚Äôs wisdom and
      goodness, his heart might be filled with love and reverence for his
      Maker.
        ‚ÄúGod saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise. He
      needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of the
      seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God and
      meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a Sabbath to
      remind him more vividly of God and to awaken gratitude because all
      that he enjoyed and possessed came from the beneficent hand of the
      Creator.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 47, 48.

       What is your experience with the Sabbath? Do you enjoy it? Do
       you come to a deeper appreciation of God through contemplat-
       ing the marvels of His creation? If not, what changes could you
       make that could help you have a more fulfilling Sabbath expe-
       rience?
                                                                            65

     Holy Time
        The word holy occurs in the Bible in different settings. People are
     sometimes referred to as holy; so are objects or time periods. The core
     meaning is ‚Äúto set aside for a specific use.‚Äù Priests were holy people
     because they were singled out for service in the sanctuary. They han-
     dled holy vessels and instruments, which were withdrawn from secu-
     lar use for a specific ritual purpose. Similarly, holy days are marked
     by God for a specific purpose. Once they have been singled out as
     holy, they are no longer available for common use, because they have
     been destined for a higher purpose. The activities on such holy days
     must correspond with the purpose God has attached to such days.

We must ‚Äúremember‚Äù to keep the Sabbath holy. Do we or does God
     make the day holy? What difference does that make? Gen. 2:3, Isa.
     58:13.


       ‚ÄúThe Sabbath is a powerful testimony to the sovereignty of God.
     Only he can create, and only he can make something holy. This is why
     Adventists object so strongly to the change from Sabbath to Sunday
     as the Christian day of rest and worship. Without a clear divine man-
     date, such a development is nothing less than an affront to God.‚Äù
     ‚ÄîRichard Rice, The Reign of God (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Andrews
     University Press, 1997), p. 403.

How does the weekly holy seventh-day Sabbath impact those who
     choose to obey the command to keep the Sabbath according to
     God‚Äôs appointed day of holy time? Exod. 31:12, 13.


        Keeping the Sabbath combines internal with external aspects. When
     our Sabbath keeping is only a matter of external behavior, following a
     list of rules, we have missed its true meaning. But, at the same time,
     our Sabbath keeping is visible to others. It tells other people that we
     are separate and different. It is a sign of our loyalty to our Creator and
     Redeemer.

      God wants His people to be ‚Äúholy‚Äù; that is, He wants people who
      have consciously separated themselves from the things of this
      world. How should keeping the Sabbath help you in a concrete
      way to be ‚Äúseparate‚Äù from the world? How should the reality of
      the approaching Sabbath each week serve as a reminder to you
      when facing temptations during the week, that we are supposed
      to be a holy people, a people separate from the defiling things of
      the world?

     Experiencing the Joy of the Sabbath
       When we talk about the Sabbath commandment, we usually refer to
     the version we find in Exodus 20. There the commandment is
     anchored in the Creation of the world. Every Sabbath we are reminded
     that God is our Creator and that we are His creatures, with all that this
     glorious truth implies. But in the version of the Ten Commandments
     in the book of Deuteronomy we discover an additional aspect. The
     weekly Sabbath is also a commemoration of Israel‚Äôs delivery from
     Egyptian bondage and thus, by extension, of every kind of slavery
     from which God‚Äôs grace has set humanity free.

Read Deuteronomy 5:12‚Äì15 carefully and compare it with Exodus
     20:8‚Äì11. What do they add to each other? How do they comple-
     ment each other? Are there possibly still other things we ought to
     ‚Äúremember‚Äù in our Sabbath keeping? If so, what might they be?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Sabbath is a sign not only of creation but of redemption. It
     points us to the salvation we have in Jesus, who not only re-creates us
     now (2 Cor. 5:17, Gal. 6:15) but offers the hope of an eternity in a
     new heaven and a new earth (2 Pet. 3:13). In fact, the Jews have seen
     the Sabbath as a symbol of the ‚Äúworld to come‚Äù; that is, the new
     heaven and the new earth. It‚Äôs a weekly foretaste of what we will have
     for eternity and should serve as a special reminder of what we have
     been given in Jesus.
        On a more practical level, Sabbath helps to free us from the slavery
     of the clock and the calendar. Many are slaves of computers and
     mobile phones also. For many people it has become incredibly diffi-
     cult to separate work time from leisure time. It seems that modern life
     requires that we can always be reached and always must be ready to
     switch into our work mode. The Sabbath is the perfect antidote to this
     disease, which threatens every form of true rest, both physical and
     spiritual.
        ‚ÄúSetting aside a holy Sabbath means that we can cease our produc-
     tivity and accomplishments for one day in every seven. The exciting
     thing about such a practice is that it changes our attitudes for the rest
     of the week. It frees us up to worry less about how much we produce
     on the other days. Furthermore, when we end that futile chasing after
     wind, we can truly rest and learn delight in new ways.‚Äù‚ÄîMarva J.

     Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1996), p. 19.

      Modeling Sabbath Rest to the World
Read Isaiah 58:12‚Äì14. What principles can we take away from these
      verses about Sabbath keeping that help us better experience the
      blessings God has for us if we remember the Sabbath properly?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It is an extremely unfortunate reality: Many Adventists do not truly
      enjoy God‚Äôs Sabbath. Some remember with utter frustration the ways
      in which the Sabbath was kept in their parental home. Even in
      Adventist institutions, Sabbath keeping can leave much to be desired.
      Rules and regulations are supposed to ensure that the Sabbath is kept
      ‚Äúholy.‚Äù Some of these rules are based on biblical principles, but many
      have, in actual fact, more to do with tradition and culture than with a
      ‚ÄúThus says the Lord.‚Äù
         The Sabbath never must be a day mainly associated with prohibi-
      tions and restrictions. If we are looking for a model to follow, we must
      let ourselves be inspired by the example of Jesus.

Look carefully at the following passages and discover how Jesus, our
      ultimate Example, kept the seventh-day Sabbath ‚Äúholy.‚Äù Mark
      2:23‚Äì3:6, Luke 4:16, 6:1‚Äì11.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äôs work never ceases, and men should never rest from doing
      good. The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactivity.
      The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil that
      gains a livelihood must cease; no labor for worldly pleasure or profit
      is lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His labor of creating, and
      rested upon the Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to leave the occupa-
      tions of his daily life, and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest,
      to worship, and to holy deeds. The work of Christ in healing the sick
      was in perfect accord with the law. It honored the Sabbath.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 207.

       Try to imagine what the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù Sabbath would be like. How
       would you keep it? What would be available to you that you
       could not have during the workweek? Bring your description to
       class on Sabbath.

     The Sign of Rest
       As Sabbath keepers we often are accused of trying to work our way
     to heaven by keeping the Sabbath. We hear that all the time. How
     should we respond?
       Read again the Sabbath commandment in Exodus 20. What does it tell
     us to do? It tells us, as well as our sons, our daughters, our servants, our
     animals, and even the strangers among us to rest. It‚Äôs all about rest.
       Now, a simple question: How is it that the one commandment
     devoted to rest, the one commandment that specifically expresses rest,
     the one commandment that gives us a special opportunity to rest‚Äî
     how has this been turned into the universal ‚ÄúNew Covenant‚Äù symbol
     of works? The only commandment that, by its nature, is all about rest
     has become, for many, the metaphor for salvation by works.
       What‚Äôs wrong with this picture?
       Indeed, far from being a symbol of works, the Sabbath is the Bible‚Äôs
     eternal symbol of the rest that God‚Äôs people have always had in Him.

Read Hebrews 4:9‚Äì11. What is the message to us here about the
     Sabbath?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        From the pre-Fall world of Adam and Eve‚Äôs Eden to the New
     Covenant rest that God‚Äôs followers have in Christ‚Äôs work of redemp-
     tion for them, the Sabbath is a real-time manifestation of the rest that
     Christ offers to all. In Matthew 11:28‚Äì30, Jesus calls us to rest in Him.
     He will give us rest, and that rest finds one expression in His univer-
     sal Sabbath day. Anyone can say that they are resting in Christ: anyone
     can say that they are saved by grace. But the keeping of the seventh-
     day Sabbath is a visible expression of that rest, a living parable of
     what it means to be covered by His grace. Our weekly rest from our
     secular, worldly works stands as a symbol of our rest in the completed
     work of Jesus for us.
        Our obedience to this commandment is a way of saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so
     sure of our salvation in Jesus, we‚Äôre so firm and secure in what Christ
     has done for us, that we can‚Äîin a special way‚Äîrest from any of our
     works because we know what Christ has accomplished for humanity
     through His death and resurrection.‚Äù
        Sabbath is a very real, very expressive, very visible expression and
     manifestation of the rest that we have in Jesus and what He has done
     for us. We don‚Äôt have to say it; we can express it in a real way, a way
     that those who don‚Äôt keep the Sabbath can‚Äôt.

                                                                             69

    Further Study: Read the comments made by Ellen G. White on
          the giving of the Ten Commandment law in Patriarchs and Prophets,
          pp. 303‚Äì310, and on the story about Jesus‚Äô Sabbath keeping together
          with His disciples in The Desire of Ages, pp. 281‚Äì289.
             A rich source for additional information is, Walter F. Specht, ‚ÄúThe
          Sabbath in the New Testament,‚Äù in Kenneth A. Strand, ed., The
          Sabbath in Scripture and History (Washington, D.C.: Review and
          Herald¬Æ Publishing Association, 1982), pp. 92‚Äì113.
             Note in particular this passage: ‚ÄúIn Mark‚Äôs account (chap. 2:27), Jesus
1
          then raised the issue of the purpose of the Sabbath. The Sabbath was not
          an end in itself. . . . It was designed to be a blessing to man, a day of
          physical rest, but also a day devoted to spiritual exercises. The Pharisees
          treated the day as though man were created to serve the Sabbath, rather
          than the Sabbath meeting the needs of man. R. Shim‚Äòon ben Menasya
          about A.D. 180 made a similar statement [to the statement made by
2
          Jesus]: ‚ÄòThe Sabbath is given over to you but you are not surrendered
          to the Sabbath.‚Äô ‚Äù‚ÄîPage 96.

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè
           1 In class, compare your descriptions of what a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù
           Sabbath would be like. What can you do to come as close as pos-
           sible to that ideal?

3          ‚óè
           2 Earlier in the week it was suggested that some of the rules and
           restrictions we apply to the Sabbath are rooted more in tradition
           than in the Word of God. As a class, discuss what these human-
           made rules might be, as opposed to what the Bible says. How can
           we know the difference?

           ‚óè3 Dwell more on the idea expressed in Thursday‚Äôs lesson. How
           can we better show the world that the special rest that we enjoy
           in Jesus through the Sabbath reveals the reality of Christ‚Äôs grace
           in our lives? What things might we have done that give others the
           wrong impression?

    Summary: The Sabbath is God‚Äôs gift to humanity. It is the perfect antidote
       for today‚Äôs restlessness and stress. It is a very specific weekly amount
       of time that God has made ‚Äúholy‚Äù for us. The day can, if approached
       with the right attitude, be a source of physical and spiritual rest and a
       time of great joy. The ultimate Example of true Sabbath keeping is
       Jesus, who referred very significantly to Himself as the Lord of the
       Sabbath.

The Attack That Saved a Life
by SILILE FEIN MAZIBISA
   It was Saturday evening, and Thabani was walking home from choir
practice with his friend, Thomas. Thomas wasn‚Äôt an Adventist, but he
enjoyed spending time with Thabani.
   As the teenagers walked down the quiet street in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe,
they heard footsteps behind them. But they paid little attention, for they
were in a safe neighborhood‚Äîthey thought. Suddenly four men raced
toward them and attacked Thabani. Three grabbed him while the fourth
searched his pockets for valuables.
   Thomas ran shouting for help, but no one would open their door.
Thabani tried to shake off the men and run, but his attackers held him
tightly. In the struggle, one of the assailants stabbed Thabani behind his
ear. Finally Thabani broke away and stumbled toward Thomas, who had
found someone to help them. When the assailants saw another man com-
ing to help the boys, they ran away.
   Thabani was bleeding from his head wound, so Thomas helped him
walk the remaining block to his house. His brother drove them to the near-
est clinic. At the clinic the medical personnel directed him to go to a hos-
pital, but in their panic the brothers had locked the car keys in the car.
While they tried to decide what to do, a physician approached them. He
had just finished his shift at the clinic and offered to take them to the hos-
pital. They arrived at the hospital, and the physician led them to a room
where he treated Thabani‚Äôs injuries. He then told Thabani that he could
return home.
   The boys thanked the doctor and explained that they had no money to
pay him. The doctor told Thabani not to worry, that he would not charge
for the care. Thanking the man once more, the boys returned home.
   When Thabani‚Äôs parents returned home, he told them what had hap-
pened. The family tried to locate the doctor who had treated their son at
no charge, but no one at the clinic or the hospital knew of a doctor that fit
Thabani‚Äôs description. ‚ÄúPerhaps you were treated by an angel,‚Äù his mother
said reverently.
   Thomas was deeply impressed that God had cared for his friend in such
a remarkable manner. Although he attended a church that focused on heal-
ings and miracles, Thomas began to worship with Thabani at the Adventist
church. Recently Thomas was baptized, and the two friends sing God‚Äôs
praises together as brothers in faith.
   Your mission offerings reach virtually every country in the world with
the message of God‚Äôs love and salvation. Thank you!
SILILE FEIN MAZIBISA is Thabani‚Äôs sister. They are the children of an Adventist pastor in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.

      Heaven




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Eccles. 9:5, 6; Col.
      1:10‚Äì14; 1 Thess. 4:13‚Äì18; Rev. 21:1‚Äì4, 8.

Memory Text: ‚Äú ‚ÄòIn my Father‚Äôs house are many rooms; if it
      were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a
      place for you. . . . I will come back and take you to be with me‚Äô ‚Äù
      (John 14:2, 3, NIV).

             or many the word heaven has become meaningless, a concept

      F      that belongs to the realm of fairy tales. We delude ourselves, they
             say, if we think there is some kind of life beyond this earthly exis-
      tence. Some go so far as to say that it is positively wrong to tell people
      that there is a heaven. They argue that it keeps people from putting all
      their efforts into what they could achieve in life here and now.
         Even many Christians struggle with the concept. They are not so
      sure that heaven is a real place. Should heaven, rather, be interpreted
      as a state of mind? On the other hand, there are many who believe that
      at death the soul is released and enters heaven to live with God. They
      are confident that their father, mother, husband, wife, or child‚Äîwho
      has preceded them in death‚Äîis now with God in heaven and that a
      few years at most separate them from a reunion with their loved ones.
         What‚Äôs the truth on this important topic?

The Week at a Glance: Why is the promise of heaven so
      important to us? What will life be like there? How can we experi-
      ence a foretaste of it now? What destiny awaits those whose
      choices exclude them from heaven?

     When Do We Get to Heaven?
        It is quite astonishing that the idea of an immortal soul‚Äîwhich is
     separable from our physical body and which ascends to heaven right
     at death‚Äîhas become so dominant among Christians. Satan cleverly
     used the ideas of the Greek philosophers to repeat his lie in Eden:
     ‚Äú ‚ÄòYou will not surely die‚Äô ‚Äù (Gen. 3:4, NIV).

What do the following passages teach us about the true nature of
     death?

       ‚Ä¢ 1 Kings 11:21
       ‚Ä¢ Ps. 13:3
       ‚Ä¢ Eccles. 9:5, 6
       ‚Ä¢ 1 Cor. 15:51

       When we die, we enter into a state of unconsciousness that the Bible
     compares to sleep. Unaware of what happens in the world, we await
     the morning of the resurrection. Only then will the great multitude of
     the redeemed enter heaven to join the very few, such as Enoch and
     Elijah, who have preceded them! But it is not going to be a long wait.
     The moment we close our eyes in death, the next thing we know will
     be Christ at His second coming. In other words, as far as those who
     die in Christ are concerned, it will make no difference whether it was
     3,000 years ago or the day before Christ returns. They close their eyes
     in death, and the next thing they are conscious of is Jesus returning to
     get them. It will seem, to them, instantaneous.

What is the glorious truth about our future entrance into the heav-
     enly realm? John 14:1‚Äì3, 1 Thess. 4:13‚Äì18.

     translation of the saints to meet Him together, at the same time. It is
     in this future, and not what happens at death, that saints can find com-
     fort.‚Äù‚ÄîNorman Gulley, Christ Is Coming (Hagerstown, Md.: Review
     and Herald¬Æ Publishing Association, 1998), pp. 293, 294.

      Why is the promise of heaven so important to us? If there were
      no heaven and this life were all there was, then what hope does
      anyone have at all?

                                                                         73

      Heaven or Hell?
         Not all people will be saved. Some will be eternally lost. Human
      beings have been created with a free will. Someone once expressed it
      like this: There are just two kinds of people‚Äîthose who say, ‚ÄúLord,
      Your will be done,‚Äù and those to whom the Lord says, ‚ÄúI have to
      respect your choice; your will be done!‚Äù In the end, no one asked to
      be born. We‚Äôre here only because we‚Äôve been created without our con-
      sent. God offers us the hope of eternal life, if we choose it. If we don‚Äôt,
      then we will go back to the nothingness out of which we came. It‚Äôs, in
      the end, our own choice.

All humanity awaits one of two ultimate destinies. What are they? Matt.
      25:46; John 5:29; Rev 21:1‚Äì4, 8.

         Heaven is a reality. It is a place. It is where God lives together with
      the other Members of the Godhead and a host of unfallen angels. It
      also is where we will live if we remain on God‚Äôs side. When Christ
      returns and the first resurrection takes place, the resurrected saints
      will accompany their Lord to heaven, where they will remain for a
      thousand years (Rev. 20:4‚Äì6). After the thousand years a series of
      events will take place, culminating in the creation of a ‚Äúnew heaven‚Äù
      and a ‚Äúnew earth‚Äù (Rev. 21:1), where the redeemed will then live for-
      ever.
         But hell also is a reality. The popular belief in a place where sinners
      will be tormented and burn for all eternity does not have biblical sup-
      port. But neither has the popular idea that in the end all people are
      going to be saved. Those who reject the good news of salvation and
      refuse to be obedient to God will be judged and condemned and will
      face a death from which there is no resurrection ever. Those who
      believe that all people will be saved argue that a God of love will not
      allow anyone to lose out on eternal bliss. They have a point to the
      extent that God is, indeed, love personified and wants to save all men
      and women. But tragically, not all people want to be saved. Christ
      could not have expressed it any clearer: ‚Äú ‚ÄòI tell you the truth, whoever
      hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will
      not be condemned,‚Äô ‚Äù but He also added that ‚Äú ‚Äòthose who have done
      evil will rise to be condemned‚Äô ‚Äù (John 5:24, 29, NIV).
         It remains our choice. Heaven can be ours if we choose to believe
      in God and are willing to become disciples of His Son, Jesus Christ.

      The Kingdom‚ÄîNow and Then
         When we accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, we enter into a new kind
      of existence. Although still subject to the results of sin‚Äîaging, sick-
      ness, and the temporary ‚Äúsleep‚Äù of death‚Äîwe have already, in a very
      real sense, received eternal life. It is important never to lose sight of that
      crucial fact. We have been born again and have a new life ‚Äúin Christ.‚Äù
      Those who have declared their allegiance to Christ are ‚Äúchildren‚Äù of
      God (1 John 3:2, NIV). They have ‚Äú ‚Äòcrossed over,‚Äô ‚Äù Jesus declares,
      ‚Äú ‚Äòfrom death to life‚Äô ‚Äù (John 5:24, NIV). They have becomes citizens of
      the kingdom of God as they have incorporated the kingdom values into
      their lives. They now have a different Master, and their ultimate focus is
      no longer on the things of this world but on the eternal city.

How did Jesus express the reality of the citizenship of the kingdom for
      His followers even in this world? Luke 17:21, John 14:27.

      ____________________________________________________________________

What confirmation of this truth do we find in the words of Paul?
      Rom. 14:17, Col. 1:10‚Äì14.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         But this is not where it stops. What we experience of the reality of
      the heavenly kingdom while we are still on earth is only a foretaste of
      the ‚Äúinheritance‚Äù that is to come. It makes us long for more. When
      Jesus comes in His glory, ‚Äúall the nations‚Äù will be gathered before
      Him (Matt. 25:32, NIV). ‚Äú ‚ÄòThen the King will say to those on his
      right, ‚ÄúCome, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance,
      the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world‚Äù ‚Äô ‚Äù
      (vs. 34, NIV). That is the moment God‚Äôs children have been waiting
      for. They will be home at last!
         ‚ÄúBetter than all the friendship of the world is the friendship of
      Christ‚Äôs redeemed. Better than a title to the noblest palace on earth is
      a title to the mansions our Lord has gone to prepare. And better than
      all the words of earthly praise will be the Savior‚Äôs words to His faith-
      ful servants, ‚ÄòCome, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre-
      pared for you from the foundation of the world.‚Äô Matt. 25:34.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen
      G. White, Christ‚Äôs Object Lessons, p. 374.

       Go back over the texts for today. How have you experienced the
       reality of what is promised in them? What choices are you mak-
       ing that could be hindering you from truly enjoying what Christ
       offers you even now?

                                                                                75

      Beyond Our Wildest Expectation
        Have you ever wondered how it will be in heaven and on the new
      earth? Will we recognize each other? Will we have eternal youth?
      What will we do when there? Will we have our own occupations? Or
      will we only sing God‚Äôs praises? Will we travel to other places in the
      universe? How much will we remember of our earthly existence? We
      are not the first ones to ask such questions!

What did the Sadducees want to know about the life in the hereafter?
      Matt. 22:23‚Äì28.


What did Jesus reply? Matt. 22:29, 30.

        The statement of Jesus that is recorded in Matthew 22 was part of a
      discussion with the Sadducees. They were a group of Jewish leaders
      who denied the possibility of a bodily resurrection. It is clear that it
      was not Jesus‚Äô intention to give a full description of the conditions of
      eternal life. The context makes clear that Jesus wanted to emphasize
      that death has been conquered. He points beyond the reality of death
      and resurrection. Those who die are safe in His memory, and He can
      therefore still be called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
      Nonetheless, Jesus‚Äô remark also clearly indicates that, in spite of all
      continuity, we will be raised with the unique identity that we had in
      this temporary life; there also will be plenty of discontinuity.

What are some of the things we will no longer experience in the earth
      made new? Rev. 21:1, 4, 22‚Äì27; 22:5.


         Those of us who love vacationing on the seaside may be disap-
      pointed to learn that the sea will be ‚Äúno more.‚Äù However, to the people
      who first heard these words, the sea was a threat. Israel never was a
      seafaring nation. For good reasons, it feared the dark depths of the
      oceans. And we know from several Gospel stories that even crossing
      the Sea of Galilee could be a scary experience. John the revelator tells
      us that in the new world that God will create, everything that could pos-
      sibly be a threat to us will have been removed and everyone who could
      present a danger to us will be absent. We will be eternally secure!

       Try to imagine a world without sickness, death, fear, loss, a
       world in which we only keep growing in knowledge and love.
       What things here give us hints at what it will be like there? Let
       your imagination seek to grasp what this new existence will be
       like. What are you especially anticipating?

      Meeting the Lord of Heaven
         We have every reason to believe that on the new earth we will be
      able to recognize those we knew in this life. Our resurrection bodies
      will resemble that of the risen Lord. When He appeared to His fol-
      lowers after His resurrection, He clearly was recognizable to those
      who had been with Him prior to His death. What an inexpressible joy
      it will be to be reunited with those we lost in death. But the supreme
      experience will be to meet the Lord of the universe. Our songs will
      come true: ‚ÄúFace to face shall [we] behold Him, far beyond the starry
      sky!‚Äù What a privilege it will be to stand before the Alpha and the
      Omega of the universe.

What assurance do we have that we will meet the Lord of lords? 1 Thess.
      4:16, 17; Rev. 21:22, 23.


         We cannot yet imagine what it will be like to meet our Savior. How
      many questions will we want to ask! The why question, which has so
      often been on our lips, finally will receive its definitive answer. We
      will at last understand why God permitted particular trials and temp-
      tations into our earthly existence. Never again will we doubt God‚Äôs
      wisdom and goodness. All distrust will dissipate as we learn why God
      allowed certain things to take place. And only then will we realize
      fully how we have been protected from all kinds of dangers.

What will be a dominant aspect of eternal life? Rom. 14:11, 1 Tim.
      1:17, Rev. 5:13.


        Eternal life is singing eternal praises and worshiping the King.
      Why? Because He is worthy of our adoration. ‚ÄúThat the Maker of all
      worlds, the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory and
      humiliate Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and
      adoration of the universe. As the nations of the saved look upon their
      Redeemer and behold the eternal glory of the Father shining in His
      countenance; as they behold His throne, which is from everlasting to
      everlasting, and know that His kingdom is to have no end, they break
      forth in rapturous song: ‚ÄòWorthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain,
      and hath redeemed us to God by His own most precious blood!‚Äô ‚Äù
      ‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 651, 652.

       What will it be like when you meet Jesus face to face? What do
       you think you will say to Him, and why? What do you think
       He‚Äôll say to you?


                                                                        77

    For Further Study: Ellen G. White has written a lot about
          heaven and our entrance into the heavenly kingdom. The final chap-
          ters of The Great Controversy are a sublime description of what will
          be ours. But the compilation The Story of Redemption also captures
          this topic admirably. See the last four chapters, pp. 418‚Äì433.
             ‚Äú ‚ÄòAnd I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
          the first earth were passed away.‚Äô Rev. 21:1. The fire that consumes the
          wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No
          eternally burning hell will keep before the ransomed the fearful con-
          sequences of sin. One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will
1         ever bear the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, His
          hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has
          wrought.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Story of Redemption, p. 430.

    Discussion Questions
2
           ‚óè1 How do we deal with the question of salvation for those who
           have never heard the name of Jesus? How should the fact that
           Jesus died for the sins of all humanity, even those who never
           heard of Him, help us trust that God has not forgotten those folk
           either?

           ‚óè2 The Bible describes death as a sleep, a state of unconscious-
           ness. How can one then explain ‚Äúnear-death‚Äù experiences in
           which people claim to have seen heavenly beings in a dazzling
3
           light or dead friends and relatives? How can we help these peo-
           ple realize that what they experienced might not be what they are
           judging it to be? In other words, how can we help them realize
           that what they saw couldn‚Äôt be what they think it was, no matter
           how real it seemed to their senses?

           ‚óè
           3 How have people abused the promise of eternal life in ways
           that allowed them to manipulate others for personal or political
           gain? What are some ways we might be guilty of doing the same
           thing, if on a less dramatic scale?

    Summary: We are people with a destiny that extends far beyond our short
       existence in this present world. We are citizens of a heavenly kingdom.
       This kingdom is both present and future. It already is with us but will
       be realized fully in all its glory when Christ returns to take us home.
       Then eternal life in God‚Äôs presence will be ours.

The Secondhand Church
   Pamela Obero sat beside her mud house in Kenya and listened to the
preacher‚Äôs sermon over the loudspeaker. She was curious about the Seventh-
day Adventist meetings being held on a nearby vacant lot, but she belonged
to another church.
   The messages touched Pamela‚Äôs heart, and at times she felt that the speaker
talked directly to her. So, on Sabbath morning she took her five children to
the meetings instead of to her own church. When the pastor invited those who
wanted special prayer to come forward, Pamela took her children to the front.
Her husband had died, and she was the sole support of her family. Life was
difficult.
   Pamela had been an ardent member of the charismatic church to which she
belonged. She had donated the land on which the church members built their
mud-brick house of worship. So, when she did not attend church for three
weeks, some church members visited and asked why she was no longer
attending. ‚ÄúI have found truth that I never knew before,‚Äù she told them sim-
ply. ‚ÄúAnd I am learning how to properly raise my family.‚Äù
   Pamela and her children joined the nearest Adventist church, which was
three miles (five kilometers) from her home. Then she learned that the charis-
matic church to which she had belonged had abandoned the mud-brick
church they had built on her land.
   Pamela invited the church leaders to hold Branch Sabbath School in the
abandoned building, and the church accepted her offer.
   When Pamela‚Äôs friends from her former church ask her questions about
why she left, she shares with them new truths she has learned and invites
them to worship in the new Adventist church‚Äîtheir former building. So far
three of her friends have joined the Adventist group that worships in the mud-
brick church.
   The little congregation of 25 met in the mud-brick church for a year before
it deteriorated to where it was no longer safe. The church members decided
                               to rebuild with more permanent materials.
                                  Pamela sells porridge and buns that she
                               makes to provide for her children. Her home is
                               poor, but she shares with those in need when
                               she can. When her friends laugh at her poor
                               house, she smiles and tells them, ‚ÄúMy God is
                               my husband and my provider. He is so good to
                               my family; I cannot thank Him enough.‚Äù
                                  Your mission offerings reach searching hearts
                               like Pamela around the world. Thank you.

      Discipleship




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Exod. 18:13‚Äì27, Matt.
      4:19, 9:9, Mark 3:13‚Äì19, 8:31‚Äì38, Rom. 8:18.

Memory Text: ‚Äú ‚ÄòThis is to my Father‚Äôs glory, that you bear much
      fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples‚Äô ‚Äù (John 15:8, NIV).

           t is important that we use our intellectual capacities to grasp as

      I    much as is humanly possible of what God has revealed to us. Yet,
           perfect knowledge of all doctrine is not a prerequisite for salva-
      tion. We are, though, commanded to do all the things that we have
      been instructed to do. To be a disciple is to be a lifelong learner and
      follower of the Master.
         What is a disciple? The SDA Bible Dictionary defines it, basically,
      as ‚Äúone who, as a student or adherent, follows the teaching of another,
      especially of a public teacher. In the NT ‚Äòdisciple‚Äô is the translation of
      the Gr. mathe‚Äìte‚Äìs . . . which is related to manthan‚Äìo, ‚Äòto learn,‚Äô hence
      means ‚Äòa learner,‚Äô ‚Äòa pupil,‚Äô ‚Äòan adherent.‚Äô ‚Äù‚ÄîPage 288. Let‚Äôs look a
      little closer at what it means to be a disciple.

The Week at a Glance: A disciple is a lifelong learner.
      When Christ calls us, we are to follow, wherever He leads and no
      matter the suffering involved, for it will involve suffering if for no
      other reason than it must involve sacrifice. In human terms the
      rewards for discipleship seem rather meager. But when the true
      dimension of life in Christ is discovered, we realize it‚Äôs worth suf-
      fering for, no matter the cost here and now.

     Followers and Leaders
Read Exodus 18:13‚Äì27. What principles of leadership can be found
     in these verses? What can we learn from them about leaders and
     followers?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Although all people are fundamentally equal in the eyes of God,
     there are major differences in the manner in which they function.
     Some have the gift of leadership. Our society, and every organization
     within society, would soon collapse if there were no leaders. Even in
     heaven there appears to be a distinct differentiation in roles: There are,
     for instance, angels and archangels! When God called His people out
     of Egypt, He appointed leaders. When He organized a sanctuary serv-
     ice, He made sure there would be adequate leadership. God worked
     through judges, prophets, kings, and so on.
        But leaders are useless without followers who are willing to accept
     their leadership. In particular, they need a group of close associates
     who are willing to learn from their leader and to assist in the realiza-
     tion of the goals of their leader.

Jesus called 12 disciples. Read Mark 3:13‚Äì19 for a condensed ver-
     sion of His selection of 12 men. What other examples of teachers
     who surrounded themselves with disciples do we find in a Gospel
     story? See Mark 2:18.


       There was nothing extraordinary in the fact that Jesus had a group
     of disciples. It was customary for teachers to have a following of
     ‚Äúinterns.‚Äù What was remarkable, however, were the kind of men Jesus
     chose. Jesus saw a potential in these men that most of us would not
     have discerned! What also is remarkable was their instant willingness
     to leave their daily business and follow this Carpenter from Nazareth.
     They apparently saw something extraordinary in this Man that even
     most of His own relatives had not discovered yet.
       It should, however, be noted that although the Twelve are a very spe-
     cial group, there are also many others referred to in the Gospels as
     ‚Äúdisciples.‚Äù

      There tends to be in some societies an antileadership attitude;
      in contrast, in some societies people all but blindly follow their
      leaders. What‚Äôs the tendency in your society, and how do you
      strike a proper balance?

                                                                           81

     Marks of Discipleship: Obedience and
     Loyalty
        Jesus did not just share knowledge with His disciples, although it
     must have been a tremendous privilege to constantly hear Jesus
     explain the Scriptures and answer the numerous questions with which
     the spiritual leaders of His day bombarded Him. They quickly noticed
     what others also perceived. He taught with an authority that surpassed
     the scholars of His day. He separated lifeless traditions from the real-
     life issues that God‚Äôs Word addresses. However, there was more the
     disciples needed to learn. They also needed to learn to make their own
     will and desires subject to the will of the Almighty.

What principles of discipleship can we find in the following texts?
     Matt. 4:19, 9:9, Mark 8:34.


        ‚ÄúYes, follow Him through evil as well as through good report.
     Follow Him in befriending the most needy and friendless. Follow Him
     in being forgetful of self, abundant in acts of self-denial and self-
     sacrifice to do others good; when reviled, reviling not again; mani-
     festing love and compassion for the fallen race. He counted not His
     life dear, but gave it up for us all. Follow Him from the lowly manger
     to the cross. He was our example.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, Testimonies for
     the Church, vol. 2, p. 178.

How did Peter react when many followers deserted Jesus? John
     6:60‚Äì70.


       Not all disciples stayed with Jesus. Many turned away. Peter spoke
     for the disciples when declaring their allegiance. With the exception
     of Judas, they eventually did prove to be faithful followers, and they
     became leaders in the early church, even though they had moments of
     grave doubt and disillusionment when their Master was taken prisoner
     and crucified. Their experience gives us great comfort. Many of us
     have had moments when our resolve to be disciples was at low tide,
     but as in the case of the apostles, this does not mean that we cannot
     overcome our temporary lapse.

      If someone were to ask you, ‚ÄúHow loyal are you to Jesus?‚Äù how
      would you respond, and why? What outward evidences do you
      give of your loyalty to Him?

      Sacrifice
        Most of us like to be with important people. Meeting a head of state
      or a government minister or a celebrity provides us with a much-
      coveted conversation topic. Knowing someone important, or even
      knowing someone who knows someone important, somehow seems to
      endow us with a halo of glory. It seems a natural desire to climb up
      the social ladder rather than remain near its base. Jesus‚Äô disciples were
      no exception to this unfortunate human trait.

How did some disciples (and their relatives) hope that following Jesus
      would enhance their status? What was Jesus‚Äô reply? Matt.
      20:20‚Äì23, Mark 10:35‚Äì41. What does this attitude remind you of?
      Isa. 14:12‚Äì14.


      Rather than promising His disciples material prosperity and social sta-
      tus, Jesus prepared them for a different kind of reality: Following Him
      is a costly business.

Read Mark 8:31‚Äì38. What do you learn in this passage about the cost
      of discipleship?


         In his famous book The Cost of Discipleship, Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
      the young German theologian who was martyred by the Nazis in 1945,
      emphasizes that divine grace does not come cheap. And following
      Christ is not an easy thing to do. It inevitably will involve suffering.
      Just as Christ said that He ‚Äúmust suffer,‚Äù so must we. If we want to
      identify with Him in His life, we must also do so in His suffering and
      death. ‚ÄúTo endure the cross is not a tragedy; it is the suffering which
      is the fruit of an exclusive allegiance to Jesus Christ. When it comes,
      it is not an accident, but a necessity. . . . Only a man . . . totally com-
      mitted in discipleship can experience the meaning of the cross. The
      cross is there, right from the beginning, or he has only got to pick it
      up; there is no need for him to go out and look for a cross for himself,
      no need for him deliberately to run after suffering. Jesus says that
      every Christian has his own cross waiting for him, a cross destined
      and appointed by God.‚Äù‚ÄîDietrich Bonhoeffer, The Cost of
      Discipleship (New York: The MacMillan Company, 1965), p. 98.

        What is the cross that God has given you to bear? What has fol-
       lowing Christ cost you? If your answer is ‚ÄúNothing, really,‚Äù
       maybe you need to take a closer look at how closely you are fol-
       lowing the Master.


                                                                             83

     The Rewards of Discipleship
       Jesus left His disciples with no doubt that following Him would
     require sacrifice. He was totally up front with them in regard to what
     they should expect.

What did Jesus promise as far as immediate or short-term reward for
     following Him as a disciple? Luke 9:57, 58; John 15:18‚Äì25. What
     specific ‚Äúpromise‚Äù did Jesus have for Peter? John 21:15‚Äì18. What
     does this tell us about the cost of following Christ?


       The disciples, except Judas, eventually became the apostles. From
     the first chapters of the book of Acts, it is clear that these men had
     learned many lessons. They had been with Jesus, and now, with the
     power of the Spirit, they were able to deal with opposition and perse-
     cution. Although we cannot be sure about the details, there is good
     reason to believe the strong traditions from the early church era which
     say that all apostles eventually suffered martyrdom. All supposedly
     suffered a violent death, except John, but his imprisonment on Patmos
     was not a luxurious vacation either. He also was a ‚Äúbrother and com-
     panion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are
     ours in Jesus‚Äù (Rev. 1:9, NIV).

What aspect of discipleship outweighs all suffering that might come
     our way as we follow Christ? John 10:10, Rom. 8:28‚Äì39.


        Those who follow Christ will face numerous challenges. If they stay
     focused on their Master, they will be able to deal with whatever hap-
     pens. They will have something that is precious beyond words. He
     gives them His peace, which is unlike the imperfect and transient kind
     of peace the world offers (John 14:27). It is the peace that transcends
     all understanding (Phil. 4:7). That peace is the hallmark of the abun-
     dant life that Christ gives to His disciples (John 10:10). In spite of all
     trials and temptations, this is the kind of life that satisfies at a level
     beyond the reach of those who choose to live without Christ.
        And yet, even more so, faithful followers of Christ have the assur-
     ance of eternal life, the assurance that whatever they struggle with
     now can‚Äôt be compared with the promise of eternity that awaits them.

      Read Romans 8:18. What hope and comfort can you draw from
      this promise for yourself? Why should it tell you to never, never
      give up?

     The Lordship of Jesus Christ
       Being a disciple implies the recognition of having a master, of alle-
     giance to someone we are willing to follow and serve. Our relation-
     ship to others usually finds expression in the manner in which we
     address them.

What was one of the titles given to Christ by His followers? John
     20:28, 1 Cor. 16:22.


        The New Testament uses a variety of names for Jesus. He is called ‚Äúthe
     Son of God‚Äù but also ‚Äúthe Son of Man‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Messiah.‚Äù Hundreds of
     times Jesus is referred to as ‚Äúthe Lord.‚Äù This word, which initially was
     quite general in its application, became a highly significant term for the
     early Christians. The Roman emperor claimed divinity and wanted to be
     addressed as ‚Äúthe Lord.‚Äù To confess that Christ was their ultimate Lord
     rather than the Roman Caesar was not just expressing an opinion. It lit-
     erally could be a matter of life or death. Those who lived in the Roman
     realm should only have one Kyrios (lord), and to apply this title to any
     person other than the emperor could well end in torture and death.
        Thus, it required faith and dedicated discipleship to call Jesus
     ‚ÄúLord.‚Äù But today it also is no small thing to call Jesus our Lord and
     truly mean it. If He is our Lord, He is the Sovereign over our whole
     life, over all that we say and do.

What is the key element that reveals how genuine we are in calling
     Jesus ‚ÄúLord‚Äù? Matt 7:22, 23; Luke 6:46.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       It‚Äôs one thing to call Jesus our Lord and our God and to profess
     faith, love, and allegiance to Him. It‚Äôs quite another to truly live it.
     Jesus was clear: Our fidelity to Him will be manifested by our obedi-
     ence to Him and to His commands. In fact, the word for ‚Äúiniquity‚Äù in
     Matthew 7:23 means ‚Äúlawlessness.‚Äù No question, a true follower of
     Jesus, a true disciple, will obey His commandments (John 14:15).

      Try to imagine how different our church would be if everyone
      who professed to follow Christ were truly disciples of Jesus.
      What differences would we see? While you can‚Äôt change others,
      what difference could you make were your life one of true con-
      formity to Jesus‚Äô will?

                                                                           85

    Further Study: For comments on the calling of the disciples, read
          Ellen G. White, ‚Äú ‚ÄòWe Have Found the Messias,‚Äô ‚Äù pp. 132‚Äì143, in The
          Desire of Ages.
             ‚ÄúIt was not enough for the disciples of Jesus to be instructed as to
          the nature of His kingdom. What they needed was a change of heart
          that would bring them into harmony with its principles. Calling a lit-
          tle child to Him, Jesus set him in the midst of them; then tenderly fold-
1
          ing the little one in His arms He said, ‚ÄòExcept ye be converted, and
          become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
          heaven.‚Äô The simplicity, the self-forgetfulness, and the confiding love
          of a little child are the attributes that Heaven values. These are the
          characteristics of real greatness.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Desire of
          Ages, p. 437.

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè
           1 As a class, go over the question of what it costs to be a true fol-
           lower of Christ. Ask those who are willing to discuss it, what it
           costs them to follow the Lord. Ask, too, why they believe it is
           worth it.

3
           ‚óè2 What can we do to help the new believers among us become
           better disciples of Christ? Why is being a disciple so much more
           than just intellectually consenting to a number of doctrines, or
           even more than believing that Jesus died for your sins?

           ‚óè3 We are called to be disciples of Jesus. But on the human level,
           we also have role models. Is it legitimate to consider ourselves
           also disciples of a human leader we respect and consider a role
           model? If so, how could we do this while at the same time not for-
           getting to whom we owe our ultimate allegiance?

           ‚óè
           4 How can we fight the sinful human desire for more self-glory,
           more adulation, more power and prestige? Why are such desires
           so contrary to all that it means to be a disciple of Christ?

    Summary: To be a disciple of Christ is no small thing. It requires a lot of
       conviction and stamina and a willingness to follow the Lord, regard-
       less of the suffering involved. To be a disciple of Christ means to live
       by faith, to trust God even in the hardest of times. It means to be will-
       ing to die to self and live for the good of others and for the glory of
       God.

The Kettle Failed Not
by RUSS DAWIS
   A colleague and I climbed the mountains of Southern Mindanao in the
Philippines to survey a possible site that a tribal chief had donated for an
Adventist high school for the Higaonan people. While in the area, we were
invited to stay in the home of Pangga Landagan.
   The man received us warmly, made us comfortable, and offered us food.
I knew the family wasn‚Äôt well-to-do and asked why he felt so generous
toward the SULADS missionaries.
   ‚ÄúIt is my blessing and joy to take care of you,‚Äù our host said. ‚ÄúFor when
we care for His children, God blesses us even more abundantly.‚Äù Then he
explained his remark. ‚ÄúWhen two SULADS missionary teachers came to
the village, they seemed shy and hesitant to visit the homes in the village.
I knew that their small stipend would not be enough to buy food, so my
wife and I invited them to eat with us so that they would have good food
while they worked for our people.
   ‚ÄúOne day we had just enough rice for one meal for two people. But our mis-
sionaries hadn‚Äôt eaten that day, so I whispered to my wife, Let‚Äôs feed the mis-
sionaries first. She agreed and cooked the rice and served the missionaries.
   ‚ÄúWhile they ate I slipped out to look for food, but I came back empty-
handed and hungry. I checked the kettle in the kitchen, expecting only a
handful of leftovers. To my surprise, the kettle was full!
   ‚ÄúI whispered to my wife, ‚ÄòHaven‚Äôt you fed the missionaries yet?‚Äô
   ‚Äú ‚ÄòYes, they‚Äôve eaten,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòAnd I‚Äôve eaten too.‚Äô
   ‚Äú ‚ÄòBut the kettle‚Äôs full!‚Äô I said.
   ‚Äú ‚ÄòThat can‚Äôt be!‚Äô my wife protested. I showed her the kettle, still full of
rice. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs an Elijah miracle,‚Äô I whispered.
   ‚ÄúTogether we thanked God for providing for our needs and those of the
missionaries too. The constant rain made it impossible for our missionary
guests to leave for the next village as they had planned, so that evening my
wife reheated the rice and we ate from the full pot. Again we let them eat
first, and then I looked at the pot. It was still full!
   ‚ÄúIn the morning the kettle was still full, and again my wife reheated it
for breakfast before the missionaries left on their journey.
   ‚ÄúFrom that day on, I see that any visitor in our village receives the best we
can offer. And as always we see that our food containers and kettle fail not.‚Äù
   ‚ÄúThose who seek the Lord lack no good thing‚Äù (Psalm 34:10, NIV). As
we support world mission with our offerings, we will see that God will
provide all our needs.

      Stewardship




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Deut. 8:18; Ps. 50:12;
      Matt. 24:46; 25:14‚Äì30; Luke 4:16; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

Memory Text: ‚Äú ‚ÄòEveryone who has will be given more, and he
      will have an abundance‚Äô ‚Äù (Matthew 25:29, NIV).

            tewardship is not limited to caring for financial resources and to

      S     making sure that God gets His 10 percent. Though that‚Äôs cer-
            tainly part of it, so much more is involved.
         ‚ÄúThe term steward is misunderstood and even foreign in our soci-
      ety. We do not have any terms in our modern vocabulary that carry the
      richness of this term. Caretaker fails to capture the responsibility laid
      on the steward. Manager seems inadequate to describe the relation-
      ship between the owner and the steward. Custodian is too passive a
      term. Agent is too self-serving in our day. Ambassador is too political,
      and it lacks the servant aspect. Warden is too administrative and loses
      the sense of the personal. Guardian is too closely tied solely to
      parental responsibilities.‚Äù‚ÄîR. Scott Rodin, Stewards in the Kingdom
      (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 2000), p. 27.

The Week at a Glance: How do I use my talents, my time,
      my material resources, all the things that God has given me stew-
      ardship over? How do I truly live my responsibilities toward my
      Maker and Redeemer? This is what stewardship is all about.

     Talents
       If there were a prize given for the clearest explanation of an all-
     encompassing profound concept, Jesus would have easily won it with
     His parable of the talents.

Read Matthew 25:14‚Äì30. What basic message about stewardship do
     you take from Jesus‚Äô words here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Reality number one: We all have talents. Note in the parable that all
     the servants receive one or more talents. No one is left without some
     talent. That is the first truth Jesus wanted to impress upon His disci-
     ples.
        Reality number two: We do not all have the same number of talents.
     It is a fact of life that we will have to accept. Some people are gifted
     in many ways while others are not so multitalented. Those who have
     several talents should never look down upon others who have fewer
     talents. Jesus‚Äô point is clear: The quantity of our talents is not the most
     important; what we do with whatever we have been given is what mat-
     ters.
        Reality number three: Some refuse to use their talents. Some never
     recognize the talents they have. Sadly, no one reminded them of their
     gifts. Or they did realize their gifts but, for a variety of reasons,
     refused to invest any energy in developing them.
        Reality number four: Not using your talents is a serious business.
     The ‚Äúworthless servant‚Äù gets no second chance. He is thrown ‚Äú ‚Äò ‚Äúinto
     the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth‚Äù ‚Äô ‚Äù
     (Matt. 25:30, NIV)‚Äîthe symbolic description of the utter nothingness
     of eternal death. Not using what God has entrusted to us not only
     impairs us in this life but jeopardizes our eternal life. This means that
     the issue of being faithful stewards is not something that belongs to
     the periphery of our Christian experience‚Äîit is the vital characteris-
     tic of discipleship.

      What are your gifts? Even more important, what are you doing
      with them? Are you using them to serve only yourself and your
      own desires, or are you using them also in service to the Lord?
      Why is this question so important?




                                                                            89

     Time
        There is a plethora of books and courses on the subject of time man-
     agement. They have helped millions of people make better use of their
     time. Many Christians would do well to read some of these books or
     attend a good seminar. But there are aspects to a Christian use of time
     that one will learn only by reading the Bible and, in particular, by
     studying the life of Jesus.

What do we learn from the Gospels about Jesus‚Äô use of His time?
     What are some of the elements to be noted, apart from His busy
     schedule of preaching and healing? What other passages can add
     further information?

     Matt. 4:23_______________________________________________

     Mark 1:29‚Äì31____________________________________________

     Luke 4:16_______________________________________________

     John 2:1‚Äì11_____________________________________________

     John 12:2_______________________________________________

        In today‚Äôs stressful world, the example of Jesus is as refreshing as it
     is worth imitating. Jesus worked hard and was fully committed to His
     mission. But He made sure that He did not miss the blessings of the
     Sabbath. The Gospels make it abundantly clear that He had time for
     His Father, for His friends, for relaxation, and for a good meal. This
     type of time management (or rather, time stewardship) will prove a
     blessing for all who practice it.
        The Bible does not praise workaholics, nor does it have any com-
     mendations for those who always take it easy. As always, there is a bal-
     ance, one in which we get done the things we need to get done, while
     at the same time we don‚Äôt burn ourselves out emotionally or physi-
     cally. God has the first claim on our time. We manifest this in our
     keeping of the Sabbath and our daily time for prayer and worship. Our
     loved ones also are entitled to a fair share of our time. Then there is
     time for work, for leisure, and for a host of other things. The church
     also claims a substantial part of our time. But there must always be a
     balance so that we don‚Äôt fall into one trap or another.

      Where do you lean, toward doing not enough or toward doing
      too much? How can you live a more balanced life in regard to
      the stewardship of your time? Why is it important that you do?

      Stewards of Our Body
         In the secular world, most people regard their bodies as their own
      property. They have total say over what happens to it. This applies not
      only to vast numbers of women who claim that they should be free to
      decide whether or not they will have an abortion but also to all who
      feel they have the right to harm their bodies by the use of illegal sub-
      stances or by eating large quantities of junk food or by having sexual
      relationships with as many partners as they choose.

Read and pray over 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. What do these verses tell
      us about how we use our bodies? What are practical ways we can
      put these words into effect?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The immediate context indicates that the apostle Paul was, in par-
      ticular, referring to the abuse of our body through sexual immorality.
      Unfortunately, this is as relevant today in many parts of the world as
      it was in ancient Corinth, a city known for its perversities.
         But the basic idea is that we should not ‚Äúsin against our body,‚Äù
      because we are not our own. First, we have been created by God
      through Jesus Christ. He is our Maker, and we therefore are responsi-
      ble to Him for all we do. Second, He is our Redeemer, the One who
      has bought us ‚Äúat a price.‚Äù
         Stewardship of our bodies implies taking good care of our health,
      too. It has to do not only with what we eat but also with the amount of
      rest we take and with keeping fit through adequate exercise. And there
      can be no question of using substances that are addictive or otherwise
      harmful.
         Yet, again, there is need for balance. ‚ÄúHealth itself is not to be a pre-
      occupation. It should be a part of the Christian pattern of life and
      rather automatic in operation. An overriding preoccupation with
      health can be a form of idolatry that gets in the way of a satisfying
      relationship with God. Health is to enable service to God, but is not an
      end in itself.‚Äù‚ÄîLeo R. Van Dolson and J. Robert Spangler, Healthy,
      Happy, Holy (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald¬Æ Publishing
      Association, 1975), p. 43.

       Take a good look at all your health habits, not just diet. What do
       you need to improve on? What changes can and should you
       make? What holds you back from doing what you know is
       right?

                                                                              91

     Our Material Possessions
       Christian stewardship is emphatically not just about money. But,
     just as emphatically, it also is about money. Money is an essential part
     of our lives and does play a central role in stewardship.

Read the following texts: Lev. 27:30, Deut. 8:18, Ps. 50:12, Mal.
     3:8‚Äì10, Matt. 6:31, Matt. 23:23. What lessons do you draw from
     them? Compare your answers with what follows below.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Fact number one: Everything begins with God. God owns every-
     thing. And He gives us the strength to work and make a living. Those
     who say, ‚ÄúIt is all my own hard work,‚Äù forget a vital truth, which is that
     it was God alone who enabled them to earn what they did.
         Fact number two: God takes first place in all we have and do,
     including our use of money. Before you spend any part of your money,
     make sure you have set aside your tithes and offerings. Then spend the
     rest responsibly, always aware that stewardship extends to the use of
     whatever money you have been entrusted with.
        Fact number three: God expects His people to return to Him at least
     10 percent of their wealth. That was the rule in the Old Testament, and
     that principle has never been rescinded. In Old Testament times the
     tithes were received by the priests and used for the support of the sanc-
     tuary services. Likewise, today our tithes are received and used for
     financing the worldwide gospel commission that God has entrusted to
     His church.
        Fact number four: The more we give, the more we are blessed. Try
     it, and you‚Äôll see for yourself the truth of the words that ‚Äú ‚Äòit is more
     blessed to give than to receive‚Äô ‚Äù (Acts 20:35, NIV).

      There‚Äôs an old English saying, ‚ÄúLet him put his money where his
      mouth is.‚Äù The idea is that people can talk about how much they
      believe in something, but unless they are willing to put some of
      their money into it, the talk is meaningless. How does the act of
      giving tithes and offerings reveal where our heart really is?
      What does your giving reveal about your faith?

     While We Are Waiting
        There is an important dimension in the parables about the talents and
     the pounds that we must not miss. In Matthew 25 ‚Äúthe master‚Äù (vs. 19,
     NIV) went on an extensive journey and returned after a long time to set-
     tle the accounts with His servants. In Luke 19 we are told that the ‚Äú ‚Äòman
     of noble birth‚Äô ‚Äù (vs. 12, NIV) went to a distant country. While on His
     mission, He was made King and then ‚Äúreturned home‚Äù (vs. 15, NIV).
        Jesus clearly referred to Himself. He wanted His disciples to know
     that He was going away and that it would take a while before He
     would come back. But when He returns He will ask for an account of
     what was done with what we have been given.

What should characterize our waiting for the second coming of
     Christ? Matt. 24:42‚Äì46. What do these verses mean for us in the
     practical sense of how we live?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       While we wait, we live with a purpose. It is not a waiting in idleness,
     but we wait as dedicated disciples who are keen stewards over all we
     have been given. ‚ÄúWe are to be vigilant, watching for the coming of the
     Son of man; and we must also be diligent; working as well as waiting is
     required; there must be a union of the two. This will balance the
     Christian character, making it well developed, symmetrical. We should
     not feel that we are to neglect everything else, and give ourselves up to
     meditation, study, or prayer; neither are we to be full of bustle and hurry
     and work, to the neglect of personal piety. Waiting and watching and
     working are to be blended. ‚ÄòNot slothful in business; fervent in spirit;
     serving the Lord.‚Äô ‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 23.
       We are waiting for the Owner of everything to return. Soon He will
     come and will want to know what we have done with our gifts, our
     time, our physical strength, and our material resources. The fact that
     He comes to inspect the results of our faithful stewardship should not
     in any way frighten us. The accusation of the servant who had buried
     his talent and refused to employ it usefully, that the master was a ‚Äúhard
     man‚Äù who wanted to harvest where he had not sown, was totally false.
     Note that the servants who had been faithful stewards did not share
     this negative view. Every effort they had put into their stewardship
     assignment was fully worth it when they heard their master say,
     ‚ÄúCome and share your master‚Äôs happiness‚Äù (Matt. 25:21, NIV).

      If Jesus came back next week, what do you think He would say
      to you regarding what you have done in the past week with the
      things He entrusted to you?
                                                                            93

    Further Study: A mine for further explorations on the topic of
          stewardship is the compilation Counsels on Stewardship, in which
          Ellen G. White‚Äôs comments on this issue have been assembled. See, in
          particular, Section VIII, which deals with the right motives for giving
          (pp. 195‚Äì206).
             ‚ÄúThe Lord will not require from those who are poor that which they
          have not to give; He will not require from the sick the active energies
          which bodily weakness forbids. No one need mourn because he can-
1
          not glorify God with talents that were never entrusted to him. But if
          you have only one talent, use it well, and it will accumulate. If the tal-
          ents are not buried, they will gain yet other talents.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen. G. White
          Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1100.

    Discussion Questions:
2
           ‚óè
           1 How are we to understand the whole question of stewardship
           and accountability to God in the context of salvation by faith
           alone? Are we saved by what good stewards we are? Or does our
           stewardship reveal the reality of our faith? And even if we make
           mistakes here, why should we not give up in despair?

           ‚óè2 What‚Äôs wrong with what‚Äôs been dubbed the ‚Äúhealth and

3
           wealth gospel,‚Äù the idea that if you live right, God will give you
           lots of money and good health? How is this a perversion of true
           principles of stewardship?

           ‚óè
           3 Discuss the following statement: ‚ÄúThe greatest, most gifted
           people are useless if they don‚Äôt make themselves available to be
           used by God. In short, availability is more important than abil-
           ity.‚Äù‚ÄîMike Nappa, The Courage to Be a Christian (West Monroe,
           La.: Howard Publishing Co., 2001), p. 164.

           ‚óè4 What advice do you give to a church member who, struggling
           through hard financial times, says that he or she just can‚Äôt afford
           to pay tithe, much less give offerings? What various approaches
           could or should be taken with this person?

    Summary: We all have been given one or more talents. We have been
       entrusted with resources. As stewards we are expected to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù
       these resources to the best of our ability, in grateful recognition that
       all we have, in fact, comes from God. Stewardship should not be a
       hard duty but a joyful prioritizing in all aspects of our lives.

From Shopkeeper to Shepherd
Told to JOHN K. MCGHEE by RAM*
   I am Ram.* I live in the Himalayan region of northern India. I was doing
pretty well running a little shop in the mountains. I earned enough money
to keep my parents fed. But I sensed that something was missing from my
life. I was sure that there was more to life than working, eating, and sleep-
ing. I looked forward to the day when I would marry and have children,
but often I wondered, Will a family fill the void in my life?
   I love to read, and I‚Äôve studied the mystics and various philosophies, try-
ing to understand the cosmos. But I sensed that I was missing something.
Then one day I bought a book that cost just four rupees (about 10 cents
US). As I read it, I discovered it was the most valuable book in my library.
The book was full of exciting stories and told me how the world began. It
described a God unlike any I had ever known.
   I told friends about this marvelous book, the Bible. But few had ever
heard of it. However, some of my more educated friends urged me to stop
reading it immediately. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a book for foreigners,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThey try to
force people to change religions.‚Äù
   Curious, I decided to find out for myself if their accusations were true.
I asked around and learned that no missionaries lived in our town. Then
one day some strangers walked past my store. I asked one if he was a mis-
sionary.
   ‚ÄúYes, I am,‚Äù he replied. He introduced himself as Pastor Ravi.* I told
him that I was searching for the truth about reality. And although he lived
in another mountain valley several miles away, he offered to return so we
could talk about the truth. Pastor Ravi came often to see me and soon
became my teacher and my friend.
   I was eager to share with others what Pastor Ravi was teaching me, so
as soon as I could I closed my shop and shared what I was learning with
my family and neighbors. I told Pastor Ravi that I wished I could share the
wonderful truths he was teaching me with others. He has provided me with
a small stipend so I can close my shop and learn how to make disciples for
my new friend Jesus. I am now shepherding a small group of new believ-
ers in a nearby village.
   Your mission offerings have brought God‚Äôs Word to my village. Thank
you! Now I share that wonderful message with everyone I meet.

        LESSON            12 *June 13‚Äì19
      Community




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Gen. 11:1‚Äì4, 12:1‚Äì3,
      1 Cor. 12:12‚Äì27, Eph. 4:1‚Äì13, Rev. 22:1‚Äì6.

Memory Text: ‚ÄúNow you are the body of Christ, and each one
      of you is a part of it‚Äù (1 Corinthians 12:27, NIV).

              umans are social beings. God could have created a hundred

      H       million perfect human beings as ‚Äústand alones‚Äù who would
              each pursue his or her own independent goals. Instead, He first
      created one male and one female and stated that it would not be good
      for man to be alone. The first couple was to complement each other.
      And they were to multiply and create a community of family members
      and eventually larger social units.
         One of the most important social units to which people can belong
      is their church. Unfortunately, many people no longer recognize the
      social benefits of church membership. Of course, the church is more
      than a club for men and women who happen to share a certain inter-
      est. The church is a community of believers who share in the ultimate
      experience of salvation and recognize Christ as their Lord.

The Week at a Glance: Believing and belonging are
      closely linked. God wants us to be part of the community that He
      has initiated. It is a privilege to belong to that community, but it
      also carries responsibilities. We all have our unique contribution
      to make to the body of Christ.

     God Wants a People
        In Genesis 11 we find the record of an experiment in community
     building that did not meet with God‚Äôs approval. When, after the world-
     wide Flood, the descendants of the original survivors decided to stick
     together and build a city with a huge tower in the southern part of what
     is now Iraq, God was extremely displeased. This was not what God
     had intended. Yet, in the following chapter‚ÄîGenesis 12‚Äîthe idea of
     community building is once again brought into focus, but now in a
     very positive sense. God told Abraham (who at that time was still
     called Abram) that He wanted to form a people whom He would call
     His own.

What was the major difference between the Tower of Babel initiative
     at community building and God‚Äôs plan to make Abraham and his
     posterity into His people? Compare Gen. 11:1‚Äì4 with Gen. 12:1‚Äì3.

     ____________________________________________________________________

       From the story of the calling of Abraham onward, the Old Testament
     centers on the experiences of the people of God, their failures and
     their triumphs. The people of Israel had the mission of making their
     covenant-God known to all other nations. They were to prepare the
     way for the coming of the Messiah. We know how, as a people, Israel
     failed to accomplish its task. When the Messiah came, He was
     rejected and killed as a criminal by certain leaders who should have
     welcomed Him as their Redeemer. At the same time, many remained
     faithful to the Lord and formed the nucleus of what was to become the
     Christian church.

Read 1 Peter 2:9, 10. What‚Äôs the message to us today?


       God‚Äôs New Testament people consist of Jews and Gentiles, of men
     and women from every nation, tribe, and linguistic group. Like Israel
     in Old Testament times, they now have the responsibility of teaching
     others about divine grace. Like Israel of old, they, too, belong to a spe-
     cial community of believers.

      What parallels can you draw between ancient Israel and the
      church of today? What lessons should we learn from them?
      What mistakes should we avoid?



                                                                           97

     The Privilege of Belonging
        Laurence J. Peter, an American educator and author, once said,
     ‚ÄúGoing to church doesn‚Äôt make you a Christian any more than going
     to the garage makes you a car!‚Äù Truly belonging to Christ‚Äôs church is
     more than having one‚Äôs name on the church‚Äôs record book. It implies
     a realization of what the church is and of one‚Äôs own role in the church.
        In numerous places Paul refers to fellow believers as saints (Eph.
     1:1, Phil. 1:1, Col. 1:2). This word has today acquired a meaning that
     it did not have in Bible times. Saints are not perfect or holy people;
     they certainly are not people who have been declared to be ‚Äúsaints‚Äù
     after a long and complex ecclesiastical procedure long after they die.
     ‚ÄúFor Paul [and for other Bible writers], the term saint had none of the
     stained-glass window connotations that it has for us. A saint was not
     some ancient, larger-than-life, perfect Christian, but anyone called
     and set apart by God who became part of the community of faith.‚Äù
     ‚ÄîJohn C. Brunt, Romans, The Abundant Life Bible Amplifier (Boise,
     Idaho: Pacific Press¬Æ Publishing Association, 1996), p. 42.

What major role is given to those who belong to the church‚Äîthe
     ‚Äúbody of Christ‚Äù? How should each ‚Äúsaint‚Äù relate to all others?
     1 Cor. 12:12‚Äì27.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        A church member is not to be reduced to a statistic. Every member
     of the church has a unique role to play and a particular contribution to
     make. No one can be missed without causing at least a measure of
     dysfunction of the body. At the same time, no member can claim that
     his or her contribution is far superior to that of someone else. The
     metaphor of the body with its many members sublimely illustrates this
     truth. Some parts appear to be more vital than others. The heart, the
     brain, the lungs, and the stomach may seem among the most promi-
     nent parts, but the functioning or malfunctioning of some minor gland
     often also proves to be a matter of life and death.

      How do you fit in with your local body? Are you content with
      the role you play? Are you jealous of someone else‚Äôs role? Are
      you a dead, lifeless organ? Or maybe you are trying to take on
      more than you need? How can Paul‚Äôs words help you better
      understand what your role should be?

      The Responsibility of Belonging
        Belonging to the body of Christ is a great privilege. Another figure
      of speech underlines this great truth: We all are part of God‚Äôs family.
      ‚ÄúHow great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should
      be called children of God!‚Äù (1 John 3:1, NIV). But privileges always
      are accompanied by responsibilities.

What does the image of the church as the body of Christ, and of each
      of us being members of that body, imply as far as our personal
      responsibilities are concerned? Eph. 4:1‚Äì13.


        ‚ÄúAll must move like parts of a well-adjusted machinery, each part
      dependent on the other part, yet standing distinct in action. And each
      one is to take the place assigned him and do the work appointed him.
      God calls upon the members of His church to receive the Holy Spirit,
      to come together in unity and brotherly sympathy, to bind their inter-
      ests together in love.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, My Life Today, p. 276.

What are some other key responsibilities for all church members?
      1 Cor. 16:2; 1 Thess. 5:14, 17, 25; Heb. 10:25; 1 Pet. 3:15.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Many people live in consumer societies and, as a result, tend to
      bring this consumer mentality into their church. The first question
      often is, What is in it for me? rather than, How can I contribute with
      my talents and gifts? When John F. Kennedy was inaugurated in 1961
      as president of the United States, he spoke these immortal words:
      ‚Äú ‚ÄòAsk not what your country can do for you‚Äîask what you can do for
      your country.‚Äô ‚Äù These words also are applicable to our attitude toward
      the church. Even though the church can and does do a lot for those
      who faithfully attend and join in its many activities, we should first of
      all constantly ask ourselves, How can I serve better? How can I
      encourage others? How can I be a role model for our youth? How can
      I contribute to making my local church into a spiritual home in which
      many can find the inner peace and nurture they need?

       Ask yourself these questions and honestly look at your answers:
       What is my main motive for going to church? What I can get, or
       what I can give?



                                                                           99

      Unity in Diversity
         Many Christians strive for greater unity among the many denomina-
      tions. They speak of the ‚Äúscandal‚Äù of division and disunity and remind
      us that Christ repeatedly called for unity among His followers. Unity
      also is a key theme for the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which is
      threatened by fragmentation and polarization from within. But the unity
      Adventists seek cannot be reduced to mere organizational unity or uni-
      formity in worship styles and other traditions. It must go much deeper.

What are key qualifications for true Christian unity? John 14:6; Eph.
      4:3, 13.


        To be united in Christ means to be united in the truth. Christ defined
      Himself as the Truth. That is not to say that there cannot be true unity
      between people who differ with regard to certain theological views or
      in the interpretation of certain passages. But true unity does require a
      common commitment to the Scriptures as the Word of God and to its
      fundamental teachings, and a common desire to practice what the Word
      teaches. It does not require, however, that all members think alike and
      worship in exactly the same way. It does not annul the wonderful cul-
      tural diversity that so much enriches our worldwide church community.

How does the description of the New Jerusalem illustrate the rich
      diversity that characterizes God‚Äôs people? Revelation 21 and
      22:1‚Äì6; in particular, 21:12‚Äì14, 19, 26, and 22:2.


        The New Jerusalem refers to something concrete and real that God
      creates for His people, even if the description is highly symbolic.
      What strikes us as we read it is the emphasis on diversity. No wonder,
      because the redeemed will come from ‚Äúevery tribe and language and
      people and nation‚Äù (Rev. 5:9, NIV; cf. Rev. 7:9).
        The peoples who will enter the gates of the New Jerusalem and will
      populate the new earth are like the many branches that issue from the
      same vine. ‚ÄúIn the branches of a vine there is diversity, and yet in this
      diversity there is unity. Every branch is united to the parent stalk.
      Every branch draws its nourishment from the same source. When we
      are branches of the true Vine, there will be no quarreling among us,
      no strife for the supremacy, no disparaging of one another.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G.
      White, General Conference Bulletin, April 25, 1901.

       If there is to be such diversity in heaven, why is there ethnic
       strife in our churches today? Why do we tend to want to con-
       gregate with those of our own ilk as opposed to others? What
       kind of message are we sending by doing this?

     The Church‚Äôs Foundation: Jesus Christ
        We often speak of our church. We have many reasons to be proud of
     our church. On the other hand, we realize that our church is not per-
     fect. We have invested a lot of ourselves, of our talents, time, energy,
     and money in the church and have good reasons to have a clear sense
     of ownership. However, in the final analysis, the church is not ours. It
     is God‚Äôs. And that makes a decisive difference.

What did Christ Himself state in answer to the question about to
     whom the church belongs? Matt. 16:18.


        The statement by Christ about the rock upon which God‚Äôs church was
     to be built has been grossly misunderstood by many. When the full con-
     text and all other biblical evidence is taken into consideration, there is no
     ground for suggesting that Peter was the rock upon whom the church was
     founded and that special authority was transferred from him to the future
     bishops of Rome. Peter‚Äôs confession of Christ as the Son of the living
     God (Matt. 16:16) was the rock upon which God founded His church.

Consider the meaning of some other symbols used to underline the
     same truth, that is, that the church is built on Jesus Christ and
     that it is His church rather than ours. Eph. 2:20; 4:15, 16; Rev.
     1:12‚Äì16, 20.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Like so many passages in the book of Revelation, the description of
     Jesus Christ in 1:12‚Äì20 is full of Old Testament imagery. Christ is pre-
     sented as walking in the midst of seven lampstands, clothed as the High
     Priest. Our mind automatically goes back to the symbol of the lamp-
     stand in the ancient tabernacle that proclaimed God‚Äôs presence among
     His people. Before the book of Revelation goes into detail about ‚Äúwhat
     must soon take place‚Äù (1:1, NIV), it makes sure that we see everything
     from the right perspective. It is the revelation of Jesus Christ, the Alpha
     and the Omega, the First and the Last, our heavenly High Priest, who
     is not some distant, static deity but the One who walks in the midst of
     His church.

      If, ultimately, the church belongs to God, what is our role in it?
      Are we, then, not stewards of it? What kind of responsibilities
      does this place on us? How well are you living up to this respon-
      sibility? What can you do better?

                                                                             101

          believer‚Äôs faith. It is that which Christ Himself has declared to be eter-
1         nal life. But the possession of this knowledge was no ground for self-
          glorification. Through no wisdom or goodness of his own had it been
          revealed to Peter. Never can humanity, of itself, attain to a knowledge
          of the divine. ‚ÄòIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than
          hell; what canst thou know?‚Äô Job 11:8. Only the spirit of adoption can
          reveal to us the deep things of God.‚Äù‚ÄîEllen G. White, The Desire of
2         Ages, p. 412.

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè
           1 Is church membership a necessary condition for salvation? Or
           do we join the church for other reasons? If so, what are they?
           What great advantages do we have being part of a body? At the
           same time, what things must we be careful of and watch out for?

3          ‚óè
           2 Some people say, ‚ÄúI have stopped going to church. When I
           attended, it left me empty. When I go out in nature, I have a
           deeper religious experience than when I listen to an uninterest-
           ing sermon.‚Äù What would you reply to such a person?

           ‚óè
           3 Dwell more on the questions raised in Wednesday‚Äôs lesson
           regarding ethnic diversity in our church. Why, of all people,
           should Christians be the most accepting and loving of others,
           regardless of ethnic differences? What could be done to help us
           better live up to what we know the Lord would have us do regard-
           ing the important question of racial and ethnic harmony?

    Summary: The church is a divine initiative. It is God‚Äôs church rather than
       our church. We are members of the body of Christ‚Äîeach of us with
       our own distinct function‚Äîbut must always remember that He is the
       Head. We are not called to uniformity but must do all we can to main-
       tain true unity in Christ.

Onward Christian Soldiers
by PAUL CLEE
   Tomas Repsys was an officer in the Lithuanian military when he met the
Savior a few years ago. He was touched by the warm fellowship and Bible
teachings of the Adventist Church and felt God urging him to share his
faith with fellow soldiers. But he was unsure how to go about it.
   Repsys studied the Bible and other Christian literature to ground himself
in his faith so that he could answer questions others might ask. But he
found that few people wanted to hear about God. He prayed for wisdom
and for direction regarding those with whom to share his faith.
   After much prayer Repsys was assigned to work in the military head-
quarters, a position he knows that God provided so that he could minister
to those with whom he came in contact.
   He learned of a Christian organization called ECHOS (European
Christians Home Organization for Soldiers) that had just been established.
Its goals were similar to his own, and he joined their group. He began invit-
ing soldiers to lectures on subjects ranging from home and family to per-
sonal health and Christian principles. This opened the door to invite sol-
diers to Bible studies, as well.
   Leaders of ECHOS provided multimedia equipment, Christian books,
Bibles, and a lot of moral support to Repsys as he ministered to those who
came. For moral support he invited church members as well as fellow sol-
diers he knew well. And he shared the lecture series with pastors, laypeo-
ple, and a few fellow soldiers.
   Besides holding lectures and weekly Bible studies, the ECHOS group
organizes outings every second month for the soldiers. They visit historic
locations or places of natural beauty. During the outing Repsys or one of
the other Christian soldiers gives a short worship. As many as 25 soldiers
attend the meetings or go on the outings.
   This outreach provides opportunities to identify soldiers who are open to
spiritual things. Repsys has invited soldiers to his home to talk about God
on a deeper level.
   Military service is short in Lithuania, but through the efforts of Tomas
Repsys and fellow Christians, they are making this time count for Christ in
the lives of young soldiers who often are away from home for the first time.
   Lithuania was once part of the Soviet Union. Today about one thousand
Seventh-day Adventist believers‚Äîor 1 person in every 3,400 Lithuanians‚Äî
worship in 17 churches. Our mission offerings support various outreach pro-
grams in Lithuania and around the world. Thank you for giving.

      Mission




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week‚Äôs Study: Mark 16:15, 16; Luke
      24:46, 47; John 14:6; Eph. 4:11‚Äì15; 2 Pet. 2:1‚Äì3; Rev. 14:6‚Äì12.
Memory Text: ‚ÄúAlways be prepared to give an answer to every-
      one who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.
      But do this with gentleness and respect‚Äù (1 Peter 3:15, NIV).
               ission is not an old-fashioned word associated with tropical

      M        helmets and six-year terms in isolated places around the world.
               The term mission refers to a core aspect of the Christian life.
      ‚ÄúThe words mission and missionary come from Latin words meaning
      send and one sent. . . . The English Bible usually uses the noun apostle,
      which also comes from the Greek word that means one sent. . . . Thirty-
      nine times the Gospel of John says that Jesus was sent by God. Thirty-
      nine times, then, Jesus is defined in that book alone as a missionary
      or apostle.‚Äù‚ÄîJon L. Dybdahl, ‚ÄúMissionary God‚ÄîMissionary Church‚Äù
      in Erich W. Baumgartner, ed., Re-Visioning Adventist Mission in Europe
      (Berrien Springs, Mich.: Andrews University Press, 1998), p. 8.
         We, as followers of Christ, are fellow missionaries with Jesus. As
      He was sent to this world, so we are sent to represent Him and to
      preach the three angels‚Äô messages to every person. The longer we are
      here, however, the greater the danger of our becoming inward-
      focused, seeking to maintain our structures and institutions at the
      expense of what we are called to do, which is to preach to the world
      the present-truth message that God has given us.

The Week at a Glance: Mission is the heart of the church.
      The destiny of people, far and near, is at stake. Mission is not one
      among many programs of the church. It is the very reason for its
      existence. Each Christian is called to be a missionary.

      People Will Be Lost, Unless . . .

         Theologians through the ages have debated whether or not God
      eventually will save all people. Some say God‚Äôs love guarantees that,
      eventually, no one will be lost. Others say that people who have never
      heard of Christ will get an opportunity to come to believe after death.
      Others again defend various alternative theories. The problem with
      theories, however, is that often they try to explain everything when, in
      fact, we must simply be content with what God has revealed to us.
      There are questions to which we do not know the answers. But we
      know that He is totally just in what He does and, at the same time, is
      limitless in His love. He also has made clear that people have a free
      will and that it is possible to be lost. In the end there will be a separa-
      tion between those who are saved and those who will face eternal
      death. And we know also that the gospel must be preached as quickly
      as possible to as many people as possible.

What do the following texts tell us about the importance of preaching
      the gospel to the whole world?

        ‚Ä¢ John 14:6 ___________________________________________

        ‚Ä¢ Acts 4:12 ___________________________________________

        ‚Ä¢ 1 John 5:11, 12_______________________________________

        John 3:16 is one of the best-known texts in the Bible. ‚Äú ‚ÄòGod so
      loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
      believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life‚Äô ‚Äù (NIV). The text
      speaks about the love of God, which found expression in the sending
      of His Son to this earth. It promises eternal life to all who believe in
      Him. But it also clearly points to the alternative. Those who do not lis-
      ten to the gospel call and refuse to accept Christ will perish. The deci-
      sion as to who will perish and who will receive eternal life is not ours.
      We may be in for some real surprises when we see the roll call of the
      saved. Without overriding people‚Äôs will, God will do everything pos-
      sible to reduce the number of those who will perish. And‚Äîamazingly
      enough‚ÄîHe has, in His wisdom, given us a role in that process.

       What is your own role in the church‚Äôs mission? How seriously
       do you take the call to reach others with the gospel? What more
       could you do?




                                                                            105

      The Great Commission
        The command to take the gospel to the entire world is found in all
      four Gospels, as well as in the book of Acts. They show, of course,
      clear parallels, but there are also some significant differences. One
      needs to read all versions to form a complete picture of everything
      that is implied in the Great Commission.

Read the passages in which the Great Commission is recorded and
      note how they complement each other. What are the specific
      details in each of these passages?

        Matt. 28:19, 20_________________________________________

        Mark 16:15, 16_________________________________________

        Luke 24:46, 47_________________________________________

        John 20:21____________________________________________

        Acts 1:8_______________________________________________

         The gospel is to be preached ‚Äúto all nations.‚Äù According to General
      Conference statistics, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is now pro-
      claiming its message in more than two hundred countries. This means
      that there are only a few countries in which our church does not have
      an official presence. Among these are several large ones: North Korea,
      Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen; most of the others are small, with less
      than one million inhabitants. So, one would be tempted to conclude
      that the Adventist Church almost has ‚Äúfinished the work.‚Äù That, how-
      ever, would be false. For even though we must give thanks to our Lord
      that our church continues to grow rapidly in many parts of the world and
      that many new territories constantly are being entered, the challenge is
      still enormous. When the New Testament speaks about ‚Äúnations,‚Äù it uses
      a word that would be more correctly translated as people groups or ‚Äúeth-
      nic groups.‚Äù Our work, therefore, is not completed until all people
      groups have been reached. There is considerable debate about how
      many such people groups exist. The number quoted by specialists varies
      between some twelve thousand to more than twenty thousand, depend-
      ing on the definition one uses. But, whatever definition is used, several
      thousand of these people groups have not yet been reached.

       Think about all the unreached people in your own community,
       whatever their ethnic background. What difference has your
       existence made in reaching them? What does your answer tell
       you about yourself and your role in the mission of the church?

      A Witnessing Church
What special message is to be proclaimed by God‚Äôs people in the time
      of the end? Rev. 14:6‚Äì12. What is your understanding of that mes-
      sage? Paraphrase it in your own words.

         The passage in which we find the messages of the three angels is
      found in a context that clearly focuses on the end of time. It is imme-
      diately preceded by a vision of the ‚Äúfirstfruits‚Äù (vs. 4) of the redeemed
      and followed by a vision of the ‚Äúharvest‚Äù (vs. 15) of all the saved. It is
      important to know what these messages entail. But also we need to
      understand who these ‚Äúangels‚Äù are that bring this ‚Äúeternal gospel‚Äù (vs.
      5, NIV). The fact that the word angel in prophecy is a symbol for
      human messengers, leaders, and church members is also underscored
      by Ellen G. White: ‚ÄúThe angels are represented as flying in the midst
      of heaven, proclaiming to the world a message of warning, and hav-
      ing a direct bearing upon the people living in the last days of this
      earth‚Äôs history. No one hears the voice of these angels, for they are a
      symbol to represent the people of God who are working in harmony
      with the universe of heaven. Men and women, enlightened by the
      Spirit of God, and sanctified through the truth, proclaim the three
      messages in their order.‚Äù‚ÄîLife Sketches, p. 429.
         Just as in the Great Commission, we find in the opening statement
      of the three angels‚Äô messages a strong emphasis on the challenge to
      take the gospel to every person on earth. Yet, a great danger that we
      face, especially the longer we are here, is shifting from the missionary
      mode to the maintenance mode. We can easily lose sight of our mis-
      sion to witness to the world and focus more on protecting and sus-
      taining our own institutions. When that happens to us, or the churches
      or institutions we represent, then we are losing the reason for our exis-
      tence.

       Think about this potential problem, that of focusing more on
       self-preservation than on mission. How does this happen? How
       can we recognize when it does, and what can we do to keep from
       falling into this trap?



                                                                           107

      Personal Witness

         It is not so difficult to agree with the statement that the church must
      be mission-minded. But who is the church? The church is not primar-
      ily an organization; rather, it is individuals who are, without any
      exception, called to be witnesses.

Why should we be confident that we can be witnesses of our faith?
      1 Cor. 12:28, Eph. 4:11‚Äì15.

        Not all of us have the gift of preaching or teaching. But we all have
      been gifted in some way so that we can be what we are called to be‚Äîdis-
      ciples always prepared to talk about the hope that is ours (1 Pet. 3:15).

What is the ultimate resource for those who are willing to witness of
      their faith? John 14:26; Acts 1:4, 8; 2:1‚Äì4.

         The fact that Christ has promised the presence of the Holy Spirit to
      His followers and that we can receive spiritual gifts does not mean that
      it is not necessary to make any preparations or to undergo any train-
      ing. The apostles were disciples who for more than three years under-
      went the most intensive training possible. Likewise, disciples today
      must be intentional about receiving training for Christian witness, and
      the church must make it a priority to constantly prepare relevant train-
      ing materials and opportunities to equip the members for their task.
      But training alone will prove insufficient. God‚Äôs people today need the
      presence and endowment of the Holy Spirit if they want to be suc-
      cessful in their outreach to others.
         One simple truth, however, will always remain: You cannot give what
      you do not have. Unless we make sure that we have a living relation-
      ship with God, we cannot hope to lead others to that same experience.

What is a vital condition for all who want to be witnesses of their
      faith? 2 Pet. 3:18.

        A church that responds to its calling will be a growing church. But
      growth should not be limited to numerical growth. Individually and
      corporately we must be ‚Äúgrowing in grace‚Äù if our witnessing truly is
      to be productive.

       What‚Äôs your understanding of what it means to grow in grace?
       How can you tell if you are? What criteria do you use? Share
       your answers in class on Sabbath.

      Sharing the Lord
         There is no doubt that sharing the message of the crucified and
      risen Christ, who is now our Intercessor with His Father, also implies
      a faithful teaching of the important doctrinal truths that God has
      revealed in His Word.

How important is it to teach and adhere to sound doctrine? Titus 2:1,
      2 Pet. 2:1‚Äì3.


         If we want to believe in the God of the Bible and have decided to
      follow Christ, we will want to know as much as we can about Him,
      about His character, and about what He expects from us. We try to
      summarize what we learn in the Bible in a series of doctrines and
      teachings. To some people, doctrinal statements are no more than
      irrelevant mental baggage. That is a tragic misunderstanding. Without
      sound doctrines our faith soon will become unfocused and shallow.
      Rather than growing in our faith, we eventually will discover that our
      faith becomes less and less meaningful. Unsound doctrines often will
      point us away from Christ, to ourselves or to something else that sup-
      posedly can contribute to our salvation. When we fail to ground our
      faith in sound biblical teaching, we are in grave danger of straying
      from the center of our faith: Jesus Christ our Lord.

What is to be the centerpiece of all our preaching and witnessing?
      1 Cor. 1:23, 2:2.


         The stress on the importance of sound doctrine must be comple-
      mented with the unconditional determination to anchor all we say in
      Jesus Christ. Everything we believe and state as doctrine must be
      related to the One in whom we are assured of our eternal salvation. If
      there is no connection with Jesus Christ, a doctrine will be no more
      than a piece of technical information, which may be interesting and
      intellectually challenging, but nothing more. But if rooted in Jesus
      Christ, a doctrine will help us better understand the plan of redemp-
      tion and will enhance our relationship with our Lord.

       Think about some of the false teachings that exist in the
       Christian world: eternal torment in hell, the predestination of
       some people to be saved and others to be lost, the belief that
       Jesus Christ was not divine but merely a great man. How could
       these and other false teachings negatively impact our under-
       standing of God and the plan of salvation?


                                                                       109

          Seventh-day Adventists, individually and corporately, see Jon L.

          church shall be reflected to the world His fullness and His sufficiency.
          The members of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness
          into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the
          repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church
          will eventually be made manifest, even to ‚Äòthe principalities and pow-

    Discussion Questions:
           ‚óè
           1 As a class, talk over your answer to the final question on
           Wednesday. What are the different perspectives of what it means
           to grow in grace?

3          ‚óè
           2 Take a good look at your local church. Where is the main
           emphasis? Is it on the church itself and ministering to the needs
           of the congregation itself, or is it on mission and on witnessing?
           How do we strike the right balance; that is, how do we disciple
           those who have joined us, while at the same time not neglect the
           call to reach all people? Where does your church stand on this
           topic, and in what ways can you help the church improve where
           it needs to?

           ‚óè
           3 How do we as a church protect ourselves from many of the
           dangerous theological trends that constantly are seeking to infil-
           trate and pollute our teachings? At the same time, how do we
           remain open to growing and advancing in new light that can help
           us better understand our Lord and our mission?

    Summary: The gospel of Jesus Christ must be preached in all the world.
       This is the responsibility of all who call themselves disciples. All of
       us have received certain relevant gifts, and all of us have the promise
       of the Spirit to further equip us. The preaching of the gospel should be
       based on sound doctrine, but everything we proclaim must be rooted
       in the One whom the gospel is all about.

Determined to Serve
by SETH A. LARYEA
   Nyuma stopped shoveling gravel and straightened his back before he
answered the question I‚Äôd just asked. ‚ÄúI work hard and press forward in
spite of difficult circumstances, for I want to fulfill God‚Äôs purpose in my
life and serve Him.‚Äù And Nyuma is doing that. In spite of financial hard-
ships, he presses toward his goal of completing his education at Valley
View University in Ghana.
   This day Nyuma is working at the construction site of the new church
on the university campus. The church, a recipient of a Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering, will seat 2,500 worshipers and be the center of the university
campus. Nyuma works to see the church finished as well as to make his
personal dream of an education a reality.
   Nyuma grew up in Sierra Leone. He and his friends walked 12 kilome-
ters (7.5 miles) to school and back every day. When he completed primary
school, his guardian sent him to work on the farm instead of continuing
his studies. When his father learned that Nyuma was not studying, he took
the boy to a secondary school in another part of the country.
   There Nyuma learned about Seventh-day Adventists and eventually was
baptized. His life took on a new direction, and he realized that God was
calling him to become a pastor. He continued studying until his father
retired. Then Nyuma had no money to continue his studies. He found work
doing menial jobs to raise money to continue his studies and finally com-
pleted his secondary education when he was 21 years old.
   Then the country was thrown into a bitter civil war in which thousands
were maimed or murdered. ‚ÄúBut God saved me to serve Him,‚Äù Nyuma
said. For the next six years he worked as a lay evangelist in Sierra Leone.
   At last he made his way to Valley View University in Ghana to study
theology. He completed two years of study before he was forced to leave
classes to earn money to complete his education. But Nyuma does not
waste time feeling sorry that he cannot study. He offered to work on the
church construction team, which is hard work, for he is determined to
move toward his calling to be a minister. ‚ÄúThrough these difficulties,‚Äù he
says, ‚ÄúGod is strengthening me for His service.‚Äù
   Nyuma‚Äôs determination encourages others to achieve their goals too. He
will make a good minister in his Master‚Äôs service.
   Your mission offerings support schools at all levels in nearly two hun-
dred countries. And your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings make possible
projects such as the church at Valley View University. Thank you.

2009    Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter

         This quarter, instead of studying John‚Äôs Gospel (his own inspired
       eyewitness account of Jesus) or the book of Revelation (which he
       also wrote), we‚Äôre going to study his three letters. Though
       addressed to certain churches and individuals in his time, they deal
       with issues relevant to us today, issues such as false doctrine, sin,
       love, apostasy, and obedience. But most important of all, they deal
       with Jesus Christ, the One through whom we were created (‚ÄúHow
       did we get here?‚Äù), the One who gives our existence meaning and
       purpose (‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù) and the One who promises to come
       again and raise us to eternal life (‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù). In short,
       in Jesus we find the answers to the most important questions.
Lesson 1‚ÄîJesus and the Johannine Letters
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: From Whom and to Whom‚ÄîAuthor and Recipients
       (1 John 1:1‚Äì3; 3 John 1, 13, 14)
       MONDAY: What‚ÄîThe Content of the Epistles (2 John 1‚Äì13)
       TUESDAY: Why‚ÄîThe Purpose of Writing These Letters (1 John
       1:4, 2:12‚Äì14)
       WEDNESDAY: Jesus in the Johannine Epistles (1 John 1:1, 2:1,
       5:20)
       THURSDAY: Jesus‚Äô Ministry in John‚Äôs Epistles (1 John 1:7)
       Memory Text‚Äî1 John 4:14
       Sabbath Gem: John‚Äôs Epistles focus on problems in the early
       Christian church but also point to God the Father and the Son and
       portray who They are and what They have done for us. When we
       ponder these truths, we need to consider what our response must be.

Lesson 2‚ÄîExperiencing the Word of Life
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: The Introduction to John‚Äôs First Letter (1 John 1:1‚Äì4)
       MONDAY: First John 1 and John 1 (1 John 1:1‚Äì5, John 1:1‚Äì5)
       TUESDAY: The Word of Life (1 John 1:1, 2)
       WEDNESDAY: Eyewitnesses (1 John 1:1‚Äì4)
       THURSDAY: Fellowship of the Saints (1 John 1:3)
       Memory Text‚Äî1 John 1:3
       Sabbath Gem: Just as eyewitness accounts are taken seriously
       in a court of law, we should realize the power behind John‚Äôs account,
       which is based on his personal experience with Jesus, and be willing
       to witness as to how Christ is working in our lives.
