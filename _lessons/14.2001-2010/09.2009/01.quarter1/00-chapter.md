         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Commitee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of worldwide evaluation committees and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

  “      or I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is
         not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least
         in the kingdom of God is greater than he” (Luke 7:28).
     No greater prophet than John? That would include, apparently,
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, even Moses. Yet, according to Jesus, John was
   the greatest of them all. How fascinating, especially because, unlike
   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and Moses—John the Baptist had no writings
   in the Bible, and yet John was a greater prophet than all those who, at
The prophetic gift          least before him, did!
wasn’t limited only to The point? The prophetic gift wasn’t lim-
the prophets whose          ited only to the prophets whose writing
writing became              became Scripture. No, the prophetic gift
Scripture.                  included those whose work for the Lord
                            involved something other than writing books
   of the Bible.
     The whole question of the prophetic gift, and of inspiration in gen-
   eral, has been a source of discussion and debate throughout church
   history. How were the prophets inspired? How do inspiration and rev-
   elation work? How much, if any, of culture and personal views appear
   in the writings of the prophets? If these questions still generate dis-
   cussion within Christendom after centuries of debate, we’re hardly
   going to solve them all in the Adult Bible Study Guide this quarter. But
   we’ll sure do our best to try.
     Issues regarding the nature of the prophetic gift and inspiration have
   been especially important to Seventh-day Adventists. In the book of
   Revelation, God promised that there will be a special manifestation of
   the prophetic gift at the time of the end (Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9).
   Seventh-day Adventists believe that the gift of prophecy has been
   manifested in the ministry of Mrs. Ellen G. White (1827–1915). For
   seven decades she gave messages of counsel and warning to our
   church; and though she died in 1915, her books, full of spiritual
   insights and counsel, have been a source of tremendous blessing to
   2

 countless millions whose lives have been, and continue to be, spiritu-
 ally and theologically enriched through them. We truly have been
 given a gift.
    Yet, questions remain. What is the role of the prophetic gift? If we
 claim the Bible as our final authority, what authority (if any) should
 the Spirit of Prophecy have? How should these writings be inter-
 preted? Though this gift has been a blessing, in what ways has it been
 misused?
    More than three decades have gone by since we last studied in
 Sabbath School the topic of the gift of prophecy. Since then the
 church has grown from 2.5 million members to more than 15 million
 (as of this writing). And though there are questions about the Spirit of
 Prophecy (along with the prophetic gift in general) that remain unan-
 swered, we believe we’ve been given more than enough reasons to
 believe in this special manifestation of prophecy among us.
    However, the real focus of this lesson isn’t just on the gift but on the
 Gift-Giver. As we study the question of inspiration and revelation,
 we’ll learn about the Lord who loves this world so much He gave of
 Himself, in the person of Jesus, as the sacrifice for our sins. Though
 God, though sinless, though the Creator Himself, He became a
 human being, and in that humanity took upon Himself the punish-
 ment for our evil as the only way that we, as sinners, could stand par-
 doned and justified before Him.
    That’s the God we serve, and that’s the God we seek to reveal in this
 quarter’s lessons.

      Heaven’s Means of
      Communication


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 18:1–15, 32:30,
      Exod. 4:10–17, Ps. 19:1–6, John 1:14, 3:16, Col. 2:9.

Memory Text: “God, who at various times and in various ways
      spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last
      days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all
      things, through whom also He made the worlds” (Hebrews 1:1, 2,
      NKJV).

             here are two basic ways in which God has revealed Himself to

      T      humanity: general and special revelation. General revelation is
             God’s revelation of Himself to all people through nature and
      conscience (see Ps. 19:1, Rom. 1:20). God’s revelations through the
      prophets as recorded in Scripture, especially His revelation through
      Jesus Christ, is special revelation. Through this means, God appeared
      to the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets in order to make His will
      known. He revealed His power and purpose through Israel’s history.
      Then later, He sent His Son, who, in the garb of humanity, revealed
      the Father in a unique and powerful way.
         This week we’ll look at both types of revelation.

The Week at a Glance: What is general and special rev-
      elation? What can nature teach us about God? What can it not
      teach us? How does the revelation through Jesus Christ differ
      from God’s other revelations?

      In the Beginning
        In the Garden of Eden God spoke with Adam and Eve face-to-face.
      “And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in
      the cool of the day” (Gen. 3:8). However, after that fateful day, when
      they blatantly disobeyed their Lord, they no longer were allowed to
      enjoy His presence (Gen. 3:23, 24), and their face-to-face communion
      with Him ended.

What do the following texts tell us about face-to-face encounters with
      God? Gen. 18:1–15; 32:30; Exod. 33:11; Judg. 6:22; 13:2, 3.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Frequently the Old Testament identifies the Angel of God or the
      Angel of the Lord as God Himself. Jacob refers to God and the Angel
      in the same way (Gen. 48:15, 16); the Angel of the Lord appears to
      Moses in the burning bush; yet, it is God who speaks to him (Exod.
      3:2–6); the Angel who appeared to Gideon is identified with God
      (Judg. 6:11–14); and the same is true of the Angel of the Lord who
      appeared to Manoah and his wife (Judg. 13:11–22). Whenever God
      manifested Himself to human beings in a bodily form, it was always
      in a humanlike manifestation.
        In John 1:18 John says, “No man hath seen God at any time, the
      only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
      declared him.” The Divine Being, therefore, who appeared to the peo-
      ple in the Old Testament must have been Jesus, not the Father. Ellen
      G. White tells us that “after the transgression of Adam, the Lord spoke
      no longer directly with man; the human race was given into the hands
      of Christ, and all communication came through Him to the world. It
      was Christ who spoke the law on Mount Sinai.”—Fundamentals of
      Christian Education, pp. 237, 238.

       What has been your own experience regarding what sin and
       rebellion do between you and God? That is, when you do some-
       thing that you know is wrong, that you know is sinful, how does
       that impact your relationship with God? In what ways do you
       feel a separation from Him? How does guilt drive you away
       from Him, away from the desire to pray and commune with the
       Lord? How does this experience help you better understand
       what happened in Eden?



                                                                           7

     In Nature
What can nature reveal about God? Ps. 19:1–6, 33:6–9, Rom. 1:19–23.


        The Bible tells us that the world that God created was perfect in
     every way (Gen. 1:31). But Scripture also reveals that sin has altered
     the natural world (Gen. 3:17, 18). Prior to the Fall, only beautiful or
     useful plants were found upon the earth. God “never made a thorn, a
     thistle, or a tare. These are Satan’s work, the result of degeneration. ”
     —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 186.
     Nevertheless, there is still great beauty in the changing of the leaves
     in autumn, in a vivid sunset, and in the opening of a rosebud on a
     sunny morning.
        Bible writers often refer to the phenomena of nature as a revelation
     of God’s majesty and greatness (Psalm 8 and 104). Consider the uni-
     verse! On a clear night one can see with the unaided eye thousands of
     stars. However, our Milky Way galaxy has about two hundred billion
     stars—and that’s only one galaxy among several hundred billion
     galaxies that we now can see. Who knows how many more are beyond
     our telescopes!
        Distances in the universe boggle the mind: Apart from the sun, the
     nearest star to our earth, Alpha Centauri, is 4.37 light-years away (one
     light-year is the distance light travels in one year—5.9 trillion miles).
     A spaceship traveling 100,000 miles per hour would require about
     29,000 years to get there. In contrast, our Milky Way has a diameter
     of 100,000 light-years! The largest galaxy known thus far is
     Markarian, with a diameter of 1.3 million light-years.
        Similar awe-inspiring facts would come to light if we used an elec-
     tron microscope to study the tens of thousands of genes each individ-
     ual possesses. Our finite minds are simply unable to comprehend all
     the wonders of the created world.
        Yet, nature alone isn’t enough to reveal the fullness of God’s character
     (Rom. 1:25). Many of the fundamental questions about God cannot be
     answered through a study of nature. We will find it hard to see God’s love
     reflected in how cats and killer whales play with their prey before killing
     them. And while we can see God’s power and majesty in creation, nature
     does not tell us always that God is “merciful and gracious, long-suffering,
     and abounding in goodness and truth” (Exod. 34:6, NKJV).

      What aspects of nature truly talk to you about the love and
      power of God? At the same time, what things do you find dis-
      turbing; and why? What do your answers tell you about how
      limited nature is in revealing the fullness of God’s love and char-
      acter?

     Through Prophets
After the Fall, when God no longer spoke to humanity directly, He
     communicated with them through men and women whom the
     Bible calls seers or prophets (1 Sam. 9:9). What do the following
     texts tell us about these prophets? 2 Sam. 23:2; Jer. 1:5; Hos. 4:1;
     Amos 7:14, 15; Jonah 1:1–3.

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The word prophet (in Hebrew nabi´) means “one called [by God]”
     or “one who has a vocation [from God].” The prophet is a person who
     proclaims divine messages. These may relate to the past, the present,
     or the future and may consist of exhortation, instruction, consolation,
     or prediction.
       The English word prophet comes from the Greek prophetes, a com-
     bination of the preposition pro, “for” or “on behalf of,” with the verb
     phemi, “to speak.” Thus the idea being “to speak for.”

Read Exodus 4:10–17. How does this help us better understand the
     role of a prophet?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Here Moses objects to God’s call for him to go to Egypt and confront
     Pharaoh, claiming that he is “slow of speech and of a slow tongue” (vs.
     10). Even after God reminded Moses that He had made man’s mouth and
     would enable him to speak before Pharaoh, Moses still objected. Then
     God told Moses that He would send Aaron to go with him. “He shall be
     your spokesman to the people. And he himself shall be as a mouth for
     you, and you shall be to him as God” (vs. 16, NKJV). As Moses was to
     be the spokesperson for God, so Aaron would be the spokesperson for
     Moses. Thus, a prophet speaks for someone. The prophet may speak to
     humankind on behalf of God or vice versa. The primary task of a bibli-
     cal prophet was not to predict the future but to declare the divine will.
     Throughout the history of Israel, the prophet’s main task was to guide
     God’s people. Particularly during the time of the monarchy, when the
     kings often “did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord” (2 Kings
     13:2), the prophetic institution was the guardian of the theocracy. The
     prophets upheld the law of God and taught it to the people.

      Notice the humility of Moses and the sense of his own weakness.
      Why is that a good attitude for anyone, not just a prophet, to

      Through the Word
         Basic to the claims of Christianity is that it is a revealed religion, the
      record of which we find in Scripture. During the first few millennia of
      humankind’s existence, God revealed Himself to individuals through
      dreams, visions, or epiphanies (appearances). From the time of Moses
      (fifteenth century B.C.) and onward, many of these revelations were
      written down. As a result, we have today 66 books in the Bible, con-
      taining all the knowledge necessary for salvation.

What do the following texts tell us about the Bible itself?

      Matt. 1:22; 2:15, 17; 4:14

         There are a number of important characteristics of the Bible that
      should hold our attention. (1) Its unity: The Bible at first sight appears
      to be merely a collection of ancient literature. However, considering
      that it was written by approximately forty authors over a period of
      nearly sixteen hundred years, its unity is amazing. The plan of salva-
      tion is revealed progressively from Genesis to Revelation. There is
      unity in its theme: The Messiah is promised throughout the Old
      Testament and declared in every New Testament book to have come in
      the person of Jesus Christ. And there is complete harmony of teaching:
      The doctrines of the Old and New Testament are the same. (2) The his-
      tory it portrays: The Old Testament embodies the oldest history of any
      people in the world. William F. Albright, the greatest archaeologist of
      the twentieth century, wrote, “Hebrew national tradition excels all
      other in its clear picture of tribal and family origins. In Egypt and
      Babylonia, in Assyria and Phoenicia, in Greece and Rome, we look in
      vain for anything comparable. There is nothing like it in the tradition
      of the Germanic peoples. Neither India nor China can produce any-
      thing similar.”—The Biblical Period From Abraham to Ezra (New
      York: Harper, Torch Book, 1963), p. 27. (3) Its survival: The Bible,
      compared with other ancient writings, has more manuscript evidence
      than any other piece of classical literature—in spite of early attempts
      by Roman emperors to destroy it. For example, there are more than five
      thousand known Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in existence.
      Homer’s Iliad is second with only 643 manuscripts that have survived.
         The reason for this phenomenon is the Holy Spirit, the real author
      of God’s Word, who inspired all the human authors. He ensured that
      the biblical historians presented an accurate picture, and He watched
      over the history and preservation of the Bible.

     Through Christ
       The center and substance of God’s revelation is the person of Christ,
     God in human flesh. When in God’s plan the time was right, Jesus was
     “born of a woman, born under the law” (Gal. 4:4, NKJV). He lived for
     about thirty-three years in Palestine, died on the cross, rose from the
     tomb, and ascended to His Father.

What do the following texts tell us about how God’s revelation
     through Christ differed from the other revelations discussed this
     week? John 1:14; 3:16; 14:8, 9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:1, 2.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Bible far surpasses the revelation of God in nature; yet, no writ-
     ten record can equal the personal presence of the Son of God. The
     Bible is God’s tool to accomplish His purpose in our lives. However,
     it has no lasting value if we regard it only as an interesting history
     book. Unless it leads us to the One it reveals, our study of the Bible
     will be of little benefit. The Bible was written, above all, to give to us
     the revelation of God presented to the world through the life and death
     of His Son, Jesus.

     “That was the true Light which gives light to every man who comes
     into the world” (John 1:9, NKJV ). What contribution does this text
     make to our understanding of the revelation of God in Christ?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The NIV English translation catches the idea best: “The true light
     that gives light to every man was coming into the world.” This does
     not mean that every person receives this light, only that if a person is
     illuminated at all, it must be from Jesus (Acts 4:12). The true light
     shines on all humankind in the same sense that Jesus died for every-
     one, but not everyone will be saved. As John goes on to say, many will
     not accept this light (John 1:10–12).

      How well do you know Jesus yourself? If someone were to say to
      you, “Tell me about Jesus, what He is like and what He can do
      for me,” what would you say and why? Be prepared to share
      your answer in class on Sabbath.

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “A True Knowledge of God,”
         pp. 409–426, in The Ministry of Healing; “God in Nature,” pp. 99–101,
         in Education.

           “Christ came to teach human beings what God desires them to
         know. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the broad waters of the
         ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify to His
         power, His wisdom, His love. But not from the stars or the ocean or
         the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it is revealed in
         Christ. God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to
         portray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into
1        the world to reveal, so far as could be endured by human sight, the
         nature and the attributes of the invisible God.”
           “Christ revealed all of God that sinful human beings could bear
         without being destroyed. He is the divine Teacher, the Enlightener.
         Had God thought us in need of revelations other than those made
         through Christ and in His written word, He would have given them.”
2        —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, pp. 265, 266.
           “The Bible is a wonderful book. It is a history that opens up to us
         the past centuries. Without the Bible we should have been left to con-
         jectures and fables in regard to the occurrences of past ages. It is a
         prophecy that unveils the future. It is the Word of God, unfolding to us
         the plan of salvation, pointing out the way by which we may escape
         eternal death and gain eternal life.”—Ellen G. White, Bible Echo,
         October 1, 1892, par. 5.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In class, compare your answers to Thursday’s final question.
          What can you learn from each other?

          ●
          2 If God does reveal Himself to us through nature, at least par-
          tially, what does this tell us about our need to protect the envi-
          ronment?

          ●
          3 What are some other ways God communicates with us? How
          can we be sure it really is God talking to us? What safeguards
          are there to protect us from deceptions?

          ●4 As a class, plan an outing in nature in which you can look at
          the revelation of God found there. What things clearly testify to
          His creative power and love? What things leave large questions
          still unanswered? Why is nature, however beautiful, still not suf-
          ficient to tell us all that we need to know?

The Stranger on the Bus
by BENJAMIN D. SCHOUN
   One family in the country of Azerbaijan is convinced that the stranger
they encountered on a bus was no ordinary passenger.
   Gunel’s family was mourning the loss of her grandfather. One day
Gunel’s mother boarded a bus to visit her grandfather’s grave. As she sat
crying quietly, a woman sat down beside her. She comforted Gunel’s
mother by telling her that God is good, that Jesus will come again, and that
there is hope for the future. The woman told her about a church she could
visit to learn more about these things. Gunel’s mother thanked the woman
for her kind words.
   A month later, Gunel’s mother saw the woman on the bus again. The
woman again encouraged her and gave her the address of the church.
Gunel’s mother was so moved by the experiences that she asked Gunel to
go with her to visit the church on Saturday morning to see what it was like.
The two women stood near the church, hesitant to go inside, for they had
never been to a Christian church. A church greeter standing saw the two
women and crossed the street to invite them in. Inside they were welcomed
warmly with hugs and kisses.
   After the service, Gunel’s mother asked members about the woman she
had met on the bus. She described her in detail, but no one recognized the
woman from the description. The pastor, who knew all of the Adventists
in the city, listened to the description and finally concluded that no such
person attended the church. “I think you’ve met an angel,” he told Gunel
and her mother.
   Gunel’s mother continued attending the Adventist church. She studied
the Bible diligently and was baptized. Later, Gunel and her brother and
sister also were baptized. Now they hold a small group meeting in their
                              home. Many of their friends abandoned them
                               when they left their traditional religion, but
                               they are firm in their faith. Gunel is studying
                               to help Adventist World Radio produce radio
                               programs in the Azeri language.
                                 The family has never seen the woman on
                               the bus again.

      The Prophetic Gift




        SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 20:7, Exod. 15:20,
      Deut. 18:15, Matt. 11:11, John 6:14, Heb. 11:24–26.

Memory Text: “Then He said, ‘Hear now My words: If there is
      a prophet among you, I, the Lord, make Myself known to him in
      a vision; and I speak to him in a dream’ ” (Numbers 12:6, NKJV).

              ll through history, and even up to the present, we can find

      A       examples of people uttering predictions about the future. In
               most cases, these things never come true. When they do come
      true, a number of factors could be involved. Could it be sheer luck?
      Maybe the Lord was in it? Or perhaps the enemy of souls was work-
      ing to deceive as many as he could?
         Sure Satan uses false prophecies and prophets to mislead people. But
      we can take comfort in knowing God has His true prophets to make
      known His will.
         In Scripture, individuals whom God endowed with the gift of prophecy
      were people who walked with God. Not that they were sinless, but
      they strove to live in harmony with God’s revealed will. They had a
      personal relationship with God, and in that context the Lord was able
      to use them in a special way.
         This week we’ll take a look at how He used them.

The Week at a Glance: Were the Old and New Testament
      prophets saints or just ordinary men and women? What role did
      women prophets play in Israel? What were the differences between
      apostles and prophets in the New Testament?

    Patriarch and Prophet
In Genesis 20:7 we find the first mention of the word prophet (Heb.
    nabi´ ) in the Bible. What was the context in which it was used?
    What can we learn from the context about what a prophet was
    and how he or she functioned?

    ____________________________________________________________________

    ____________________________________________________________________

      In the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible), the word
    prophet describes the recipient of divine revelation. During the time
    of the judges the word seer (in Hebrew ro´eh) appears to have come
    into use (1 Sam. 9:9, 11, 18, 19); then, later, the usage reverted to the
    older term again.
      Prophets were not only spokespersons for God but on occasion were
    also intermediaries between God and the people. Abraham in Genesis
    20 was the intermediary between God and Abimelech—he was to pray
    to God on behalf of Abimelech.
      Abraham is a towering figure in the Old Testament. Three times in
    Scripture he is called God’s friend (2 Chron. 20:7, Isa. 41:8, James
    2:23). When he was 99 years old, God told him, “I will make you
    exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall
    come from you” (Gen. 17:6, NKJV), a promise that, humanly speak-
    ing, seemed impossible. Because Abraham believed God in spite of
    what human reason told him, he became “the father of all those who
    believe” (Rom. 4:11, NKJV).
      Considering that Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son in
    response to God’s command (Genesis 22), it seems incredible that
    Abraham should have lied to Abimelech concerning Sarah (Gen.
    20:2). However, the situation is only too true to life. “As water reflects
    a face, so a man’s heart reflects the man” (Prov. 27:19, NIV). The
    occasional manifestation of the remaining old nature in the believer,
    the backsliding of God’s children in all ages, and our own sad depar-
    tures from the path of righteousness are sufficient to explain the
    deplorable conduct of the “father of all those who believe.” How
    human Abraham was—moments of great faith, moments of deep
    lapses. What follower of Abraham’s God can’t relate?

     What encouragement can you take for yourself from the fact
     that, despite Abraham’s mistakes and lack of faith, God used
     him anyway, even mightily? How can we learn not to let our
     lapses turn us away from continuing to press on ahead in faith?



                                                                           15

      The First Named Prophet of Israel
         The first person of the nation of Israel called a prophet was Moses.
      Concerning his death, the statement is made, “since then there has not
      arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to
      face” (Deut. 34:10, NKJV). Abraham was the father of the nation of
      Israel, but Moses was the first prophet in Israel’s history—an example
      for all the prophets who followed him.

What do the following texts tell us about Moses’ personality and charac-
      ter? Exod. 4:10; 32:11–13, 32; Num. 12:3; 20:10–12; Heb. 11:24–26.
      How do some of these traits help us understand how he fit into his
      role as a prophet?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Through his upbringing in Egypt, his strong faith in God, and his
      personal experience with the Almighty at the burning bush (Exodus
      3), Moses was well equipped to lead the people of Israel. From
      Scripture, we know that because of Israel’s repeated failure to have
      faith in God, Moses constantly was interceding with God for the
      nation (Exod. 32:11–13, Num. 14:13–19, 16:46–50), while at the
      same time admonishing the Israelites to be faithful.
         Following the golden-calf episode at Mount Sinai (Exodus 32),
      Moses spent 40 days with God on the mountain. When he returned
      from the mountain, his face shone (Exod. 34:28–35). The radiant face
      of Moses was but a reflection of divine glory (2 Cor. 3:7). Consider-
      ing the fact that Moses had the unique privilege of seeing the glory of
      the Creator, it is small wonder that his face shone after such an expe-
      rience, but this was not the only reason. The golden-calf rebellion was
      directed not only against God but also against Moses. The evidence of
      his communion with God was instrumental in restoring him to his
      rightful place of leadership. When the people realized where he had
      been, his role of leader and mediator that had been questioned was
      restored.
         Anyone filled with the Spirit of God will in some way reflect the glo-
      rious character of God. Those who live close to God will have a telling
      effect on the lives of others, though they may not know it themselves.

       Who is someone who seems to have a close relationship with the
       Lord? How is that closeness revealed in their lives? What char-
       acter traits do they manifest? How can you learn to walk closer
       to the Lord? What things in your life are holding you back from
       that closer walk?

Prophets in Israel
   Prior to his death Moses told the Israelites: “ ‘The Lord your God
will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your
brethren. Him you shall hear’ ” (Deut. 18:15, NKJV). The context
indicates that this prophecy had an immediate application to the
prophetic leadership of Israel in the years following the death of
Moses (Deuteronomy 18; 34:9, 10; Hos. 12:10). The prophets from
Joshua to Malachi were partial fulfillment of Moses’ prophecy.
   Christ, however, fully could meet the conditions set forth in Moses’
prediction (see John 1:21, 6:14, 7:40). He came as the Second Moses,
not to free His people from the power of earthly rulers but to free them
from the power of sin.
   The writings of the prophets of the Old Testament from Isaiah to
Malachi are well-known. In addition, there were many other prophets
in the history of Israel. Samuel lived during the period of the judges
(1 Sam. 3:20). Gad and Nathan continued his work (2 Sam. 12:1,
24:13). After the division of the kingdom in 931 B.C. we find the
prophets Ahijah (1 Kings 11:29), Elijah (1 Kings 18:1), and Elisha
(2 Kings 2:9–14) ministering to the people of God.
   Prophets came from all walks of life: Jeremiah and Ezekiel were
priests, Isaiah and Zephaniah were of royal blood, Daniel was prime
minister of Babylon, Samuel was a judge, Elisha was a farmer, and
Amos a shepherd. Whatever their backgrounds, all of them were God’s
messengers through whom God tried to keep Israel from falling into
sin. Some prophets wrote books (1 Chron. 29:29, 2 Chron. 9:29), oth-
ers did not (1 Kings 17:1, 2 Kings 2:15); some were counselors to
kings (Jer. 38:14), others preached to the people (Ezek. 3:17). After
four centuries of prophetic silence, John the Baptist appeared as the
last of the prophets of the Old Covenant period (Matt. 3:1).
   All through the sacred Scriptures we see the Lord speaking to His
people through His servants, the prophets. The whole Bible itself is
the work of these prophets, delivering the messages that God gave
them. No matter how diverse their backgrounds, education, tempera-
ments; no matter the flaws in their characters (with the radical excep-
tion of Jesus), these human beings, flesh and blood like us, were used
by the Lord to proclaim His messages, messages that still are being
proclaimed today in almost every country in the world and will con-
tinue until the close of time.

 Which prophet can you relate to the most? Which prophet
 speaks the clearest to you, and why? What have you taken from
 that prophet’s life and message? How are you able to apply what
 you’ve learned from them to your life in a way that changes you
 for the better?


                                                                    17

      Prophetesses in Israel
Scripture mentions a number of prophetesses. Who were they?
      What do the following texts tell us about the role they played in the
      history of Israel? Exod. 15:20, 21; Judg. 4:4–10; 2 Kings 22:11–20.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Miriam, the sister of Moses, is called a prophetess. She is described
      as leading the women in the Song of Moses and Miriam (compare
      Exod. 15:1 and 15:21, NIV). Moses was the appointed leader of the
      people of Israel, but his dealings would have been primarily with the
      men, who were considered the heads of their families. Miriam’s task
      was, perhaps, with the Israelite women. She must have been several
      years older than Moses (Exod. 2:1–8), and according to Josephus she
      married Hur, who together with Aaron had held up the arms of Moses
      in the battle with the Amalekites.—The Works of Flavius Josephus
      (Philadelphia: David McKay Publisher), p. 98.
         That she was an important person in Israel is seen in the fact that all
      Israel had to wait seven days until God took away her leprosy after the
      unfortunate incident with her brother Moses and his wife (Num.
      12:1–15).
         Deborah (Judges 5) must have been an extraordinary person. In a
      society dominated by men, she became a political and spiritual leader,
      something few women achieved in those days. Deeply spiritual, she
      ascribed all praise for the victory over the Canaanites to God (vss.
      3–5, 13); she did not take any glory for herself or Barak.
         As a “mother in Israel” (vs. 7), she watched over the people with
      maternal care, counseling and aiding them in procuring justice.

Read Judges 4:1–8. What does this tell us about how highly respected
      this woman was in Israel at that time?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Another prophetess in Israel was Huldah (2 Kings 22:14–20,
      2 Chron. 34:20–28). When King Josiah asked her concerning God’s
      will, she prophesied judgment and disaster upon Jerusalem and its
      people but not in Josiah’s day; his eyes were not to see the evil because
      he humbled himself before the Lord. It is interesting that Huldah was
      consulted although both Jeremiah and Zephaniah were living at the
      same time.

     New Testament Prophets
       The Old Testament prophetic period came to an end about four hun-
     dred years prior to the birth of Christ. During the period between that
     end and the birth of Christ, many Jewish books were written, but none
     were accepted as inspired.

The life of Christ ushered in a new era, in which God again called
     individuals to function as His spokespersons. Who were some of
     these New Testament prophets, and what was the difference
     between them and the apostles? Luke 1:67; John 1:6, 7; Acts 11:27,
     28; 13:1; Rev. 1:1–3.

       In New Testament Greek, the word apostle was used of persons in
     the sense of ambassador, envoy, or delegate. Josephus, for example,
     used this word when speaking of the ambassadors whom the Jews sent
     as their representatives to Rome.—Flavius Josephus, The Works of
     Flavius Josephus, p. 11.
       In the New Testament, apostle carries the concepts of mission and
     representation. The term appears in the context of Jesus’ ordaining
     and sending forth His disciples on an evangelistic mission (Matt.
     10:2–6). The apostles were those with special authority from the risen
     Lord; they had seen for themselves His death and resurrection, some-
     thing that all the previous prophets hadn’t. Some of the apostles, such
     as John and Paul, were also prophets, but not all apostles were
     prophets. According to Ephesians 2:20, apostles and prophets together
     provided the foundational interpretation of what God had done in
     Christ for humanity.

Read Matthew 11:11. Why was John the Baptist greater than all the
     Old Testament prophets? What does Jesus mean when He says, “But
     he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he” (NKJV)?

        John the Baptist was the greatest prophet in the sense that it was his
     privilege to announce the coming of Christ, to whom all the prophets
     had borne witness (see Luke 24:27; John 5:39, 46). Like Abraham, all
     the Old Testament prophets looked forward to the day the Messiah
     would come (1 Pet. 1:10, 11), but John saw Him in the flesh. Hence,
     in some sense, the prophetic office in the Old Testament reached its
     climax in John. At the same time, John the Baptist was only at the
     door of the kingdom of grace, looking in, while the least follower of
     Jesus can look back and rejoice in the fulfillment of all the Messianic
     prophecies through Christ.

      Dwell on some of the Old Testament prophecies that pointed to
      Jesus as Messiah. How can they help strengthen your faith?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Test of Faith,” pp. 145–
         155; “Moses,” pp. 241–256, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “During his stay in Egypt, Abraham gave evidence that he was not
         free from human weakness and imperfection. In concealing the fact
         that Sarah was his wife, he betrayed a distrust of the divine care, a lack
         of that lofty faith and courage so often and nobly exemplified in his
         life.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 130.
            “Moses had been instructed in regard to the final reward to be given
         to the humble and obedient servants of God, and worldly gain sank to
1
         its proper insignificance in comparison. The magnificent palace of
         Pharaoh and the monarch’s throne were held out as an inducement to
         Moses; but he knew that the sinful pleasures that make men forget
         God were in its lordly courts. He looked beyond the gorgeous palace,
         beyond a monarch’s crown, to the high honors that will be bestowed
         on the saints of the Most High in a kingdom untainted by sin. He saw
2
         by faith an imperishable crown that the King of heaven would place
         on the brow of the overcomer.”—Ellen G. White, Conflict and
         Courage, p. 81.
            “The glory reflected in the countenance of Moses illustrates the
         blessings to be received by God’s commandment-keeping people
         through the mediation of Christ. It testifies that the closer our com-
         munion with God, and the clearer our knowledge of His requirements,
         the more fully shall we be conformed to the divine image, and the
3
         more readily do we become partakers of the divine nature.”—Ellen
         G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 330.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Discuss some of the character flaws found in various prophets
          and apostles in the Bible. What hope can you take from these for
          yourself? At the same time, what are the good characteristics
          seen in many of these people? What hope and promise can you
          find there, as well?

          ●2 What about some of the so-called “prophets” today, those
          making all sorts of predictions, many of which are reported in
          the local newspaper? How should we relate to them? What kind
          of people are they; what kind of predictions do they make? What
          can we learn from the contrast between them and the prophets
          seen in the Bible?

          ●
          3 In what ways can we, as a church, act in the role of the
          prophets? In what ways are we called to do just that? How can
          we better fulfill that role?

Keeping the Faith on Sabbath
by MUHINDO KABWE
   Schools in French-speaking countries hold classes on Sabbaths. Getting
schools to accommodate Adventists is difficult. It’s no different where I
live in Congo.
   After secondary school, I enrolled in a government school to study busi-
ness. I knew that Sabbath would be a problem, but I was one of four
Adventists in the school, and we helped one another stay faithful to God.
   Three other Adventist students, who were older than I, told me that
exams were scheduled for Sabbath, and rescheduling them was difficult.
We had no option but to pray for God’s will and request permission to take
our exams on another day. But several teachers refused.
   We fasted and prayed, then we went to the school administration. The
administration told us that all exams are scheduled for Saturday, no excep-
tions. But we weren’t ready to give up. We prayed for two more days and
returned to plead our case. To our surprise the director decided to write a
letter to the teachers stating that no exams would be scheduled on
Saturday. And he even allowed us to make up the exams we had missed
because they were given on Sabbath. We were overjoyed!
   Then just before the end of my second year at the school, a new direc-
tor was elected. He changed the exam policy so exams fell on Saturdays
again. We appealed, but we were denied. Final exams came, and several
fell on Sabbath. We faced failure. Instead of letting us take our exams on
another day, the director offered to let us withdraw from school.
   I decided to stay at the school. I fasted and prayed about the exam
schedule, but the teachers could do nothing without the director’s permis-
sion. It was a difficult situation, but by trusting God and praying much, I
was able to take enough exams to pass on to the third year.
   By this time my Adventist friends had finished their studies. I was the
only Adventist still at the school. I held evangelistic meetings to introduce
teachers and students to Adventist beliefs, especially about the Sabbath.
The meetings focused on Jesus and drew about eighty people, including two
teachers. After that, it was easier to get Sabbaths off. Two students wanted
to know more about Adventists and why we are so firm in our beliefs. I
explained the Sabbath from before Creation right through to Revelation and
invited them to church. Both of them have since been baptized.
   I completed my studies at last, and the new Adventists who now attend
this school are able to get Sabbaths off because of the groundwork we laid
for them.
   Your mission offerings brought the news of Jesus to my country and to
me. Now we share that news with others. Thank you for your help.

          LESSON            3      *January 10–16


      Spiritual Gifts and
      Prophecy


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 2:1–11; Rom. 12:6–8;
      1 Cor. 1:6, 7; 13:9; Eph. 4:11; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.

Memory Text: “There are diversities of gifts, but the same
      Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. And
      there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works
      all in all” (1 Corinthians 12:4–6, NKJV).

            eventh-day Adventists believe in the existence of spiritual gifts.

      S     We’re not alone either. Many charismatic and Pentecostal churches
            have claimed to see the manifestation of spiritual gifts among
      themselves. Some of these have included people in church, making
      noises like animals (lions, donkeys, dogs, even chickens!), as well as
      the utterances of prognostications and prophecies, such as the time it
      was prophesied that God blew up the space shuttle Challenger in
      order to teach America a lesson because there was a public school-
      teacher on board. (Apparently, someone believed that God doesn’t like
      public schoolteachers.)
        As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe in the gifts of the Spirit,
      including prophecy, but we also believe that everything should be
      tested by the Word of God. This week, using the Word, we’ll take a
      closer look at some of these gifts.

The Week at a Glance: What is the purpose of spiritual
      gifts? How are they manifested? What about the gift of tongues?
      What does the Bible teach about counterfeit gifts?

      Spiritual Gifts
      “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evan-
      gelists; and some, pastors and teachers” (Eph. 4:11).

        Spiritual gifts (Greek charismata) are known as spiritual because
      they originate with the Holy Spirit, who apportions them to each
      according to His will (1 Cor. 12:11). In addition, the Holy Spirit is
      given to Christians so that they may understand and appreciate these
      gifts (1 Cor. 2:10–13).

Paul provides four lists of spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6–8; 1 Cor. 12:8–10,
      28–30; Eph. 4:11, 12). What is the purpose of spiritual gifts? Why
      were they given?
      ___________________________________________________________________

      ___________________________________________________________________

         According to the New Testament, spiritual gifts are given for the
      completion of the mission entrusted to the church. This includes the
      nurture and edification of the church, as well as the proclamation of
      the gospel to the world. The existence of these gifts should serve as a
      constant reminder of our utter dependence upon the Lord in order for
      us to do the work He has called us to do.
         From the Gospels we know that the apostles possessed spiritual
      gifts even prior to Pentecost. In Luke 9:1, Jesus “gave them power and
      authority over all demons, and to cure diseases” (NKJV), and in
      Matthew 10:8 He charged them to “heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
      raise the dead, cast out demons” (NKJV). Then at Pentecost they were
      filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues (Acts 2:1–4). This
      seems to indicate that it is possible to receive more than one baptism
      of the Holy Spirit.

       How have spiritual gifts been manifested in your own church?
       What has been the fruits of these gifts? What can you do to help
       nurture these gifts in your local congregation? Bring your
       answers to class on Sabbath for discussion.

     Spiritual Gifts in the Church Today
        These days we find two views among Christians in regard to the
     permanency of spiritual gifts. Some believe that edifying gifts, such as
     knowledge, wisdom, teaching, exhortation, faith, and mercy, are per-
     manent gifts but that the sign gifts, such as prophecy, healing, tongues,
     and miracles, ceased with the death of the apostles. Defenders of this
     view claim: “The sign gifts had a unique purpose: to give the apostles
     credentials, that is, to let the people know that these men all spoke the
     truth of God. Once the Word of God was inscripturated, the sign gifts
     were no longer needed and they ceased.”—John F. MacArthur, Jr.,
     Charismatic Chaos (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1993), p. 199.
     Other Christians believe that all the spiritual gifts will be present in
     the church until the Lord comes.

What do the following texts say about the permanence of spiritual
     gifts? 1 Cor. 1:6, 7; 13:9, 10; Eph. 4:11–13.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        According to Paul, the charismata, the spiritual gifts, will be in the
     church until Jesus comes, but does this mean that all the gifts will be
     present all the time?
        The church father Irenaeus (A.D. 120–195) wrote about the presence
     and operation of spiritual gifts even in his day. Thus, according to
     Irenaeus, spiritual gifts were still in evidence at the end of the second
     century A.D.
        During the next two centuries, however, the church suffered a seri-
     ous spiritual and theological deterioration, and the spiritual gifts
     largely disappeared. During the time of the Reformation, beginning
     with John Wycliffe in England, God used the Reformers to restore
     neglected truth, and they certainly had the gifts of knowledge, wis-
     dom, and teaching. None of the main Reformers, though, claimed to
     have the prophetic gift. This particular gift, according to Revelation
     12:17, was to be manifested again in the end-time remnant church.

      Paul says in Ephesians 4:12 that spiritual gifts are given “for the
      equipping of the saints for the work of ministry” (NKJV). What
      kind of equipping is Paul referring to, and in what way do you
      see this happening in the church today?

     Counterfeit Gifts
What does the Bible teach about counterfeit gifts and their origin?
     Matt. 7:22, 23; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10; Rev. 16:13, 14.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        By the power of God, Moses and Aaron, standing before Pharaoh,
     turned a staff into a snake (Exod. 7:10), the river Nile into blood (vs. 20),
     and made frogs come out of the Nile to cover the land (Exod. 8:6); but
     by the power of Satan the Egyptian magicians could do the same.
     However, from the third plague onward the Egyptian magicians were
     unable to counterfeit God’s miracles.
        This teaches us two things: (1) Satan can produce miracles that look
     like the genuine article, and (2) Satan can work only within the limits
     set by God.
        Counterfeit gifts are not just a perversion of the true gifts of God
     but can be similar manifestations from a different source—Satan.
        A study of the texts listed above should reveal to us a few other
     important points about the existence of counterfeit spiritual gifts.
     First, as we can see, these false manifestations can be done by those
     professing the name of Jesus; indeed, as Jesus said, many will claim
     to do some miracles in His name. And yet, according to Jesus, they are
     not of Him.
        Second, there will be miracles, miraculous signs and wonders, pow-
     erful enough to deceive many. In other words, we need to be very care-
     ful not to be swept away by the existence of the supernatural. Even
     though something is done in the name of Jesus and appears to be
     supernatural doesn’t mean it’s a genuine gift of the Spirit.
        Finally, in the end, Satan is working to do what he can to deceive as
     many people as possible. Thus, whatever manifestations that do appear,
     we always must test them by the Bible. If they are not in harmony with
     the Word of God, we have our answer, regardless of how impressive
     the manifestations appear to be. The Bible must be our ultimate stan-
     dard.

      With these thoughts in mind, what are we to make of these min-
      istries that claim to manifest all sorts of prophecies, healing, and
      wonders week after week? Without wanting to judge anyone,
      why should we be leery? What kind of questions should we ask,
      and why?




                                                                              25

      The Gift of Prophecy
        The French physician Michel de Notredame (1503–1566), known
      as Nostradamus, supposedly predicted the great fire of London of 1666
      with the words: “The blood of the just will be demanded of London,
      burnt by the fire in the year 66.” (http://www.armageddonline.org/
      nostradamus.php [Accessed January 29, 2007.]) The Irish seer Cheiro
      warned journalist W. T. Stead in 1894 and again in 1911 that he would
      drown in April 1912. Stead died when the Titanic sank in April 1912.
      In 1956 Jean Dixon published a vision in which she said she saw that
      a Democrat would be elected president of the United States in 1960,
      only to be assassinated in office. John Kennedy, a Democrat elected
      in 1960, was assassinated in 1963 while in office.

How can we account for these exact predictions by people who had lit-
      tle in common with the biblical prophets? Isa. 8:19, Acts 16:16,
      2 Cor. 11:14.

        Ever since Satan used the snake in the Garden of Eden to deceive
      Eve, he has used a variety of human agents to deceive men and
      women, including the giving of predictions that have come true.
      Which means, then, that the fulfillment of a prediction is not a guar-
      antee that it is a true prophecy from God.
        Nevertheless, prophets and prophecies play an important part in the
      plan of salvation. This point is made clear in the Bible.

Prophecy, or the prophetic office, is listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8–10
      as one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. It appears first on the list in
      Romans 12:6 and second, after apostleship, in both 1 Corinthians
      12:28–30 and Ephesians 4:11. What makes the prophetic gift so
      important that it is the only gift that is mentioned in all four lists
      of spiritual gifts or ministries?
      ___________________________________________________________________
      ___________________________________________________________________

        The purpose of the prophetic gift is to provide a means of commu-
      nication between the Creator and His creatures. Prophetic messages in
      Scripture have unveiled the future (Daniel 2), counseled and reproved
      kings (Isa. 7:3, 4), warned of coming judgments (Jer. 1:14–16), called
      for revival (Joel 2:12, 13), and encouraged and comforted God’s peo-
      ple (Isa. 40:1, 2).
        Prophets were men and women who spoke the word of God to their
      generations. The emphasis in the prophetic gift was not on predicting
      the future (although this was one of the marks of a true prophet) but
      on setting forth what God wanted His people to hear.

      Spiritual Gifts and 1 Corinthians 14
        The church in Corinth had many problems: division, immorality,
      court cases among believers, marriage problems, and the abuse of the
      Lord’s Supper. Another problem concerned spiritual gifts, particularly
      the use of the gift of tongues (1 Cor. 14:1–5).

What was the gift of tongues in the book of Acts? Going solely by
      what these verses in Acts 2:1–11 say, what kind of languages were
      being spoken?
      ___________________________________________________________________

      ___________________________________________________________________

What were the tongues spoken in the church in Corinth? 1 Cor. 14:1–25.
      ___________________________________________________________________

      ___________________________________________________________________

        When we apply the principle Scripture interprets Scripture, which
      means obscure passages are explained by plain ones, we have to con-
      clude that the tongues in 1 Corinthians 14 are of the same nature as
      the tongues in the book of Acts, especially because the same Greek
      word glossa is used for tongues in both books. In other words, the evi-
      dence is that tongues in both places were the supernatural ability to
      speak in foreign languages. Some understand the gift to apply also to
      instances in which a person speaking in one language is understood in
      another language or languages by those listening. In either case, this
      undoubtedly rules out the common and popular notion of tongues
      today, in which people babble in unknown languages.
        Also, God works through man’s intelligence. Would the Lord, who
      warned us against babbling on as the heathen do (Matt. 6:7, NEB),
      inspire unknown noises? In 1 Corinthians 14:22, tongues are a sign to
      unbelievers as at Pentecost, and how could someone uttering noises
      that no one understands be a sign to unbelievers? Tongues, as Acts 2
      shows, are real languages, given for the purpose of building up the
      church. Furthermore, spiritual gifts were given for the common good
      (1 Cor. 12:7), ruling out using a gift purely for personal gratification,
      as the so-called modern gifts of tongues are used today.
        In spite of all the manifestations of ecstatic speech today, nowhere
      does the Bible teach that the gift of tongues is anything other than
      human languages. Modern tongues-speaking, called glossolalia, is not
      the same as the biblical gift of languages.

       Think about the words you speak on a daily basis. How much is
       meaningful, purposeful talk, and how much is nonsensical banter?
                                                                           27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Pentecost,” pp. 35–46, in
         The Acts of the Apostles.

           “The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented
         in the parable. It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original
         or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ’s
         service. In becoming His disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him
         with all that we are and have. These gifts He returns to us purified and
         ennobled, to be used for His glory in blessing our fellow men.”—Ellen
         G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 328.
1          “The man who makes the working of miracles the test of his faith
         will find that Satan can, through a species of deceptions, perform
         wonders that will appear to be genuine miracles.”—Ellen G. White,
         Selected Messages, book 2, p. 52.
           “Some of these persons have exercises which they call gifts and say
         that the Lord has placed them in the church. They have an unmeaning
2        gibberish which they call the unknown tongue, which is unknown not
         only by man but by the Lord and all heaven. Such gifts are manufac-
         tured by men and women, aided by the great deceiver. Fanaticism,
         false excitement, false talking in tongues, and noisy exercises have
         been considered gifts which God has placed in the church. Some have
         been deceived here.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
         vol. 1, p. 412.

          of gifts are manifested in your local church? How can you take
          better advantage of what you have? Most important, how are
          these gifts being used?

          ●
          2 Pentecostal Christians believe that speaking in tongues is the
          evidence that a person is filled with the Holy Spirit. According to
          Scripture, what is the true evidence of a Spirit-filled life? See
          Gal. 5:22, 23.

          ●
          3 What are some of the supernatural manifestations common in
          your culture and your part of the world? What seems to be the
          fruit of these manifestations? What are ways that you, as a
          church, cannot only protect other church members from being
          deceived but also help others outside the church be aware of the
          potential dangers inherent in these manifestations?

          ●4 Discuss what Ellen G. White says in the first quote listed
          above. What does she mean about the gifts being “purified and
          ennobled”? What is she talking about? Can people have gifts that
          are used for wrong purposes? Explain.

Not Afraid
by ARASH*
   I am a refugee living in a Middle Eastern country. I was imprisoned
when I refused to work on a project involving chemical warfare. There I
met someone who helped me escape and flee the country.
   I applied to the United Nations for refugee status and hid in the city
while the paperwork was processed. There I met a Christian couple who
really impressed me. Although I had grown up in a religious country, I did
not practice religion. But I could see the difference their God made in their
lives. I accepted their invitation to worship with them in their house
church though I did not intend to become a Christian. I did not understand
a lot of what the man said, but his life and behavior made me want to know
about God. I began to read the Bible they gave me.
   When the government learned that I was a refugee and knew military
secrets about my homeland, they pressed me to talk. I refused. They threat-
ened me, beat me, and put a gun to my head; but still I refused to talk. My
Christian friends prayed for my safety, and one day the interrogator told
me to leave the city if I wanted to live. He actually helped me leave the
city. I made my way to the capital city.
   When I arrived, I missed my Christian friends. I started worshiping in a
Protestant church, but I noticed that they did not have the same love in
their lives. I remembered how my friends who had introduced me to Jesus
lived like Jesus. I kept searching.
   Then one day I met a Christian woman and saw God’s love in her life.
She invited me to worship with a small group, and I accepted. I watched
the people and realized that these Christians lived what they preached, as
my friends had.
   The pastor asked me to translate The Desire of Ages, and the book
changed my life. I realized that the Old Testament is the foundation for the
New Testament. Reading just the New Testament is like reading only the
last half of a book and trying to understand it. I realized that I had found
the true church that followed God’s Word.
   The church members are not perfect, but they seek to follow God’s
Word. I want to be like Jesus, to serve people, teach people, and help peo-
ple, no matter who or where they are. I will go where God leads me, even
back to my homeland. I am not afraid.
   Please pray for me; pray for the people in my homeland and the people
in my adopted country. They need to meet Jesus, for they are His children;
they just don’t know it yet.

      The Gift of Prophecy and
      God’s Remnant Church




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Revelation 12; 14:1–12.

Memory Text: “And the dragon was enraged with the woman,
      and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep
      the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus
      Christ” (Revelation 12:17, NKJV).

             he remnant theme first appears with Noah and his family (Gen.

      T      7:23) and resurfaces in the history of Israel. The apostle Paul
             refers to a remnant (Rom. 11:5) that was then constituted of
      Jews who had accepted Jesus and who later became the nucleus of the
      Christian church. In the book of Revelation a remnant appears in the
      churches of Thyatira (Rev. 2:24) and Sardis (Rev. 3:4). It appears also
      in chapter 12—the subject of our study this week.
        God’s faithful remnant was not always a visible remnant; that is,
      from the early days up to the last days, God has His faithful ones in
      different faiths, which is why the call is made: “ ‘Come out of her
      [Babylon], my people’ ” (Rev. 18:4). Nevertheless, there is a specific
      depiction of God’s remnant in the last days.

The Week at a Glance: What do the symbols in Revelation
      12 represent? What events in history can be seen as a fulfillment
      of this chapter? What is the meaning of the phrases “the testi-
      mony of Jesus” and “the spirit of prophecy”?

                S UNDAY January 18

     Good Versus Evil: Act 1
Read Revelation 12:1–6. What’s happening here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Revelation 12 introduces the great controversy between Christ and
     Satan in symbolic form and describes its progress from the time of
     Christ to the time of the end. In verse 1 John sees a dazzling sight—a
     pregnant woman, “clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet”
     (NKJV), and wearing a crown of 12 stars. He calls the appearance a
     “great sign” (NKJV), indicating that the woman is more than a mere
     woman. She is a symbol for the church or for God’s faithful people
     (see Isa. 54:5, 6; 2 Cor. 11:2). The woman’s dazzling appearance links
     her to Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness (Mal. 4:2, Rev. 1:16).

According to Revelation 12:6, the woman flees from the dragon
     into the wilderness, where she is taken care of by God for 1,260
     days. What is this talking about, and what do the 1,260 days sym-
     bolize? Dan. 7:25, Rev. 12:14, 13:5.

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Until the nineteenth century, most students of prophecy used the
     year-day principle, and so they understood the 1,260 days to refer to
     the time of persecution of the church during the Middle Ages, a period
     of 1,260 years.
       And with good reason, too. First, the whole section is filled with
     symbols that aren’t taken literally, so why should the time element be
     taken literally, as well? Second, the various time phrases used in Daniel
     and Revelation—“time and times and half a time” (Dan. 7:25, 12:7,
     Rev. 12:14, NKJV), “forty-two months” (Rev. 11:2, 13:5, NKJV), and
     “one thousand two hundred and sixty days” (Rev. 11:3, 12:6, NKJV)—
     are not the natural way of expressing a literal three and one-half years
     (see Luke 4:25, James 5:17). For these reasons and others, Seventh-
     day Adventists (in contrast to most other Christians today) interpret
     the 1,260 days as 1,260 years and see it as a reference to the period of
     papal supremacy from the sixth to the end of the eighteenth century.

      What are some of the symbols prevalent in your own society and
      culture? What purpose do they serve? What is the advantage
      (and disadvantage) of them? How do you use symbols in your
      everyday life? How does the way symbols are used around you
      help you better understand the way the Bible uses symbols?


                                                                           31
                 M ONDAY January 19

      Good Versus Evil: Act 2
        Revelation 12:7–12 is an interlude in the story; it focuses on the fall
      of Satan in heaven and his being cast down to the earth. Hence, we are
      given a glimpse into the origins of the great controversy as it began in
      another part of the universe. The back-and-forth between heaven and
      earth should tell us how closely events in one impact events in the
      other. Truly, we are in the midst of a cosmic battle!

Revelation 12:13–17 picks up the story from verse 6 and
      describes in symbolic terms the persecution of the Christian
      church, first by the Roman Empire and later by the apostate
      Roman Church. What do the symbols here represent?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In these verses, a flood of water is sent against God’s people, a sym-
      bol of persecuting armies (Jer. 46:7, 8; 47:2; Dan. 9:26). In contrast,
      in Revelation 12:16 the earth is described as helping the persecuted
      church. In 1620, the first pilgrims, fleeing the religious persecution in
      Europe, arrived on the American continent. On this newly discovered
      continent, they found a safe haven where the persecuting armies of the
      European powers could not reach them. Thus, symbolically, the new
      continent America swallowed up the persecuting armies.
        In Revelation 12:17, we are now in the time after the 1,260-day
      period (which ended at the close of the eighteenth century). Satan,
      seeing that he was unable to wipe out God’s faithful people, is angry
      with a particular group called “the rest of her offspring” (NKJV) or
      “the remnant of her seed” (KJV).

Read carefully Revelation 12:17. What is the first identifying mark of
      this special remnant? How do the following texts help us under-
      stand what “the commandments of God” mean? Matt. 24:20, Rom.
      3:31, Eph. 6:1, James 2:9–11, 1 John 3:4.


        How much simpler could God have made it? This end-time remnant
      will be distinguished, first of all, by the fact that it keeps the com-
      mandments of God, all of them, which, of course, includes the sev-
      enth-day Sabbath.

       How firm are you in your own mind regarding God’s call that
       we keep His commandments? How can you be sure that the
       Lord commands us to keep them? How do you respond to argu-
       ments against keeping the commandments, especially the
       Sabbath?

                T UESDAY January 20

      The Testimony of Jesus
        The second identifying mark of the remnant church is “the testi-
      mony of Jesus” (marturia Iesou). This expression occurs six times in
      the book of Revelation (Rev. 1:2, 9; 12:17; 19:10; 20:4, NIV).

What is the meaning of the phrase “the testimony of Jesus” in the fol-
      lowing texts? Rev. 1:2, 9; 19:10; 20:4, NIV.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Two grammatically possible explanations concerning its meaning
      have been put forward. The first view interprets “the testimony of
      Jesus” as man’s witness for Christ (NEB, RSV). The second view
      understands “the testimony of Jesus” as the self-revelation of Jesus—
      His own testimony (NIV, NKJV).
         A study of the word testimony in John’s writings indicates that each
      time it appears in the same grammatical construction as in Revelation,
      it always refers to Jesus’ own testimony (John 1:19; 3:11, 32, 33;
      5:31). In contrast, the idea of witnessing about somebody in John’s
      writings consistently is expressed by a different grammatical con-
      struction.
         In the book of Revelation, therefore, the expression “testimony of
      Jesus” also should be understood as Jesus’ testimony about Himself
      and not the remnant’s testimony about Him. This is borne out by a
      study of the texts in Revelation themselves. Revelation 1:2 says that
      John bore witness to “the word of God” and to “the testimony of
      Jesus.” Thus, “the word of God” refers to what God says and is paral-
      lel to “the testimony of Jesus.” Thus, “the word of God” is simply
      what Jesus says; it is the testimony that Jesus gives about Himself.
         The same is true in Revelation 1:9. John introduces himself, states
      his credentials, and says that he is on the island of Patmos because of
      “the word of God” and “the testimony of Jesus.” The parallelism
      between the “word of God” and “the testimony of Jesus” is again
      clearly discernible. Thus, according to the principle of interpreting
      scripture with scripture, every text in the book of Revelation where the
      phrase “testimony of Jesus” appears always refers to Jesus’ own testi-
      mony.

       How has Jesus revealed Himself to you? Would you like to know
       Him better? What is the only way you can?



                                                                          33
         W EDNESDAY January 21

     The Spirit of Prophecy
Revelation 19:10 says, “ ‘ For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
     of prophecy.’ ” In all of Scripture the phrase “spirit of prophecy”
     appears only in this text. What does it mean? 1 Cor. 12:8–10, 28;
     Eph. 4:11.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The closest parallel to the phrase “spirit of prophecy” in the Bible
     is found in 1 Corinthians 12:8–10. There Paul refers to the Holy Spirit,
     who gives the gift of prophecy among other gifts (charismata), and
     the person who receives this gift is called a prophet.
        Now, just as in 1 Corinthians 12:28, those who have the gift of
     prophecy (verse 10 of the same chapter) are called prophets—in
     Revelation 22:8, 9 those who have the spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10)
     are also called prophets.
        “And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, ‘See that
     you do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who
     have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus
     is the spirit of prophecy’ ” (Rev. 19:10, NKJV).
        “I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me
     these things. Then he said to me, ‘See that you do not do that. For I am
     your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those
     who keep the words of this book. Worship God’ ” (Rev. 22:8, 9, NKJV).
        The situation in both passages is the same. John falls at the feet of
     the angel to worship. The words of the angel’s response are almost
     identical, yet the difference is significant. In Revelation 19:10, the
     brethren are identified by the phrase “who hold to [have] the testi-
     mony of Jesus” (NIV). In Revelation 22:9, the brethren are called sim-
     ply “prophets.”
        If the Protestant principle of interpreting scripture by scripture
     means anything, this comparison must lead to the conclusion that “the
     spirit of prophecy” in Revelation 19:10 is the prophetic gift, which is
     given not to church members in general but only to those who have
     been called by God to be prophets.
        This is not purely an Adventist interpretation. Lutheran scholar
     Hermann Strathmann says about “brothers who have the testimony of
     Jesus” (NJKV) in 19:10: “According to the parallel 22:9 the brothers
     referred to are not believers in general, but the prophets. . . . If they
     have the marturia Iesou [the testimony of Jesus], they have the spirit
     of prophecy, i.e., they are prophets.”—Theological Dictionary of the
     New Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1967), vol. 4, p. 501.

            T HURSDAY January 22

     The Remnant Church
        From our study thus far, we understand that in Revelation 12:17
     “the rest of her offspring” (NKJV) refers to God’s visible remnant
     church that can be recognized by two specific characteristics: (1) they
     “keep the commandments of God” as God has given them on Mount
     Sinai, including the Sabbath commandment, and (2) they “have the
     testimony of Jesus Christ,” which is the Spirit of prophecy, or the
     prophetic gift.
        The Sabbath-keeping Adventist movement, from even before its
     organization in 1863, always has claimed these identifying signs for
     itself. As Adventists we proclaim the Ten Commandments, including
     the seventh-day Sabbath; and we believe that as a church we have the
     testimony of Jesus; that is, that God manifested Himself in the life and
     work of Ellen G. White.
        Thus, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is not just one church
     among many. It is a church prophetically foreseen. God has called this
     church into existence for a very specific purpose—to proclaim the
     three angels’ messages to a dying world.

Read Revelation 14:6–12. What is happening there that helps us
     understand some of the characteristics of God’s end-time people?
     What elements come into play, and in what ways are we justified
     in seeing ourselves and our calling there?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe that we are members of God’s
     remnant church. However, this identification with the remnant church
     does not accord us an exclusive status with God. We can be part of this
     corporate remnant and still be lost. Salvation is not guaranteed
     through membership in any church. We are saved as individuals, not
     as a church. It’s a great privilege and responsibility, being part of this
     church, because we have a sacred calling; but being a member of this
     church no more guarantees salvation than being a Hebrew in ancient
     Israel did (Jer. 8:20).


      What is your only guarantee of salvation, and how can you have
      it as your own?


                                                                           35
                      F RIDAY January 23

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Spirit of Prophecy,” pp.
         7–16, in The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1; “Historical Prologue,” pp. vii-
         xxxii, in Early Writings.

            “One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an iden-
         tifying mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry
         of Ellen G. White—the Lord’s messenger. Her writings are a continu-
         ing and authoritative source of truth which provide for the church
         comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear
         that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience
         must be tested.”—Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . (2nd ed.,)
1        (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing Association, 2005), p. 247.
            A study of the idea of the remnant in the Old Testament reveals a
         few interesting characteristics. Perhaps the most important one is that
         all through the Bible, the remnant were those who were living with
         more light than others. Noah had the light about the coming flood.
         Abraham had the light about the true God. The nation of Israel was
2        worshiping the Lord in the sanctuary, while their pagan neighbors
         were sacrificing children on their altars or bowing down to statues of
         cats and bulls and other animals. In short, the idea of the remnant had
         more to do with a revelation of truth and of God’s character than with
         the holiness of those who had that knowledge. The point? As
         expressed in Thursday’s lesson, being part of the remnant means only
         that you have great light, and with that light comes important respon-
         sibilities. It does not mean you automatically have salvation; nor does
3        it mean that those who aren’t part of the remnant are lost. It’s an unfor-
         tunate fact of sacred history that many of those who were part of
         God’s remnant not only failed to live up to the light they were given
         but oftentimes rebelled against it.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What important message is found in Luke 12:48 for those who
          believe that they are part of the remnant church?

          ●
          2 The claim that we are the “remnant church” can sound very
          arrogant and exclusive. And yet, why does it make sense that God
          would have a special people with a special message in the last
          days? Or does it? Discuss.

          ●
          3 If being in the remnant does not guarantee salvation, then
          what’s the advantage of being part of it?

I Love to Preach!
by ARNEL BLANC
   I didn’t grow up in the Adventist Church. But God led me to this church
in a wonderful way.
   A Protestant pastor in town knew a little about Adventists, but he
refused to acknowledge their teachings. Then he had a dream in which
God told him to preach the fourth commandment or risk being lost forever.
The pastor preached the Sabbath truth in his church, and I accepted the
message.
   Several months later I was baptized and started preaching. Preaching,
for me, was my gift to God, and He blessed my efforts. An Adventist
leader in the area urged me to study theology at the Adventist university.
So I enrolled.
   During school breaks, I returned home and preached and gave Bible
studies. During one of my home visits, I studied with a young woman who
was baptized. We were friends, but neither of us had any idea that it would
go beyond that. Then God spoke to her and showed her that we were to be
married. She resisted, but God persisted, and in time we married.
   We now work in an exciting area. Our town is a political hot spot in
Haiti. Sometimes things get so tense that people fear to leave their homes.
But even during these tense times, people come to our evangelistic meet-
ings. We preach and pray, and hundreds come. After one meeting 72 peo-
ple were baptized! This difficult area has yielded more baptisms in a given
year than anywhere else in Haiti.
   I love evangelism! I want to preach and evangelize so that everyone in
our area will know that Jesus is coming again.
   I have eight congregations; the largest has 400 members. But there are
still places where we have no Adventist believers. My wife and I have a
burden to reach those areas, to bring God’s light to the dark corners of
Haiti.
   In Haiti we have one Seventh-day Adventist for every 28 people! Yet
there are places where not one Adventist lives. Haitian people love the
gospel, and many Adventist laypeople want to reach out and preach to
those who do not know that Jesus is coming again. But the political and
economic situations here make it difficult to reach these people. We want
Jesus to come soon, and we ask that you pray for the people of Haiti and
continue to help us reach them for Christ through your mission offerings.
Then we will be ready for Jesus to come. Hallelujah!


PASTOR ARNEL and JUQUELANDE BLANC share their faith in southern Haiti.

      The Inspiration of the
      Prophets


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 36:1–4; 1 Thess.

      is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruc-
      tion in righteousness” (2 Timothy 3:16).

             hristians have long debated the question, What does it mean

      C      when we say that the Bible is inspired? For Seventh-day
             Adventists there is, in addition, the question of the inspiration
      of Ellen G. White. In 1906, she wrote a letter to an Adventist physi-
      cian in which she refuted the idea that every word she wrote was as
      inspired as the Ten Commandments: “My brother, you have studied
      my writings diligently, and you have never found that I have made any
      such claims, neither will you find that the pioneers in our cause ever
      made such claims.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 24.
      This week we will study some of the issues surrounding the question
      of inspiration.

The Week at a Glance: What is the difference between
      inspiration and revelation? What is the difference between verbal
      and thought inspiration? Can prophets get help from others when
      they write? What are some examples of prophets quoting sources
      outside the Bible?

     Revelation-Inspiration
Study 2 Timothy 3:16 and 2 Peter 1:20, 21. What do these texts tell
     us about the divine activity in the production of the books of the
     Bible?
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        In 2 Timothy 3:16 Paul says that the Bible is theopneustos (God-
     breathed). In the Latin translation of the Bible the text reads, scriptura
     divinitus inspirata, from which we get the English word inspired. Paul
     is saying that the Bible had its origin in an activity of the Holy Spirit.
     Through visions and dreams, the Holy Spirit revealed truth to the
     prophets (revelation), and then He ensured, through His guidance in
     the writing process (inspiration), that what the prophet wrote was in
     harmony with what God had revealed.
        Second Peter 1:21 tells us that “men spoke from God as they were
     carried along by the Holy Spirit” (NIV). As a ship is carried along by
     the wind, the biblical writers were moved by the Holy Spirit. Thus,
     revelation-inspiration refers to that process whereby the Holy Spirit
     revealed to the prophets what God wanted them to know and then
     guided them in the proclamation of that message. Some spoke the
     word; others wrote it down. The written form became the inspired
     (God-breathed) Scripture.
        Although in the New Testament the apostles did not claim inspira-
     tion as frequently as did the Old Testament writers, it is obvious that
     they regarded their messages as given by divine authority. Paul, for
     example, wrote, “These things we also speak, not in words which
     man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches” (1 Cor.
     2:13, NKJV), and “When you received the word of God which you
     heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in
     truth, the word of God” (1 Thess. 2:13, NKJV).
        Yet, the Bible is also a human book. At face value it bears all the hall-
     marks of human authorship. Authors in recording their own experiences
     refer to themselves with personal pronouns (Neh. 1:1–11, Dan. 10:1–9,
     Gal. 1:12–20), the customs and traditions of the authors’ times are seen
     in the writings, and some of the psalms and proverbs reflect the litera-
     ture and culture of the surrounding nations. In short, though inspired by
     the Lord, the Bible also reflects the humanness of its penmen.

      Of all the Bible authors, which one’s humanity comes through
      most clearly to you? In what ways can you sympathize and
      relate to that author purely on a human level? Bring your
      answer to class on Sabbath.

     Verbal or Thought Inspiration
What do the following texts tell us about inspiration in Scripture?
     Isa. 2:1, 2; Ezek. 36:16; 1 Cor. 7:10–12, 39, 40; 1 Thess. 2:13.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        Two important theories of inspiration are:
        Verbal Inspiration. The focus in verbal inspiration is on the words
     of the Bible rather than on the author. All the words are said to be
     inspired by God, who chooses from the vocabulary and educational
     background of the writer. According to this view, only the original
     writings of the biblical writers are inspired, not the copies, which
     might have errors. This view must be distinguished from the dictation
     theory of inspiration, in which every word in Scripture is dictated by
     the Holy Spirit without reference to the vocabulary and educational
     background of the writer.
        Thought Inspiration. The focus here is on the writers, not on the
     words. Primarily the thoughts, not so much the words of the Bible, are
     inspired (1 Cor. 7:10–12, 39, 40; 1 Thess. 2:13), except when the
     words of God or an angel are quoted (Jer. 29:30, 31; Rev. 19:9) or
     when God speaks directly through a prophet (Num. 22:35; 23:1–12,
     26). The writer receives the vision, dream, or thought and puts it down
     in writing in his own words (Isa. 2:1, 2; Rev. 4:1); the Holy Spirit
     ensures that the words used convey God’s truth correctly. The Bible,
     therefore, is declared to be the infallible revelation of God’s will.
        On the basis of Scripture and the writings of Ellen White, Adventists
     hold to thought inspiration. “It is not the words of the Bible that are
     inspired, but the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the
     man’s words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under the
     influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words
     receive the impress of the individual mind. The divine mind is dif-
     fused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human mind and
     will; thus the utterances of the man are the Word of God.”—Ellen G.
     White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 21. As the last sentence indi-
     cates, the words of the prophet become the Word of God. In the same
     vein David wrote, “The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and His word
     was on my tongue” (2 Sam. 23:2, NKJV). This indicates that inspira-
     tion not only imparted thoughts but ensured that the Written Word
     accurately conveyed God’s thoughts.

      Why is it important to have a correct understanding of how
      inspiration works? What are the dangers of holding wrong
      views?

     Visions and Physical Phenomena
What do the following texts tell us about how heavenly visions
     affected some biblical prophets? Dan. 10:7–9, 17, 18; Acts 9:1–5;
     Rev. 1:17.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        To stand in the presence of a heavenly being can be a powerful
     experience. Daniel, Saul (Paul), and John all fell to the ground when
     they received a heavenly vision. Daniel wrote, “No strength remained
     in me” (NKJV), and John said, “I fell at his feet as dead.”
        Ellen White describes her experience with these words: “As
     inquiries are frequently made as to my state in vision, and after I come
     out, I would say that when the Lord sees fit to give a vision, I am taken
     into the presence of Jesus and angels, and am entirely lost to earthly
     things. I can see no farther than the angel directs me.”—Selected
     Messages, book 1, p. 36.
        In 1868 her husband, James White, gave the following description of
     her physical appearance while in vision: “1. She is utterly unconscious
     of everything transpiring around her; 2. She does not breathe. . . .
     [This] has been repeatedly proved by pressing upon the chest, and by
     closing the mouth and nostrils; 3. Immediately on entering vision, her
     muscles become rigid, and joints fixed, so far as any external force can
     influence them; . . . 4. On coming out of vision, whether in the day-
     time or a well-lighted room at night, all is total darkness. Her power
     to distinguish even the most brilliant objects, held within a few inches
     of the eyes, returns but gradually.”—Life Incidents (Battle Creek,
     Mich.: Steam Press, 1868), p. 272.
        Many observed her during her visions. Joseph Bates, for example,
     wrote, “I have seen her in vision a number of times, and also in
     Topsham, Maine; and those who were present during some of those
     exciting scenes know well with what interest and intensity I listened
     to every word, and watched every move to detect deception or mes-
     meric influence. And I thank God for the opportunity I have had with
     others to witness these things. I can now confidently speak for myself.
     I believe the work is of God.”—Christian Experience and Teachings
     of Ellen G. White, p. 89.

      However impressive these physical manifestations might be,
      why must we not base our belief in her gift on them? What ulti-
      mately must be the final test of Ellen White’s prophetic calling?

     Inspiration and Literary Assistants
       Prophets were not God’s pens but His penmen. What they saw or
     heard in visions and dreams they wrote down according to the best of
     their ability. From Scripture we know that some of the biblical authors
     had secretaries to help them write down the messages of God.

Read Jeremiah 36:1–4, Romans 16:22, 1 Corinthians 16:21, Colossians
     4:15–18, and 2 Thessalonians 3:17. What do they tell us about the
     use of literary assistants?


        Thus, both Old Testament and New Testament writers used literary
     assistants or scribes to write down the messages God had given them.
        From New Testament times we know that at times scribes used a
     wax tablet to take down the gist of what the author wanted to say
     before they wrote a good copy of the letter. Prior to sending it, the
     author would go over the letter to make sure it conveyed to the reader
     what he wanted to say.
        Ellen White also used literary helpers. Here’s why:
        1. With formal schooling ending at the age of nine, she recognized
     her own limitations as a writer. “I am not a grammarian. I will try, if
     the Lord will help me, at forty-five years old to become a scholar in
     the science. God will help me. I believe He will.”—Ellen G. White,
     Selected Messages, book 3, p. 90. Thus, some of her assistants func-
     tioned as her copy editors.
        2. The great demand for her writings made it necessary for her to
     have literary help. “After my husband’s death, faithful helpers joined
     me, who labored untiringly in the work of copying the testimonies and
     preparing articles for publication.”—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 50.
        3. Because most of her books were not written as books but were
     put together from previously written material, she needed special
     assistance in their production. Marian Davis was Ellen White’s book-
     maker. “She takes my articles which are published in the papers, and
     pastes them in blank books. She also has a copy of all the letters I
     write. In preparing a chapter for a book, Marian remembers that I have
     written something on that special point, which may make the matter
     more forcible. She begins to search for this, and if when she finds it,
     she sees that it will make the chapter more clear, she adds it. The
     books are not Marian’s productions, but my own, gathered from all my
     writings.”—Selected Messages, book 3, p. 91.

      How does this understanding help us better grasp how inspira-
      tion works? What wrong views might you have held on the topic
      of inspiration?

     Inspiration and the Book of Luke
What does Luke say about how his Gospel came into existence, and
     what does this tell us about inspiration? Luke 1:1–4.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

        In writing his Gospel, Luke doesn’t seem to have relied on dreams
     or visions. Neither was he an eyewitness to the events he describes.
     Instead, he worked from what he had learned from others, all, no
     doubt, under the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit, which
     ensured that what he wrote down was in harmony with the historical
     events and God’s will.
        In the New Testament, the apostle Paul not only received informa-
     tion orally from others (1 Cor. 1:10, 11) but in a few places quoted
     from the writings of pagan authors. For example, in Acts 17:28 he
     quotes from the Cilician poet Aratus (ca. 315–240 B.C.) who wrote, “It
     is with Zeus that every one of us in every way has to do, for we are
     also his offspring.” See also 1 Corinthians 15:33 and Titus 1:12, where
     Paul quoted other sources, all in order to teach inspired truth.
        Ellen White from time to time used other books as sources for her
     own works. In the introduction to The Great Controversy she wrote:
     “The great events which have marked the progress of reform in past
     ages are matters of history, well known and universally acknowledged
     by the Protestant world; they are facts which none can gainsay. . . . In
     some cases where a historian has so grouped together events as to
     afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of the subject, or has summa-
     rized details in a convenient manner, his words have been quoted; but
     in some instances no specific credit has been given, since the quota-
     tions are not given for the purpose of citing that writer as authority,
     but because his statement affords a ready and forcible presentation of
     the subject. In narrating the experience and views of those carrying
     forward the work of reform in our own time, similar use has been
     made of their published works.”—Pages xi and x11.

      Prophets using other sources? Many people find that disturb-
      ing. What does this tell us, though, about how inspiration can
      work? If you think about it, what’s wrong with prophets under
      the guidance of the Holy Spirit going to other sources as a way
      of helping express truth?

                                                                          43

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Inspiration of the
         Prophetic Writers,” pp. 15–23, in Selected Messages, book 1.

            “Yet now when I send you a testimony of warning and reproof,
         many of you declare it to be merely the opinion of Sister White. You
         have thereby insulted the Spirit of God. You know how the Lord has
         manifested Himself through the Spirit of prophecy. Past, present, and
1
         future have passed before me. I have been shown faces that I had never
         seen, and years afterward I knew them when I saw them. I have been
         aroused from my sleep with a vivid sense of subjects previously pre-
         sented to my mind and I have written, at midnight, letters that have
         gone across the continent, and arriving at a crisis, have saved great
         disaster to the cause of God. This has been my work for many years.
2
         A power has impelled me to reprove and rebuke wrongs that I had not
         thought of. Is this work of the last thirty-six years from above or from
         beneath? . . .
            “. . . In these letters which I write, in the testimonies I bear, I am
         presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me. I do not
         write one article in the paper, expressing merely my own ideas. They
         are what God has opened before me in vision—the precious rays of
         light shining from the throne.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages,

         book 1, p. 27.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 As a class, read your answers to Sunday’s study and compare
          notes on which prophets members were able to relate 10. Which
          prophets were picked, and why?

          ●
          2 Some people have worked on the assumption that some parts
          of the Bible are more inspired than others. Though it’s true that
          some parts might be more relevant to us today than others, that’s
          radically different from the idea that some parts are more
          inspired than others. What’s the great danger of taking such a
          position? As you think about it, ask yourself the following ques-
          tions: Who decides which parts are more inspired than others?
          What criteria does one use to make that determination? Where
          does the authority to make these decisions come from? What
          happens when people disagree about which parts are more
          inspired than others?

          ●
          3 Think about the life and teachings of Ellen White during her
          long years of ministry. Despite the large amount of misinforma-
          tion out there about her and her ministry, and despite the fre-
          quency with which her writings have been abused, what great
          evidence and reasons do we have for believing in the reality of her
          prophetic gift?

Saved by a Watermelon
by HOMER TRECARTIN
   The 12 members of a small church in Dubuque, Iowa, planned evange-
listic meetings. They asked Elder Dave Weigley to lead out. For three
months before the meetings were scheduled to begin, the members prayed
for Elder Weigley, the meetings, and the people who were searching for
something better in their lives.
   As time for the meetings drew near, Pastor Weigley remembered a girl
he had studied with a year earlier in Florida. She wanted to clean up her
life and start over, but she didn’t know how to break free from her current
situation. She had thought about moving back to Iowa to be near her fam-
ily. She hoped that a move would give her the new start she needed.
   Weigley called the local elder in Florida and asked about the girl. The
elder remembered her first name, Sharon, but he couldn’t remember her
full name. He knew that she moved north, but he did not know where she
had gone. Weigley urged the local elder to pray for this girl. If she was in
the Dubuque area, he wanted to invite her to the meetings.
   On the first day of the meetings, a young woman entered the rented hall,
walked up to a greeter, and said, “Hi, I came to see Pastor Weigley.” The
greeter took her to the local pastor.
   “I am Pastor Wagly,” the man said, smiling.
   The young woman looked at him and said slowly, “No, you’re not the
man I’m looking for.”
   Laughing, the man said, “Oh, you mean the other Pastor Weigley. Our
names sound the same, but they are spelled differently. Let me take you to
Pastor Dave Weigley.” The pastor escorted the young woman to a back
room where Elder Dave Weigley was preparing his message. When the
two walked through the door, Pastor Weigley’s mouth dropped open.
“Sharon!” he exclaimed, “How did you come to be here?”
   Sharon laughed. “I moved here shortly after I met you last year. It’s been
good for me to start over again. Then yesterday my mom invited me over
for watermelon. She covered the table with newspapers to catch the juice,
and we sat down to eat and talk. As I was eating, my eye fell on an adver-
tisement for some prophecy meetings. Then I saw your name, and I
decided right then I had to come.”
   Sharon attended the meetings faithfully and was baptized.
   God doesn’t always send a bright light and loud voice to catch some-
one’s attention, as He did with Saul. Sometimes He uses simple things—
such as a juice-soaked newspaper ad on the kitchen table.

      Testing the Prophets




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 8:20; Jer. 18:6–10;
      Jonah 3; 4; Matt. 7:20; Gal. 2:11–14.

Memory Text: “Do not despise prophecies. Test all things; hold
      fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:20, 21, NKJV).

            undamental Belief number 18 states, “One of the gifts of the

      F     Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the
            remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G.
      White, the Lord’s messenger. Her writings are a continuing and
      authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort,
      guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the
      Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be
      tested.”—Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . (2nd ed.) (Nampa, Idaho:
      Pacific Press® Publishing Association, 2005), p. 247. (See Joel 2:28,
      29; Acts 2:14–21; Heb. 1:1–3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10).
         Although Mrs. White never called herself a prophetess, the church
      has recognized her as such. In 1905 she wrote: “Others have called me
      a prophetess, but I have never assumed that title. I have not felt that it
      was my duty thus to designate myself.”—Selected Messages, book 1,
      p. 36. This week we’ll look a little closer at her prophetic gift.

The Week at a Glance: How did God communicate to His
      prophets? What are the biblical tests of a true prophet? What is
      conditional prophecy? Are prophets infallible? Why do we believe
      that Ellen G. White’s visions and prophetic dreams were from God?

     Dreams and Visions
     “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit
     upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
     your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see
     visions” (Joel 2:28).

How did God communicate with individuals whom He called to
     prophetic office? Gen. 15:1, Num. 12:6–8, Dan. 7:1.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

       In Scripture we learn that God primarily used dreams and visions to
     communicate with His messengers. Prophetic dreams played an
     important role in the time of the patriarchs (Genesis 20–41), in the
     ministry of Daniel (Daniel 1–7), and in the Nativity narratives (Matt.
     1:20; 2:12, 19, 22). Visions frequently are mentioned in the writings
     of the prophets (Isa. 1:1, Ezek. 1:1, Dan. 8:1, Obad. 1:1, Nah. 1:1)
     and in the book of Acts (9:10, 10:3, 11:5, 16:9, 18:9).
        During her 70-year ministry (1844–1915) Ellen White received an
     estimated two thousand visions and prophetic dreams. “At times I am
     carried far ahead into the future and shown what is to take place. Then
     again I am shown things as they have occurred in the past. After I
     come out of vision I do not at once remember all that I have seen, and
     the matter is not so clear before me until I write, then the scene rises
     before me as was presented in vision, and I can write with free-
     dom.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 36.
       Often her visions were given while she was in the presence of others,
     who observed certain physical phenomena—she did not breathe, she had
     supernatural strength (no one could move her limbs), and she was uncon-
     scious of her surroundings. Adventists and non-Adventists have testified
     to the supernatural character of her visions. At the General Conference
     session in 1893, J. N. Loughborough said: “I have seen Sister White in
     vision about fifty times. . . . She has been examined while in vision by
     skillful physicians, and we have testimonials from them which declare
     that the phenomena of her visions are beyond their comprehension.”

      Agreement With the Bible
What is one of the most important tests of a true prophet? Isa. 8:20.
      Why should this be so important?
      ___________________________________________________________________

      ___________________________________________________________________

         Law (Heb. torah) is the common biblical term for the inspired writ-
      ings of Moses (Deut. 4:44, 31:9); the testimony refers to the witness
      of the prophets (2 Chron. 23:11, John 3:32). In other words, what a
      prophet says must harmonize with what God has revealed already.
      Though later prophets may reveal additional insights regarding the
      plan of salvation, they will not contradict what God has said before.
      God’s unchangeableness (Mal. 3:6) is at stake in His revelations to
      humanity.
         An example of this test of a true prophet is given in Jeremiah 28.
      Jeremiah prophesied that Israel would serve the king of Babylon 70
      years (Jer. 25:11). A few years into the 70 years, Hananiah the son of
      Azur claimed otherwise: “In the presence of the priests and of all the
      people, saying, ‘Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, say-
      ing: “I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Within two full
      years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the Lord’s house
      . . . with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,” says the
      Lord’ ” (Jer. 28:1–4, NKJV). Because this was not in harmony with
      what God had told Jeremiah previously, God gave another message to
      Jeremiah: “Hear now, Hananiah, the Lord has not sent you, but you
      make this people trust in a lie. Therefore thus says the Lord: ‘. . . This
      year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the
      Lord.’ So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh
      month” (Jer. 28:15–17, NKJV).
         Every true prophet has made the writings of previous prophets the
      benchmark for his or her own ministry. The same is true for Ellen
      White. Anyone familiar with her books can testify that she used
      Scripture profusely. She immersed herself in the Bible and constantly
      referred to the biblical text, and what she wrote is in agreement with
      the Bible. Although she was not a theologian and did not write an
      exegetical commentary on the Bible, her message is in harmony with
      the message of Scripture.

       Why must harmony with the Bible be our final test of every-
       thing moral, spiritual, and theological? Why must we have a
       final authority, especially in spiritual and theological matters?

     Fulfilled Prophecy
Read Jeremiah 18:6–10. What important principle regarding the ful-
     fillment of predictions is found here?


       The proof of a true prophet lies, in part, in the fulfillment of his or
     her predictions (see 1 Sam. 9:6, Jer. 28:9, Lam. 3:37). At the same
     time, though, not all predictions come to pass if the people involved
     have a change of heart. It’s what is known as conditional prophecy,
     and it’s important for us to understand.

Study Jonah 3 and 4. What must be taken into consideration in
     applying the test of fulfilled prophecy?


        The fulfillment of most prophecies (exceptions are the end-time
     prophecies of Daniel and Revelation) is dependent on the actions and
     attitudes of the people concerned. Jonah made the clear-cut statement,
     given to him from God, that in 40 days Nineveh would be “over-
     turned” (Jonah 3:4, NIV). Yet, it never happened. Was Jonah a false
     prophet? Of course not. Instead, the prophecy was conditional—its
     fulfillment depended upon how the people responded to the message
     God had given them.
        This principle may explain why a particular prophecy made by Ellen
     White did not come to pass. In 1856, Mrs. White declared: “I was
     shown the company present at the Conference. Said the angel: ‘Some
     food for worms, some subjects of the seven last plagues, some will be
     alive and remain upon the earth to be translated at the coming of Jesus.’ ”
     —Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 131, 132.
        All who were alive way back then are now, of course, dead. How do
     we explain this? The answer is conditional prophecy. We must remem-
     ber that she was told God’s kingdom could have come in her lifetime.
     In 1896 she wrote: “If those who claimed to have a living experience
     in the things of God had done their appointed work as the Lord
     ordained, the whole world would have been warned ere this, and the
     Lord Jesus would have come in power and great glory.”—Review and
     Herald, Oct. 6, 1896.
        In the last volume of the Testimonies for the Church, published in
     1909, she wrote, “If every soldier of Christ had done his duty, if every
     watchman on the walls of Zion had given the trumpet a certain sound,
     the world might ere this have heard the message of warning. But the
     work is years behind. While men have slept, Satan has stolen a march
     upon us.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 29. If we apply the
     principle of conditionality to her 1856 vision, the problem disappears.

     Confessing Jesus, the God-man
What was one of the issues John faced in his time; and what does he
     say is another mark of a true prophet? 1 John 4:1, 2.


        One of the problems in John’s day was the question over the human
     nature of Christ. Was He really flesh and blood, or did He, as some
     taught, only appear to have a body? To understand and confess that
     Jesus was truly human became so important to John that he declared
     it to be a test of a true prophet.
        This test is broader than simply believing that Jesus became a
     human being. It includes everything the Bible teaches about Jesus. He
     took on humanity for a purpose. He became man in order to live a sin-
     less life and then die for sinful humanity. But more than that, He
     became man so that after His resurrection and ascension He could
     minister for us in the heavenly sanctuary. Our High Priest is one who
     is able to understand us and can sympathize with our weaknesses,
     because He was tempted in every way human beings are tempted
     (Heb. 4:14, 15).
        Every true prophet will point people to Jesus, the God-man, who is
     the Savior and example of all humanity. Ellen G. White’s life was
     devoted to doing just that. She wrote, “Jesus Christ is everything to
     us,—the first, the last, the best in everything. Jesus Christ, His Spirit,
     His character, colors everything; it is the warp and woof, the very tex-
     ture of our entire being. . . . Christ is a living Saviour. Continuing to
     look unto Jesus, we reflect His image to all around us.”—Messages to
     Young People, p. 161.

Why is it so important that true prophets exalt Jesus Christ? Acts
     4:12.

       The ecumenical spirit and postmodern thinking have permeated
     almost all Christian churches today, in the process eroding the unique-
     ness of Christianity and especially the importance of Jesus Christ as
     Savior of the world. In contrast, Ellen White wrote: “The only hope
     for fallen man is to look to Jesus and receive Him as the only
     Saviour.”—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 367. “Only Bible truth and
     Bible religion will stand the test of the judgment.”—Fundamentals of
     Christian Education, p. 127. “Let us lift up Jesus, the Saviour of men.
     Talk of his love, tell of his power.”—Signs of the Times, March 18,
     1889. See also Friday’s study.

      The Orchard Test
What did Jesus say in the Sermon on the Mount about how true
      prophets can be identified? Matt. 7:20.


        The context of this statement is Jesus’ warning to the disciples to
      beware of false prophets (Matt. 7:15). Jesus applied the principle—
      that a good tree bears good fruit—to the life of the prophets. What
      kind of fruit do they bring forth? What influence do their teachings
      have on others?
        The orchard test takes time. Ellen White lived and worked for 70
      years under the critical eyes of millions of people, largely skeptical,
      doubtful, suspicious, and in some cases openly hostile. Errors, faults,
      and inconsistencies were and still are exposed with great satisfaction by
      her opponents. God alone is flawless; His messengers never are.

What do these texts tell us about the character flaws of some people who
      had the prophetic gift? Gen. 12:12, 13; Jon. 1:1–3; Acts 15:36–39;
      Gal. 2:11–14.

        Being a prophet, of course, does not make a person infallible or sin-
      less. Mrs. White made mistakes and had character weaknesses, as did
      other people, but the trend of her life was such that at her death a local
      non-Adventist newspaper reported, “The life of Mrs. White is an
      example worthy of emulation by all. . . . She was a humble, devout dis-
      ciple of Christ and ever went about doing good. . . . Her death marks
      the calling of another noted leader of religious thought and one whose
      almost ninety years were full to overflowing with good deeds, kind
      words and earnest prayers for all mankind.”—“Called to Her Reward,”
      St. Helena Star (Calif.), July 23, 1915.
        Some people have difficulties accepting her prophetic ministry
      because they stumble over certain details of her writings but fail to see
      the bigger picture: the way God used her to raise up this church, the
      many wonderful insights she received from God, and the contributions
      she has made to this church.

       What are the great advantages of having the prophetic gift mani-
       fested among us? What are potential challenges it brings?
                                                                            51

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Bible Prophets Wrote
         for Our Time,” pp. 338, 339, in Selected Messages, book 3; Arthur L.

         1827–1862.

            “As the subject was presented before me, the period of Christ’s min-
         istration seemed almost accomplished. Am I accused of falsehood
         because time has continued longer than my testimony seemed to indi-
         cate? How is it with the testimonies of Christ and His disciples? Were
         they deceived?
            “Paul writes to the Corinthians: ‘But this I say, brethren, the time is
2
         short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they
         had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that
         rejoice, as though they rejoiced not’ (1 Cor. 7:29, 30).
            “Again, in his epistle to the Romans, he says: ‘The night is far spent,
         the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and
         let us put on the armour of light’ (Rom. 13:12). . . .
            “The angels of God in their messages to men represent time as very
         short. Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that time has
3
         continued longer than we expected in the early days of this message.
         Our Saviour did not appear as soon as we hoped. But has the word of
         the Lord failed? Never! It should be remembered that the promises
         and threatenings of God are alike conditional.”—Ellen G. White,
         Selected Messages, book 1, p. 67.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Why have some Seventh-day Adventists lost confidence in
          Ellen White’s prophetic ministry? Could part of the problem be
          with how her work has been presented? Discuss.

          ●
          2 Take some of your favorite excerpts from her writings and read
          them again. What was it about them that you liked so much?
          What is the message she is giving in these sections? Bring your
          selections to class and share them.

          ●
          3 Some people use the writings of Ellen White as the final
          authority on every point. Why is that wrong? What great dangers
          does such an attitude present to our church? What are some ways
          this wonderful gift has been, and still is, abused in the church?
          What have been some of the results?

Excited About God
by NONHLANHLA KHUMALO
   I attend an Adventist secondary school in Zimbabwe. I love sharing my
faith with others, but it hasn’t always been that way. At first it was hard for
me to tell others what God was doing in my life. But as I prayed and stud-
ied the Bible, I became more certain of my faith and wanted to share it
with others. I started with my twin brother. He’s a Christian, but he didn’t
attend a Pathfinder camp I went to near Victoria Falls. At that camp I
learned to make prayer and Bible study part of each day. And I heard sto-
ries of miracles God was doing in people’s lives. I went home excited
about God.
   I started telling my brother what God meant to me. The more I shared,
the more eager I was for him to experience the joy of sharing his faith.
   When I started studying in this school, I joined the Christian Service
Band. We went to a village about an hour away to hold Sabbath services.
We rode in an open truck pulled by a tractor to reach the village. The dirt
road spit dust onto us, but we didn’t mind. We passed the time singing
songs and talking about God. When we arrived, we brushed the dust off
our clothes and entered the church. The church members knew we were
coming, but other villagers watched curiously as we walked into the
church.
   I was a little nervous my first time there, and I asked God to help me
teach the younger children their Bible lesson. We had no felts or no pic-
ture rolls, but the children listened carefully as we told them the Bible
story. Then I read the story of the boy Samuel from my Bible. Few of the
children prayed at home, so we taught them to pray and urged them to pray
every day at home. I was surprised at how little these children knew about
God and His love for them.
   After Sabbath School and church, we divided up into teams and visited
every home. We talked and prayed with the people and invited them to the
evangelistic meetings that would start soon in the village.
   It was late afternoon when we returned to the school, and I was hungry
and dusty. But I was happy that we could make a difference in the lives of
these villagers.
   I want to continue visiting that village and watch people respond to
God. In the meantime, I am praying that the people will see the light of
God’s love in our lives and in the lives of believers living in the village.
   I invite you to join us in sharing God’s love with these villagers through
your mission offerings and your prayers.

      The Work of the
      Prophets


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 22:1–14, Isaiah 53,
      Matt. 3:7–10, 1 Cor. 5:1–5.

Memory Text: “By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of
      Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved” (Hosea 12:13, NKJV).

             s the Bible amply shows, the life of a prophet was never easy.

      A      Ellen White’s was no exception, and though she didn’t face the
             same kind of trials that many of the Bible prophets did (jail,
      stoning, etc.), she had plenty of trials just the same. In the early years,
      besides struggling with illness and various assaults of Satan, she and
      James were very poor and had to depend on others for living quarters
      and furniture. Two of their four children died young, and James wore
      himself out with traveling, preaching, writing, and guiding the fledg-
      ling church until 1881, when he died at the age of 60. For the last 34
      years Ellen White continued to labor in an environment that was at
      times hardly friendly. This week we’ll look at some of her work and
      how it paralleled the biblical prophets.

The Week at a Glance: Does the preaching of the gospel
      in the New Testament differ from the proclamation of salvation in
      the Old Testament? Why were the early Seventh-day Adventists,
      who came out of the Millerite movement, opposed to church
      organization? What were some ways prophets delivered God’s
      messages to His people?

     Preaching the Gospel
Where do we find the gospel of salvation in the Old Testament? Gen.
     22:1–14, Lev. 4:27–31, Isaiah 53.


       The plan of salvation was explained to Adam and Eve as soon as
     they had sinned; it graphically was illustrated in Abraham’s test on
     Mount Moriah and in the sanctuary service instituted by Moses. The
     sanctuary rituals were designed for an agricultural people who lived
     closely with their animals. The sacrificed animals symbolized Christ’s
     death on the cross, and the priest’s services illustrated His ministry in
     the heavenly sanctuary.

Does the preaching of the gospel in the New Testament differ from
     the proclamation of salvation in the Old Testament? John 1:29,
     Rom. 3:21–26.


        While the Old Testament people looked forward by faith to the
     Messiah, the New Testament looks back to the accomplished salvation
     through Jesus Christ. In both testaments the focus is on what God has
     done to remedy humanity’s fall into sin.
        It’s the same with the writings of Ellen White, where we find more
     than eight thousand references to the gospel and about six thousand
     references specifically to Jesus Christ and His sacrifice on the cross.
     The Christ of the Cross and the cross of Christ were the focus of her
     message. She admonished Seventh-day Adventists to uplift Jesus
     Christ before the world. “Of all professing Christians, Seventh-day
     Adventists should be foremost in uplifting Christ before the world.”
     —Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 156. “Christ as manifested to the
     patriarchs, as symbolized in the sacrificial service, as portrayed in the
     law, and as revealed by the prophets, is the riches of the Old Testament.
     Christ in His life, His death, and His resurrection, Christ as He is man-
     ifested by the Holy Spirit, is the treasure of the New Testament.”
     —Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 126. “The sacrifice of
     Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth around which all other
     truths cluster. . . . This is to be the foundation of every discourse given
     by our ministers.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 315.

      How much time do you spend thinking about Jesus, focusing on
      His life and what He’s done for you? How much stronger would
      your faith be if you were to dwell more on Christ and His sacri-
      fice in your behalf?



                                                                            57

     Guiding God’s People
     Jesus appointed Paul and the Twelve Apostles, some of whom also
     had the prophetic gift, to lead and guide the early Christian
     church. What are some of the specific areas in which Paul and the
     apostles provided counsel and guidance for the church? Acts
     6:1–7, 1 Cor. 5:1–5, 7:10–16, Titus 1:5, 1 John 4:1–3.
     ___________________________________________________________________

     ___________________________________________________________________

       The leaders of the early church faced many problems. Questions of
     immorality, apostasy, church organization, and a host of other matters
     occupied the time and attention of the early church. Prophets and
     apostles guided and directed the people of God in accordance with the
     Lord’s revealed will.
       The early days of our church had numerous struggles, as well.
     During the first 20 years of our church, there was no church organi-
     zation, so there also was no paid ministry; preachers worked at other
     jobs to make a living. Anyone could preach if he felt called, and, as a
     result, heresies prospered. Furthermore, church buildings and the
     Review and Herald press were in the names of individuals, which cre-
     ated the potential for many problems. For years James White urged
     organization but with little success.
       Then in 1854, Mrs. White published an article concerning church
     order. “The Lord has shown that gospel order has been too much
     feared and neglected. Formality should be shunned; but, in so doing,
     order should not be neglected. There is order in heaven. There was
     order in the church when Christ was upon the earth, and after His
     departure order was strictly observed among His apostles. . . .
       “The danger of those traveling whom God has not called was shown
     me. . . . I saw that this door at which the enemy comes in to perplex
     and trouble the flock can be shut. I inquired of the angel how it could
     be closed. He said, ‘The church must flee to God’s Word and become
     established upon gospel order, which has been overlooked and ne-
     glected.’ ” —Ellen G. White, Early Writings, pp. 97, 100.
       It took another six years until a church name was adopted in
     Michigan. In 1861 the Michigan Conference was established, and in
     1863 the General Conference was established.

      People sometimes talk about not wanting to be part of an orga-
      nized church. What are the advantages of being part of an
      organized structure? How can you better serve the organized
      church and help remedy aspects of it that you believe could use
      improvement?

     Reproving Sin
What were some of the evils the prophets spoke against, and what
     parallels can you see to our own days? 1 Kings 18:21, Isa. 1:10–14,
     Amos 5:12, Mal. 3:8–10, Matt. 3:7–10.

       Prophets were commissioned by God to resist social injustice, root
     out idolatry, protest against immorality, and condemn formalistic wor-
     ship and hypocrisy. At times it seemed to them that their voices were
     the only dissenting cries (1 Kings 19:14); yet, their protests were
     God’s protests and were delivered regardless of the consequences.

How did Ellen White deal with messages of reproof for individuals?


       Like the prophets of old, Ellen White had to reprove sins known
     only to the individual and God. It was a work she did not enjoy. “I bore
     my testimony and related things which had been shown me in the past
     history of some present, warning them of their dangers and reproving
     their wrong course of action. I stated that I had been placed in most
     disagreeable positions. When families and individuals were brought
     before me in vision, it was frequently the case that what was shown
     me in relation to them was of a private nature, reproving secret sins. I
     have labored with some for months in regard to wrongs of which oth-
     ers knew nothing. As my brethren see these persons sad, and hear
     them express doubts in regard to their acceptance with God, also feel-
     ings of despondency, they have cast censure upon me, as though I
     were to blame for their being in trial. . . . It has been the disagreeable
     work assigned me to reprove private sins. Were I, in order to prevent
     suspicions and jealousy, to give a full explanation of my course, and
     make public that which should be kept private, I should sin against
     God and wrong the individuals. I have to keep private reproofs of pri-
     vate wrongs to myself, locked in my own breast. Let others judge as
     they may, I will never betray the confidence reposed in me by the
     erring and repentant, or reveal to others that which should only be
     brought before the ones that are guilty.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
     for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 584, 585.

      If the Lord gave Ellen White a message for you, what do you
      think it would say, and why? Most important, how would you
      respond?

     Communicating God’s Will
What were some of the ways the prophets delivered God’s messages
     to His people? Num. 9:1–5; Jer. 37:16, 17; Ezek. 4:1–6; Col. 4:16.

        Prophets were charged by God to deliver to the people the messages
     that they received from Him. At times they proclaimed God’s words in
     a discourse before a company of people. At other times they delivered
     their testimonies in private interviews. Frequently, prophets were told to
     write out the messages received so that not only the people living at that
     time but also all future generations would hear what God had to say.
        When Ellen Harmon (Ellen G. White’s maiden name) received her
     second vision in December 1844, she was told that she must go and
     relate to others what had been revealed to her. For several days, she
     prayed that this burden might be taken from her, but the words of the
     angel sounded continually in her ears, “ ‘Make known to others what
     I have revealed to you.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Life Sketches of Ellen G.
     White, p. 69.
        During 1845, therefore, Ellen Harmon, accompanied by her sister
     Sarah or other friends, visited former Millerites in Maine, New Hamp-
     shire, and Massachusetts, who had experienced the Great Disappoint-
     ment on October 22, 1844, and shared her early visions with them.
     James White, a former Millerite preacher, became convinced that her
     visions were genuine and began to travel with her and her compan-
     ions, and in 1846 James and Ellen were married.
        Early in her ministry, Ellen White also was told to write out the
     things revealed to her. Messages to individuals frequently were com-
     municated to their recipients through letters (often called testimonies).
     Thousands of such communications were mailed from her home over
     the years. Of these she wrote, “In these letters which I write, in the tes-
     timonies I bear, I am presenting to you that which the Lord has pre-
     sented to me.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5,
     p. 67. When Ellen White died, she left behind about one hundred thou-
     sand pages of published and unpublished material.

     Predicting the Future
What were some of the Bible prophecies that have been fulfilled?
     Isa. 44:28, Jer. 25:11, Dan. 9:24–27.

     ____________________________________________________________________

        About one hundred fifty years prior to the time of Cyrus, Isaiah
     prophesied that a king by the name of Cyrus would bring back the
     Jews from Babylon and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. The fulfill-
     ment of this prophecy is found in Ezra 1:1–4.
        Jeremiah predicted the length of the Babylonian captivity, and
     Daniel predicted the time of the appearance of the Messiah almost six
     hundred years before Jesus was born. Both prophecies provide evi-
     dence for the inspiration of the Scriptures.
        And with Ellen White, too, we can find many of her predictions ful-
     filled. For instance, on January 12, 1861, three months before the out-
     break of the American Civil War, Mrs. White received a vision in the
     Parkville, Michigan, church in which she was shown battlefields cov-
     ered with the dead and dying. As she related what she had seen, she
     told her listeners, “There are men in this house who will lose sons in
     that war.”—Pacific Union Recorder, March 7, 1912 (Arthur L. White,
     Ellen G. White: The Early Years, vol. 1, p. 463). No less than five fam-
     ilies in the room that day lost sons in the Civil War.
        In 1885, Ellen White predicted: “When Protestantism shall stretch
     her hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when
     she shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism . . . then
     we may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of
     Satan and that the end is near.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
     Church, vol. 5, p. 451.
        At the time she wrote those words, Protestants and Catholics were
     all but at war with each other. In 1885 the ecumenical movement was
     still a long way in the future, but times have changed greatly. Just one
     example: On March 29, 1994, 39 leading evangelical Protestants and
     Roman Catholics signed a document entitled “Evangelicals and
     Catholics Together: The Christian Mission in the Third Millennium”—a
     stunning fulfillment of prophetic trends.

    Further Study: Read Arthur L. White, “The Messenger of the Lord
         at Work,” pp. 73–89, in The Early Years: 1827–1862; Ellen G. White,
         “God’s Law Immutable,” pp. 433-450, in The Great Controversy.

            “When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such
         points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the
         state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then
         Protestant America will have formed an image of the Roman hierar-
         chy, and the infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably
1        result.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 445.
            For more than one hundred fifty years, Adventists have been warn-
         ing the world about the coming reconciliation between Catholics and
         Protestants—even when all political and religious indications made
         such a reconciliation seem impossible. Today, of course, the impossi-
         ble has become all but inevitable, as time and again Catholics and var-
2        ious Protestants are coming together on a whole host of issues. Most
         interesting, and again in line with what Ellen White wrote more than
         a century ago, the Protestants are the ones who are making the most
         incredible compromises, all in order to bring about this unity with
         Rome. Though there’s still much to unfold, these events are leading to
         an amazing fulfillment of prophecy and are another powerful vindica-
         tion of Ellen White’s prophetic gift.

          2 Talk about the hostility that some people have toward orga-
          nized religion. What are their complaints? Are those complaints
          often valid? If so, what can we do, as an organized church, to
          solve as much as possible some of those things that cause this hos-

Wendy’s Prayers
  Wendy lives in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. As the eldest child
in her family, it was her job to care for her younger sisters. Even before
she started school, she carried the youngest child on her back.
  Wendy often heard the children next door singing songs about Jesus.
One day she asked the children to teach her the songs. Her neighbors did,
and they invited her to go to Sabbath School with them. Wendy wasn’t
sure whether her mother would let her go to Sabbath School, so on
Sabbath morning she hid until her neighbors walked by her house. Then
she followed them to church.
  Wendy’s mother learned that Wendy was going to church and gave her
permission to go—as long as she took her sisters with her. So every
Sabbath morning Wendy washed and dressed her little sisters and took
them to church. They had to climb a steep hill, and Wendy could not carry
her baby sister all the way. So her other sisters helped her. Wendy loved
church and often invited her mother to come with her. Sometimes her
mother came, but just to visit.
  When Wendy was eight, a huge argument broke out at home. Her father
had taken a second wife, which angered her mother so much that she and
her children returned to her home village. Wendy missed her father, but
she was delighted to find an Adventist church near their new home. Every
Sabbath morning Wendy hustled her little sisters to church.
  Wendy’s aunt lived in the village. She was also an Adventist, and she
often invited Mother to attend church. When Mother decided to give her
heart to God, Wendy was thrilled.
  Wendy’s aunt was moving to an isolated village high in the mountains
and wanted Wendy to go with her. Wendy loved living with her aunt. She
loved family worship when the family prayed for her family. Wendy’s
prayer was always that her mother would stay faithful to Jesus and her
father would give his heart to God.
  When Wendy returned home, she was thrilled to learn that her father
was attending church with Mother! He was even bringing his other wife
and their children! It was quite a sight: one man, two wives, and 11 chil-
dren sitting together in church. In time Father’s second wife gave her heart
to Jesus and became an Adventist, but Father could not join the church
because he had two wives. Still he faithfully attended church. Then one
day Father said that he had sent his second wife home to her village and
had asked the pastor to baptize him.
  “God has answered so many of my prayers,” Wendy says. “He helped
me find Jesus, then led my whole family to God.” Your mission offerings
help reach people at home and in the uttermost parts of the earth for the
Savior. Thank you for having a part in telling the world about God’s love.
WENDY lives in Goroka, Papua New Guinea.

      The Authority of the
      Prophets


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 4:10–16, 1 Sam.
      12:1–14, 2 Kings 22:10–13, Jer. 36:22–31, Mark 1:21–27, Acts
      16:25–34.

Memory Text: “Do not despise prophecies. Test all things; hold
      fast what is good” (1 Thessalonians 5:20, 21, NKJV).

                ll through the Bible, a theme recurs: God talks to people through

      A         His prophets, and the people either accept or reject what’s being
                said. Of course, by rejecting the words of the prophets, they’re
      not rejecting the prophets, they’re rejecting the One who sent them.
         It’s a very serious thing, then, to claim to speak in the name of God.
      If you claim to speak for Him, and are, then you are a mouthpiece for
      the Creator of the universe, no small responsibility. People have been
      delegated authority to speak for the boss of the company, or the pres-
      ident, or prime minister—but to speak for the Lord? That’s heavy.
      Unfortunately, much of biblical history is a story of God speaking
      through His prophets and of people rejecting what was said. How
      careful we need to be so as not to make the same mistake today.

The Week at a Glance: Why was Moses so reluctant to
      become God’s prophet? What authority did the prophets have in
      Israel, even those who never wrote a book of the Bible? Is there a
      difference between the authority of the canonical and extracanon-
      ical prophet?

     The Prophet as God’s Mouthpiece
Read Exodus 4:10–16, the dialogue between God and Moses. What
     happened here, and what can we learn from this exchange about
     how prophets are called and how they operate?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        According to the arrangement God put in place, Moses was literally
     “to become God” to Aaron (see Exod. 4:16), and Aaron was to
     become Moses’ mouthpiece or “prophet” (Exod. 7:1). This defines
     accurately the intimate relationship between God and all His prophets;
     they were His mouthpieces, His spokespersons. Furthermore, as in the
     case of Moses and Aaron—God “taught” all His prophets what they
     were to do in regard to being a mouthpiece. Moses was, however,
     somewhat of a reluctant prophet.
        According to her own testimony, Ellen White was reluctant when
     first called by the Lord, as well. “In my second vision, about a week
     after the first, the Lord gave me a view of the trials through which I
     must pass, and told me that I must go and relate to others what He had
     revealed to me. It was shown me that my labors would meet with great
     opposition, and that my heart would be rent with anguish; but that the
     grace of God would be sufficient to sustain me through all. After I
     came out of this vision I was exceedingly troubled, for it pointed out
     my duty to go out among the people and present the truth. My health
     was so poor that I was in constant bodily suffering, and to all appear-
     ance had but a short time to live. I was only seventeen years of age,
     small and frail, unused to society, and naturally so timid and retiring
     that it was painful for me to meet strangers.
        “For several days, and far into the night, I prayed that this burden
     might be removed from me, and laid upon some one more capable of
     bearing it. But the light of duty did not change, and the words of the
     angel sounded continually in my ears, ‘Make known to others what I
     have revealed to you.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Life Sketches of Ellen
     G. White, p. 69.

      In what way are we called, regardless of our position in the
      church, to “make known to others what I have revealed to you”?
      What has God revealed to you? How can you better share that
      with others?
                                                                        65

      The Authority of the Incarnate Word
      “And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
      unto me in heaven and in earth” (Matt. 28:18).

         In Matthew 21:23, while Jesus was teaching, the chief priests and
      the elders asked Him, “ ‘By what authority are You doing these things?
      And who gave You this authority?’ ” (NKJV). Jesus responded to the
      question in good rabbinic fashion, and that was with a counter ques-
      tion: “ ‘The baptism of John—where was it from? From heaven or
      from men?’ ” (vs. 25, NKJV; see vss. 24–27). In rabbinic debates the
      counter question was meant to point the way to the answer of the orig-
      inal question. When they refused to answer, He refused to give a clear
      answer in return, because if they refused to acknowledge God’s power
      in John’s ministry, there was little point in discussing His own—which
      was also from God.

What do the following texts tell us about Jesus’ authority? Matt. 7:28,
      29; Mark 1:21–27; Luke 8:22–25; 9:1; John 5:25–27.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Ultimate authority belongs to Christ as our Creator (John 1:3) and
      Redeemer (Rom. 3:24). He is at once the final court of appeal and the
      absolute norm by which each life is to be judged. Divine authority
      finds its focus and finality in Him. The Gospels, therefore, declare
      that His teaching caused astonishment because He taught as One hav-
      ing authority (Matt. 7:29).
         Throughout the Gospels we find Christ’s more-than-human author-
      ity. He forgave sins (Mark 2:10), drove out devils (Mark 3:15), and
      claimed the right to judge men’s hearts (John 2:24, 25) and give eter-
      nal life (John 10:28). Yet, the authority that Christ exercised within
      His earthly commission was granted to Him by the Father (John 17:2).
      Whatever He did, including all the miracles He performed, always was
      done in dependence on and in cooperation with His Father (John
      5:19). At the same time, He had absolute authority (Matt. 28:18).
      Therefore, He could delegate authority to His disciples (Mark 6:7)
      and will in the end judge all people (John 5:27).

       We live in a day and age when it’s fashionable to question author-
       ity. How are we to relate to authority? What factors should deter-
       mine our answer?

     The Authority of the Written Word
Compare these two responses to God’s Written Word: 2 Kings
     22:10–13; Jeremiah 36:22–31. Though we might not act quite as
     dramatically as the folk did here, how do these incidents represent
     the basic responses to God’s Written Word?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        One can reject God’s Word today without openly burning it, as did
     this king. Instead, it can be ridiculed, ignored, denounced as out-of-
     date, or interpreted in such a way that it is deprived of any historical
     value or authority.
        Yet, no one can disregard the authority of Scripture with impunity.
     Sooner or later, he or she will suffer the consequences of that rejec-
     tion. In the Written Word, the character and will of God, the meaning
     of human existence, and the purposes of God for humanity in all ages
     are stated in propositional form that all can understand. To reject it
     may not have immediate consequences, but it will certainly result in
     eternal loss.
        “He [Christ] pointed to the Scriptures as of unquestionable authority,
     and we should do the same. The Bible is to be presented as the word of
     the infinite God, as the end of all controversy and the foundation of all
     faith.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 39, 40.
        All through her life Mrs. White exalted the Word of God. In regard to
     the controversy between science and Scripture she wrote: “There should
     be a settled belief in the divine authority of God’s Holy Word. The Bible
     is not to be tested by men’s ideas of science. Human knowledge is an
     unreliable guide.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 114.
        In 1909 she attended her last General Conference session. At the
     close of her last sermon she picked up the Bible, opened it, and held
     it out on extended hands.
        “ ‘Brethren and Sisters,’ ” she said, “ ‘I commend unto you this
     Book.’ ”—Arthur L. White, Ellen G. White: The Later Elmshaven
     Years, p. 197.

      Examine your own attitude toward the Scriptures. Ask yourself
      the following questions: How much time do I spend in them?
      How seriously do I try to follow the teachings? When I read, am
      I trying to find fault with it? What’s my attitude toward pas-
      sages that I find disturbing or that express ideas that I don’t
      like? What can I learn from my answers?


                                                                          67

     The Authority of the Spoken Word
     In ancient times, when writing material was scarce and most peo-
     ple could not read, the spoken word was very important. What
     effect did the spoken Word of God have on people in the following
     passages? Jer. 38:1–4, John 3:1–10, 6:51–66, Acts 16:25–34.


        The Word of God, whether spoken or written, has a double function.
     It is like a two-edged sword, says Paul, “piercing even to the division
     of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
     thoughts and intents of the heart” (Heb. 4:12, NKJV). In the context
     of what Paul is saying, the word refers to the messages that were
     preached both to ancient Israel and to Christians (Heb. 4:2).
        Like a surgeon’s scalpel, the spoken Word of God can penetrate to
     heal and restore, or it can furnish the evidence of a deadly disease that
     will result in eternal condemnation. Unless the word preached meets
     with faith on the part of the hearers, it cannot benefit them.
        While not everyone in the church was willing to accept Ellen G.
     White’s prophetic authority, the church by and large listened to her
     counsel and benefited by it. The following story reveals the good
     things the church experienced by following Ellen G. White’s advice.
     For example, church organization between 1863 (when the General
     Conference was organized) and 1901 remained basically unchanged.
     As work in different lines developed, various associations (Medical
     Missionary, Sabbath School, Religious Liberty, Tract Society, etc.)
     were formed to foster these ministries. Because these associations
     were all autonomous organizations represented by independent cor-
     porations but not integral parts of the General Conference organiza-
     tion, they were sometimes in competition with one another. On the
     other hand, all major decisions in regard to the worldwide work were
     made by a few people at the General Conference in Battle Creek.
        The day before the General Conference session in 1901, Ellen
     G. White met with the church leaders and urged them to make drastic
     changes in the running of the church. Accordingly, when the confer-
     ence opened, the usual order of business was set aside, and a large
     committee (about 75 people) was appointed to work on the reorgani-
     zation of the church structure. The result was that the General
     Conference committee was enlarged considerably, the various associa-
     tions became departments of the General Conference, and union con-
     ferences were organized to enable leaders in the field to make deci-
     sions on the spot without having to wait for answers from Battle Creek.
        The reorganization of the church structure, directed by divine coun-
     sel, was accepted unanimously and has stood the test of time. With
     some modifications and enlargements, it is still the structure of the

     The Authority of Noncanonical
     Prophets
     Apart from the canonical prophets, such as Isaiah and Amos, we
     find in Scripture a number of prophets whose books did not become
     part of the canon. What do the following texts tell us about these
     prophets and their writings? 1 Chron. 29:29, 2 Chron. 9:29, 12:15.

       Among its sources, the books of Chronicles refer to different
     prophetic books written by extracanonical prophets: Gad, Nathan,
     Ahijah, Shemaiah, and Iddo.

What authority did extracanonical prophets have? 2 Sam. 12:1–4,
     1 Kings 11:29–39, 14:2–18, Luke 7:28.

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In David’s time, Scripture was the books of Moses, but not for one
     moment did David question the authority of Nathan. He knew that
     Nathan was a prophet and that his word was authoritative, even though
     Nathan had no books that ever made it into the Bible.
        Let us suppose that archaeologists found a book written by Nathan
     today. Would it be added to the Bible? No; it would remain an inspired
     book outside of the canon. And if a theological statement were found
     in the book, it would remain an inspired and authoritative statement
     outside of the canon.
        The canon is simply the collection of books that under God’s guid-
     ance was put together as the rule of life and faith for God’s people and
     by which everything else has to be measured. It contains everything a
     person needs to know to be saved. However, not everything the
     prophets wrote under inspiration is in the Bible. We know, for exam-
     ple, that Paul wrote more inspired letters than we have in the New
     Testament today (1 Cor. 5:9, Col 4:16). Now, if we found one of these
     letters today, it would not become part of the Bible. It would remain
     an authoritative, inspired letter, outside of the canon.
        Ellen White’s authority can be compared to the authority of the
     extracanonical prophets. The inspired messages she received for the
     church are not an addition to the canon. Her writings are not another
     Bible, nor do they carry the kind of authority found in the Bible. In the
     end, the Bible and the Bible alone is our ultimate authority.

      Why must even Ellen White’s writings be tested by the Bible?
      Why must she not be the final authority on doctrinal matters?

                                                                          69

    Further Study:
            In 1982, an ad hoc committee of the General Conference prepared a
         statement on the relationship between the Bible and Ellen G. White. It
         reads in part, “Affirmations: (1) We believe that Scripture is the divinely
         revealed Word of God and is inspired by the Holy Spirit. (2) We believe
         that the canon of Scripture is composed only of the 66 books of the Old
         and New Testaments. (3) We believe that Scripture is the foundation of
         faith and the final authority in all matters of doctrine and practice. (4) We
         believe that Scripture is the Word of God in human language. (5) We
         believe that Scripture teaches that the gift of prophecy will be manifest
1        in the Christian church after New Testament times. (6) We believe that
         the ministry and writings of Ellen White were a manifestation of the gift
         of prophecy. (7) We believe that Ellen White was inspired by the Holy
         Spirit and that her writings, the product of that inspiration, are applicable
         and authoritative especially to Seventh-day Adventists. (8) We believe
         that the purposes of the Ellen White writings include guidance in under-
2        standing the teaching of Scripture and application of these teachings,
         with prophetic urgency, to the spiritual and moral life. (9) We believe that
         the acceptance of the prophetic gift of Ellen White is important to the
         nurture and unity of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. (10) We believe
         that Ellen White’s use of literary sources and assistants finds parallels in
         some of the writings of the Bible. Denials: (1) We do not believe that the
         quality or degree of inspiration in the writings of Ellen White is different
         from that of Scripture. (2) We do not believe that the writings of Ellen
3        White are an addition to the canon of Sacred Scripture. (3) We do not
         believe that the writings of Ellen White function as the foundation and
         final authority of Christian faith as does Scripture. (4) We do not believe
         that the writings of Ellen White may be used as the basis of doctrine. (5)
         We do not believe that the study of the writings of Ellen White may be
         used to replace the study of Scripture. (6) We do not believe that Scripture
         can be understood only through the writings of Ellen White. (7) We do not
         believe that the writings of Ellen White exhaust the meaning of Scripture.
         (8) We do not believe that the writings of Ellen White are essential for the
         proclamation of the truths of Scripture to society at large. (9) We do not
         believe that the writings of Ellen White are the product of mere Christian
         piety. (10) We do not believe that Ellen White’s use of literary sources and
         assistants negates the inspiration of her writings.”—“The Inspiration and
         Authority of Ellen G. White Writings” in Ministry, August 1982, p. 21.
            The conclusion then was drawn that a correct understanding of the
         inspiration and authority of the writings of Ellen White will avoid two
         extremes: (1) regarding these writings as functioning on a canonical
         level identical with Scripture; (2) considering them as ordinary
         Christian literature.
    Discussion Question:
          Go through the lists above. How does this help clarify some issues
          regarding Ellen G. White? What questions does it raise?

Man With the Black Book
by SATURNINO SABALLA JR.
   I am a SULAD, a student missionary, teaching in a newly opened vil-
lage in Mindanao, Philippines. These villagers found God through a
dream.
   One night the datu (chief) dreamed that a Man dressed in white and car-
rying a big black book came to him. “Whoever obeys the commands writ-
ten in this book will be my people,” the Man said. Then he explained the
importance of the Sabbath.
   The datu called the villagers together and shared his dream. The people
agreed that they would worship the creator God on His sacred day. On
Saturday they gathered to worship in the only way they knew—chewing
betel nut and talking to an unseen spirit.
   Then a villager met an Adventist tailor while visiting town. The villager
told the tailor about their new religion, which required them to worship on
Saturday and related the chief’s dream about the Man with a black book.
   “I also am a Sabbath keeper!” the tailor said. “May I visit your village
and worship with you?” The villager eagerly agreed.
   The tailor and a lay worker set out on Friday for the six-hour hike to the
village. They carried a large Bible. When they reached the village, they
met the datu, who stared at the Bible. “This is the book I saw in my
dream!” he said. “You must be Sabbath keepers too!”
   The next morning the villagers gathered for worship followed by a feast
of roasted pig and vegetables. Then the datu invited the visitors to speak
at the afternoon meeting.
   The lay worker read the Sabbath commandment from the Bible and
explained how God wanted them to worship. The chief and villagers
cheered in agreement. Then the lay worker explained God’s other laws,
laws of good health. He explained that the pig is a scavenger and is not fit
for food, and that betel nut is a drug that God does not want His followers
to use.
   The datu again responded. “My dear people,” he said. “This black book
tells us many important things. We shall eat pig flesh no more. We shall
use betel nut no more.” The datu turned to the two men and invited them
to teach them more. “We will gladly obey,” he said.
   In time every villager was baptized. Today SULAD missionaries are
teaching the villagers to read the black book for themselves.
   Our mission offerings help plant new churches in remote areas of God’s
vineyard. Thank you for sharing in this work.

          LESSON            9      *February 21–27


      The Integrity of the
      Prophetic Gift




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Sam. 7:1–7, 1 Kings
      22:10–18, Jer. 43:2–4, Dan. 8:27.

Memory Text: “As the Lord lives, whatever my God says, that
      I will speak” (2 Chronicles 18:13, NKJV).

          f you ever read modern criticism of the Bible, one thing you’ll

      I   notice: The same kind of attacks leveled against the Bible are sim-
          ilar to the attacks leveled against Ellen White. And one attack
      against Ellen White is that because she used other sources, she is not
      reliable or honest.
        Yet, Ellen White has explained in print how she used the writings of
      others, and why. She even recommended that people read certain
      books she used in writing her own works. That hardly sounds as if she
      were trying to hide her use of other sources.
        This week we’ll explore a little more about how inspiration works,
      both with Bible writers and with Ellen White.

The Week at a Glance: What do we know about the
      integrity of biblical prophets? If Scripture and the writings of
      Ellen G. White are both inspired by the same Spirit, what is the
      relationship between them? What is the danger in seeing prophets
      as infallible? Can prophets give wrong advice?

     The Integrity of the Prophet
       The year was 853 B.C. King Ahab of Israel invited King Jehoshaphat
     of Judah to go with him into battle against the Arameans, and Jehosha-
     phat agreed. However, he requested that before they go into battle they
     ask for a word from the Lord. When Jehoshaphat refused to accept the
     word of the four hundred prophets of Ahab, Micaiah, a prophet of the
     Lord, was called.

Read 1 Kings 22:10–18. How did Ahab’s officer attempt to influence
     Micaiah, and what did the prophet do, regardless of the circum-
     stances?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Micaiah’s message was unpopular with the king, and he was sent to
     prison for it (1 Kings 22:27). King Ahab, in spite of the prophet’s
     warning, went into battle and was killed; and King Jehoshaphat, who
     in a weak moment had agreed to support King Ahab, barely escaped
     with his life.
        Though prophets, like all humans, have their moments of weakness,
     in this case Micaiah was determined to tell the truth, no matter how
     unpopular it was with those in authority. Throughout history, God’s
     prophets have endured hardship because they refused to change their
     testimony to suit their contemporaries.
        During Ellen White’s lifetime, critics questioned her integrity and
     have continued to do so ever since her death. She has been accused of
     deception, falsehood, and lies. One major reason for these accusations
     has been personal presuppositions about how a prophet should func-
     tion. For example, some critics believe that “prophets ‘should have
     full knowledge’ from the start of their ministry; their predictions
     should be unalterable, their writings exempt from all errors, discrep-
     ancies, and mistakes, and never include uninspired sources. For them,
     prophets never express merely personal opinions in their writings.”
     —Herbert E. Douglass, Messenger of the Lord (Nampa, Idaho:
     Pacific Press® Publishing Association, 1998), p. 468. As we have
     seen in our study of biblical prophets, these presuppositions assume
     a verbal-inspiration concept that Seventh-day Adventists do not hold.
     If we don’t hold it for the Bible itself, why should we for Ellen White?

      Have you ever had to deliver an unpopular message? What kind
      of pressures did you face? In what ways did you try to make
      excuses to yourself that could have allowed you not to deliver the
      message? What have you learned from that experience?

                                                                         73

     The Integrity of the Message
       A few months after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 B.C., Gedaliah, the
     governor appointed by Nebuchadnezzar, was assassinated. The lead-
     ers and the people left in the land were afraid of Babylonian reprisals
     and decided to seek safety in Egypt; but they wanted to make sure that
     God was on their side. So, they asked Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord
     concerning their plan.

What was Jeremiah’s message, and how did the people respond to it?
     Of what did they accuse Jeremiah, and who was said to have orig-
     inated the counsel that Jeremiah declared to be from the Lord?
     Jer. 43:2–4.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Because some did not like the clear instructions God gave, they
     claimed Jeremiah’s message actually had originated with his literary
     assistant Baruch and not with the Lord.
        How interesting that thousands of years later, Mrs. White (like
     Jeremiah) has at times been the focus of claims that her literary assis-
     tants wrote her books or that she plagiarized most of what she wrote.
     Yet, in the preface to The Great Controversy she stated that she had
     used other books: “In some cases where a historian has so grouped
     together events as to afford, in brief, a comprehensive view of the
     subject, or has summarized details in a convenient manner, his words
     have been quoted. . . . In narrating the experience and views of those
     carrying forward the work of reform in our own time, similar use has
     been made of their published works.”—Page 14.
        Does this justify the charge of plagiarism? In 1981 the General
     Conference asked a non-Adventist copyright lawyer to study the mat-
     ter. After spending more than three hundred hours researching, he
     concluded that “Ellen White was not a plagiarist, and her works did
     not constitute copyright infringement/piracy.”—Adventist Review,
     September 17, 1981. Among the reasons given were first, the fact that
     the books Ellen White used were not covered by copyright; and sec-
     ond, even if they had been covered by copyright, her use of phrases
     and sentences did not constitute an infringement of copyright.

      Why was there always hostility among God’s professed people
      to the messages of the prophets? Look in your own heart; can
      you find, at least somewhat, part of the answer there? Explain.

     “Thus Says the Lord”
What did the prophets often designate as the source of their mes-
     sages? Jer. 1:4, Ezek. 7:1, Hos. 1:1. Why is this so important to
     what they have to say?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________


       The prophets repeatedly pointed out that their messages came from
     God. Their position can be compared to that of earthly ambassadors
     who are sent out by an earthly ruler and who are commissioned to rep-
     resent their sovereign. In that capacity they must adhere closely to the
     instructions they have received. The expression “the Word of the Lord
     came unto . . .” means that (a) their messages carry divine authority,
     (b) they received them by direct communication from the Lord, and
     (c) these messages are in their minds, ready to be presented.
       The expression “thus says the Lord” appears more than four hun-
     dred times in the Old Testament—a powerful testimony to the fact that
     in Scripture, God is speaking directly to the reader. The prophet’s
     responsibility was to bring these messages before the people and
     apply them to the audience’s situation.
       Ellen White strongly emphasized the inspiration of the Scriptures.
     “I take the Bible just as it is, as the Inspired Word,” she said.
     —Selected Messages, book 1, p. 17. At the same time, she also
     claimed divine inspiration for her writings: “In these letters which I
     write, in the testimonies I bear, I am presenting to you that which the
     Lord has presented to me. . . . It is true concerning the articles in our
     papers and in the many volumes of my books.”—Page 29.
       Ellen White called her writings the lesser light leading men and
     women to the greater light—the Bible. (See Colporteur Ministry,
     p. 125.) While both are light, their functions are different: (1) The
     Bible is God’s message for all time and for all people. The writings of
     Ellen G. White are God’s message for a particular time, the end time,
     and for a particular people, the remnant church. (2) Her writings are
     not a new or additional standard of doctrine but a help for the church
     in the time of the end. Her writings focus the reader’s attention on
     Scripture. They do not replace Scripture.

      How can we avoid the trap of putting Ellen White’s writings on
      par with the Bible? Why is that so easy to do and such a big mis-
      take?


                                                                          75
         W EDNESDAY February 25

      Growth in Understanding
        Prophets did not receive all of God’s light at one time. As they faith-
      fully ministered as the Lord’s servants, they received more light and
      grew in their understanding.

What do the following texts tell us about the spiritual-growth experi-
      ence of biblical prophets? Dan. 8:27, 9:2, Gal. 2:11–16, 1 Pet. 1:10.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The possession of the prophetic gift in biblical times did not imply
      immediate, full, and complete knowledge of spiritual and other mat-
      ters. Prophets received increased light as history unfolded and as they
      were able to understand it. They also had to study Scripture, as the
      case of Daniel illustrates (Dan. 9:2). In Daniel 8:27 the prophet said,
      “I was appalled by the vision and did not understand it” (RSV). About
      ten years later the angel Gabriel came and explained to him the full
      import of the vision (Dan. 9:20–23).
         The prophets knew only that which God had revealed to them, and
      only this were they permitted to set forth as a “Thus saith the Lord.”
      Since the messages to one prophet often complemented those given to
      others, it became necessary to study and compare the various revela-
      tions in order to get a balanced and comprehensive view of the mes-
      sages from Heaven.
         It was the same with Ellen White: “For sixty years I have been in
      communication with heavenly messengers, and I have been constantly
      learning in reference to divine things, and in reference to the way in
      which God is constantly working to bring souls from the error of their
      ways to the light in God’s light.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages,
      book 3, p. 71.
         Hence, when we compare earlier writings of Ellen G. White with her
      later works, we sometimes find that her later writings modify or expand
      her earlier writings, reflecting a deeper insight into God’s messages.
         She was not a systematic theologian but more of an evangelist and
      communicator of what God showed her. Her understanding of theol-
      ogy, though founded on Scripture and informed by her visions, grew
      through the years as she continued to study Scripture and the writings
      of others and was open to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

       We must be careful not to place the attributes of God, such as
       omniscience (knowing all things), on His messengers. What is
       the danger in seeing prophets as infallible and having full
       knowledge in all areas of life?

     When Prophets Get It Wrong
Read 2 Samuel 7:1–7. What was wrong with Nathan’s advice to
     David, and why would God not allow David to build Him a tem-
     ple? 1 Chron. 22:8.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The prophet Nathan was a wise, thoughtful, and God-fearing man,
     but not everything a prophet says or does is done under inspiration. In
     giving his approval to David’s plan, Nathan had spoken as a friend of
     the king and not in his capacity as a prophet. A permanent dwelling
     for the God of Israel was probably something that most pious people
     desired. In a night vision (2 Sam. 7:4–17), however, God told Nathan
     that what he had told David was wrong and that he had to go and tell
     David.
        Ellen White was not infallible, and she never claimed infallibility.
     She grew, changed her mind on issues, and was constantly open for
     more light.
        In one instance, when the publishing house in the South was doing
     poorly, she supported making it merely a depository for the Review
     and Herald. “Go ahead,” she said, “God’s cause must not be left to
     reproach, no matter who is made sore by arranging matters on a right
     basis. Edson should give himself to the ministry and to writing. . . .
     Finance is not his forte at all.”—Manuscript Releases, vol. 17, p. 270.
     But within 24 hours Ellen G. White received a vision that caused her
     to reverse herself. “Let the Southern field have its own home-published
     books,” she told the General Conference.—Arthur L. White, Ellen
     G. White: The Early Elmshaven Years, p. 193.
        We must remember that prophets are not always on duty—that is,
     they are not speaking constantly for God. “There are times when com-
     mon things must be stated, common thoughts must occupy the mind,
     common letters must be written and information given that has passed
     from one to another of the workers. Such words, such information, are
     not given under the special inspiration of the Spirit of God.”—Ellen
     G. White, Selected Messages, book 3, p. 58.
        But as history has shown, if erroneous counsel has been given by a
     prophet, God will intervene to correct the mistake.

      Some people love to focus on every perceived error in either the
      Bible or in the lesser light, which is the writings of Ellen G. White.
      What’s so dangerous and unhealthy about that kind of attitude?
      How can you protect yourself from falling into that trap?

                                                                         77
                      F RIDAY February 27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Question of Influence,”
         pp. 62–67, in Selected Messages, book 3.

           “Ellen White made claims about her ministry that leave no room for
         compromise or ambivalence about those claims. She claimed to have
         seen things that could have come only from supernatural inspiration.
         Either her claims are true or she was a lunatic and/or a powerful liar who
         promulgated her insane ravings or amazing deceptions from the middle
         of the nineteenth into the second decade of the twentieth century.
           “What rational options are there for someone who claimed to have
1        seen, in vision, what she claimed to have seen? She claimed to have
         seen Jesus bring the redeemed into the Holy City. She claimed to have
         seen people living on other planets and angels protecting God’s peo-
         ple. She claimed to have seen, in vision, Jesus in the heavenly sanctu-
         ary or what Satan looked like in heaven before he sinned. She claimed
         to have seen angels visiting Adam and Eve in Eden. She said that she
2        saw the look on Adam’s face when he realized that Eve had sinned.
         She claimed to have seen Jesus, in vision, and what His face was like
         after the wilderness fast. She claimed to have seen the Resurrection of
         Jesus from the tomb, as well as an angel release Paul and Silas from
         prison. She claimed to have seen Satan lead lost multitudes into the
         final rebellion against God after the second resurrection. She claimed
         to have seen, in vision, life in the new earth, and on and on. . . .
           “What does one do with these claims? Those who place her ministry
3        on the level, for instance, of Martin Luther, are living in a logical fan-
         tasy world. Either we take her for what she has claimed for herself
         (which, of course, leaves open a whole group of questions that we, as
         a church, haven’t always answered in the most fortuitous manner), or
         we have to reject her as [a] liar, a lunatic, or someone inspired by the
         devil. These are the only logical options.”—Clifford Goldstein,

         Publishing Association, 2003), pp. 172, 173.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Read over the argument above. The point is simple: Ellen
          White, by her claims, doesn’t leave us many logical options
          regarding her ministry. From what we know of her life, her
          teachings, and the legacy of writings that she has left, what’s
          really the best and most logical explanation for her life and min-
          istry? Defend your answer.

          ●
          2 As with the Bible, some questions remain regarding Ellen
          White’s ministry. The issue is do we focus on these few questions
          and miss the big picture of her work, or do we focus on the big
          picture, knowing that as with anything, some questions will
          remain?

Redeemed, Healed, and Joyful
by SUNG JA KOH
   I live in Korea. I grew up believing in God, but Jesus wasn’t my Savior. I
married a Christian man, but I didn’t know how to have a close relationship
with Christ. I prayed that God would show Himself to me and show me that
He is in control of my life.
   My husband and I visited different churches, hoping to find a relationship
with God. We prayed for hours, hoping that this would draw us closer to God.
But we found no spiritual breakthrough. We stopped attending this church,
but we didn’t stop searching. Then my husband met a pastor who offered to
study the Bible with us. At last we experienced God’s love.
   We moved back to my husband’s hometown, where we lived with my in-
laws. They still worshiped their ancestors, and the situation caused me great
stress. I became sick. In spite of the doctors’ advice, I grew worse. My hus-
band urged me to have faith, and I begged God to heal me.
   Then I learned about a health recovery program called NEWSTART that
was being held in a nearby church. I went, hoping something there would
help me. The program nourished my body and my soul. A change to a more
natural diet eased my symptoms.
   The daily devotionals at the program fed my soul, and I asked the leader
for Bible studies. I found answers to Bible questions that had troubled me for
years, and I became convinced of the truth. My husband wanted me to wait
to visit the Adventist church until he could go, but his busy schedule left no
time for Bible studies, so I went alone.
   I knew I had found what I was searching for and was baptized. I shared
cassettes, books, and pamphlets with my husband, and eventually he agreed
to go to church with me. In spite of Satan’s attempts to divert his attention
from the truth, my husband also joined the church.
   I prayed for my grown children, and one by one they opened their hearts
to God’s message. Some have been baptized, and others are on the way. My
brother also found this beautiful faith. My mother was growing old and weak.
                            She told me that she did not have the peace she
                            wanted, and there was little time left. Praise God,
                            she surrendered her heart to God and asked to be
                            baptized just two months before she passed away.
                            My mother-in-law turned from ancestor worship
                            and gave her life to Jesus too.
                              God has shown us the truth, and we want to
                            share it with others. Please pray with us for family
                            members who have not yet given their hearts to
                            God. And thank you for your mission offerings,
                            which help sponsor programs such as the one that
                            brought me to God’s church.

        LESSON            10 *February 28–March 6
      The Message of the
      Prophets


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 20:1–17; Leviticus
      16; Matt. 24:24–31; Rom. 3:21–28; Heb. 8:1, 2; 9:23.

Memory Text: “Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine.
      Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and
      those who hear you” (1 Timothy 4:16, NKJV).

              he doctrinal framework of the Seventh-day Adventist Church

      T       largely was created by a small, dedicated group of Adventist pio-
              neers. Their meetings were characterized by earnest Bible study
      and prayer. Writing in 1904, more than a half century after the events,
      Ellen G. White still had vivid memories of these gatherings. “Often we
      remained together until late at night, and sometimes through the entire
      night, praying for light and studying the Word.”—Selected Messages,
      book 1, p. 206. At times, when they could go no further, Ellen White
      would supply answers given to her in vision, though she never initiated
      doctrinal formulation. The visions were not given to take the place of
      faith, initiative, hard work, or Bible study. The crucial point to remem-
      ber is that our church’s doctrines are based solely on the Bible. They are
      not dependent upon Ellen White’s writings, however helpful she has
      been in clarifying some of those teachings.

The Week at a Glance: Why do we need to keep the com-
      mandments when we are saved by grace? What is the cleansing of
      the heavenly sanctuary? How does the Sabbath commandment
      differ from the other commandments? What happens at death,
      and why is knowledge of the state of the dead important? What
      does the Bible teach about the manner of Christ’s second coming?

     Righteousness by Faith
What is the common lot of all human beings, and why? What is the
     only solution for the situation in which we find ourselves? 1 Kings
     8:46, Rom. 3:21–28, 5:12.

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Sin is the greatest problem we face. The Egyptians thought that
     death was humanity’s biggest problem, hence they developed the art
     of mummification and built huge pyramids to keep the mummies. The
     Greek philosophers thought ignorance was the chief enemy of true
     happiness, so they emphasized education. But the chief problem of
     humanity is sin. Sin destroys happiness and peace of mind. Sin kills,
     and no modern medicine can cure it. From the moment we are born,
     we begin to die. The only cure is Jesus Christ and the Cross. “There is
     not a point that needs to be dwelt upon more earnestly, repeated more
     frequently, or established more firmly in the minds of all than the
     impossibility of fallen man meriting anything by his own best good
     works. Salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone.”—Ellen
     G. White, Faith and Works, p. 19.
        According to the Greek poet Homer, ships passing through the
     Strait of Messina were in danger of running afoul of the rock Scylla
     on one side or the whirlpool Charybdis on the other. Christians are
     always in danger of running afoul of either legalism or cheap grace.
     Those who fear that talk of assurance of salvation in Christ will lead
     to cheap grace and the tolerance of sinful behavior stress the impor-
     tance of obedience. Those who fear that talking of obedience and vic-
     torious Christian living directs attention away from Christ and leads to
     legalism emphasize God’s part in salvation.
        The balanced Christian will have assurance of salvation in Jesus
     and lead a victorious Christian life at the same time. The two go
     together like the two sides of a coin. Whomever God justifies, He also
     sanctifies. We cannot have one without the other. We are saved by
     faith alone, but the faith that saves is not alone; good works follow,
     even though those good works, even done under the unction of the
     Holy Spirit, never can justify us before God. Our salvation is rooted
     only in what Jesus has done for us.

      Discouraged over your spiritual life? Not getting the victories you
      wish you had? What great hope can you find in the fact that you
      are accepted solely through what Jesus has done for you and not
      through your victories or failures? Why should that hope keep
      you from never giving up in your struggles with sin and self?
                                                                         81

     The Sanctuary
What were the services of the Old Testament tabernacle, and how did
     they illustrate the plan of salvation? Heb. 9:1–8.


       With the sanctuary service God produced a visual demonstration
     that enabled the sinner to understand the great plan of salvation.
     Confession, sacrifice, forgiveness, faith, reconciliation, holiness, all
     graphically were demonstrated in the daily and yearly services of the
     earthly sanctuary.

According to Hebrews 8:1, 2, Jesus ministers in the heavenly sanc-
     tuary. What does His ministry consist of, and why does Hebrews
     9:23 say that the heavenly sanctuary needs cleansing?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In the Old Testament the sinner received forgiveness through faith
     in the atoning blood of the Promised Seed (Gen. 3:15), who was fore-
     shadowed in the animal sacrifice of the sanctuary service. And just as
     in the earthly service at the close of the year there was a Day of
     Atonement, a day of judgment on which the sanctuary was cleansed,
     so in the heavenly sanctuary service there is a day of judgment prior
     to Christ’s second coming.
       The pre-Advent judgment reveals to the universe those who have
     professed Christ and are really His followers. God, so to speak, opens
     the books of heaven for all the universe to see that in each case His
     decision was just and fair. In that sense, this judgment vindicates the
     justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus (Rom. 3:4).

      In Leviticus 16, the key element that appears again and again is
      blood. And that makes sense, because this is the Day of
      Atonement, and only blood atones. And what is atonement,
      other than the work of God saving us? Hence the judgment is
      good news; it’s the work of God saving us because we can’t save
      ourselves. The crucial point is that just as the high priest never
      went into the Most Holy Place without blood, neither should we,
      for to enter into the Most Holy Place without blood means
      death, not atonement. Dwell on these ideas. What hope and
      encouragement should they bring to us, who are living in the
      great antitypical day of atonement?

     The Sabbath
        The Sabbath and marriage are the only earthly institutions that come
     to us from the time before sin entered the world. Hence, sometimes they
     are called the twin sisters of Paradise. When you look at our world
     today, it’s obvious that Satan has worked hard to deface and defile them.

Read Exodus 20:1–17. What is it about the Sabbath commandment
     that makes it stand out from the others?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The fourth commandment is, in a sense, a test commandment. It
     tests humanity’s spirituality. Because it deals with time, which is invis-
     ible, rather than with tangible objects, it is well suited to measure
     humanity’s attitude toward God. How we feel toward the Sabbath is an
     indicator of how we feel toward God. It is the only commandment an
     individual can break and yet be fully accepted as a good person in any
     conservative Christian society.
        In a certain sense, the Sabbath is arbitrary. Why the seventh day
     over any other? It’s because God said so, that’s why. There’s a lot of
     obvious and apparent logic in not stealing, not killing, not coveting,
     and so forth. You don’t have to be a Christian to follow those precepts;
     many non-Christians do.
        But to obey the seventh-day Sabbath, which isn’t rooted in any nat-
     ural phenomena, is to reveal a willingness to obey simply because God
     tells us 10. Sabbath keeping is an act of faith; we keep the seventh-day
     Sabbath, not because it’s socially acceptable, not because it’s popular,
     not because it fits in with any natural cycle. No, we keep the seventh-
     day Sabbath because God commands us to, and as New Testament
     Christians saved by grace, we reveal our faith through obedience to
     God’s commandments (James 2:10, 11; 1 John 5:2, 3; Rev. 14:12).
        In fact, by resting on the Sabbath, we’re revealing to the world that
     all this talk about resting in Christ isn’t just talk. As Sabbath keepers,
     we truly rest in Christ’s work of salvation for us, not just daily but also
     in a special way each week. We reveal the fullness of our assurance in
     Christ by resting on the Sabbath (see Heb. 4:1–11). Sabbath keeping
     is an outward expression of our rest in Christ.

      Though the Sabbath is, in a sense, arbitrary, what are the tangi-
      ble and practical benefits we get from keeping the Sabbath holy,
      as God commanded? What can you do to better enjoy the ben-
      efits of Sabbath keeping?

                                                                            83

      State of the Dead
What do the following Bible texts tell us about humanity’s condition
      in death? Ps. 146:4; Eccles. 9:5, 6; John 11:11–14; Acts 2:34.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Inspiration teaches that only God is immortal (1 Tim. 6:16) and that
      human beings apart from God are subject to death. Jesus taught that
      death is a sleep that ends in one of two resurrections—a resurrection
      of life and a resurrection of damnation (John 5:28, 29). William
      Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, recognized this when he wrote,
      “Man is not immortal by nature or of right; but he is capable of
      immortality and there is offered to him resurrection from the dead and
      life eternal if he will receive it from God and on God’s terms.”
      —Nature, Man, and God (London: Macmillan & Co., 1934), p. 472.

How are we to understand texts such as Matthew 25:46 and Revelation
      14:9–11? Do they teach eternal torment in hell?


        The notion of human immortality is found in all primal, animistic,
      and polytheistic religions. It was also an important concept in Greek
      philosophy, which conceived of Hades as a ghostly, shadowy under-
      world, in which the soul lived a twilight existence. The Greeks viewed
      human beings as consisting of matter and soul. At death, matter and
      soul separated, releasing the soul from the prison house of matter into
      an independent existence.
        In Matthew 25 and Revelation 14, the words translated “everlast-
      ing” and “for ever” do not mean necessarily never ending. The Greek
      words aion and aionios express duration as long as the nature of the
      subject allows. For example, in Jude 7 we are told that the cities
      Sodom and Gomorrah are suffering the punishment of eternal (aion-
      ios) fire. Yet, 2 Peter 2:6 says that they were turned into ashes. When
      the subject of the words eternal or forever is the life of the redeemed
      who have received immortality, the word means a time without end.
      When it refers to the punishment of the wicked, who do not receive
      immortality, the word has the meaning of a limited time period.

       From popular preachers to popular films, the world is flooded
       with spiritualism (the idea that the dead live on now in another
       existence). How does our understanding of the state of the dead
       give us powerful protection against this terrible deception?

     The Second Coming
       Since the early 1970s, Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth has
     sold more than fifteen million copies. In recent years, the Left Behind™
     series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins (Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale
     House Publishers) has sold millions, as well. These facts indicate that
     there is a general awareness among many Christians that we are living
     in the time of the end.
       The word Adventist in our church name means that we believe in the
     second coming of Christ so much that it’s part of our identity. Yet, our
     understanding of the Second Coming is far different from that advo-
     cated in the Left Behind™ series or by Hal Lindsey.

What does the Bible teach about the manner of Christ’s coming, and
     why is it of vital importance to know this? What deceptions did
     Jesus warn us about regarding the manner of His coming? Matt.
     24:5, 24–31; Rev. 1:7.

     ____________________________________________________________________

       First introduced by John N. Darby in the nineteenth century, the
     concept that Christ’s coming consists of two stages has captured the
     thinking of many Protestants today. The first supposed stage involves
     a secret rapture, when all true Christians will be caught up with
     Christ, and the second focuses on Christ’s appearing seven years later
     to rule on earth for 1,000 years.
       Seventh-day Adventists can find no scriptural support for splitting
     the Second Advent into a rapture and an appearing. According to the
     New Testament, Jesus’ return will be an indivisible, single, literal,
     audible, and visible event (1 Thess. 4:16, 17; Rev. 19:11–21). And, just
     as important, Jesus warned us against false interpretations about the
     manner of His coming. Jesus obviously knew that deception would be
     rampant (Matt. 24:24), which is why the Word of God is so clear about
     how He will return.

      Though the passing of every day brings us closer to Christ’s
      return, the passing of each day also makes His return seem more
      and more delayed. How do we strike the balance between living
      in the expectation of Christ’s return and yet simply getting on in
      the daily routine of life?

                                                                         85

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Can Our Dead Speak to
         Us?” pp. 551–562; “God’s People Delivered,” pp. 635–652, in The
         Great Controversy.

           During the early years, many of our pioneers became imbalanced in
         their preaching of the law. Hence, Ellen White wrote in 1890: “As a peo-
         ple, we have preached the law until we are as dry as the hills of Gilboa
1
         that had neither dew nor rain. We must preach Christ in the law.”
         —Review & Herald, March 11, 1890. At the 1888 Minneapolis General
         Conference session, E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones did just that. The
         burden of their message was “to affirm the truth that the only way righ-
         teousness can be obtained is through a living faith in the Lamb of God,
         whose blood was shed on Calvary’s cross as a propitiation for the sins
2
         of the world. No one can enter the kingdom of God without being clad
         in the spotless robe of Christ’s righteousness. This robe can neither be
         purchased with silver or gold nor earned by good works. This message
         was a clarion call to make Christ and His righteousness the center of all
         our living and our preaching. It placed special emphasis on righteous-
         ness by faith as a real personal experience rather than a mere theory.”
         —A. V. Olson, Through Crisis to Victory 1888–1901 (Washington,
         D.C.: Review and Herald® Publishing Association, 1966), p. 35.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Is there any teaching of the Seventh-day Adventist Church
          that is based on anything other than the Bible? That is, is there
          any doctrine that comes from Ellen White rather than the Bible?
          Though we believe in the gift of prophecy, why must we make
          sure that we know all our teachings are from the Bible alone?
          What problems are created if we lean on Ellen White for our doc-
          trines? At the same time, why is she so helpful to us in clarifying
          and understanding teachings that we have gotten from the Bible?

          ●
          2 Dwell on the idea that Sabbath keeping is an expression of the
          rest we have in Christ, in that our salvation is based on His works
          for us, not on our own. How does this help answer the spurious
          charge that by keeping the Sabbath, we are denying the gospel of
          God’s grace?

          ●3 Even critics of Ellen G. White admit that she played a big role
          in moving the Adventist Church from legalism toward a more
          Cross-centered view of salvation, which is a strange thing for a
          “false prophet” (what many of these same people refer to her as)
          to do. How is the inconsistency of these critics revealed by their
          view that, though a “false prophet,” she nevertheless guided the
          church away from legalism?

The Eavesdropper
by DAVID VIKAS PAN
  Chhabi stood in the shadows, straining to hear the visitor talking to her
brother-in-law about a God named Jesus.
  Several weeks earlier Chhabi had heard her brother-in-law say,
“Something good is in this Jesus.” She wondered who this Jesus was and
why her brother-in-law was interested in Him. Chhabi wanted to learn
more about this Jesus, but her husband forbade her to join the Bible study
on the veranda. So when the Global Mission pioneers, David and Swarna,
visited their home, Chhabi eavesdropped on the Bible studies being held
on the family’s veranda.
  Chhabi found Swarna’s telephone number and called her. She told
Swarna, “I want to know about Jesus, but my husband won’t allow it.
Please pray to your God that He will cause my husband to allow me to
search for the true God,” she begged. The two women began meeting
secretly to study the Bible while Chhabi’s husband was at work.
  One day when the women were studying, Chhabi’s daughter rushed in
to tell her that Father was coming! Fearing what he would say, Chhabi
asked Swarna to pray before he entered the house. When he arrived, he sat
down to listen to their study. Chhabi asked her husband why he was home
early, and he said that he was not feeling well. Swarna prayed for him, and
soon he said he felt better. After that, Chhabi’s husband allowed her to
study the Bible with Swarna.
  Chhabi learned to pray and began praying for her husband. He didn’t
argue when she wanted to attend church—a bold step for an Indian
woman, and in time she was baptized. Men don’t allow their wives to
teach them, but Chhabi encouraged him to read certain passages in the
Bible and decide for himself whether he was going to worship the idols or
the living God. Chhabi’s husband read the passages, and soon he joined
her in the faith. Today Chhabi’s family and three of her husband’s brothers
and their families have become Adventists.
  Then Chhabi turned to her own family. She is encouraging her mother,
a widow who lives in another area, to follow Jesus. She is praying that her
two brothers will also consider following Jesus. But there are no
Adventists in their village, and some villagers are pressuring them to
reject Christianity.

        LESSON           11 *March 7–13
      Interpreting the Prophetic
      Writings


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 65:17; Mark 1:15;
      Rom. 2:14–16; Eph. 2:8, 9; James 2:14–26; 1 John 5:12, 13.

Memory Text: “And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets,
      He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning
      Himself” (Luke 24:27, NKJV).

              s Seventh-day Adventists we believe that Ellen White mani-

      A       fested the gift of prophecy. The next question, however, is how
              do we interpret her writings?
         Though we believe that her inspiration, not her authority, is on the
      same level as the Old and New Testament prophets, when interpreting
      what she has written, we must apply the same principles of interpre-
      tation to her writings that we do to Scripture. Indeed, principles for
      interpreting the Bible can be used when interpreting Ellen White’s
      writings, even though the authority of the Bible is above the authority
      of the Spirit of Prophecy. To use an analogy from American law, one
      might use the same principles for interpreting a decision of the United
      States Supreme Court as for interpreting a decision by a lower court,
      but in the end the decision of the Supreme Court carries the ultimate
      authority.

The Week at a Glance: What is the difference between
      exegesis and the homiletical use of a biblical text? Why is context
      so important? Can people who have never heard the gospel be
      saved? What distinguishes the kingdom of grace from the kingdom
      of glory?

     Exegesis
       Exegesis is concerned with the original meaning of a text. It focuses
     on what the author wanted to say and what the text meant to the orig-
     inal reader.

What is the original or exegetical meaning of Romans 2:14–16?
     Compare Ezek. 3:17–19, Rom. 10:12–17.


       There is no question that there will be people in heaven who never
     have heard the gospel. “Among the heathen are those who worship God
     ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought by human instru-
     mentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of the written law
     of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them in nature, and have
     done the things that the law required. Their works are evidence that the
     Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized as the
     children of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 638.
       On occasion, God, apart from human messengers, reaches out to
     individuals in heathen lands and saves them. However, they are saved
     because the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they have
     responded appropriately as evidenced by their works. They are not
     saved because they have lived up to their conscience; if they were, then
     they would be saved by keeping the law, and the New Testament clearly
     denies that possibility (Rom. 3:28, Gal. 2:16). The issue in Romans
     2:11–16 is the accountability of Jews and Gentiles, not their salvation.
     The fact that God is no respecter of persons (vs. 11) is illustrated by
     what Paul says in Romans 2:12. “As many as have sinned without law
     will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will
     be judged by the law” (NKJV). Those “without law” are the Gentiles
     who do not have the written law given to the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
     However, they will perish, not because they did not have the written
     law but because they are sinners who have transgressed against the law
     “written in their hearts, their conscience” (vs. 15).
       In the judgment, Jews and Gentiles will be judged and condemned
     by their respective laws, the Jews by the written law and the Gentiles
     by the law “written in their hearts.” Among the Gentiles, conscience
     performed the same function as the written law performed among the
     Jews. Scripture clearly says that “ ‘there is no one righteous, not even
     one’ ” (Rom. 3:10, NIV). This means that Jews and Gentiles are sin-
     ners alike and are all saved the same way, not by any law keeping but
     only by Jesus’ death on the cross.

      How reliable a guide is your conscience? Does following your
      conscience always guarantee that you will make a right deci-
      sion? Justify your answer.
                                                                         89

     Homiletics
       Homiletics is the art of preaching. In a homiletics class a student
     learns sermon preparation and how to use the Scriptures in preaching.
     Sometimes a preacher may use just the wording of a text, without spe-
     cial regard for its original meaning, to make a point or an appeal dur-
     ing a sermon. This is called the homiletical use of Scripture.

What was the kingdom Jesus was proclaiming as being near in Mark
     1:15?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The kingdom that Jesus was proclaiming at that time was the kingdom
     of grace, which He established at His First Advent. But the text also can
     be applied to our situation today. A preacher on Sabbath morning may
     tell the congregation, “All the time prophecies have been fulfilled, the
     kingdom of God is at hand.” And he may appeal to them that today we
     need to repent and believe the gospel. The kingdom that the modern
     preacher has in mind, however, is no longer the kingdom of grace but the
     kingdom of glory that Christ will inaugurate at His second coming. The
     first interpretation of Mark 1:15 is exegetical, the second homiletical.
        According to Mark 1:17, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee one
     day when He saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the
     sea. Jesus said to them, “ ‘Follow me and I will make you become fish-
     ers of men’ ” (NKJV), and immediately they left their nets and followed
     Him.
        A modern preacher, using the words of Mark 1:17, may call upon
     church members to follow Jesus because only He can make us fishers of
     men. Exegetically the text applies to Simon and Andrew, but homileti-
     cally it can be applied to every Christian, because Jesus wants us all to
     become fishers of men (Matt. 28:19, 20).
        Ellen G. White frequently used Scripture homiletically. She was
     steeped in the language of the Bible, and whenever she spoke or wrote
     on a topic, she used biblical language and biblical texts to convey to the
     church the message that she had received from the Lord. For example,
     in the book Education, Ellen G. White has a chapter on the study of
     physiology. Speaking of good posture she says, “Among the first things
     to be aimed at should be a correct position, both in sitting and in stand-
     ing. God made man upright, and He desires him to possess not only the
     physical but the mental and moral benefit, the grace and dignity and self-
     possession, the courage and self-reliance, which an erect bearing so
     greatly tends to promote.”—Education, p. 198. That “God made man
     upright” is a quote from Ecclesiastes 7:29 (NKJV), but when Solomon
     wrote Ecclesiastes, he was referring to moral uprightness, not to posture.

     Time and Place
       A crucial rule of biblical interpretation is the principle of studying
     the times and circumstances during which a particular text was writ-
     ten and by whom.

What is Jeremiah describing in Jeremiah 4:23–26?

        When most Adventists read these texts, they think of the millen-
     nium. However, when Jeremiah wrote this text, around 600 B.C., he
     was not thinking of the millennium. The context of this passage is the
     destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C.
        God, through Jeremiah, pleaded with His people to turn from their
     evil ways, but they would not listen. In verses 23–26 the prophet sees
     in vision what will happen if they disobey. In poetic language he
     describes the waste and desolation that will come upon the land of
     Judah because of their disobedience. The crucial point is that when a
     text was written and under what circumstances need to be taken into
     account when we seek to interpret it.
        What happened with Judah and Jerusalem in 586 B.C. is a symbol of
     what will happen to the world in the future. When Jesus comes and the
     earth is cleansed with fire, Jeremiah 4:23–26 will be an apt descrip-
     tion of this earth during the millennium. Thus, exegetically, Jeremiah
     4:23–26 refers to the destruction of Jerusalem. Symbolically, however,
     it also refers to the time of the millennium. Ellen G. White, therefore,
     quotes from Jeremiah 4 to describe the situation on earth during the
     millennium.—The Great Controversy, p. 659.
        In reading Ellen White, we also need to take time and circumstances
     into account. For example, in 1897 Mrs. White wrote that “the money
     expended in bicycles and dress and other needless things must be
     accounted for.”—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 398.
        At the end of the nineteenth century, the bicycle was not an eco-
     nomical means of transportation but was rather a rich person’s toy. The
     best early bicycle cost US$150, an investment comparable to the cost
     of an expensive car today. People were mortgaging their income for
     months in advance to buy what was then an expensive luxury item.
     Within a few years’ time the bicycle became a useful and inexpensive
     means of transportation, and she never again spoke against it.
        Her policy on bicycles was based on the biblical principle of good
     stewardship. If she were alive today, she probably would apply this
     principle to other things that people spend frivolously on.

      Time and circumstances are important not just in the interpre-
      tation of inspired writings but in all aspects of life. How quick
      are you to judge the actions of others without getting more
      background information? How can you improve in this area?
                                                                         91
        W EDNESDAY March 11

     Immediate Context
Read Isaiah 65:17. What is the new heaven and new earth to which
     Isaiah is referring? Is it the new earth that Christians expect in
     the future?

        In the immediate context, Isaiah says, “ ‘No more shall an infant from
     there live but a few days, Nor an old man who has not fulfilled his
     days; For the child shall die one hundred years old, But the sinner being
     one hundred years old shall be accursed’ ” (vs. 20, NKJV). Death on the
     new earth? This cannot be the new earth we expect that follows the mil-
     lennium. What then is the new heaven and the new earth in verse 17?
        In this passage Isaiah describes a “new creation” that would have
     been brought about had Israel, following the restoration from the
     Babylonian captivity, remained faithful to God and fulfilled the divine
     commission to be a light to the world (Isa. 42:6). Unfortunately, it
     didn’t, and thus the prophecy, which was conditional, was not ful-
     filled. This “new heaven and new earth” never became a reality.
     Nevertheless, in a secondary sense these verses point forward to the
     new heaven and the new earth to be ushered in at the close of the mil-
     lennium. But in that “new earth and new heaven” there will be no chil-
     dren born to the redeemed (Matt. 22:30), neither will there be any
     more sorrow or death (Rev. 21:4), so we have to be careful how far we
     seek to push the imagery.
In Christ’s Object Lessons, Ellen White makes the statement that
     “those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion,
     should never be taught to say or to feel that they are saved.”
     —Page 155. Does this mean we can never be certain about our
     salvation? 1 John 5:12, 13.

        When we study the context, we discover that she is speaking about
     whether a person can fall from grace after conversion. Many Christians
     in her days believed in the doctrine of “once saved always saved.” Ellen
     White was clearly against this teaching. In context she says, “Never can
     we safely put confidence in self or feel, this side of heaven, that we are
     secure against temptation.”—Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 155.
        The immediate context makes it clear that she is addressing the issue
     of self-confidence and temptations after conversion. We are never
     secure against temptations, we can never say that we cannot fall, that
     we are saved and therefore secure from temptation, but this does not
     mean that in Jesus we cannot have day-by-day assurance of salvation.

      If your hope of salvation rests in what Jesus did for you, how can
      you then not have assurance of salvation? On the other hand, if
      you are looking to self, how can you ever have any assurance at all?

      The Larger Context
        The larger context refers to what other texts beyond the immediate
      passage have to say on a particular topic. It can refer to other chapters
      in a book, the whole book, or to the whole of Scripture.

Are we saved by grace through faith alone, or do we also need works?
      Eph. 2:8, 9; James 2:14–26. Is Paul in conflict with James on the
      issue of salvation? What do the following texts have to say on this
      topic? Rom. 3:21–28, Rom. 4:3, Gal. 3:6–12.


         When we look at the larger context in Scripture, what other passages
      have to say on the topic, we discover that James is not arguing for good
      works as a requirement for salvation. Rather, he insists that there are two
      kinds of faith, one valid and the other invalid. Paul speaks about the
      valid faith that is followed by good deeds. James refers to the invalid
      faith that stops at the intellectual level, faith that is mere mental assent.
         Paul uses the example of Abraham to show that we are justified on
      the basis of valid, or real, faith. James shows that Abraham’s faith was
      real because it produced good works (obedience). Therefore, we do
      not need anything but faith, valid faith, to be saved, and our behavior
      will show if our faith is valid or not.
         When reading Ellen White, we also need to look at the larger context
      in her writings; i.e., everything she has written on a particular topic. We
      cannot just take one or two statements and run with them. For example,
      on the issue of meat-eating she has very absolute-sounding statements
      but also many modifying statements that need to be considered, as well.
         In the book Counsels on Diet and Foods, she says: “Vegetables, fruits,
      and grains should compose our diet. Not an ounce of flesh meat should
      enter our stomachs. The eating of flesh is unnatural. We are to return to
      God’s original purpose in the creation of man.”—Page 380. Anyone read-
      ing only this statement would have to come to the conclusion that under
      no circumstances are we to eat meat. However, a few pages further on is
      this statement: “A meat diet is not the most wholesome of diets, and yet
      I would not take the position that meat should be discarded by every one.
      Those who have feeble digestive organs can often use meat, when they
      cannot eat vegetables, fruit, or porridge.”—Pages 394, 395. (See also
      Friday’s lesson.) When we look at the total body of what she has written
      on a given topic, a balanced picture emerges that is invaluable for every
      Christian who takes religion seriously.
       While we shouldn’t make meat and drink our religion, God has
       given us wonderful counsel about diet that can have a positive
       impact on our health. How careful are you in your diet and all
       your habits? Why wait until sickness strikes before you make a
       change for the better?
                                                                               93

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Christ Our Righteousness,”
         pp. 35–39; “Ellen White Clearly Draws the Lines,” pp. 41–46; “Faith
         and Works,” pp. 47–50, in Faith and Works.

         Further Guidelines for the Interpretation of Inspired Writings
            Apart from the guidelines studied in this week’s lesson, we need to
         (a) ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the study of His Word;
         (b) ensure that we use one or more good translations; (c) look for prin-
1
         ciples that are universal and apply to all people, in all places, and at
         all times; (d) be willing to obey the truths we discover; (e) be open-
         minded and willing to surrender previously held positions; (f) guard
         against extreme interpretations; (g) work together with people of
         experience; and (h) use common sense.

         Ellen G. White on Once Saved Always Saved
            “There is nothing so offensive to God or so dangerous to the human
         soul as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless,
         the most incurable. Peter’s fall was not instantaneous, but gradual.
         Self-confidence led him to the belief that he was saved, and step after
         step was taken in the downward path, until he could deny his Master.
         Never can we safely put confidence in self or feel, this side of heaven,
         that we are secure against temptation. Those who accept the Saviour,
3
         however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to
         feel that they are saved. This is misleading. Every one should be
         taught to cherish hope and faith; but even when we give ourselves to
         Christ and know that He accepts us, we are not beyond the reach of
         temptation.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 154, 155.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Look at the whole context of the Ellen White quote above. Now
          look at the one statement about not saying we are saved. How
          easy to take that one statement out of context and come away
          with a whole different meaning from what was intended. Why
          must we always be careful not to pull statements out of context?
          What other examples can you find of people having done just
          that? Why is it such a temptation?

          ●
          2 What are some other ways that Ellen White’s writings have been
          misused? What can we do, however, to avoid the trap of throwing
          the whole thing out, simply because it has not been used properly?

          ●3 Think about what we’ve been given with the health message
          as it appears in the writings of Ellen White. What great blessings
          can we take away from it if we use it properly? What traps must
          we avoid?

Amina’s Forbidden God
   Amina* (ah-MEE-nah) lives in northern Africa. From childhood she
read her holy book, and there she met Issa (Jesus) and fell in love with
Him. She often asked her father to tell her more about this Prophet who
was a perfect Man. As she grew to adulthood, Amina became a sincere and
faithful follower of her family’s religion, but she never forgot Issa.
   One day a Christian girlfriend invited Amina to visit the Adventist
chapel in her city, and Amina went. She couldn’t explain why she went, for
going to a Christian house of prayer was a dangerous thing to do. But she
went. And something—some power she did not fully understand—drew
her to return again and again. Little by little Amina’s faith in her family’s
religion faded as her love for Issa grew.
   Amina’s father saw that Amina was losing her faith and wanted to wake
her up to the danger she was in. Because she no longer submitted to daily
prayers with the family, her father refused to allow her to enter his home.
He hoped that she would realize her error and once more worship with
them. But it didn’t work. Finally after almost a year of estrangement,
Amina’s parents invited her to return home—but she wasn’t allowed to
speak of Issa or Christianity inside the house. For nearly 10 years Amina
kept her faith to herself. For 10 years she didn’t worship in the Adventist
chapel in town or talk about Issa.
   Then one day Amina asked her girlfriend to take her to the Adventist
chapel. There she met a missionary who welcomed her with joy. Amina
spoke at length with the missionary and asked many questions about Issa.
Is He really God? What does He require of followers?
   Amina continued worshiping at the chapel, and several months later, she
surrendered her life to Issa and was baptized. The Lord, Issa, has become
everything to her. Amina has made a dangerous decision, for in her culture
to leave her family’s faith could mean death.
   In spite of the danger, Amina bravely shares her faith in quiet ways and
with much prayer. With kind words, a visit, and a smile, she shares her
faith. And through her actions, the Spirit of God is touching hearts. God
often arranges opportunities for Amina to show her faith in Issa.
   Pray for Amina and her quiet ministry in the shadows of her daily life.
Pray that her acts of faith become as precious drops of water to the
parched desert of her hostile homeland.
   Your mission offerings help reach people such as Amina for Issa. Thank
you.

        LESSON           12 *March 14–20
      The Blessings of the
      Prophetic Gift




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 17:14, 34:27, Lev.
      11:1–8, Deut. 6:4–7, Isa. 44:8, 49:6.

      Memory Text: “Surely the Lord God does nothing, unless
      He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7,
      NKJV).

              ll through biblical history, the Lord worked through the

      A       prophets (including those who wrote no books of the Bible) in
              order to encourage, uplift, and warn God’s people. However
      unpopular at times their messages, or however often their motives
      were misunderstood, these people all had one goal in mind: to bless
      and benefit God’s church. And it was certainly no different with Ellen
      White and her prophetic gift.
         This week we are going to look at some of the blessings that come
      to God’s people through the prophetic gift. The Seventh-day Adventist
      Church, certainly as we know it today, would probably not exist had it
      not been for the guidance God gave this movement through the Spirit
      of Prophecy.

The Week at a Glance: Why and for what purpose did
      God elect Israel as His special people? How were the young peo-
      ple in Israel educated in Old Testament times? What were some of
      the counsels on health that God gave the Israelites? Why did the
      Israelites write God’s Word on the doorframes of their houses?
      How has the Lord used the gift of prophecy to benefit the church?

        God chose Israel to be His witnesses. All nations of the earth were
      to share in the blessings that He was to bestow on His people. Israel
      was to show forth His praise (Isa. 43:21), declare His glory among the
      nations (Isa. 66:19), and be a light to the Gentiles.

What is the mission of the Christian church, and how well is it car-
      rying out this mission? Matt. 28:19, 20.


         The Christian church experienced two great periods of expansion in
      its history. The first period was the time of its establishment in the
      first and second centuries; the second was during the nineteenth cen-
      tury, also called the century of mission. Following the great revivals
      of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Christian church
      established many Bible and missionary societies in Europe and
      America, and within 100 years it increased from 18 percent of the
      world population in the year 1800 to 34 percent in 1900.
         In the early decades of Seventh-day Adventist history, it was
      believed that the church was fulfilling God’s command to teach all
      nations simply by preaching to the immigrants in North America.
      However, Ellen White in 1871 wrote, “Young men should be qualify-
      ing themselves by becoming familiar with other languages, that God
      may use them as mediums to communicate His saving truth to those
      of other nations.”—Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, p. 204.
         Then in 1874 she had an impressive dream of giving the third
      angel’s message to the world. In the dream she was told: “You are
      entertaining too limited ideas of the work for this time. . . .
         “The message will go in power to all parts of the world, to Oregon,
      to Europe, to Australia, to the islands of the sea, to all nations,
      tongues, and peoples. . . . Your faith is limited, it is very small. Your
      conception of the work needs to be greatly enlarged.”—Pages 208,
      209.
         In the same year J. N. Andrews became the first official Seventh-
      day Adventist missionary. He and his children went to Switzerland,
      and three years later the John G. Matteson family was sent to
      Scandinavia. Today, out of 229 countries of the world recognized by
      the United Nations, Seventh-day Adventists have an established work
      in more than two hundred of them.

       How do we strike the balance between working for souls over-
       seas while at the same time not neglecting the mission field in
       our own backyard?

                                                                           97

How were the young people in Israel educated in Old Testament

        Through the father’s instructions Hebrew children were taught what
     God had done for His people in the past, how they were to live in His
     presence, and what God’s promises were for the future. They also were
     taught the skills they would need to be successful members of their
     community. It was, therefore, both an education in practical skills
     along with spiritual and religious instruction.
        In the earliest days of the Adventist movement, private initiatives
     among our pioneers led to several attempts to establish a school for
     Adventist children, but none of them lasted long.
        Then at the beginning of 1872, Ellen White received a vision on the
     proper principles of education. On the basis of this vision she wrote
     30 pages on those principles. Among other things she wrote, “We need
     a school where those who are just entering the ministry may be taught
     at least the common branches of education, and where they may also
     learn more perfectly the truths of God’s word for this time.”
     —Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 45, 46.
        In May 1872 the General Conference committee agreed to assume
     responsibility for a locally operated church school in Battle Creek,
     Michigan, and on June 3 the first official Seventh-day Adventist
     school opened its doors. Two years later 100 students were enrolled in
     the newly established Battle Creek College.
        Today more than six thousand Adventist schools, colleges, and uni-
     versities serve more than one million students around the world.

      be different from other schools? Make a list of specific charac-
      teristics and discuss them in class.

     Health
     God told the Israelites: “ ‘If you diligently heed the voice of the
     Lord your God and do what is right in His sight . . . I will put none
     of the diseases on you which I have brought on the Egyptians’ ”
     (Exod. 15:26, NKJV). What were some of the counsels on health
     given to them by God? Lev. 7:22–26, 11:1–8, 13:46.

        For centuries, leprosy and the Black Death spread fear and terror
     among medieval humanity. It was only when church leaders remem-
     bered that people afflicted with leprosy in the Bible were segregated
     and excluded from the community, and they applied this principle to
     the victims of leprosy and the bubonic plague that these scourges were
     stopped.
        Most Seventh-day Adventist pioneers were anything but health
     reformers. At the 1848 Sabbath Conferences, they most likely sat
     together eating pork chops for lunch. In a vision in 1848, Ellen
     G. White was shown that tobacco, tea, and coffee are harmful, but it
     took several years to convince the membership.
        On June 6, 1863, Ellen G. White received a vision in which she was
     shown the need for health reform. “I saw that it was a sacred duty to
     attend to our health, and arouse others to their duty.”—Selected Messages,
     book 3, p. 280. Two years later, on December 25, 1865, she was shown
     that Seventh-day Adventists should establish a health institute. The
     Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, which opened its doors
     in 1866, was the first of a network of more than three hundred hospitals,
     clinics, and dispensaries that the church operates today.

What can we say to those who claim that Ellen G. White copied the
     health message from other health reformers of her time?

        Recent research into Ellen G. White’s health message has revealed
     that there is a vast difference in quality between Ellen G. White’s prin-
     ciples of health and those advocated by other health reformers in her
     time. “Modern medical science has verified a high percentage of her
     health principles . . . while the sources from which she supposedly
     copied had a low percentage of health principles that have been veri-
     fied. This difference indicates that Mrs. White had health information
     that could not have come from any human source available anywhere
     at the time she lived.”—Leonard Brand and Don S. McMahon, The
     Prophet and Her Critics (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing
     Association, 2005), pp. 87, 88.

      The health message is a wonderful gift from God to us. Like all
      of His gifts, it can be, and indeed, has been abused. How can we
      avoid turning this gift into a curse?
                                                                           99

      Publishing
       According to Scripture, Moses was the first one to write down
      God’s words (Exod. 17:14, 34:27, Deut. 31:24). Today, the Bible is the
      most published and most read book in history.

Where were the Israelites to write the words of the law? Why do you
      think that command was given? Deut. 6:1–9, 11:18–20.


        To inscribe important sayings or statements in conspicuous places
      on their dwellings was a custom widely prevalent in the ancient Near
      East. It is evident in Muslim countries and even among Western
      nations. In the British Isles, as well as in Germany, Austria, and
      Switzerland, inscriptions can be seen on houses.
        In Israel the purpose of writing God’s Word on the doorframes of their
      dwellings was to keep God’s instructions constantly in view and in mind,
      thereby reminding them continuously to keep God’s commandments.

What role did publishing play in the early history of the Seventh-day
      Adventist Church?


         The publishing work in our church did not originate from human
      wisdom. In 1848, Ellen G. White had a vision in the home of Otis
      Nichols in Dorchester, Massachusetts. When she came out of it, she
      said to James, “ ‘I have a message for you. You must begin to print a
      little paper and send it out to the people. Let it be small at first; but as
      the people read, they will send you means with which to print, and it
      will be a success from the first. From this small beginning it was
      shown to me to be like streams of light that went clear round the
      world.’ ”—Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, p. 125.
         “ ‘Streams of light that went clear round the world’ ”! How could that
      be? Jesus was coming soon. The number of Adventists were so few.
      There were no wealthy persons or great scholars among them. The
      world was unbelieving. And yet, here was a young woman who pre-
      dicted that a work of publishing, to be started by her penniless husband,
      would grow until it would encompass the globe? More than six months
      went by before James White could make even the smallest beginning,
      arranging on a charge account for the printing of 1,000 copies of an
      eight-page paper. Today the Seventh-day Adventist Church owns more
      than fifty publishing houses, and the message is being printed and pro-
      claimed in more than two hundred twenty languages.

     Theology
        All through biblical history, God has used the prophetic gift to pro-
     tect His people from theological errors. It was no different with the
     ministry of Ellen White. In the early days of our church she had to
     combat fanaticism of various kinds. Some people claimed to be per-
     fect, others stated that no more work should be done, and some kept
     on setting times for Christ’s return. During the Kellogg crisis at the
     turn of the century, her counsel saved the church from pantheism. At
     the same time, almost single-handedly she led the church from a semi-
     Arian (a belief that Jesus was not God) to a Trinitarian position. When
     A. F. Ballenger tried to change the sanctuary teaching, she took a
     strong stand against it. Ellen White also had a strong role in keeping
     the church of her day from falling deep into legalism; along with A. T.
     Jones and E. J. Waggoner, she was a great proponent of salvation by
     faith in Christ alone, without the deeds of the law.
        After her death, her writings continued to give guidance to the church.
     In more recent times, her writings provide clear direction on the issue of
     Creation, which is coming under attack even from within our own ranks.

What does the Old Testament teach about origins of human life? Gen.
     1:1–3, Exod. 20:8–11, Ps. 33:6, Isa. 42:5.


       According to the Old Testament, the Lord created life on our earth
     in six days. The Hebrew word translated day in Genesis 1 is yom.
     Whenever this word in the historical books of the Bible is accompa-
     nied by a numeral, it always refers to a literal 24-hour period (see Gen.
     7:11, Exod. 16:1). In resting on the seventh day of the Creation week,
     God established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial of His com-
     pleted creative work. In short, we are on immovable biblical ground
     by adhering to a literal six-day Creation, despite voices, even among
     us, that would argue for something else.
       And though Ellen White has been dead for almost a century, here,
     too, her words give us a strong affirmation of this great Bible truth: “I
     was then carried back to the creation and was shown that the first
     week, in which God performed the work of creation in six days and
     rested on the seventh day, was just like every other week.”—Spiritual
     Gifts, vol. 3, p. 90.

      Despite the clear testimony of the Bible, despite the strong affir-
      mation of Ellen White, some among us still insist that God used
      millions of years of evolution to create human life. What examples
      can you find from the Bible of people getting so caught up in the
      trends of their time that they lose sight of important truth? How
      can we protect ourselves from falling into the same tired, old trap?
                                                                          101

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Teaching and Healing,”
          pp. 139–160, in The Ministry of Healing; “Source and Aim of True
          Education,” pp. 13–19; “Relation of Education to Redemption,”
          pp. 28–30, in Education.

             Many of the principles of healthful living found in the writings of
          Ellen White already were taught in a limited way by other health
          reformers of her day. But in their teaching we find many errors and
          extremes that Ellen White avoided because of the instructions she
          received from God. For example, Sylvester Graham and James
1         Jackson, two prominent health reformers in Ellen White’s day, both
          taught, “Don’t eat salt.” Ellen G. White, however, wrote, “I use some
          salt, and always have, because salt, instead of being deleterious, is
          actually essential for the blood.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9,
          p. 162.
             Other errors that were taught by health reformers in the nineteenth
2         century and that Ellen G. White avoided included: Do not cut your
          hair; do not drink water—get your liquids from fruit only; when eat-
          ing meat, eat mostly the fat; overweight people are healthy people; do
          not use soap, etc.—Leonard Brand and Don S. McMahon, The
          Prophet and Her Critics (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing
          Association, 2005), pp. 77, 78.

           ●2 We now live in the day and age of science, where for many peo-
           ple science is the only way to know truth. How interesting that of
           all the things we teach (the Second Coming, salvation by faith,
           the state of the dead, etc.), only one can be verified scientifically:
           our health message. Dwell on the implications of that thought.

           ●3 As Seventh-day Adventists we insist, and rightly so, that all our
           doctrines need to come from the Bible and the Bible only. At the
           same time, if we believe that Ellen White manifested the gift of
           prophecy, shouldn’t weight and credence be given to her writings
           on doctrine, as well? How do we find the right balance in how we
           use her writings to deal with theological issues?

           ●4 As with the Bible, there are things about Ellen White’s writ-
           ings that we don’t understand. How can we protect ourselves
           from getting into the deadly mode of focusing only on the prob-
           lems or concerns, and missing the greater picture?

Moans in the Night
  by JAMES APPEL

   Wails and moans cut into the evening’s silence. These sounds of mourn-
ing come from just beyond the hospital wall. Allawaye lives there. His
third wife’s baby was recently hospitalized for meningitis. After a course
of antibiotics he was sent home eating and with no fever. But three days
later Allawaye brought him back, feverish again. The bacteria in his body
is resistant, and we have no other antibiotics to treat it.
   The next morning Allawaye returned to the hospital. The baby is better,
but not well enough to go home. I explain that the baby is still sick and
could still die. One of Allawaye’s wives speaks in a low, threatening tone.
“We will take the baby home. Your treatments have not worked, and it’s
time to consult a witch doctor.” I explain why the child must stay in the
hospital, and Allawaye agrees to finish the treatment.
   I offer to pray for the baby, and the family agrees. I plead with God to
prove that it’s not witchcraft that has made the child sick and ask Him to
heal the child. We’ve done all we can with our limited medical supplies,
and now we need a miracle.
   The wails next door tell me that God has not intervened.
   Most people in this area believe that disease is caused by witchcraft, that
someone has cast a spell on them. They seek treatment from the “tradi-
tional” healers—the witch doctors—and come to the hospital only when
the patient is nearly dead. Then, if the patient dies, it’s our fault.
   My frustration rises with the wailing. How does one fight, not just
against the forces of physical disease in a resource-poor setting, but
against the forces of ignorance and evil? I’ve tried to give patients hope,
to encourage them to fight, only to hear family members tell them that
they are going to die. The sick person loses hope and eventually dies, at
least in part because of the psychological attacks of their family. Nothing
I’ve experienced in Tchad even comes close to that for discouraging.
   I light my kerosene lamp and open my Bible to John 3:19. “Light has
come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their
deeds were evil” (NIV).
   I understand God’s dilemma. He can’t mess with free will. Satan can use
fear, superstition, manipulation, coercion, and brutality, but God won’t.
And because I’ve aligned myself on God’s side, I can’t use force either.
Sometimes I’d like to shake parents who wait to bring their child to the
hospital half dead instead of when they first get sick.
   It’s true: People do love the darkness rather than the light. There’s noth-
ing we can do except continue to fight, continue to pray. Maybe one or two
will see the light and come out of the darkness.

      Confidence in the
      Prophetic Gift




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 41:9; Isa. 53:4–6;
      Matt. 23:28–31; John 5:39; Acts 10:9–16, 44–48; 17:11.

Memory Text: “Jehoshaphat stood and said, ‘Hear me, O Judah
      and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the Lord your God,
      and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall
      prosper’ ” (2 Chronicles 20:20, NKJV).

            ome folk were interested in joining the Seventh-day Adventist

      S     Church. They had come to accept the teachings of the church
            through their study of the Bible but had questions about Ellen
      White. After all, with so many false prophets and false teachers out
      there, they wanted to be careful. Knowing their concerns, and under-
      standing them, the minister said to them: “This is something you have
      to come to on your own, through a personal conviction of the Holy
      Spirit. Take time to read her writings. Some things will resonate
      clearly with you right away; other things you might have questions
      about. But just read the books yourself and then come to your own
      conclusion about them. In the end, her writings are really the best and
      ultimate testimony regarding their origins.”

The Week at a Glance: Why must the Bible be our final
      doctrinal authority? How important is Bible study in our lives
      today? What happens when people ignore the prophetic word?
      What role should miracles have in establishing our faith? Why do
      people rebel against the prophetic gift?

      Biblical Authority
What parallels do you see between the experience of the disciples after
      the Crucifixion and the early Advent believers after the Great
      Disappointment in 1844? Luke 24:13–27; Acts 10:9–16, 44–48.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The disciples experienced their great disappointment at the Crucifix-
      ion. They had hoped Jesus would redeem Israel; as they watched Him
      ride a donkey into Jerusalem in fulfillment of Zechariah’s prophecy,
      they were certain that He would set Himself up as their king, drive out
      the Romans, and establish God’s kingdom on earth. Only after His
      death, when He had “opened their understanding, that they might
      comprehend the Scriptures” (Luke 24:45, NKJV), did they see for the
      first time that He had come for a different purpose. In other words,
      even with all those years of Jesus being in their midst, even with His
      plain testimony, they made mistakes; they still didn’t understand what
      the Scriptures had taught. Jesus pointed them to the Bible, and on that
      they were to base their beliefs.

Read Acts 1:6. What does this say about how, even after Jesus was
      with them after the Resurrection, they still were carrying false
      ideas about what His coming meant?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The early Advent believers also experienced a great disappointment
      because of William Miller’s mistaken view that the sanctuary in
      Daniel 8:14 was the earth. And just as Bible study and God’s super-
      natural interventions had helped the disciples to shed their mistaken
      views, so, too, did the early Advent believers come to a new under-
      standing of the sanctuary truth through their study of Scripture and by
      God’s guidance in the prophetic ministry of Ellen White.
         In the end, however helpful the prophetic gift was, our pioneers
      were determined to base doctrines on the Bible without using the
      prophetic gift as a doctrinal authority.
         Today, too, the strength and certainty of what we believe as
      Seventh-day Adventists must be based on the Word of God alone.
      Once we are certain of our doctrines from the Bible, and work from
      that firm base, we can truly have confidence in the prophetic gift.

                                                                         105

      Into the Word
Why did the Bereans study the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul
      said was true? Why did they not trust his words? Acts 17:11.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Because Paul preached Christ from Scripture, showing that He was
      the promised Messiah, those who heard him with an open mind were
      driven to study the Scriptures for themselves to see if these things
      were indeed so. In other words, even Paul’s words weren’t good
      enough. They had to be confirmed by the Bible.

What do the following texts tell us about the importance of the study
      of Scripture? Prov. 2:1–6, Isa. 34:16, Matt. 4:4, Rev. 1:3.

        Ellen White consistently lifted up God’s Word and encouraged
      church members to study it. “I recommend to you, dear reader, the
      Word of God as the rule of your faith and practice,” she wrote in Early
      Writings (p. 78). In the introduction to The Great Controversy she wrote,
      “In His word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for
      salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an authoritative,
      infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the
      revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience.”—Page 9.
        Why did the prophets throughout history admonish God’s people to
      read and study God’s Word? The reason is simple: God “gave His
      word to men as a revelation of Himself. Every new truth discerned is
      a fresh disclosure of the character of its Author. The study of the
      Scriptures is the means divinely ordained to bring men into closer
      connection with their Creator and to give them a clearer knowledge of
      His will. It is the medium of communication between God and
      man.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 69.
        Ellen White’s writings are never to be used in place of the Bible; on
      the contrary, she spent her life trying to get church members to read
      the Bible and make it the rule of faith for their lives.

       What are ways that you can get more out of your own Bible
       study? How can you make your time in the Bible more prof-
       itable than it is now?

Pointing to Jesus
Jesus said: “ ‘You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you
have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me’ ” (John
5:39, NKJV). What do the following Old Testament texts tell us
about Jesus? Ps. 16:9, 10; 41:9; Isa. 53:4–6; Mic. 5:2.


   Jesus said, “Abraham rejoiced to see my day” (John 8:56), “Moses . . .
wrote about Me” (John 5:46, NKJV), and “David [called Me] Lord”
(Matt. 22:45). He began His ministry in the synagogue at Nazareth
with the words of Isaiah, “ ‘The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me,
Because / the Lord has anointed Me / To preach good tidings to the
poor’ ” (Isa. 61:1, NKJV). Jesus then said, “ ‘Today this Scripture is
fulfilled in your hearing’ ” (Luke 4:21, NKJV). Jesus knew that the
Old Testament was replete with references to Him. He was the central
figure in Israel’s hope.
   The biblical authors from Moses to the apostle John directed their
readers to the One who would come first to save His people from their
sins (Matt. 1:21) and a second time to deliver them from the presence
of sin (Rev. 21:4).
   Following in the footsteps of the biblical prophets, Ellen White con-
sistently pointed people to their Savior Jesus Christ. “Whatever may
have been your past experience, however discouraging your present
circumstances, if you will come to Jesus just as you are, weak, help-
less, and despairing, our compassionate Saviour will meet you a great
way off, and will throw about you His arms of love and His robe of
righteousness.”—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 9. And she
admonished ministers to make Christ the center of everything. “Put
Christ into every sermon. Let the preciousness, mercy, and glory of
Jesus Christ be dwelt upon until Christ is formed within, the hope of
glory.”—Evangelism, p. 186.
   Repeatedly she emphasized that Jesus was very real to her. “I know
my Saviour loves me, and I love my Jesus. I rest in His love, notwith-
standing my imperfections.”—Manuscript Releases, vol. 4, p. 245.
Jesus was the center of her ministry. “The object of all ministry,” she
said, “is to keep self out of sight, and to let Christ appear. The exalta-
tion of Christ is the great truth that all who labor in word and doctrine
are to reveal.”—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 155.

 Forgetting for a moment about doctrine and theology, ask your-
 self this basic question: How well do I know Jesus? What does
 your answer tell you about yourself and your spiritual life?
 What changes might you need to make?

      The Blood of the Prophets
      “ ‘Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
      within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. Woe unto you, scribes
      and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the
      prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If
      we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been
      partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be
      witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which
      killed the prophets’ ” (Matt. 23:28–31).

What do Jesus’ words have to say about the attitude that many have
      had toward the prophets? What lesson can we draw from these
      words for ourselves?

         Despite all the evidence for the integrity and validity of Ellen
      White’s ministry, even among us there are those who are, in a sense,
      spilling “the blood of the prophets.” Among us, as in ancient Israel,
      there are those who in various ways, subtle and sometimes not so sub-
      tle, are working to destroy confidence in the prophetic ministry of
      Ellen White. It has been that way from the beginning, and we can be
      sure it will be right up to the end, as well. Just about every charge lev-
      eled against her and her works are similar to the charges leveled
      against the prophets of old and against the Word of God itself.
         Reasons for these attitudes vary (see Friday’s lesson). Some people
      have elevated her writings to a level that is inappropriate, and so oth-
      ers have reacted to that, sometimes going too far in response. Others
      have a false understanding of how inspiration works, and because her
      writings do not fit that understanding, they have turned against them.
      Some speak, perhaps, out of ignorance; others, perhaps, from mean-
      spirited hostility. Fortunately, we aren’t to judge motives or hearts. We
      simply have to be able, as Peter wrote, “to give an answer to every man
      that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and
      fear” (1 Pet. 3:15). In the end, each one of us will have to make a
      choice, regarding the voices we listen to and believe.

       What is your own attitude about the writings of Ellen White?
       Why do you hold them? Think through your reasons for those
       attitudes. Are you open to change, if need be?

     The Gift and Miracles
     “And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
     him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and tor-
     ments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those
     which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed
     them” (Matt. 4:24).

       Think about the ministry of Christ when He was here in the flesh.
     Time and again, Jesus performed miracle after miracle. Whether turn-
     ing water into wine (John 2:1–11), feeding the 5,000 (Matt.
     14:14–21), healing the sick (Matt. 4:24), or raising the dead (John
     11:1–45), Jesus punctuated His time here on earth with miracles, a
     powerful testimony to His divine power.

Read Luke 24:13–27, the story of Jesus and the two disciples on the
     road to Emmaus. What did He point them to in order to persuade
     them that Jesus of Nazareth was, indeed, the Messiah? Why is that
     answer so important to us, particularly in the context of the
     prophetic gift?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Despite all the miraculous things that Christ did while here, He
     pointed the two disciples to the Word of God and from the Bible alone
     worked to teach them the truth about His death and resurrection and
     what it all meant.
        This point shouldn’t be overlooked. Over the years, there have been
     numerous accounts of the miraculous ways in which the Lord worked
     through the ministry of Ellen White. Some of these accounts are more
     easily verifiable than others. Either way, in the end, our belief in the
     manifestation of the gift should not rest on accounts of miracles and
     so forth. Though they might have a role, the ultimate test must always
     be the Word of God and how the gift harmonizes with the Bible.
     Miracles are fine, but they are hardly the final test and mean nothing
     if the teachings are unbiblical.
        As with the inspiration of the Bible, questions remain about the
     manifestation of the prophetic gift in the life of Ellen White. Yet, the
     gift speaks for itself and gives the best testimony and witness regard-
     ing itself. There’s little that we, or accounts of miracles, could or
     should add. More than enough evidence has been given for anyone to
     make an informed decision regarding the gift, regardless of the unan-
     swered questions that we who “see through a glass, darkly” (1 Cor.
     13:12) might still have.
                                                                        109

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Attitudes Toward the Testi-
          monies,” pp. 40–48, in Selected Messages, book 1.

             Opposition or indifference to the writings of Ellen G. White usually
          is the result of (1) a failure to read enough of her writings to recognize
          and understand her overall and well-balanced instructions; (2) a failure
          to understand the proper relationship of her writings to Scripture; (3) a
          failure to recognize the true nature of divine inspiration; (4) a failure to
1         recognize the principle of time and place in connection with the coun-
          sel she has given; (5) a failure to acknowledge that her counsels are still
          relevant today; (6) a failure to recognize that while sufficient evidence
          is given to convince the honest in heart, the Lord does not remove the
          opportunities for doubt; (7) an unwillingness to make a personal sacri-
          fice of some cherished habit or practice that seems out of harmony
2         with the counsels given in the writings of Ellen G. White.
             Most opposition to the Spirit of Prophecy would disappear (1) if
          people would stop using some pet sentence or paragraph as a club
          with which to hit somebody else; (2) if everyone would apply the
          counsels to themselves instead of trying to apply them to someone
          else; (3) if we would not quote her without knowing where the quote
          is found (there are too many apocryphal sayings in existence); (4) if
          we would not discuss something she wrote without having studied
3         everything she wrote on a particular topic (partial knowledge can be
          more dangerous than no knowledge at all); (5) if we would recognize
          that people’s failure to live up to or carry out the counsels that Ellen
          White has given has nothing whatsoever to do with the reliability of
          the visions and instructions.—Based on Denton E. Rebok, Believe His
          Prophets (Washington, D.C.: The Review and Herald® Publishing
          Association, 1956), pp. 309–312.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 As a class, talk about the blessings the Adventist Church has
           received from the ministry of Ellen White. What are some favorite
           quotations? How has her writing personally impacted each mem-
           ber’s spiritual growth? At the same time, what struggles have peo-
           ple sometimes had with her writings? What was the cause of those
           problems, and how can we help folk work through them?

           ●2 Many new people coming to the Adventist Church have ques-
           tions regarding Ellen White. What are some approaches we could
           take in helping them come to a balanced understanding of the gift?

           ●
           3 What have you learned this quarter that helps you better
           understand the role of the Spirit of Prophecy? What positions
           have you had to change? What new insights have you gained?
           What questions still remain?

The Drunkard and the Tailor
  by FULGÊNCIO CHALUFOIA

   I was a drunkard, and my drinking robbed me of everything. But a hum-
ble tailor helped me find my way back from the edge of hell.
   I live in Mozambique. I kept my drinking a secret until I was married,
hoping that I could stop. But I was powerless to stop. After we were mar-
ried, my drinking only got worse. Sometimes I was so drunk I beat my wife,
and she threatened to leave me.
   I went to a witch doctor, but he could not help me conquer my addiction.
Finally my wife had enough; she left me.
   Desperate to stop drinking, I bought a Bible and began attending church.
One Sunday on my way to church, I met a tailor working in his roadside
shop. “Where are you going?” he asked.
   “To church,” I replied.
   “Why are you going today?” he asked. “Yesterday was God’s Sabbath
day.” Curious, I stopped. The tailor told me that God had the answer to my
drinking problem and offered to teach me the Bible. The tailor could not
read, but he knew the Bible. He sat down beside me, opened a notebook
filled with Bible references, and pointed to one. “Look up this verse,” he
said. I found the Bible verses and read them. Then he explained what they
meant.
   We read many Bible texts, and the tailor explained each one to me.
Finally he told me to read Exodus 20. I read the Ten Commandments, and
suddenly I realized that the Bible was filled with new truths that I had never
read before.
   I asked the tailor what church he belonged to, and he told me the
Seventh-day Adventist Church. He invited me to worship there the follow-
ing Sabbath. I promised to be there as I continued on to my church to tell
my friends what I had just learned.
   The next Sabbath I found the Adventist church and worshiped there. In
that church I found God’s grace and the power to overcome alcohol and
tobacco. It took some time, but with God’s help, I never smoked or drank
again.
   My drinking had cost me everything—my job, my wife, my home. But
God has given me my life back. I am happy in Jesus, and I have invited my
friends to find Jesus as well. So far at least 15 of my friends have discov-
ered God’s truth and joined the Adventist church because I shared with
them what God has done for me.

2009     Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

        This quarter we will look at two important aspects of faith—
     doctrine and experience. We will focus on 13 essential themes of the
     Christian faith, 13 essential teachings. Each week’s lesson will
     attempt to maintain a careful balance between a correct biblical
     understanding of these various elements of our faith and how they
     impact our daily experience. It’s our hope that by the end of the quar-
     ter you will not only understand these themes better but also have
     been enriched as far as your Christian experience is concerned. Each
     lesson is not just about truth but about “the truth as it is in Jesus.”
        After all, He is the One who is the Alpha and Omega of our faith.
     There may be 13 different themes, but they will have one focus: the
     One in whom “we live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28).
Lesson 1—Love
        The Week at a Glance:
     SUNDAY: Love—The Fabric of Life (Gen. 1:26, John 3:16)
     MONDAY: The Old Testament God—A God of Love (Jer. 31:3)
     TUESDAY: The New Testament God (Phil. 2:5–8 )
     WEDNESDAY: A Response of Love (Matt. 5:44, 25:31–46, 1 Pet.
     1:22)
     THURSDAY: Love Personified (Luke 17:12–19)
     Memory Text—1 Corinthians 13:13
     Sabbath Gem: God is love. His love is more than we can
     fathom. Our concept of love is often shallow in comparison with the
     infinite love of God. Whatever else God is aside from love, what-
     ever He has done, is doing, and will do—everything is a manifes-
     tation of His never-ending love.
Lesson 2—Faith
        The Week at a Glance:
        SUNDAY: A Gift From God (Rom. 10:17)
        MONDAY: The Basis of Our Faith (John 5:39)
        TUESDAY: Exercising Faith (Matt. 9:29)
        WEDNESDAY: Growing in Faith (1 Cor. 16:13)
        THURSDAY: Faith in a Person (1 Pet. 2:4–8)
        Memory Text—Ephesians 2:8
        Sabbath Gem: Faith is a deep-rooted assurance that affects an
        entire person. It is a principle that governs life. Faith is the means
        by which we reach out and grab hold of God’s promises that we
        can’t see but trust are there.
