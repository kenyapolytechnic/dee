          The Johannine

   I
        n 2007 a popular science magazine (Wired) had a cover arti-
        cle titled “What We Don’t Know About . . .” The article
        then ran short pieces on such unanswered mysteries as
        “Why Do We Sleep?” “Is Time an Illusion?” “What’s at the
   Earth’s Core?” “What Is the Universe Made Of?” and “Why
   Can’t We Predict the Weather?”
     Even after hundreds of years of scientific advancement, on
   such basics, we’re still in the dark!
     Fortunately, on the most basic of all questions (and by far
   more important than “What’s at the earth’s core?”)—questions
   such as “How did we get here?” “Why are we here?” and
                                    “Where are we going?”—we
                                    haven’t been left to grope in dark-
“In Jesus we find the               ness. Instead, God has revealed to
                                    us, in the Bible, the answers to
answers to the most                 these fundamental concerns. And
important questions.”               among those revelations given to
                                    us in Scripture, we have the writ-
                                    ings of John the evangelist.
     This quarter, instead of studying John’s Gospel (his own
   inspired eyewitness account of Jesus) or the book of Revelation
   (which he also wrote), we’re going to study his three letters.
   Though addressed to certain churches and individuals in his
   time, they deal with issues relevant to us today, issues such as
   false doctrine, sin, love, apostasy, and obedience. But most
   important of all, they deal with Jesus Christ, the One through
   whom we were created (“How did we get here?”), the One who
   gives our existence meaning and purpose (“Why are we here?”),
   and the One who promises to come again and raise us to eter-
   nal life (“Where are we going?”). In short, in Jesus we find the
    2
Epistles
 answers to the most important questions.
   As with many of the letters of the New Testament, John’s don’t
 occur in a vacuum. On the contrary, they were written to deal
 with issues facing some churches at that time, including the
 nature of Christ, which for John wasn’t mere abstract theology
 but a topic that impacted the Christian’s view of truth. For
 John, to deny that Jesus Christ “has come in the flesh” would
 ultimately lead to a view of sin and redemption that radically
 differs from the Bible’s teaching. It would lead to a different
 dynamic within the community of believers and to a different
 relationship to the “world.” Finally, it would lead to apostasy
 and ruin. Hence, the importance of this theme.
   Indeed, while discussing the passages and themes of these
 epistles, we need to keep in mind that they are all related to
 Jesus. Whenever we discuss them, we also discuss who Jesus is,
 what He has done for us, and what He promises to do for us.
   Thus, the three epistles of John speak to issues relevant for the
 church today. We would do well to listen to them, because we
 believe that ultimately it is God who is speaking to us through
 John’s words, the God who—though not revealing to us
 answers to such questions as “What’s at the earth’s core?”—has
 revealed to us truths about a greater and firmer foundation
 upon which we can rest: our Creator and Redeemer, Jesus
 Christ.

      Jesus and the
      Johannine Letters


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Skim over the three Epistles
      of John.

Memory Text: “And we have seen and testify that the Father
      has sent the Son as Savior of the world” (1 John 4:14, NKJV).

            alse teachers spreading error among the saints? Deviant views

      F     on the nature of Christ? Power struggles in the church?
            Theological errors spreading in the pews? Folk needing assur-
      ance of salvation? Others needing to know that faith must lead to obe-
      dience to the law?
        Sounds like our church today, right?
        These, however, were some of the issues that John dealt with almost
      two thousand years ago in his three short epistles in the New
      Testament.
        How true were Solomon’s words, “There is nothing new under the
      sun” (Eccles. 1:9, NKJV)!
        John, though, does not concentrate on the problems only. He points
      to God the Father and the Son; he portrays who They are and what
      They have done for us, and thus what we must do in response.

The Week at a Glance: Why do we believe that John
      wrote these epistles? To whom was he writing? What were his con-
      cerns? How does he address those concerns? What does John tell

     From Whom and to Whom—Author
     and Recipients
       The first epistle of John begins without formal introduction. For
     whatever reason, the author does not introduce himself. The second
     and third letters mention as the author a person called only “the elder.”
     They also inform us to whom they are addressed—an elect lady and
     also someone named Gaius. This information is not extensive and
     leaves open a number of questions; nevertheless, from the letters
     themselves, we can learn about the one who wrote them.

Common style and vocabulary seem to indicate that the author of
     1, 2, and 3 John is the same. What do these three letters tell us
     about him? As you read, focus on, among other things, some of the
     terms that he uses for those he addressed in the letters (1 John
     1:1–3; 2:1, 18; 4:4; 2 John 1, 12; 3 John 1, 13, 14).

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Obviously the author had been an eyewitness to Jesus. He also
     seemed to have had an intimate relationship with the church members
     to whom he wrote, because he called them “little children,” an expres-
     sion of endearment. He maintained a leadership position in the church
     and more than once said that he eventually hoped to visit those to
     whom he was writing. The close resemblance of phrases and themes
     to the Gospel of John, as well as the testimony of church fathers,
     reveal that he was the apostle John.
        All this brings up a very important point: How important that we
     seek to develop a kind, caring, loving relationship with those around
     us. It’s very clear from these letters that John loved and cared about
     these people and that He wanted to see them strong in the Lord. There
     can be little doubt that the love he expressed for them only strength-
     ened, greatly, the power of his words. What an important lesson for all
     who seek to be witnesses for Jesus and the truths He has given us as
     a church.

      It’s one thing to have a knowledge about the nature of God, the
      plan of salvation, the Second Coming, and the right Sabbath
      day. But what happens to our witness if our lives don’t reflect
      the love and character of the God who created these truths?
      Maybe you have propositional truth? That’s good, but how
      much love and concern for others come with your expression of
      that truth?

                                                                            7

     What—The Content of the Epistles
        In the first letter of John we find a number of important topics, even
     if the apostle does not seem to move forward in any kind of linear pro-
     gression. This observation has led some scholars to conclude that John
     presents his arguments in a cyclic way; that is, he revisits his topics
     but from different angles. Thus, the same things are being discussed
     but from various perspectives.

Read 2 John 1–13. Follow his line of thought:

      2 John 1–3_____________________________________________

      2 John 4______________________________________________

      2 John 5, 6____________________________________________

      2 John 7–11____________________________________________

      2 John 12, 13___________________________________________

        In 2 John the apostle expresses his thankfulness that the lady’s chil-
     dren walk in the truth. He also talks about love and obedience and then
     focuses on the false teachers that he already mentioned in his first let-
     ter. He employs again the term antichrist. In his conclusion John
     expresses the desire to visit his audience. He also transmits greetings.
        How does 3 John relate to the previous two letters, which deal with
     false teachers who are not mentioned in John’s last epistle? It is con-
     ceivable that all three letters deal with a similar situation but from dif-
     ferent perspectives. While 1 John and 2 John warn against false teach-
     ers, 3 John may show how in one particular instance church leadership
     tried to control the problem.

      In many parts of the world, the idea of doctrinal orthodoxy
      sounds so medieval; it reminds people of such things as the
      Inquisition, when folk were tortured and killed because they
      weren’t orthodox enough in their theology. Hence, many shy
      away from the idea of orthodoxy altogether, arguing instead that
      all you need is love, regardless of teaching. John, though, what-
      ever his strong emphasis on love, didn’t shy away from dealing
      with theological error. What should this tell us regarding how
      we should act in the face of theological error in our own church?

     Why—The Purpose of Writing These
     Letters
Repeatedly, John tells us why he wrote his first letter. What is he
     saying?

     1 John 1:4_______________________________________________

     1 John 2:12–14____________________________________________

     1 John 5:13 _____________________________________________

        All these statements are positive and reaffirming. However, the con-
     text shows that they must be understood within the context of serious
     problems in the churches to which 1 John was addressed. This letter
     makes strong statements about false teachers. They are called antichrists.
     The term is found four times in 1 John and once in 2 John. Otherwise, it
     is not used anywhere else in the Bible.
        These antichrists had erroneous ideas about Jesus Christ, ideas that
     also affected their Christian lifestyle. John, obviously, felt the need to
     deal with these teachings, and he did so in a powerful and uncompro-
     mising manner.
        Nevertheless, the author portrays a positive picture of true
     Christianity and focuses on its positive nature. In countering the theo-
     logical error and the ethical error of the false teachers, John argues in
     favor of the unity of Father and Son, acceptance of divine forgiveness,
     and a life governed by the principle of love.
        While he encourages church members and warns against inade-
     quate views of Christ and Christian behavior, he may even hope to win
     back some of those who have left the church.
        In 2 John and 3 John, the reasons he wrote the letters are not men-
     tioned, but those reasons are discernible. The purpose of 2 John is to
     warn church members against the erroneous teachings and ethics of
     the false teachers mentioned in 1 John.
        According to 3 John a power struggle was going on. Diotrephes was
     attempting to usurp all authority. Apparently by using the problem of
     heresy, he was trying to establish his own power base.

      Though not downplaying the seriousness of these false teachings,
      John deals with them by emphasizing the positive. There is an
      important principle here for us. How easy it is to get so caught up
      in fighting error that we focus on it instead of truth. What’s your
      own way of dealing with what you deem wrong: Do you focus on
      the error at the expense of truth? How can you start training
      yourself to deal with problems in a more positive manner?

                                                                             9

     Jesus in the Johannine Epistles
      Jesus is found throughout 1 John. He is at the center of this book.
     Who is He according to this epistle?

     1 John 1:1_______________________________________________

     1 John 1:2, 5:20__________________________________________

     1 John 1:3, 4:15__________________________________________

     1 John 2:1_______________________________________________

     1 John 2:8_______________________________________________

     1 John 2:22______________________________________________

     1 John 4:14______________________________________________

     1 John 5:20______________________________________________

        Although in 1 John God the Father is mentioned more frequently
     than Jesus, the problem of former and maybe active church members
     is with the Son. Church members and false teachers may have agreed
     largely on the nature of the Father. They disagreed, however, when it
     came to Jesus, as to His humanity and His divinity. The issue was
     whether or not Jesus “has come in the flesh” (1 John 4:2, NKJV) and
     “is the Christ” (1 John 2:22, NKJV).
        In the midst of all this, John clearly maintains that it is impossible
     to separate Father and Son. Even in our days some people, including
     some Christians, think they can have a relationship with God the
     Father without caring about Jesus. For them Jesus is just a wonderful
     human being. John, however, is clear: If you know about Jesus but do
     not accept Him as the Messiah and the Son of God, you cannot have
     a saving relationship with God the Father.

      First John contains 105 verses. Jesus is mentioned in about 45
      of them. What does that tell me about the place Jesus has in this
      letter? How central is Jesus in your own understanding of
      truth? That is, might you be too occupied with dates, charts, and
      doctrines as opposed to knowing Jesus and His forgiveness and
      grace for you? If so, how can you change? Why must you
      change? See John 17:3.

      Jesus’ Ministry in John’s Epistles
         The Johannine letters not only portray Jesus from different per-
      spectives, telling us that He is from the beginning (1 John 1:1), has
      come in the flesh (1 John 4:2), and remained righteous, pure, and
      without sin (1 John 2:1; 3:3, 5); they also emphasize His ministry and
      work.
         Who Jesus is and what He has done are deeply related. To deny His
      divinity or humanity also means to deny His ministry as Savior, as
      example, and as Lord. Salvation through Jesus depends on Jesus’
      divine-human nature. Without a proper understanding of Jesus’
      divine-human nature, you can end up with a different understanding
      of the plan of salvation and the problem of sin. Sin may be taken
      lightly or even denied (1 John 1:6–10), an attitude that will surely, one
      way or another, influence Christian behavior and ethics.

What does John tell us about Jesus’ ministry and work? That is, what
      promises are made to us because of what Jesus has done or is
      doing for us now?

      1 John 1:7_______________________________________________

      1 John 2:25______________________________________________

      1 John 2:28______________________________________________

      1 John 3:8_______________________________________________

      1 John 3:16______________________________________________

      1 John 5:18 _____________________________________________

      2 John 3 ________________________________________________

        What Jesus has done for us as our Savior and what He is doing for
      us as our Advocate require a response on our part. Forgiveness of sin,
      the assurance of salvation, the gift of the Holy Spirit, the hope of the
      Second Coming, and the promise that we will be like Him and see
      Him as He is cannot leave our hearts cold. We believe in Him, love
      Him, follow Him, obey Him, and abide in Him and in His teachings.

       Look at some of the promises listed above. Which ones mean the
       most to you, and why? Which ones, perhaps, are you not experi-
       encing in your life as you should? Why might that be, and what
       can you do in order to realize, even better, the richness of these
       promises?
                                                                           11

    Further Study: Read 1 John in one sitting to get an overview of
         this important epistle.

            “As the years went by and the number of believers grew, John
         labored with increasing fidelity and earnestness for his brethren. The
         times were full of peril for the church. Satanic delusions existed
         everywhere. . . . Some who professed Christ claimed that His love
         released them from obedience to the law of God. On the other hand,
         many taught that it was necessary to observe the Jewish customs and
         ceremonies; that a mere observance of the law, without faith in the
         blood of Christ, was sufficient for salvation. Some held that Christ
1        was a good man, but denied His divinity. Some who pretended to be
         true to the cause of God were deceivers, and in practice they denied
         Christ and His gospel. Living themselves in transgression, they were
         bringing heresies into the church. Thus many were being led into the
         mazes of skepticism and delusion.
            “John was filled with sadness as he saw these poisonous errors
2        creeping into the church. He saw the dangers to which the church was
         exposed, and he met the emergency with promptness and decision.
         The epistles of John breathe the spirit of love. It seems as if he wrote
         with a pen dipped in love. But when he came in contact with those
         who were breaking the law of God, yet claiming that they were living
         without sin, he did not hesitate to warn them of their fearful decep-
         tion.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 553, 554.

3   Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Read the Ellen G. White quote listed above. Suppose she were
          writing for the church today. What might she write? That is, what
          are the theological challenges that the church is facing today? In
          what ways are they similar to the ones John was dealing with?
          What can we learn from John that could help us as we deal with
          these errors?

          ●
          2 As Adventists, we believe we have been given a great deal of
          truth, truth that many other churches do not have. (After all, if
          they had these truths, then what purpose would we as Adventists
          serve?) At the same time, how could we, as a church, better
          reflect the love and kindness that must go along with our wit-
          ness? How can you, either as a class or as an individual, help your
          local church better manifest the love of God? It’s frightening to
          think of how many people who, attracted to our message, have
          never accepted it because of the lack of kindness, grace, and love
          expressed by the church. We can and must do better.

A God to Love: Part 1
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Tolga lives in Turkey. From his youth he sensed that God was so much
more than the rules that religious leaders had imposed or the cruel and
punishing god mothers used to threaten their children. He yearned to find
God, to really know Him. But he knew no one who could teach him.
   Tolga worked in the tourist industry, where he could use his language
ability to talk with visitors to his country. He hoped that one of them
would tell him more about the God of the universe.
    One day a German man stayed in Tolga’s hotel. Tolga noticed that he
was different from other tourists. He was gentle and humble and made no
demands on people. What makes him so different? Tolga wondered. He
talked with the man who seemed genuinely interested in Tolga. The two
became friends. When Tolga asked about his religion, the man told him he
was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian.
   Tolga had never heard of Adventists, but he wanted to learn. The hotel
guest told him that Adventists accept Jesus as their Savior and Lord; that
they follow the Ten Commandments, including keeping the Sabbath as
God’s holy day; and that they look forward to Jesus’ second coming. Tolga
had heard of Jesus, but not the Sabbath. He asked the man to explain.
   This hotel guest spent the rest of his vacation introducing Tolga to Jesus.
When the man left Turkey, he gave Tolga a Turkish Bible. Tolga promised
to read it. The two men corresponded several times over the next several
months. Then the German man told Tolga of a friend who lived in the same
city. He gave Tolga his friend’s phone number, and Tolga promised to call
him.
   The German man’s friend, Berk, was humble, just like Tolga’s friend!
Berk told Tolga that he was an Adventist pastor. So that’s why he is like his
friend! Tolga thought. This must be what most Adventist people are like.
Pastor Berk offered to teach Tolga the Bible.
   When Tolga left his job over problems with his boss, Pastor Berk asked
him if he would like to translate some German Bible lessons into Turkish.
Tolga accepted the offer, which gave him work and taught him more about
the Bible. Pastor Berk invited Tolga to join fellow believers on Sabbath.
Tolga went when he could.
   For two years Tolga attended worship and studied with the pastor. His
desire to be like these Christians—humble, strong, honest—grew. One day
he told the pastor that he had accepted Jesus as his Savior and wanted to
be baptized. But what would his family say?

      Experiencing the Word of
      Life


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Deut. 4:1–4; 1 Cor. 15:4–8;
      1 John 1:1–5; Rev. 19:13.

Memory Text: “We proclaim to you what we have seen and
      heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fel-
      lowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ” (1 John
      1:3, NIV).

          n court a man stands charged with murder. He swears, vociferously,

      I   that he is innocent, that he didn’t do it, and that he wasn’t even at
          the scene when the crime occurred. He sounds very convincing too.
      From his words alone, one could be tempted to believe him.
         Then, however, witnesses appear. One after another, the eyewitnesses
      say the same thing: They saw the accused at the scene of the crime,
      and they saw him (and even in some cases heard him) commit the
      crime. Though individual details differ, depending on where they were
      at the time of the incident, their eyewitness accounts are overwhelming,
      and the man’s guilt becomes obvious.
         In a similar way John introduces his first letter by claiming that he
      belongs to the circle of eyewitnesses who, having seen and personally
      experienced Jesus, are able to share this life-transforming information
      with others.

The Week at a Glance: Why is Jesus the “Word of life”?
      What does John hope to accomplish by writing this introduction?
      How can we, even today, be eyewitnesses to Jesus? What role does
      community have in the life of a Christian?

      The Introduction to John’s First
      Letter (1 John 1:1–4)
Read 1 John 1:1–4. What is John saying to us with those words?
      What hope can you take from them for yourself? Also, why do you
      believe him?

      _________________________________
      _________________________________
      _________________________________
        John begins by pointing out that he, together with others, is an eye-
      witness of “the Word of life.” Verse 2 further explains this “life,” and
      together with the first part of verse 3, stresses its proclamation.

What two things does John say will come as a result of his declaration
      about “the Word of life”?

        _____________________________________________________

        _____________________________________________________

        In verses 1 and 3, John makes seven statements before he finishes
      the sentence: (1) What was from the beginning, (2) what we have
      heard, (3) what we have seen, (4) what we have looked at, (5) what we
      have touched, (6) what we have seen, and (7) what we have heard.
      Then he ends: “We proclaim to you . . . , so that you also may have
      fellowship” (vs. 3, NIV). In verse 2, which is an insertion and clarifi-
      cation, a fourfold enumeration ends with the phrase “and we proclaim
      to you the eternal life” (NIV).
        The point in all this seems to be that John wants us to know, for our-
      selves, the reality of God that he himself had experienced through
      Jesus. He wants us to know, for ourselves, the eternal life, the fellow-
      ship, and the joy that we can have through Jesus, the same Jesus he
      himself had heard, seen, and touched.

       What is your own understanding, and experience, of what it
       means to have “joy” in the Lord? Have you ever known any
       Christian who is always joyous? How do we understand the
       promises of joy when so often, even as Christians, our lives are
       filled with pain and suffering?


                                                                           15

     First John 1 and John 1
       Those who know the Gospel of John are intrigued when they begin
     reading the first letter of John and find an introduction similar to the
     introduction of John’s Gospel.

Read 1 John 1:1–5 and compare it to John 1:1–5. What are some
     things that they have in common?

     _______________________________________________________

        Both passages begin almost identically. Both point back to a time in
     the past, using “the beginning,” an apparent reference to Genesis 1:1,
     the Creation. Both distinguish between God the Father and the Word,
     and both place them next to each other in close connection. Both sec-
     tions also use the image of “life” and “light.” No question, there’s
     much in common between the two sections.
        But there are also differences, as well.

What emphases do we find in John 1:1–5 that are not seen in 1 John
     1:1–5?

     _______________________________________________________

        John’s Gospel strongly stresses Jesus as God and Jesus as Creator.
     Although the full title “his Son, Jesus Christ” (NIV) in 1 John 1:3
     points to both Jesus’ humanity and His divinity, the term God is not
     directly applied to Jesus in the introduction to 1 John as it is in the
     introduction to John’s Gospel. The Gospel of John is also very clear
     regarding Jesus in His role as Creator. Nothing that was made—that
     is, nothing created—was created apart from Him. It’s hard to see how
     John could have been more clear, not only about Christ’s divinity but
     His creatorship, as well.
        Also, 1 John emphasizes the role of eyewitnesses and their procla-
     mation (and, hence, their authority), an emphasis not found in John’s
     Gospel, which speaks from a more detached and less “personal” per-
     spective.
        Taken together, both sections reveal truths about Jesus that are cen-
     tral to the plan of salvation.

      Think about all you know about the life of Jesus. What were the
      things He did, said, and suffered? Also, ask yourself, Why did
      He do these things? As you do so, dwell on the fact that this Man
      was also God, the Creator. What hope and encouragement do
      these truths offer you? How can they help you cope with the
      stresses and strains of life?

     The Word of Life (1 John 1:1, 2)
What do you think the phrase “Word of life” means? Why is that such
     an accurate term for Jesus?

     _______________________________________________________

        First John 1:1 mentions the “Word of life.” The term word is also
     found in John 1:1–3 and refers specifically to Jesus. In Revelation 19
     the rider on the white horse is called “The Word of God” (Rev. 19:13)
     and refers to Jesus too. Because in the Johannine literature the term
     word may in certain contexts designate Jesus, in 1 John 1:1 it most
     likely stands for Jesus, as well.
        The same is true for the term life. Jesus called Himself “the way, the
     truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Thus the life in 1 John 1:2 surely refers
     to Christ, as well. No wonder, then, He is the “Word of life.”

What other evidence from those verses shows that John was referring
     to Jesus when He used the phrase “Word of life”?


       Though some people have argued that the phrase “Word of life”
     means the proclamation of the gospel, the evidence points instead to
     Jesus Himself. Although it is possible to hear the gospel of Jesus with
     one’s ears, it is more difficult to see it with the eyes. Meanwhile, it is
     impossible to touch with one’s hands “the Word of life,” if that phrase
     were referring to the gospel proclamation. To hear, see, and touch a
     person makes more sense than to hear, see, and touch the gospel.
     Furthermore, the phrase “the . . . life . . . was with the Father and has
     appeared to us” (1 John 1:2, NIV) also suggests that John had a per-
     son in mind when he mentioned the Word and the life.

      If we accept that Jesus is the “Word of life,” what does that
      mean for us? Look at each part of the phrase, “Word of life”.
      How do the following texts help us better understand what this
      phrase means in and of itself, and more important, what it
      means to us personally? Gen. 1:14, Dan. 5:23, Matt. 8:8, John
      1:1–4, Acts 17:28.

     Eyewitnesses
        Many people like to go to a soccer game, a concert, a political meet-
     ing, whatever. They want to see for themselves what is going on and
     want to experience the event for themselves. Afterward they are able
     to share what they have seen and heard. Others are involuntary eye-
     witnesses, for instance, of an accident or a crime, and may be called
     to witness in court.
        The apostles were eyewitnesses of Christ’s life, death, and resurrec-
     tion. This “Christ event” influenced them to such an extent that they
     could not refrain from communicating it to others.
        This is what we have with John. In 1 John 1:1–4, John claims to
     have been an eyewitness to Jesus. He buttresses his claims by saying
     that he not only saw Jesus but touched Him and heard Him, as well.
     John repeats those claims in the verses, trying to emphasize the real-
     ity of his personal experience with Jesus.

John isn’t the only biblical writer to make some powerful claims
     about eyewitness events. What do the following verses have in com-
     mon with 1 John 1:1–3? Who is speaking, and what was the back-
     ground for their claims?

       Today we cannot be direct eyewitnesses, at least not to the events of
     Jesus’ life or to the historical events of biblical history. But that doesn’t
     mean we still can’t be eyewitnesses to the reality of Christ and what
     He has done for us. In some ways, especially in a postmodern world,
     our own personal story, our own personal “eyewitness” account, can
     be a more powerful witness to the reality and goodness of God than
     can the historical events depicted in the Bible.

      Fellowship of the Saints
        Someone has stated that God has no grandchildren, only children. A
      Christian experience is not a hereditary experience. We need to make a
      decision, in our own hearts, to give ourselves to Jesus. Someone else can
      no more do that for us than someone else can sneeze for us. We have to
      make the choice ourselves, and it has to be a complete surrender to Him.
      In this sense, being a Christian is a very personal and solitary experience.
        At the same time, in those first few verses John adds another dimen-
      sion to what it means to be a Christian. John invites us to accept his
      testimony about Jesus and thereby experience fellowship with Jesus
      and other Christians. In other words, the proclamation of Jesus is com-
      munity building. To accept Jesus as Savior and Lord, as Giver of eter-
      nal life, means to be added to the family of believers.

According to 1 John 1:3, what are the dimensions of this fellowship?

        Jesus Himself has established His community or church (Matt.
      16:18), and He cares for it the way a shepherd would care for a flock
      (John 10:14–16). Jesus and His church belong together. The procla-
      mation of Jesus and the gospel bring people into fellowship not only
      with the Father and the Son but also with other believers. There is not
      only an unseen heavenly connection but also a very real visible con-
      nection among these believers. Christians are blessed by the fact that
      they do not have to master their lives alone and in isolation from oth-
      ers, but have become part of Christ’s community and family on earth.

How is this Christian fellowship in its ideal form portrayed in the New
      Testament? See Acts 2:42–47, Rom. 12:3–17.

        Our passage in 1 John ends with verse 4. John’s goal is not only that
      people enjoy fellowship with God and with believers but also that they
      have their joy completed.
        Verse 4 is, perhaps, looking back at the preceding verses. Our joy is
      complete because Jesus, “that eternal life,” has appeared. The verse
      also may look forward to the rest of John’s first epistle, in which Jesus
      and salvation through Him, as well as a life with God (which is a life
      of love), are unfolded. It finally may envision the future appearance of
      our Lord. Thus, 1 John 1:1–4 could encompass the time from the pre-
      existent Christ to the final consummation at Christ’s second coming.

       What has been your own experience regarding Christian fel-
       lowship? What can you do differently? How can you better
       enjoy, and help others enjoy, the community of fellowship that’s
       our privilege as Christians to have?

                                                                              19

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Peace, Be Still,” p. 340, in
         The Desire of Ages.

           “John, who has personally known Christ, desires to share his knowl-
         edge with his readers in order that they may enjoy the same fellowship
         he is already enjoying with the Father and the Son. In the course of
         expressing this loving desire, he asserts the divinity, the eternity, and
         the incarnation—and consequent humanity—of the Son. This won-
         drous knowledge he conveys in simple but emphatic language so that
         readers, in his own day and in ours, may have no doubt concerning the
1
         foundation of the Christian faith and the nature and work of Jesus
         Christ.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 629.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 As a class, go over together your own “eyewitness” accounts of

2
          Jesus. What did they have in common? In what ways did they dif-
          fer? What can you learn from the experience of others that can
          help you better know the Lord? At the same time, what have you
          witnessed that, in sharing, could benefit others?

          ●
          2 What is it about eyewitness testimonies that can be so power-
          ful? At the same time, why should we not believe every eyewitness
          account? After all, people do lie, or they simply don’t see things
3
          accurately. Have you ever thought you saw something, only to
          realize later that you were wrong? If so, share your experience
          with the class. At the same time, what is it about the eyewitness
          accounts depicted in the Bible that give them so much credibil-
          ity? Do we believe that they’re true because they are in the Bible?
          Or are they in the Bible because they are true? Or is it both?

          ●3 Go over this whole question of fellowship. Why is fellowship so
          important to all believers? What happens to those who tend to
          strike out on their own, apart from any body of Christ? At the
          same time, what potential dangers arise from being too depend-
          ent on others or on the church? How do we strike the right bal-
          ance?

          ●4 What can you do to help your local church be more receptive
          to the needs of its members, thus helping it fulfill some of the
          ideals of fellowship, as seen in aspects of the early church? In
          what areas can your church do better?

A God to Love: Part 2
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Tolga yearned to know God, but he couldn’t find anyone in his home-
land who could teach him. When a Christian tourist introduced him to
Jesus, Tolga realized that Jesus was the true God, whom he could love and
serve.
   Tolga’s family pressured him to marry, but he didn’t know any Christian
girls. His family arranged for him to marry Esin. Tolga and Esin had little
chance to get acquainted before their marriage, but Tolga prayed that God
would lead. He felt he dare not tell her that he was a Christian.
   One day church members planned a trip to the mountains. Tolga’s wife
had just given birth, and he was afraid she wouldn’t want to go. But she
agreed to go. They boarded the bus and sat down. She found a paper and
began reading it. “What book is this from?” she asked him, showing him
the paper. He read the paper and began to sweat. “It’s—it’s from a holy
book,” he stammered, “the Bible.”
   She continued reading. “This is good,” she said. “I want to read more.
Where can I get a Bible?”
   Tolga was astounded. Before he could answer, the church leader said, “I
can give you a Bible.”
   Tolga realized that God was saying it was time to tell his wife that he
was a Christian.
   He had prayed for a way to tell her, and now God had opened the door
with a piece of paper!
   The next day was Sabbath, Esin’s first Sabbath. He prayed that God
would open her heart to receive the truth. In Sabbath School he watched
Esin as she listened carefully to the leader’s remarks and even asked ques-
tions. The sermon seemed prepared just for her. The speaker spoke about
common points between her religion and Christianity. He even read from
her holy book about Christ’s second coming.
   Esin reads the Bible whenever she has time, and she shares what she’s
learning with customers in her shop. “She puts me to shame!” Tolga says.
“I didn’t dare share my faith with my wife, but she shares Jesus with
everyone! Recently she asked for two Bibles to give to friends!”
   Esin attends church when she can and is progressing on her journey to
Jesus. Tolga is learning from her to be brave in sharing the gospel.
   The church in Turkey has fewer than 100 members. Part of a recent
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering went to help the church in Turkey reach out
to the millions who don’t know Christ. Thank you for your part in sharing
the gospel in this great land.

      Walking in the Light:
      Turning Away From Sin




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: John 3:19, 8:12, Rom.
      3:10–20, 1 Tim. 1:15, 1 John 1:5–2:2.

Memory Text: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righ-
      teous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteous-
      ness” (1 John 1:9, NASB).

         n 1982 an unusual work of modern art went on display. It was a

      I  shotgun affixed to a chair. The artwork could be viewed by sitting
         in the chair and looking directly into the gun barrel. The problem
      was that the gun was loaded and set on a timer to fire at an undeter-
      mined moment within the next hundred years. Amazingly enough,
      people waited in lines to sit and stare into the shell’s path, although
      they knew that the gun could go off at any moment.
        Talk about tempting fate!
        Unfortunately, people do the same thing with sin, thinking that they
      can stare it in the face and still get away unharmed. Unlike the gun,
      however, sin—unless dealt with—definitely will kill them.
        This week John looks at the problem of sin and its solution in Jesus
      Christ.

The Week at a Glance: What does the Bible mean when
      it calls God “light”? What kind of errors regarding the reality of
      sin did John seek to deal with in these early verses? What prom-
      ises does John present to us as the remedy for the sin in our lives?
      Why do we need those promises?

      The Light (1 John 1:5)
Read 1 John 1:5. What does John mean that “God is light”? After all,
      light is merely a physical phenomenon, a form of energy made up
      of photons. What point is John making? See Pss. 27:1, 36:9, Matt.
      4:16, John 3:19, 8:12, 12:46, 1 Tim. 6:16.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Light is used in reference to both Jesus and the Father. Light is
      God’s glory, and it points to Him as the One who brings salvation. The
      image also emphasizes the concept of truth and revelation. And, espe-
      cially in our immediate context, it stresses His moral qualities of righ-
      teousness, holiness, and perfection (see also 1 John 2:9).

Why is John not content to say that God is “light” but adds that “in
      him there is no darkness at all”?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         By adding this phrase, the apostle underlines in strongest possible
      terms God’s perfection and His separation from sin. He is not compa-
      rable to the Greek or Roman gods, in whom one supposedly would
      find virtues and vices combined. God is pure holiness, pure goodness,
      pure righteousness. He is, in a sense, as opposite to sin as darkness is
      to light.
         John’s mention of darkness, meanwhile, introduces a new element,
      one that sets the stage for what follows. As fallen beings, steeped in
      sin, humans belong by nature to the sphere of darkness rather than to
      the realm of light. If God is light and we are in darkness, the contrast
      between us and God, especially in terms of holiness and righteous-
      ness, couldn’t be greater.

       Think about darkness. What kind of emotions, images, and
       thoughts does it evoke in you? Write down what you come up
       with about darkness, about what it represents, and about how it
       makes you feel. Why is it such an appropriate image for sin and
       unholiness? Bring your responses to class.
                                                                           23

      The Sin Problem                  (1 John 1:6, 8, 10)

        First John 1:6–10 forms a unit. After his principal statement about
      God’s character, John deals with some beliefs apparently circulating
      among the believers. It is these beliefs that he criticizes.
        All five verses begin more or less in the same way, namely, with the
      phrase “If we.” However, we notice a marked difference among them.

What are some of the claims that John, in verses 6, 8, and 10, is deal-
      ing with? What false statements are being made, and what do they
      have in common?

      _____________________________________________________

      _____________________________________________________

        The first statement discusses fellowship with God. People claim to
      have fellowship with God, but in reality they walk in darkness, which
      means that they really aren’t walking with God.
        In contrast (vs. 7), walking in the light results in true fellowship.
      Those who do that are cleansed from their sins. Therefore, to walk in
      darkness has to do with living in sin. Living in sin and claiming to
      have fellowship with God is, according to John, a lie.
        The next two claims, in verses 8 and 10, also are linked with sin.
      Though John speaks against the practice of sin, he’s very clear about
      the reality of it in our lives. In verse 8 he seems to be dealing with the
      belief that humans are not sinful, a teaching that goes against the most
      basic Christian doctrine.

Why is John’s declaration in verse 10 so important? What are the
      implications of the idea that “we have not sinned”?

      _____________________________________________________

      _____________________________________________________

        Notice the progression in these verses. In verse 6, the folk are lying.
      In verse 8, they deceive themselves. In verse 10, they make God a liar.
      Obviously, John understands the reality and seriousness of the sin
      problem for humanity.

       How open and honest are you with yourself regarding the real-
       ity of sin in your own life? Do you tend to ignore it, justify it, or
       berate yourself over it? What should be your attitude toward
       your own struggles with sin, and what can you do in order to
       cultivate the right attitude? What is the right attitude?

     Responses to the Sin Problem                              (1 John 1:7,
     9; 2:2)

       It’s clear that in these verses John is dealing with the seriousness of
     sin. How does he understand sin? In 1 John 3:4 he equates sin with
     lawlessness. According to 1 John 5:17, sin is wrongdoing or unrigh-
     teousness. It is a departure from the will of God as revealed to us in
     Scripture. Sin also is opposed to truth. It alienates from God the per-
     son who commits sin, and this alienation leads to spiritual death. Sin,
     in the singular, may point to the separation of the sinner from God; in
     the plural, sins, it may point to sinful acts. However we view it, one
     thing is certain: Sin is real, and unless dealt with, it will destroy us.

First John 1:7 and 9 contain divine promises regarding the solution
     to the sin problem. What are those promises, and how can we
     make them real in our own lives? How can we experience for our-
     selves what God is promising us here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Forgiveness of sins has become possible because of Christ’s death
     on the cross, the shedding of His blood as the sacrifice. Because we
     have transgressed the law and therefore deserve death, He died in our
     place and has set us free from the eternal condemnation that our trans-
     gression otherwise will bring us. More so, His blood purifies us from
     every sin.
        However, from our side, confession of sins is necessary. The term to
     confess in 1 John 1:9 also can mean “to admit,” “to acknowledge.” The
     text does not mention to whom sins have to be confessed. God is cer-
     tainly implied, because in the next part of the verse we hear that if sins
     are confessed, God is faithful and just and will forgive our sins. It may
     be that confession of sins includes also public confession before those
     who were hurt through our sins; even so, the forgiveness of sin comes
     only from God.
        First John 1:9 also has the force of a command. We should lay our
     sins before God, and He will forgive us and purify us. Sinning makes
     us guilty; we need forgiveness. Sin makes us unclean; we need purifi-
     cation. Through Jesus, God has made a way for us to have both.

      What areas of your life might you need to change in order to
      better avail yourself of these wonderful promises? What holds
      you back from choosing to surrender all your sinful ways to
      God?

                                                                           25

      The Christians’ Goal                    (1 John 2:1)

In 1 John 2:1 John calls us not to sin. How should we understand this
      admonition?

      _______________________________________________________

         The context of the call here not to sin comes in the context of walk-
      ing in the light, which was introduced with the statement that God is
      light. If we want to live in fellowship with Him and His children, we
      must walk in the light, and to walk in the light means to renounce sin
      (1 John 2:1).
         John addresses the believers in a caring and intimate way, calling
      them “little children” and telling them one reason for writing his let-
      ter: They must renounce sin completely. By doing this, he is not sug-
      gesting that a completely sinless existence is possible, but he is plead-
      ing that Christians stay away from any definite act of sin.

Why does John balance his admonition not to sin with the phrase
      “and if anyone sins” (NKJV)? See also 1 Kings 8:46, Rom. 3:10–20,
      1 Tim. 1:15.

      _______________________________________________________

        The discussion of sin here could have been misunderstood in the
      sense that someone might think that sin does not matter: “Do not
      claim to be without sin; you are a sinner anyway. Therefore, just live
      your life and do not worry about sin.”
        John therefore has to balance his statements about sin, and he does
      this with 1 John 2:1. The goal of a disciple of Christ is not to sin.
      Christians must admit that they are sinners, yet, they must seek to live
      without sin.
        At the same time, John doesn’t want to give the idea that we can be
      perfectly sinless. Therefore, along with his admonition against sin-
      ning, he says: “If anyone sins, we have an Advocate . . .” (NKJV). This
      is a clear acknowledgment of the reality of sin in the lives of
      Christians. Even consecrated and sincere Christians may commit sins.
      Unfortunately, sinning is always a real possibility for church mem-
      bers. Therefore they need help. They need someone to help them resist
      temptation, but they also need someone who intervenes for them after
      they have sinned.

       How can we learn to live with the tension of being sinners, and
       yet being admonished—very strongly in the Bible—not to sin?

The Christians’ Comfort                         (1 John 2:1, 2)

   First John 2:1, 2 contain wonderful statements that comfort repen-
tant sinners and fill them with hope and courage. In spite of sin and
guilt and horrible consequences that often arise from our sins, there is
a solution. John has already mentioned forgiveness, or purification of
sins. Now he comes back to this topic again, saying that this forgive-
ness has become possible through Jesus.
   How? First, He is our Advocate, and He intervenes in our behalf.
This Advocate is identified as the Messiah (“Christ”), and it is said
that He is righteous. Righteousness was attributed to God the Father
in 1 John 1:9. It is attributed to the Son in 1 John 2:1, and it’s because
of His righteous character that He can intercede for us.
   Second, our forgiveness is secured because, through His sacrificial
death, Jesus brought about propitiation, or atonement; this means that
He paid the penalty for our sins. The debt that we owed, which we
could never pay, Jesus paid for us.
   John therefore portrays Jesus as Sacrifice and Intercessor. In the
context of the New Testament witness, this implies that Jesus lived a
sinless life among us, died on the cross, rose from the dead, and
ascended to heaven, where He intercedes in our behalf.
   The term paraklētos, translated “advocate” in 1 John 2, has been
translated differently; for example, “comforter,” “helper,” “advocate,”
“mediator,” or “intercessor” (see John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7; 1 John
2:1). It is a person who is called to the side of someone else and who
stands up for someone else. A paraklētos can be a person who helps a
friend. In the Gospel of John the Holy Spirit is the helper. In the first
Epistle of John, Jesus is the helper and intercessor (1 John 2:1).
   When we talk about Jesus as our Advocate and take great comfort
in the fact that He is instrumental in providing forgiveness for our
sins, we must be careful not to give the impression that the Father is
mean and harsh and must be persuaded by a go-between to forgive us.
Such a picture of God is unwarranted. He is the One who sent Jesus
in our behalf (John 3:16). Also, a few verses earlier we were told that
He is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us (1 John 1:9). Jesus
does not have to pacify the Father. On the contrary, the Father is the
One who has revealed, through Jesus, His desire for our salvation.

 Based on what we have just read, how do you understand the
 wonderful promises given us in 1 John 2:1, 2? What do they
 mean in terms of our daily walk with the Lord? How can you
 make those promises more real in your own life? What changes
 should those promises bring to our experience?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Confession,” pp. 37–41, in
         Steps to Christ.

            “ ‘If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
         sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.’ The conditions of
         obtaining mercy from God are simple and reasonable. The Lord does
         not require us to do some grievous thing in order to gain forgiveness.
         We need not make long and wearisome pilgrimages, or perform
         painful penances, to commend our souls to the God of heaven or to
         expiate our transgression. He that ‘confesseth and forsaketh’ his sin
1        ‘shall have mercy.’ Proverbs 28:13. In the courts above, Christ is
         pleading for His church—pleading for those for whom He has paid
         the redemption price of His blood. Centuries, ages, can never lessen
         the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice. Neither life nor death, height nor
         depth, can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus;
         not because we hold Him so firmly, but because He holds us so fast.
2        If our salvation depended on our own efforts, we could not be saved;
         but it depends on the One who is behind all the promises.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 552, 553.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In class, read what you wrote about the thoughts and emotions
          and images that the idea of “darkness” brought to you. How does
          that help you better understand not only what it means to be
3         unrighteous and in sin but also what it means to walk in the light
          of God?

          ●2 How could you help those who are so burdened with their sins
          and guilt that they are ready to give up on God completely? What
          promises and encouragement can you offer them? What exam-
          ples from the Bible can you find of God forgiving some very
          heinous sin?

          ●
          3 Some people believe that we have to be utterly free of all sin
          before we can be saved. How do you deal with this belief without,
          at the same time, giving the impression that sin doesn’t matter?

          ●
          4 Someone killed most of a family of people who were not
          Christians and who never professed faith in Jesus. Years later, on
          his deathbed, the murderer confessed his deeds and accepted
          Christ as His Savior. How would you respond to this comment by
          a surviving member of the family: “So, according to you
          Christians, my whole family is destined for final punishment,
          while the person who murdered them now has the promise of
          heaven? Is that what your religion teaches?”

A Better Tomorrow
by E. KIKOMEKO
   Eric is 20 years old and a student at Bugema Secondary School in
Uganda. His father left the family several years ago, and his mother tries
to support her four children by selling vegetables and snacks she makes.
But it’s difficult. She managed to build a four-room mud-brick building
that she rents to provide a small monthly allowance for her children.
   Eric is the eldest, and the man of the house. His siblings are 15, 13, and
12. The four live in a single room, and Eric supports them by working dur-
ing his school breaks. He cuts grass with a machete, fetches water for peo-
ple, and does whatever he can to earn a little money. The other children
keep the house clean, wash clothes, and cook their daily porridge of beans
and cornmeal. Sometimes—when they can afford them—they eat a few
potatoes.
   Eric has been caring for his siblings since he was 17. He studies hard,
and his grades are OK. Classes begin at 5:00 A.M., and except for dinner,
he stays at school to study until lights out at 10:00 P.M. Life is difficult at
best, and almost impossible at other times. The school helps him finan-
cially by letting him continue his studies, even if he owes on his bill. The
headmaster gives him work whenever he can, and sometimes he gets a lit-
tle financial help. During holidays he makes bricks.
   In spite of his almost impossible schedule and responsibilities, Eric
insists that his brothers and sister do their best. He encourages them to
keep moving forward and assures them that life in the future will be eas-
ier than it is now. He dreams of becoming an engineer, but he knows that
it will take many years to finish his education.
   Eric isn’t the only student on campus who’s struggling; many others
must work to pay their school fees too.
   “I have faith that God will see us through,” he says. “We cannot see the
end from the beginning, but we know God sees our needs and cares for us.
I try to tell my siblings that it’s up to them to make the right decisions and
to work hard. If they choose the wrong path, it will affect their entire lives.
   “As I care for my brothers and sister, I’m learning what it’s like to be a
father, to teach them and to care for them and to discipline them. That will
help me in the future.”
   Eric is grateful for the Adventist school that has opened its doors to him
and his siblings. “Without this school, what would we have?” he asks. He
looks around him, at textbooks and papers. “Nothing. Thank God for a
Christian school in which to study.” And thank you for making Adventist
education possible through your mission offerings.

 Walking in the Light: Keeping
 His Commandments




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Lev. 19:18; Luke 14:26;
      John 3:20; 13; 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Pet. 3:18; 1 John 2:3–11.

Memory Text: “Now by this we know that we know Him, if we
      keep His commandments” (1 John 2:3, NKJV).

               pastor had been counseling a husband and wife. The problem?

      A        The husband had been having extramarital affairs. That’s not
               an extramarital affair but, in fact, many of them. The husband
      tried to calm the situation by telling the wife that although he had been
      with other women, it didn’t mean that he didn’t love her. In fact, he
      said, he loved her more than any of the others.
         As could be expected, his words—far from solving the problem—
      only made it worse. Why? Because if you love someone, you show it
      by your actions, by your deeds, not just by what you say.
         This week, John talks about what it means to know and to love God.
      Anyone can say that he or she loves the Lord. The question is,
      According to the Bible, how are we to reveal that love?

The Week at a Glance: What does it mean to know God,
      as opposed to just knowing about Him? What role does obedience
      to God’s law have in our relationship with God? What does John
      say about Jesus as a role model for behavior? What is the “new
      commandment” that John gives and how “new” is it really?

      What Do We Know?                        (1 John 2:3–5)

         The phrase “by this we know” (NKJV) appears twice in the above
      passages. Just what is it, according to John, that Christians know?
         First, that they have come to know God (vs. 3) and, second, that they
      “are in Him” (vs. 5, NKJV). Considering what’s at stake—our eternal
      life or our eternal destruction (see John 5:29)—these are important
      things to know, are they not?
         At the same time, we have to be careful that we don’t turn knowl-
      edge itself into the means of salvation. In fact, that’s the exact kind of
      heresy John was dealing with here and in other places, the idea that
      knowledge alone brings redemption.
         Knowledge (gnosis) was a crucial term in ancient religion, and it
      was an important concept in the religious world of the first centuries
      after Christ. Probably by the second century it had developed into a full-
      fledged heresy among Christians called Gnosticism. In Gnosticism,
      there was little concern for moral behavior. The emphasis was on mys-
      tical experience and fancy myths about God and the nature of human-
      ity. Salvation was gained through this secret knowledge rather than
      through a faith relationship with the Lord.

What do the following texts tell us about how the New Testament uses
      the idea of knowledge? Matt. 13:11; Luke 1:34, 77; John 17:3; Rom.
      3:20; 1 Cor. 8:1; 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Pet. 3:18; 1 John 4:8.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        In the New Testament to know/knowledge has a theoretical and theo-
      logical meaning. However, it also describes relationships. To know
      God means to have an intimate relationship with Him. Obedience,
      love, and staying away from sin all point to the existence of such a
      relationship. The theoretical and the experiential side of knowledge
      must go together.
        Although the verb to know is used frequently by John, he stays away
      from the noun knowledge. He may have decided to avoid the more
      technical term so that confusion with Gnosticism could be avoided.

       Do you know the Lord, or do you just know about Him? What’s
       the crucial difference between these two concepts? Most impor-
       tant, if it’s only the latter, how can you change, and why is it
       important to do so?




                                                                            31

     Keeping the Commandments                                (1 John 2:3–5)

       Anyone can say that they know God. In fact, a lot of people have
     done that, even people in John’s day. Many do today, as well. Talk,
     though, is cheap.

For John, what was the outward evidence, the outward proof, that a
     person knows God? What else does John say about this topic?
     John 14:15, 21; John 15:10; 1 John 3:22, 24; 5:3; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.
     How do these verses tie in with each other? How do they affirm us,
     as Adventists, in our position about the law?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Keeping the commandments is very important to John and to Jesus.
     The phrase occurs quite often in John’s writings. Keeping the com-
     mandments is a sign that we know God/Jesus and love Him. Love and
     obedience are connected here. The term Him can refer to either God
     the Father or Jesus and is somewhat ambiguous—probably on purpose
     too. First John 2:4 states the same truth in negative terms and may
     refer to a false claim made by those who say that you can come to
     know God and yet neglect keeping the commandments. John attacks
     this idea in very strong language, calling anyone who teaches it a liar.

Why would keeping the law reveal our knowledge of God? How does
     our act of keeping the law reveal the reality of our knowledge of
     God? How is one related to the other?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The kind of knowledge of God that the Bible talks about isn’t
     merely a cognizance of facts. It’s a knowledge that forms the basis of
     a love relationship. You can’t truly love someone you don’t know. And
     if you love someone, you are going to act a certain way. A man who
     truly loves his wife isn’t going to cheat on her. He can profess his love
     day and night, and yet if his actions don’t reveal that love, then he is,
     to use John’s term, “a liar.”

      What other analogies can you think of that are helpful in under-
      standing why our obedience, our deeds, form an inseparable
      part of what it means to know God?

     What Would Jesus Do?                        (1 John 2:6–8)


       Awhile back there was a fad during which young Christian people
     would wear bracelets with the English letters WWJD inscribed on
     them, standing for “What would Jesus do?” Though some derided the
     whole idea as childish, at least the idea behind it was good, and the
     idea was that when confronted with a situation, we should think about
     what Jesus would do and try to do likewise.
       This fits in nicely with what John has been saying here. The first
     part of our passage has stressed that walking in the light and knowing
     God means to be obedient. The second part now calls Christians who
     want to abide in Him and walk in the light to follow Christ’s example
     in living their lives. How can they do this? They have to find out how
     Jesus lived, and on a daily basis they must compare their conduct to
     His.
       In other words, “What would Jesus do?”

Skim through the Gospels. What are some of your favorite stories of
     Jesus; that is, what stories really speak to your heart about the
     kind of person Jesus was? How similar are you to Him in these
     areas?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Although the death of Jesus and His resurrection are the climax of
     the Gospels, sufficient information on Jesus’ teachings and His life
     are recorded so that we can understand how a human being, ideally,
     should live.
       This is important to remember, because sometimes people want to
     focus only on Jesus as Savior, Jesus as their Substitute, and not on
     Jesus as their Lord and Example. John accepted Jesus both as Savior
     and as an example. In 1 John 1:7 he had mentioned the cleansing
     blood of Christ, which points to His death on the cross in our place.
     According to 1 John 2:2, Jesus is the atoning sacrifice for our sins. He
     was our substitute. But in our verses this week the other aspect shows
     up. Jesus lived an exemplary life. We should follow His footsteps.

      Most of us, no matter who we are, are facing some sort of diffi-
      culties in life. Think about your greatest challenge, your great-
      est struggle. Then ask yourself the question, “What would Jesus
      do?” After you have what you deem your best answer, ask your-
      self, “What’s stopping me from doing the same?”


                                                                         33

      The New Commandment                             (1 John 2:7, 8)

        After stressing the importance of obeying the commandments
      (1 John 2:3, 4), John in verses 7 and 8 introduces the idea of a “new
      commandment.” What is this “new commandment”? The answer is
      found in John 13:34, where the same expression, “new command-
      ment,” appears.

Read John 13. What is the context that helps us understand what this
      “new commandment” is?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         After having shown His disciples what it means to serve, namely,
      even to step down and perform the lowly task of washing someone’s
      feet, Jesus issued His “new commandment.” His disciples should love
      each other just as Jesus loved them.
         A similar situation occurs in 1 John 2:6–8. After having talked
      about walking as Jesus did, John pointed to Jesus’ commandment in
      John 13. It is this literary connection with John 13:34, 35 that helps us
      unlock the meaning of 1 John 2:7, 8. The commandment John is talk-
      ing about is the commandment about brotherly and sisterly love.
         But why does he state that he is writing not a new commandment
      but an old one? That’s because the commandment of neighborly love
      was already present in the Old Testament (Lev. 19:18). When John
      wrote his letter, Jesus’ “new commandment” of John 13:34 had
      already been a commandment for many years.
         Yet in a sense, this commandment was new in that it was continu-
      ously realized in the life of Jesus (“in Him” [1 John 2:6, NKJV]) and
      was to be seen in His followers (“and in you” [vs. 8, NKJV]) in an
      unprecedented way because of the new age inaugurated with Jesus’
      first advent (“the darkness is passing away, and the true light is
      already shining” [vs. 8, NKJV]).
         Finally, the concept of God’s law connects the first part of our pas-
      sage (1 John 2:3–6) with the second (1 John 2:7, 8). The command-
      ments are summarized in the commandment to love each other. To
      walk in the Light and to walk as Jesus did means to keep the com-
      mandments and love each other.

       When was the last time you “washed someone’s feet,” figura-
       tively speaking? If it has been a long time, what does that tell
       you about yourself and about how you relate to others? Why is
       the kind of death to self that leads to the service of others so
       hard to realize in our own lives?

     Loving Others               (1 John 2:9–11)

Summarize what John is saying to us in the above verses.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Love was mentioned briefly in 1 John 2:5. Obviously that love
     refers to our love toward God, which is manifested when we keep His
     commandments. Love was indirectly dealt with in the second part of
     our passage, the new commandment (vss. 6–9). Love toward fellow
     Christians is, however, clearly spelled out in the last section of our
     paragraph (vss. 9–11). It also begins with the phrase “he who says”
     (see vss. 4, 6, 9, NKJV).
       Verse 9 makes a statement about the church member who hates his
     brother. This person is in darkness. Verse 10 shows the positive side,
     namely, a person who loves his brother. Verse 11 returns to hating
     one’s brother. Not only is such a person in darkness, but his or her eyes
     have been blinded.
       In his letter John is interested primarily in the Christian community.
     That does not mean he would deny the fact that Christians are called
     to love their neighbors and even their enemies, but this is not his con-
     cern here. He has other problems at hand.

Hating one’s brother is a strong statement, and we may not like
     applying it to us and our behavior. We may prefer to say that we
     are irritated or offended, but Scripture oftentimes uses the term
     hate in ways that we don’t commonly use today. How is the term
     hate used, and how is it to be understood in the following texts?
     Matt. 6:24; 24:9, 10; Luke 14:26; John 3:20.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       In Scripture hate stands not only for what we may call hate today
     but also for preferring one person over another or neglecting some-
     body. In other words, you don’t have to despise someone to reveal
     “hate” as it’s sometimes understood in the Bible.

      Is there someone you hate, and maybe with good reason, too? If
      so, ask yourself the question, What would Jesus do?




                                                                          35
                        F RIDAY July 24

    Further Study: Read Genesis 39:7–12, Daniel 3:8–18, Revelation
         13:16, 14:5.

            Walking in the light, which includes keeping the commandments,
         living like Jesus, and exercising love, is especially important at the end
         of the world’s history. God’s law is being challenged, and the issue of
         true worship and obedience to the Creator will come even more to the
         front. In Scripture, examples are mentioned, people who remained
         faithful even under the most challenging circumstances: Joseph,
         Daniel’s friends, Daniel, and many others. The prime example is Jesus.
         We must make the decision to follow His lead, no matter what.
1           “John tells us that true love for God will be revealed in obedience
         to all His commandments. It is not enough to believe the theory of
         truth, to make a profession of faith in Christ, to believe that Jesus is
         no impostor, and that the religion of the Bible is no cunningly devised
         fable. . . . John did not teach that salvation was to be earned by obe-
         dience; but that obedience was the fruit of faith and love.”—Ellen G.
2        White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 563.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 It’s one thing to keep the Ten Commandments; it’s another
          thing to love other people. What’s the difference? Which is easier
          to do, and why?

          ●
          2 French philosopher Michael Foucault once differentiated
3
          between two kinds of knowledge: the kind that changed the one
          who acquired that knowledge and the kind of knowledge that
          brought no change at all. What could be some examples of these
          two types of knowledge? More important, what kind of knowl-
          edge is the knowledge of God, and what kind of changes should
          it bring to the ones knowing it?

          ●
          3 How can we avoid falling into the trap of trying to earn our
          salvation by keeping the commandments, while at the same time
          avoiding the trap of believing that we can be saved in disobedi-
          ence to the law?

          ●4 What can you, as a class, do to help your local church as a
          whole better understand what it means to manifest love? Is there
          even such a thing as corporate love? Picture what the ideal and
          perfectly loving local church would be like. How well does your
          local church match up?

Instant Answer to Prayer
by SAMUEL LABAG
   When we pray we know that sometimes God answers Yes, sometimes
No, and sometimes Wait. Recently God’s answer to my urgent prayer was
an instant Yes!
   I work in Zamboanga, on the western edge of Mindanao, Philippines.
One day I took a boat to a nearby island to deliver health magazines to stu-
dents at a parochial high school. I visit schools, talk about the dangers of
drugs, how to stop smoking, and other health-related topics; then I take
orders for magazines that talk about these topics.
   My visit to the school completed, I rushed to catch the last boat of the
day. I hailed a tricycle taxi for the 10-minute ride to the dock, praying that
the boat would not leave without me. But we arrived at the pier only to
watch the boat sail away. The porters were sympathetic, but they suggested
I find a place to stay overnight.
   I can’t stay overnight, I thought. I promised some money to another col-
porteur who must leave tonight for a distant island. He can’t go without
the money, and his next boat doesn’t leave for a week. How will I get the
money to him? And where will I stay tonight? As I stood on the pier and
prayed fervently for a solution to my problems, I felt a calm assurance.
   I opened my eyes to see the boat veer from its course. It made a huge U-
turn and returned to the pier. The crew threw a rope down and called to me
to grab onto the old tire tied to the end. I clutched the rope in one hand and
my case in the other while the sailors pulled me onto the boat. Safely
aboard, I realized that God had turned the boat around—for me. The
engine roared, and we started out into the open sea just as another tricycle
taxi loaded with passengers arrived at the pier. The occupants jumped out
shouting and waving for the boat to stop. But the boat kept going.
   As we sped toward the mainland, I thanked God for helping me keep my
promise to my friend and for allowing me to be a part of His army, bring-
ing truth to searching hearts.
   I told my friend what had happened, and we rejoiced together in God’s
providence. Then I saw him off for his trip to the distant island to take
God’s word to another needy part of His kingdom.
   Your mission offerings help support the literature work, bringing God’s
message of love to every corner of the world. Thank you for giving so that
others can find Jesus.

Walking in the Light:
Renouncing Worldliness




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Dan. 5:13; John 15:19;
      Col. 1:14; 2:8, 13; 2 Pet. 3:10–12; 1 John 2:12–17.

Memory Text: “Do not love the world or anything in the world. If
      anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 John
      2:15, NIV).

          n 1933, French author Andre Malraux published Man’s Fate, a

      I   story about an ill-fated Marxist uprising in Shanghai, China, in the
          1920s. In the story, a Marxist terrorist, Ch’en, is walking down the
      street when his first teacher, a Christian minister, approaches him and
      starts a conversation about Ch’en’s loss of faith. Little does the teacher
      know that Ch’en, at the moment, is carrying a bomb and is on his way
      to a political assassination! Ch’en replies that he hasn’t lost his faith;
      he has simply put it in politics, that’s all.
         “What political faith,” his former teacher asks with sadness, “will
      destroy death?”
         In other words, no matter your political ideas, no matter the utopia
      you hope to create, it will never defeat humanity’s great scourge: death.
         While continuing to show us what it means to “walk in the light,”
      this week’s texts point us to the temporality of our world in contrast to
      the eternal life found only in God.

The Week at a Glance: On what basis can we know that
      our sins are forgiven? What does it mean to know God? What does
      it mean not to love the things of the world? What’s the ultimate
      fate of the world?

      “For His Name’s Sake”
        “I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
      you for his name’s sake” (1 John 2:12).

        In 1 John 2:12–15, John addresses “little children” and “fathers”
      and “young men.” Though various suggestions have been made about
      what he meant by this division, we suggest that the “children” refers
      to all church members, because John uses the expression children in
      this sense in his epistle (1 John 2:1, 12, 28; 3:7; 4:4; 5:21). The
      “fathers” would represent older church members, and the “young
      men” younger members. In short, he’s writing to everyone.

In 1 John 2:12, he tells them all that their sins are forgiven. On what
      basis is that forgiveness found? Why is it so important for
      Christians to know that their sins are forgiven? See also Acts 5:31,
      Rom. 4:7, Eph. 4:32, Col. 1:14, 2:13.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        John wants his hearers, that is, faithful church members, to have
      absolute assurance of their salvation. He is referring back to his dis-
      cussion of the topic of sin as found in 1 John 1:9 and 2:1, 2, stressing
      that to be a Christian means to have this forgiveness. Christians do not
      deny their sinfulness but have accepted salvation through Jesus Christ
      and, therefore, live with the assurance of being forgiven.
        The crucial point is for Christians to understand that the basis of
      their salvation is found only in Jesus and in what Jesus has done for
      them. That’s why John says they have been forgiven—not on the basis
      of their good deeds, not on the basis of their beliefs, and not even on
      the basis of their knowledge of God, but rather for “his name’s sake,”
      that is, on the basis of Jesus and what He has done for them. Thus, in
      the midst of all John’s talk about overcoming, about obedience, he
      keeps the emphasis before them that salvation comes only because of
      Jesus.

       How important is it to you to know that you have forgiveness of
       sins? Where would you be today if you were to doubt that for-
       giveness? Also, why must you always remember that the basis of
       forgiveness is found in Jesus, not in yourself?

     Overcoming the Wicked One
Read 1 John 2:13, 14. What do these verses say to us? What positive
     message is coming from them, and how can we apply them to our
     lives?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The children are reminded that they know the Father, while the
     fathers are reminded that they know Him who is from the beginning.
     Obviously this person is Jesus. “In the beginning” is attributed to Jesus
     in 1 John 1:1. It seems to make more sense when, in our verses here,
     the Father and He who is from the beginning (Jesus) are two different
     persons.
       When the young men are addressed a second time, the phrase “you
     have overcome the evil one”(NIV) is repeated, but the statement is
     expanded. The young men have overcome not just the evil but Satan
     himself, because they belong to Christ and claim His victory. The origi-
     nal language indicates that the overcoming has been achieved in the
     past but the consequences are an ongoing reality. The young men are
     also spiritually strong, and the “word of God” dwells in them.
       The Word of God points to its author, the Holy Spirit (Eph. 6:17,
     2 Pet. 1:21). Therefore, some expositors have suggested that in these
     verses an implicit reference to the Trinity is found: God the Father,
     Jesus as the One who is from the beginning, and the Holy Spirit rep-
     resented through the Word of God. In the end, true believers have
     come to know God and continue to know Him; that is, they have an
     intimate relationship with Him.
       Thus, in these verses we’re given the essence of the Christian life:
     forgiveness of sins, knowing the Godhead, victory over sin, and the
     Word of God living in us.
       Because believers know that God and His Word live in them, they are
     ready for the challenge issued in verses 15 through 17. While verses 12
     through 14 contain affirmative statements, verse 15 begins with an
     imperative, a call or command: “Do not love the world” (NKJV).

      Write a paragraph in which you answer the question, What does
      it mean to know God? What does your answer tell you about
      yourself and your relationship to God? Work on your answer
      through the week and be prepared (if you are willing) to share
      it in class on Sabbath.

     Renouncing Any Love of the World (1 John
     2:15)

Christians are admonished not to love the world. How does
     Scripture define the term world? John 12:19, 15:19, Acts 17:24,
     Rom. 1:20, Col. 2:8, 1 Tim. 6:7, James 4:4, Rev. 11:15.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The term kosmos (translated “world”) designates the universe, the
     earth, humankind, the realm of existence, and the way of life opposed
     to God. The term occurs more than twenty times in 1 John and 2 John.
     The world needs salvation (1 John 4:14), yet it is hostile to God and
     His people (1 John 3:13). It lies in the power of the evil one (1 John
     5:19), and false prophets, antichrists, and deceivers are in the world
     (1 John 4:1, 3; 2 John 7). It is not wrong to possess the world’s goods,
     but they should be shared with the needy (1 John 3:17). Finally, the
     world needs to be overcome (1 John 5:4, 5). In the Johannine epistles
     the term world is predominantly a negative term, because the world is
     in rebellion against God.
        An interesting tension arises in Scripture regarding our relationship
     to the world. On the one hand, we are told not to love the world, but
     then on the other hand, the Bible is clear that God loves the world
     (John 3:16). Meanwhile we are told not to love the things in the world,
     yet we are admonished, again and again in Scripture, to love people,
     and people are certainly in the world.

How do you understand the tension here? How are we to love people
     and yet not love the world, when the world is, primarily, people?
     Are there some things in the world, other than people, that we can
     love too? If so, what?


       The end of verse 15, and the next verse, help us to understand what
     John has in mind. He does not say we should hate humans or despise
     planet Earth; rather, we should hate the things of the world that, if cher-
     ished by us, will keep us from knowing and experiencing for ourselves
     the love of God. That is, we need to stay away from the things of the
     world that will keep us from having a saving relationship with God.

      Be painfully honest with yourself. What are some of the things of
      the world that you love and you know are wrong? Or are there
      things in the world that, of themselves, aren’t bad but that you
      love more than God? What will it take to make you give them up?
                                                                            41

      Problems With the World
        “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
      the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
      world” (1 John 2:16).

        While verse 15 is quite a broad warning against loving the world,
      verse 16 now spells out some details. What does it mean to love the
      world? John mentions three things: (1) the lust of the flesh, (2) the lust
      of the eyes, and (3) the boastful pride of life. John says that these three
      things are not of the Father but of the world; yet, our flesh, our eyes,
      and our life all come from God. What, then, is the problem? What is
      John warning us against?
        Lust of the flesh, obviously, deals with passions, though it does not
      have to be limited to that alone (see Gal. 5:19–21).
        Lust of the eyes, though certainly linked to the flesh, takes it deeper,
      takes it to our thoughts, our desires, to the things that we see and want
      for ourselves (see Exod. 20:17).

What does John mean about “the pride of life”? What is this, and why
      is it so bad? See Job 12:10, Acts 17:28.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        The idea of “the pride of life” implies independence from God. It’s
      as if we created our lives, and hence the glory and honor of any of our
      accomplishments should belong to us. “Know ye that the Lord he is
      God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves” (Ps. 100:3). In
      contrast, when we realize that every breath, every heartbeat, everything
      that we could ever have or be comes only from God, upon whom we’re
      utterly dependent, pride will be the last thing in our hearts. As sinful,
      fallen beings whose very existence depends totally on the grace and
      beneficence of our God, as beings utterly incapable of saving ourselves
      from eternal death and destruction, we should be humble and meek
      regarding our lives, not full of pride about them. It was pride that
      brought the fall of Lucifer in a perfect world; as beings in an imperfect
      one, we should flee it like the plague.

       Which is it for you? Lust of the flesh? Lust of the eyes? The
       pride of life? Or any combination thereof? What’s your only
       hope? What are you waiting for to make the changes that must
       come?

      The Transient Nature of the World (1 John
      2:17)

        In verse 16 the apostle presents the first reason that we should not
      love the world: the love of the world and the love of the Father are
      incompatible. In verse 17 John adds a second reason: It does not make
      sense to love the world, because the world is impermanent. It is better
      and wiser to choose that which lasts. By doing so, we ourselves also
      will last—that is, we will live forever.
        Humanity is tempted to live by the moment, to be captivated by the
      material world, and to treasure only what can be seen. Therefore, Paul
      joins John by saying, “Keep seeking the things above, where Christ is,
      seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things above, not
      on the things that are on earth. For you have died and your life is hid-
      den with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then
      you also will be revealed with Him in glory” (Col. 3:1–4, NASB), and,
      “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For
      what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18,
      NIV).

What does the Bible teach in other places about the transitory nature
      of the world and planet Earth? Dan. 2:35, 1 Cor. 7:31, 2 Pet.
      3:10–12.


         In 1 John 2:8, John had already stated that the darkness was passing
      away. Now he uses the same verb and says that the world is passing
      away, including its lust. A new era has come with the incarnation of
      Jesus, the Light. The things of this world are passing away; that should
      be obvious to everyone. Political solutions never can be the ultimate
      solution, not in a world that’s passing away and we along with it.
         If the world is passing away, how can we survive? John answers: by
      doing the will of God. Although correct theology is important and
      John tries to refute the false teachers with their misguided under-
      standing of Jesus and sin, it also is important to live a life of obedi-
      ence. Ethics cannot be separated from theology. Pious words and cor-
      rect doctrines are not enough. Our theology must be lived.
         Let us not get so comfortable here that we forget our eternal goal;
      let us not compromise our love for God by being attracted to those
      things and attitudes that are hostile to Him.

       What examples of the transient nature of things on earth do you
       see every day? What do they say to you? Why—when it’s so
       obvious that things here don’t last—do we find it so easy to live
       our lives as if they do?

                                                                           43

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Worldliness in the Church,”
         pp. 196, 197, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2.

            “Professed Christians yearly expend an immense sum upon useless
         and pernicious indulgences, while souls are perishing for the word of
         life. God is robbed in tithes and offerings, while they consume upon the
         altar of destroying lust more than they give to relieve the poor or for the
1
         support of the gospel. . . . The world is given up to self-indulgence. ‘The
         lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life’ control
         the masses of the people. But Christ’s followers have a holier calling.
         . . . In the light of God’s word we are justified in declaring that sanc-
         tification cannot be genuine which does not work this utter renuncia-
         tion of the sinful pursuits and gratifications of the world.”—Ellen G.
2
         White, The Great Controversy, p. 475.
            Positively speaking, our passage tells us that genuine Christians
         have an intimate relationship with the Godhead, manifest loving obe-
         dience, have received strength to conquer evil, and have God’s Word
         dwelling in them. Their sins have been forgiven. Negatively, they do
         not love the world but reject it where it is hostile to God and His cause.

    Discussion Questions:
3         ●
          1 Our world is purely transitory. It won’t last forever; even sci-
          ence—with all its weaknesses—tells us that. What hope, however,
          does the Bible offer us that science doesn’t?

          ●2 Some people, heeding the call against loving the world, isolate
          themselves from the world as much as they can, moving into
          monasteries or communities that are radically separate from the
          norm. Is this a good idea? Bad idea? Might it be good in some
          cases? Discuss.

          ●3 In class, discuss your answer to Monday’s question about what
          it means to know God.

          ●
          4 What are some things in the world that, in and of themselves,
          might not be bad, might not work against the knowledge of God,
          yet are often made that way because of how people use them?

          ●
          5 Why is victory over sin such an important part of what it
          means to “walk in the light”? How can you have this victory?

Trouble in the Village: Part 1
by JUAN IGNACIO
   “How much are those people paying to use your meeting hall,” the
angry man asked. “I’ll pay twice that amount to have you kick them out of
town! They’re a bad influence, and there’s going to be trouble if they stay!”
   I own a meeting hall in a small village in central Mexico. When some
Adventist people asked to rent my hall, I agreed, though I hadn’t been to
any of their meetings. I never expected my friend’s angry response to the
Adventists’ presence in our village.
   My family, like most in the village, considered ourselves Christians. I
held an important position in the village church. But religion was more a
tradition than a guiding faith. We didn’t read the Bible or pray at home—
unless we had an emergency.
   And when an emergency hit, my wife and I began reading the Bible
together and praying for God’s guidance. As we studied the Bible, we
found the Ten Commandments and read them with amazement. Here,
plainly written, was God’s command not to bow down to idols, and another
to keep the Sabbath, Sabado in Spanish. I asked our priest about these
commandments, and he said simply, “You know what is right; do it.”
Perhaps he meant we must follow our church’s tradition, but I understood
he meant we should follow the Bible.
   We decided to find a church that taught according to the Bible, but we
didn’t know which church that was. So we prayed that God would send
someone to us. That’s when the Adventists asked to rent my hall to hold
Bible studies and evangelistic meetings.
   And when my friend came with such strong accusations, I decided to
attend the meeting and see if these people spoke the truth. If they did, they
could stay; but if they spoke lies, I’d ask them to leave. At the meeting we
saw people reading the Bible and talking about what they read. And what
they said made sense. We continued attending the meetings. There I
learned that these people keep Sabbath, as the Bible commands.
   Then a police officer summoned me to appear in court to explain why I
was allowing these meetings in my hall. I went to court and explained that
I had found nothing in what they were teaching that went against the Bible,
that even the Sabbath they teach is in the Bible. Satisfied, the judge
allowed me to go. But that was just the beginning of the trouble in our vil-
lage over these Adventists.

                                                                (Continued next week)

      Walking in the Light:
      Rejecting Antichrists




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Lesson: John 15:4–10; Acts
      2:15–17; 2 Thess. 2:3, 4; Heb. 1:1, 2; 1 John 2:18–29; 4:1–6.

Memory Text: “Whoever denies the Son does not have the
      Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also”
      (1 John 2:23, NKJV).

             rom the earliest day, the church had to deal with false teachings

      F      and heresy. Paul had warned the leaders of the church in
             Ephesus against “savage wolves” who would attack “the flock”
      and against false teachers from among themselves who would draw
      away church members (Acts 20:29, 30, NKJV). Jesus, too, had warned
      of false christs and false prophets (Matt. 24:5, 11, 24). Today, the
      church faces the same thing.
         In Revelation 13 the sea beast is depicted as an imitation of Jesus.
      Therefore, commentators have called this beast the antichrist (anti in
      Greek meaning “in place of ”). Interestingly enough, John in his first
      letter also talks about the antichrist(s). Who are these people? What do
      they teach?
         This week we look at what John was dealing with and seek to draw
      lessons from it for ourselves today.

The Week at a Glance: What is the “last hour” (1 John
      2:18, NIV)? What threat is John warning his readers about? Is
      there a difference between the antichrist and antichrists? What
      does John mean about our abiding in Christ? How are Christians
      to test the spirit?

      “The Last Hour”                  (1 John 2:18, NIV)

        “Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that
      the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come.
      This is how we know it is the last hour” (1 John 2:18, NIV).

        At the end of 1 John 2, John starts to speak in somewhat greater
      detail about the group or groups that had been causing problems to his
      church members. In their activity he recognizes that “the last hour”
      has come.

John talks about “the last hour” around the end of the first century
      A.D. How are we, almost two thousand years later, to understand
      what he means? “The last days” in Acts 2:15–17 (NIV); Heb. 1:1, 2;
      1 Pet. 1:20; 1 John 2:18.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         The expression “the last hour” occurs only here. In contrast, in the
      New Testament other writers have used the phrase “the last days” to
      refer to the time since Jesus’ first coming.
         With Jesus a new era had arrived. The entire period between Christ’s
      first and second comings is considered “the last days.” Given the con-
      text of his writing, John’s “last hour” may simply be his way of mean-
      ing the same thing as “the last days,” the period between the first and
      second comings of Jesus.
         Jesus Himself had used the expression hour in John 4:23 and 16:2
      (in some versions it’s translated “time”), and He’s pointing to a spe-
      cific period of time in the future but prior to His return. John seems
      to use the phrase “the last hour” in this same sense, as well.
         What’s important to notice, however, is that John does not set a date,
      nor does he describe a precise chronology of detailed events that must
      take place before the Lord would come. That’s not his point. His point,
      instead, has to do most likely with the need to be diligent and careful,
      because false teachers are out there, just as Jesus Himself had warned
      about.

       If John was impressed back then to warn about the perils of
       “the last hour,” what about us today? What kinds of teachings
       are we daily confronted with, both within and without the
       church, that if accepted would lead us astray? How can we pro-
       tect ourselves from these deceptions?



                                                                           47

      The Coming of Antichrists (1 John 2:18, 19, 22,
      23)

Who is antichrist? 1 John 2:18, 19, 22.

      _______________________________________________________

         The term antichrist is used in 1 and 2 John only. An antichrist tries
      to take the place of Christ and is opposed to Christ. Scholars of dif-
      ferent denominations have, for example, called the sea beast of
      Revelation 13 and the man of lawlessness of 2 Thessalonians 2
      “antichrist.” This is a correct designation, because the language used
      in Revelation 13:2–4 shows that this sea beast is an imitation and par-
      ody of Christ, the Lamb; in 2 Thessalonians 2:4 the antichrist, the man
      of lawlessness, seeks to take the place of the Lord. Although not using
      the very term, Scripture in various places talks about this concept, and
      obviously John is familiar with it. Indeed, in Revelation he himself
      uses this concept, if not the term itself.
         In 1 John 2:18 John employs antichrist in the singular, as well as in
      the plural: The antichrist is supposed to come; many antichrists have
      already appeared. Does John give up the idea of one specific antichrist
      by calling other people antichrists? Most likely not! First John 4:3 is
      helpful. The text talks about the spirit of the antichrist: These people
      reveal the spirit of the antichrist, but the real antichrist was still to come.

Why would John call those people antichrists who have some problems
      with the correct understanding of the nature of Christ? 1 John 4:3,
      2 John 7.

      _______________________________________________________

        John may not deem as “antichrists” those members of his church
      who were simply wrestling with a correct understanding of Jesus or
      who were momentarily wavering, buffeted by the false teachings.
      They had to make a decision between the teaching of Christianity and
      the view of the antichrists with regard to Jesus as the Messiah and/or
      the nature of Christ.
        However, there were people who had left the church and successfully
      proclaimed false doctrines (1 John 4:5). These were the antichrists.

       In a real sense, anything that takes the place of the true God in
       our lives can be an “antichrist.” What are some of the
       “antichrists” that we confront in our lives today? How can we
       recognize them and, more important, neutralize their power
       against us?

     Testing Spirits             (1 John 4:1–6)

       In 1 John 4:1–6, John picks up again on the theme that he was deal-
     ing with in 1 John 2:18–27, the erroneous teachings being promul-
     gated among them. How interesting that so soon among the church the
     enemy was working, seeking to divide the believers through the intro-
     duction of false teaching. Even today, do we as Adventists not strug-
     gle with the same thing, false teachings that divide us?

Read 1 John 2:19. What relevance does that have for us, today, as
     Adventists?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Though we don’t know all the details, John seems to be struggling
     with various heretical views about Jesus that many of these former mem-
     bers were promoting. One may have taught that Christ only seemingly
     had been a human being but actually was not. Another may have stressed
     that Christ entered the human being Jesus at baptism and left Him before
     crucifixion. Still others may have rejected Jesus as the Messiah.
       Maybe these false teachers claimed to be inspired, which is why he
     in 1 John 4:1 warned about false prophets. Their erroneous views
     proved, however, that they were influenced by the spirit of the
     antichrist.

Compare 1 John 2:18–27 with 1 John 4:1–6. Even amid the warn-
     ings about the antichrist and their false teachings, what positive
     assurances and hope does John give to his readers? What hope
     can we, for ourselves, take away from these passages, as well?

      Notice the parallel between 1 John 2:21 and 1 John 4:6. In both
      cases, a great defense against these errors is a knowledge of
      God, a knowledge of the truth. John is stressing the importance
      of having a correct understanding of the teaching, especially
      about Jesus. Here’s very clear biblical evidence for the impor-
      tance of correct doctrine.
                                                                         49

     The Anointing               (1 John 2:20, 21, 27)
The “anointing” of 1 John 2:20 has been understood by many as the
     Holy Spirit. How do the following texts help validate that conclu-
     sion? 1 Sam. 16:13; John 14:17; 15:26; 16:7; 1 John 2:20, 21, 27.
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________
        True believers have received the anointing, which remains in them,
     teaches them, and is without falsehood. What is said about the anoint-
     ing and its functions may remind readers of Jesus’ statements about
     the Holy Spirit in His farewell speeches (John 13–16). Already Isaiah
     61:1 links being anointed and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is very
     likely that the anointing stands for the Holy Spirit.
        However, there is also another dimension. To some extent 1 John
     2:24 is parallel to verse 27:
          “As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the
        beginning” (1 John 2:24, NASB, emphasis supplied).
         “As for you, the anointing which you received from Him
       abides in you” (vs. 27, NASB; emphasis supplied).
        What the true believers have heard from the beginning is the gospel
     of Jesus. Furthermore, the Word of God (1 John 2:14) and the truth
     (2 John 2) abide in the Christian. In 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22, the divine
     anointing is linked to the sealing by the Holy Spirit, while in Ephesians
     1:13 hearing the word of truth and believing leads to the sealing by the
     Holy Spirit. Therefore, the anointing may also point to Scripture.
        The antidote to the messages of the antichrists is God’s Word as
     communicated by the Holy Spirit. It is the objective standard by which
     doctrines can be evaluated. True believers rely on the Holy Spirit as
     He manifests Himself in Scripture. The Bible has to be the final
     authority on all our teachings. The moment believers start to doubt the
     authority of the Bible, its reliability, and its inspiration, they start
     opening themselves up to all sorts of delusions and errors. The world
     is filled with folk who, once staunch Christians, have abandoned their
     faith because—coming across things they didn’t understand or didn’t
     necessarily like—they started questioning the validity and inspiration
     of the Bible. It’s one thing to admit that there are things in the Bible
     we don’t understand, or that even seem questionable to us; it’s another
     to doubt the authority of the Scripture because of them.

      What’s your attitude toward things in the Word that you don’t
      understand or even necessarily like? Have you, over time, found
      yourself doubting more and more in the Word? Are you on that
      path, and if so, how can you get off it?

     Abiding in Him
What’s the one common theme found in these verses? Why is this
     message so important to us? John 5:38; 6:56; 8:31; 15:4–10; 1 John
     2:14, 28; 2 John 9.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The word rendered “to abide” has also been translated as “to remain,”
     “to live in,” “to dwell in.” It is an important concept in John’s Gospel
     and in his letters. It occurs more than 20 times in 1 John and twice in 2
     John.
       The concept stresses that it is important to remain in the Son, the
     Father, and the Holy Spirit. A right relationship with the Godhead is
     crucial. It also is important to remain in correct doctrine and in the
     Word, because that will affect our relationship with God. Indeed, that
     seems to be a crucial aspect of John’s letter, because he’s afraid of
     what these false teachers and their false views could do to the faith of
     the believer.

One of the promises made to those who remain in Him is the promise
     of eternal life. Why is the promise of eternal life so important to
     us? What would our faith offer us if we didn’t have that promise?
     Why bother even being a Christian at all? See 1 Cor. 15:1–19.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        No question, for John a crucial aspect of the Christian faith was
     abiding in the Lord. This is simply another way of stating that we need
     to “walk in the light,” we need to live in a close relationship with
     Jesus, which means a daily surrender of our wills to His, as revealed
     through the Word and through the working of the Holy Spirit in our
     lives. As soon as we start disobeying the Lord, as soon as we start
     thinking we can figure things out apart from God, as soon as we start
     passing negative judgments on whatever parts of the Bible we don’t
     like, we’re moving in a direction that, if not stopped, will separate us
     from a saving relationship with Jesus.

      How do you “abide” in Christ? What were the things you did in
      the past 24 hours that enabled you to “abide” in Him? Make a
      list of the things that we can do that are part of what it means “to
      abide” in Christ, and share your list with members on Sabbath.
                                                                          51

    Further Study: Read 2 Peter 2 and Ellen G. White, “Worldliness
         in the Church,” pp. 196, 197, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2.

            One could raise the question why 1 John 2:29 is important in this
         discussion about false teachers. Obviously with the false teaching
1
         about Jesus, a false lifestyle went along. This is oftentimes the case
         even today. Attacking one doctrine of Christianity leads to calling in
         question others, and sooner or later not only is a theoretical construct
         affected, but it plays itself out in practical terms. People no longer live
         righteous lives. A disastrous vicious cycle begins, a downward spiral
         that can be stopped only by returning to the Lord, His teachings, and
2
         His exemplary life.
            “The Spirit was not given—nor can it ever be bestowed—to super-
         sede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly state that the Word of God
         is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested.
         Says the apostle John, ‘Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
         whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
         the world.’ 1 John 4:1.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 9.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 How do we as Adventists, who have long been anticipating the
          return of Jesus, deal with the question of what it means to be liv-
          ing in “the last hour”? If “the last hour” has lasted almost two
          thousand years, what is it supposed to mean to us and how we live
          our lives today?

          ●
          2 What is the list that you made from Thursday’s lesson show-
          ing about the practical ways in which we can abide in Christ?
          What can you learn from each other?

          ●3 What are ways that we can manifest the spirit of antichrist
          toward others?

          ●4 What are some of the difficult things in the Bible that church
          members sometimes struggle with? How can we learn to trust the
          Bible despite these difficulties? How can we help those who are
          struggling with their faith because of things in the Bible they
          don’t understand or like?

          ●
          5 How should we, as a church, relate to those former members
          who now openly attack us? What should our attitudes be toward
          them?

Trouble in the Village: Part 2
by JUAN IGNACIO
   When people in my village complained about the bad things the
Adventists were saying at their meetings, I attended just to find out. I dis-
covered people studying God’s Word. My wife and I continued attending.
   After I was called into court to defend my decision to rent the hall to
these people, the Adventist pastor offered to leave town. “No,” I said.
“Stay. What you are teaching is the truth.”
   We began attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church and studying the
Bible with them. We realized that we’d found God’s truth and were deter-
mined to follow truth wherever it led.
   When the church decided to hold evangelistic meetings in our village, I
again rented them my hall. But the angry townspeople again tried to close
down the meetings.
   And when word spread that my wife and I and our children wanted to be
baptized, we received more threats. I challenged the troublemakers to show
me what Adventists taught that was wrong, but they couldn’t show me.
   On the Sabbath of the baptism, mobs of villagers carrying signs and
shouting slogans closed the roads leading into town so the Adventists
couldn’t enter. But the pastor had stayed overnight in the village and con-
ducted the baptism in a portable pool in the meeting hall.
   At another time the villagers became riled up, and I was forced to
defend the church. “You’re dividing our town!” they shouted. “Return to
our church, and let the village be at peace again.”
   I prayed for wisdom and spoke, “I used to smoke and drink and do many
bad things. But God cleansed me. How can I return to my old ways when
God has done so much for my family and me?”
   Some people carried cans of gasoline and threatened to set me on fire if
I refused to renounce my faith. For five hours they shouted and threatened
while we prayed that God would intervene. Finally the crowd dispersed.
   Eventually the government stepped in to settle the problem. Villagers
marched with signs saying “No more churches in our village!” The offi-
cials decided that the Adventists could worship in the village, but we
couldn’t hold public meetings. We don’t have a church, and we can’t hold
public meetings, but we can share our faith with family and friends. Today
60 people in our village worship God with us.
   Thank you for your mission offerings, which made possible the small
group evangelistic meetings that introduced my family to God’s truths.
Please keep giving and praying so that others may hear as well.
JUAN IGNACIO lives in a village south of Mexico City, Mexico.

      Living as Children of God




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:5; Ps. 51:4; Isa.
      1:2; John 1:12; Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 John 3:1–10.

Memory Text: “How great is the love the Father has lavished on
      us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we
      are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know
      him” (1 John 3:1, NIV).

              new convert came to see the preacher and said, “No matter

      A       how much I pray, no matter how hard I try, I simply cannot
              seem to be faithful to my Lord. I think I’m losing my salva-
      tion.” The preacher responded, “Do you see this dog here? He is my
      dog. He is house-trained; he never makes a mess; he is obedient; he is
      a pure delight to me. Out in the kitchen I have a son, a baby son. He
      makes a mess, he throws his food around, he fouls his clothes, he is a
      total mess. But who is going to inherit my legacy? Not my dog; my
      son is my heir. You are Jesus Christ’s heir because it is for you that He
      died.” We are children of God and heirs of His kingdom, not through
      our perfection but by His grace.
         This week we look more at what this promise entails.

The Week at a Glance: What does it mean to be a “son
      of God”? In what ways should we want to be “like God”? How
      does John define “sin”? What did Jesus do about sin at His first
      coming? How are we to understand John’s words that the one who
      is born of God “does not sin” (1 John 3:9, NKJV)?

     Sons of God             (1 John 3:1)

Read 1 John 3:1. What wonderful promise is found there? What does
     that promise entail? What hope should it give us? See also John
     1:12, 1 John 2:29, 3:9.

     _______________________________________________________

        First John 3:1 points to a spiritual birth; John 1:12 stresses the faith
     in Christ by which we become children of God. First John 3:1 stresses
     that believers are already God’s children. God has taken the initiative
     to do this for us. The new birth is His work, not ours. We can bring
     about neither our own birth nor our adoption as God’s children. Also,
     we do not need to worry about our status as children of God as long as
     we maintain our relationship with Him. This relationship is described
     as one between a father and a child; thus, it is very close. The ideal
     father takes care of us, loves us, and would give his life for us.
        Stop and dwell on the implications of the promise that we are the
     children of God. At last count there are more than four hundred bil-
     lion visible galaxies in the universe, each one containing billions of
     stars. Who knows how many planets are among those stars and how
     many are inhabited with intelligent life? Given the size of the universe
     in contrast to our planet, much less to each of us individually, how can
     we not be astonished that the God who created all this loves us and has
     made us His children? What a wonderful perspective this should give
     us on what our lives mean! What hope, what assurance, what confi-
     dence we should have for the future, regardless of whatever difficult
     circumstances we now face. God, the Creator of all that is, loves us,
     cares for us, and calls us His children. The New International Version
     translates 1 John 3:1 freely but catches its meaning well when it says
     that the Father lavished His great love on us.

      Dwell on the implications of the notion that not only does God
      exist but He loves us, cares for us, and even died for us. How
      should this reality impact how we live? Why should it impact it?




                                                                            57

      Results and Responsibilities (1 John 3:2, 3)
        First John 3:1 is an introduction to the thoughts developed in the
      remainder of the passage for this week. It deals with results of this
      Father/child relationship, including subsequent responsibilities. As a
      consequence of their relationship with God, believers live pure lives
      not under the dominion of sin (vss. 3–10). However, first it is stressed
      that we will see Him and will be like Him.
        Because we know about our present state as children of God, we
      also know that the future will be even more fantastic, even though we
      may not yet fully understand it. That we will see the Lord and be like
      Him should fill us with joy and confidence and not a little bit of awe
      and wonder.

What is the difference between Satan’s and Eve’s wish to be like God
      (Gen. 3:5, Isa. 14:14, Ezek. 28:2) and the promise of 1 John 3:2 that
      we will be like Him?

        Satan wanted to be like God in power and may have craved the ado-
      ration of all created beings. However, it seems that he was not inter-
      ested in being like God in character. His desire to be like God in power
      did not deepen his relationship with God but, to the contrary, has dis-
      rupted and ruined it.
        Although Christians will be like God, they do not desire to take
      God’s place. They want to be like Him in loving others, in selfless ser-
      vice, in exhibiting purity of thought and righteousness of action. They
      respect the basic difference between Creator and creature and do not
      want to do away with it. For them the issue is love, not power. As Jesus
      showed us, to be like God is to give of oneself totally and unselfishly
      for the good of others. Jesus came to show us what the Father is like.
      “Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast
      thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father;
      and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?” (John 14:9).

       Think of the incredible contrast between the character of Jesus
       and the character of Satan. A created being, Satan sought a
       position higher than he had but for a purely personal and self-
       ish motive, while Jesus—the Creator—chose to make Himself
       “of no reputation” (Phil. 2:7) for the good of others. What’s your
       natural tendency, to be more like Christ or more like Satan? If
       the latter, how can you change?

      A Definition of Sin                   (1 John 3:4)

         The false teachings that John confronted in these letters may have
      stressed the present blessing of salvation but may have ignored the
      importance of living pure lives. The false teachers may not have wor-
      ried about the problem of sin or its consequences. Therefore, John
      emphasizes that our future depends on how we live now. This has
      nothing to do with righteousness by works. We are saved by grace
      alone, but our lives must reflect that we are saved. So, John, after hav-
      ing called Christians to purify themselves, goes on to show what that
      means.

What do the following texts tell us about the nature of sin? Exod. 9:27;
      Pss. 36:3; 51:4; Isa. 1:2; Jer. 3:13; Matt. 7:23; Rom. 6:17, 20; 1 John
      1:8; 3:4; 5:17.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        In Scripture sin is described as missing the mark, falsehood, delib-
      erate violation of God’s standard of truth, revolt, wickedness, disobe-
      dience, transgression, trespass, lawlessness, and unrighteousness.
        In 1 John 3:4 sin is defined as “lawlessness” (NIV). Later in
      1 John 3:11–20, John relates the story of Cain, who murdered his
      brother, a clear example of “lawlessness.” Then in verses 22 and 24 of
      the same chapter, he refers to the commandments and the necessity to
      keep them.
        Besides the legal implications of the term, lawlessness reminds us
      of the “man of lawlessness” in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 (NIV), the
      antichrist par excellence, and the climax of his activity just prior to the
      Second Coming. This lawlessness is exhibited by the antichrists in
      1 John, who flagrantly rebel against God and align themselves with
      Satan. Church members are indirectly warned in 1 John 3:4 to
      renounce such an attitude and all sin. It’s one of the great ironies of
      the Christian world today that many of the same preachers who rail
      against sin continue to make the claim that God’s law has been abol-
      ished because we are now under grace. What a horrible distortion of
      what grace is all about!

       What’s your favorite sin? That is, what sin do you find yourself
       continually indulging in? What are the ways in which you jus-
       tify it in your mind? How much less sinful does it seem with
       each passing year? When are you going to wake up and realize
       that sooner or later, unless you claim God’s power to overcome
       it, it will destroy you?
                                                                             59

      The Appearance of Jesus (1 John 3:5, 8)
What do the following texts tell us about Jesus and what happened at
      His first coming? 1 John 1:2; 3:5, 8.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Jesus, at His first coming, appeared in human flesh. He came to
      solve the sin problem, and He came to destroy the works of the devil.
      If so, believers cannot have anything to do with sin or the originator
      of sin, the devil. By making common cause with sin, or by aligning
      ourselves with it, we are making common cause with Satan and are
      rejecting Jesus.

According to 1 John 3:5, Jesus takes away sins. This statement
      seems to be an allusion to John 1:29. How did Jesus accomplish
      this task? Heb. 9:26, 28; 1 John 2:2; 4:10; Rev. 1:5, 6.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        First John 3:5 does not directly tell us how Jesus took away sins.
      However, the context of 1 John and of the Gospel of John makes it
      clear that Jesus did this by dying on the cross. Whereas Hebrews
      clearly states that Jesus did away with sin by His self-sacrifice,
      Revelation teaches that Jesus freed us from our sins by His blood.
        While the first part of 1 John 3:5 may indirectly point to the Cross,
      the second part stresses the absolute sinlessness of Jesus, which was
      needed in order for His death on the cross to save us.
        The antichrists of 1 John may not have fully comprehended the true
      value of the Cross and the substitutionary death there in our stead.
      How foolish; for Christ’s death in our behalf, in which He suffered the
      penalty for all our sins, forms the foundation of the plan of salvation.
      Christ’s death was the only way possible for humans to be saved and
      have the promise of eternal life. To miss that is to miss the point of the
      entire gospel.

       In your own struggles with sin, guilt, fear, and lack of assurance,
       how does the Cross answer these challenges for you? How can you
       better avail yourself of the hope and promises we have through
       Jesus, not just for forgiveness but for power to overcome?

     No Sin!        (1 John 3:6, 9)

How can 1 John 3:6, 8, 9 be reconciled with 1 John 1:6–2:2?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        First John 3:6 and 9 contain strong and perplexing statements,
     asserting that no one who lives in Jesus and no one who is born by
     God sins. This sounds quite absolute. Christians have wrestled with
     these statements and have tried to find explanations. After all, what
     true Christians haven’t wrestled with the reality of sin in their lives?
        What we—in any case—can safely assume is that the apostle John
     does not contradict himself. In chapter 1 he says that people who
     claim to be without sin deceive themselves. In chapter 2 he points to
     our goal, which is not to sin, but he adds that if we do, then we have
     an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ. Our present passage must
     be understood in the light of the previous discussion on the topic of
     sin: Christians stay away from sin, but if they sin, they confess their
     wrongdoing and accept divine forgiveness.
        Expositors have come up with different attempts to solve these dif-
     ficult verses. Two are briefly mentioned:
        1. John portrays the ideal in 1 John 3:6, 8, 9—which he also men-
     tions in 1 John 2:1. The difference is that in 1 John 3 no qualifiers are
     added. A reason may be that John wants his hearers and readers to be
     clear about the issue of sin. Sin cannot be taken lightly. Followers of
     Christ cannot play with sin.
        2. The verbs to sin and to do (sin) are found in the present tense,
     which oftentimes points to continuous actions. The meaning would be
     that disciples of Christ cannot continuously sin. They may fall in sin
     here and there, but they have separated from sin and do not practice a
     life of sin. The are not dominated by sin. The New International
     Version follows this view by translating the verbs with “to continue to
     sin.”
        No matter which interpretation is accepted, chapter 3 must be
     understood in the light of chapters 1 and 2. Though sin is real,
     Christians have no choice but to put it away from their lives, no mat-
     ter the cost.

      OK, you’re a sinner. No one is going to debate that. The question
      is, How much blood, sweat, and tears do you expend in the bat-
      tle against sin in your life? In what ways does your answer help
      explain your lifestyle?



                                                                          61
                      F RIDAY August 14

    Further Study: Read Rom. 8:12–17, Phil. 2:14–16.

           “Let none deceive themselves with the belief that they can become
         holy while willfully violating one of God’s requirements. The com-
         mission of a known sin silences the witnessing voice of the Spirit and
         separates the soul from God. ‘Sin is the transgression of the law.’ And
         ‘whosoever sinneth [transgresseth the law] hath not seen Him, neither
         known Him.’ 1 John 3:6. Though John in his epistles dwells so fully
         upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true character of that
1        class who claim to be sanctified while living in transgression of the
         law of God. . . . And the claim to be without sin is, in itself, evidence
         that he who makes this claim is far from holy.”—Ellen G. White, The
         Great Controversy, pp. 472, 473.

    Discussion Questions:
2         ●
          1 What does it mean in practical terms to be “like God”? In
          what ways can we be “like God” in a positive manner and in a
          negative one?

          ●2 Some people are afraid of the idea that we are saved only by
          what Jesus has done for us. They say, if our salvation rests in
          Christ’s righteousness and not in our own, what’s to stop us from
          continuing in sin? How would you respond to that concern?
3
          ●3 Someone once explained his or her understanding of the Cross
          this way: “I don’t use the Cross as an excuse or a cover for sin.
          What the Cross does for me is keep me from giving up altogether
          on God when I do sin.” Discuss the reasoning in that line of
          thought.

          ●4 It’s virtually impossible not to be impacted by whatever soci-
          ety and culture you live in. In your particular society, what sins
          are deemed really bad that perhaps in another culture might not
          be deemed that bad, or even bad at all? How much should we let
          society influence our understanding of what sin is? What sins
          does your society not frown on that the Bible is explicit about?

          ●
          5 We all know the promises we are given for victory over sin. At
          the same time, under what conditions, if any, should someone
          struggling with a sin, perhaps some kind of addiction, seek pro-
          fessional help and counseling? What do you say to the person
          who thinks that those who seek professional help are showing a
          lack of faith in God’s power?

The Family Business
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Kwon Young-Soo inhaled deeply as he entered the bakery. Fragrant
whole-grain bread cooled on trays near the ovens. This bread will bless so
many, he thought, and the money will help spread God’s love so far!
   Kwon’s passion is mission. A pastor by training, he wanted to reach
beyond the pew to those who wouldn’t hear that Jesus is their Savior
unless he stepped outside his comfort zone and told them. His wife shared
his passion, and the couple journeyed down a path that led to mission ser-
vice and later to supporting those willing to go to unreached areas. God
has blessed their efforts. The bakery is just one of several industries that
Kwon and his family have started in order to share the gospel. The sani-
tarium they founded now has 60 beds and runs 10 NEWSTART* health
programs every year. In one year alone 135 were baptized as a result of
this program.
   Recently Kwon opened a training institute to prepare young people for
mission work. One of the first 20 trainees sent to the mission field was his
own daughter, who is serving in a predominantly nonchristian country in
Asia. They work much like Global Mission pioneers, often establishing a
small business or teaching a foreign language as a means of supporting
themselves and meeting people with whom to share the gospel. Their term
of service is undefined, and missionaries can stay as long as they wish.
Some are in their sixth year of service.
   Through his ministry Kwon can share his passion with others while he
trains and sends them to the mission field. And because God has blessed
so abundantly, Kwon has been able to expand his work and ministry far
beyond his initial dreams.
   Kwon’s wife, Kim Suk-Woon, is a partner in the mission outreach her
                             husband envisioned. “From the beginning
                              these enterprises have always been God’s
                              work,” she says. “We pray that we will never
                              be tempted to consider it ours. It’s God’s; we
                              only use the money to further the gospel.” For
                              the Kwons, mission is the family business.
                              Mission is our business, too, one we support
                              with our mission offerings every week.

      Sisters


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Mark 12:28–31; John
      14:15; James 2:15, 16; 1 John 3:11–24; 4:7–5:4.

Memory Text: “And this commandment we have from Him:
      that he who loves God must love his brother also” (1 John 4:21,
      NKJV).
              pastor was visited by a woman full of hatred toward her hus-

      A       band. Not only did she want to divorce him, she wanted to cause
              him as much pain as possible. The pastor suggested that she go
      home and act as if she really loved him. She was to tell him how much
      he meant to her and to be as kind as she could. After having convinced
      him of her undying love, she would then inform him about wanting a
      divorce. That would all but guarantee hurting him as much as possible.
         With revenge in her eyes, she did just that, lavishing love on him for
      a few months as she never had done before. Then the pastor called her
      and asked about her divorce.
         “No way!” she replied. “I discovered I really do love him.”
         Love is able to change our world, our churches, our families, and
      our marriages. This week we’ll see a little of what John says about this
      crucial topic and how love is to be manifested by those who claim to
      be followers of Jesus.

The Week at a Glance: What does John teach about the
      importance of love? How is Christian love manifested? How does
      the plan of salvation reveal the true meaning of love? How can we,
      as sinners, have the assurance of salvation? How are Christians to
      manifest love?

     The Two Passages on Love (1 John 3:11–24,
     4:7–5:4)

        The passage we investigated last week ended with saying that chil-
     dren of God are recognizable by doing what is right and by loving
     their brothers and sisters in the Lord (1 John 3:10). That verse builds
     a bridge to the discussion of love that appears in the rest of the epis-
     tle.

What are some of the similarities between 1 John 3:11–24 and 1 John
     4:7–5:4?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The two passages are remarkably similar. Both contain the phrase
     “love one another” repeatedly (1 John 3:11, 23; 4:7, 11, 12). Both
     stress that the objects of love are primarily other believers, and both
     warn us against hating our brothers and sisters. Both passages also
     emphasize God’s love for us.
        First John 3:11–24 focuses on love to one another and uses the vari-
     ants of the phrase “to love” eight times; the second passage employs
     it more than thirty times and enlarges the topic: We are called to love
     not only the children of God but also God Himself. On the other hand,
     God loved us first and still loves us.
        First John 4:7–5:4 must also be understood in the context of the
     antichrists, who were wrong in their ideas about Jesus. The passage
     says that Jesus is the Son of God (1 John 4:15) and the Christ (1 John
     5:1) and became the atoning sacrifice for our sins and the Savior of
     the world. Only through Him and what He did for us can the love of
     God be understood in a deeper sense. That is, only as we understand
     what happened at the cross and how Christ bore in Himself the pun-
     ishment for our sins can we come to love God as we should.

      Read again the passages for today’s lesson. What specific point,
      or points, jump out at you, talk to you, convict you the most?
      How well are you doing in regard to what John says here? How
      well do you reflect toward others the love that God has toward
      you? What changes do you need to make in order to better show
      that love?

                                                                         65

     The Definition of Love (1 John 3:11–16, 4:7–16)
Though John talks a lot about love in these verses, how does he
     define and explain love? 1 John 3:12–16; 1 John 4:7–10, 16.


        Interestingly enough, John does not set out to give a lexical defini-
     tion of love. Rather, he starts out using the example of Cain as show-
     ing what love is not.

How does that example help make John’s point?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The negative example is followed by a positive one. Jesus laid down
     His life for us. The Father sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice. He sent
     Him to be the Savior of the world. This is the deepest meaning of love.
     Love means to do whatever is necessary to help others, even if it
     includes self-sacrifice. Hence, what a contrast to what Cain did to his
     brother. Love also means to forgive and to forget the past. In Jesus’
     case, it meant complete self-denial for the good of others.
        But love is not a mere spectacle to be observed. It must have an
     impact on others’ lives. If someone would jump in the water and drown
     just to prove his or her love, it would mean nothing. But if the person
     who jumped in lost his life in order to save someone else, that is love.
        The best definition of love is the character and work of the Godhead
     as revealed in the plan of salvation, with Jesus giving Himself for us.
        Christian love has its source in the love of God. To abide in love
     means to enjoy an intimate relationship with God. There is no love in
     the biblical sense that ultimately does not come from God (1 John
     4:7). However, the statement that “everyone who loves is born of God
     and knows God” (NKJV) in the same verse could be misunderstood.
     It has to be interpreted in the context of 1 John. According to 1 John
     3:23, faith (true belief) and love belong together; according to 1 John
     5:2, love and keeping the commandments do too. Anyone can say that
     he or she loves God; John shows us how that love is to be revealed.

      What are some examples of this kind of love that you have seen
      manifested among others? Who manifested this love, what did
      they do, and what did you learn from them about the true mean-
      ing of love?

     A Crisis of Assurance
Read 1 John 3:19–21. What point is John making? What is he saying
     to us? Who hasn’t at some point experienced the feelings that
     John is talking about here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

Read also 1 John 4:17, 18. What problem is he addressing here, as
     well? Again, who hasn’t experienced this concern?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        What Christians at some point, looking at themselves, at their weak-
     nesses, at their lack of love, at their shortcomings, have not felt con-
     demned, guilty, even lost? How important to remember that God is
     greater than we are, greater than our guilt, greater than our hearts. How
     crucial that we realize, day by day, that our hope of salvation must rest
     on Jesus and His work in our behalf. Only by leaning on Him, on His
     merits and not our own, can we have confidence and assurance.
        Confidence is emphasized several times in 1 John. John wants believ-
     ers to be confident when they approach God in prayer (1 John 3:21, 22),
     confident before the reality of Christ’s coming (1 John 2:28), and con-
     fident about the divine judgment (1 John 4:17). God means well for us,
     His children. Being grounded in His love drives away all fear.
        “Satan knows that those who ask God for pardon and grace will
     obtain it; therefore he presents their sins before them to discourage
     them. Against those who are trying to obey God, he is constantly seek-
     ing occasion for complaint. Even their best and most acceptable ser-
     vice he seeks to make appear corrupt. By countless devices, the most
     subtle and the most cruel, he endeavors to secure their condemnation.
        “In his own strength, man cannot meet the charges of the enemy. In
     sin-stained garments, confessing his guilt, he stands before God. But
     Jesus, our Advocate, presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by
     repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to
     Him. He pleads their cause, and by the mighty arguments of Calvary,
     vanquishes their accuser. His perfect obedience to God’s law has given
     Him all power in heaven and in earth, and He claims from His Father
     mercy and reconciliation for guilty man.”—Ellen G. White, God’s
     Amazing Grace, p. 316.

     Love in Practice (1 John 3:17, 18; 4:19–21)
       John is not content to theorize about love. He lets us know that God
     wants us to put love into practice. Therefore he states that hate is
     incompatible with a loving attitude, and it is even a form of murder
     (1 John 3:15). He says, too, that we should not love with words alone
     but with actions (vs. 18).
       John, of course, isn’t against us speaking kind and encouraging
     words to each other. Words are an important part of sharing love. How
     would spouses, children, relatives, and friends feel if they never
     received verbal affirmations from us? Even John himself used words
     to share God’s love with others.
       However, John is opposed to a superficial declaration of love with
     no strings attached. In 1 John 3:17 he describes a situation similar to
     the one found in James 2:15, 16. A church member is in need. Others
     have the means to help him or her but do not do anything other than
     say some nice things to that person. That’s not enough. God not only
     informed us that He loves us, He sent His Son to die in our place.
     People who love much do much, because real love is active.

Read 1 John 3:16 and 17. Which command is the harder one to fol-
     low, and why?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       It’s not likely that any of us will be called to die for another believer.
     But we most likely will be called to demonstrate love for someone in
     need. We may have the means to provide jobs, food, clothes, a
     Christian education, a place of refuge, whatever. Instead, though, we
     prefer to live our own comfortable lives. Early Christians shared their
     financial means. To love others is a challenge, especially because it
     demands sacrifice on our part.
       Of all the places that love must be manifested, no place is more
     important than in the home. There are endless ways we can show our
     love to family members. Sometimes even the littlest things can send a
     powerful message of love and acceptance: extra help around the
     house, a nice dinner, a special family outing together, whatever. There
     are many ways we can manifest love. Love thinks first about others;
     more so, it will act on those thoughts.

      Imagine what it would be like living in a home in which true love
      was manifested. What changes should you make that can help
      bring that ideal closer to reality in your home?

     Love and the Commandments (1 John
     3:22–24, 4:21–5:4)

        Both passages that we have studied this week end with a reference
     to the commandments. The term is used four times each in both sec-
     tions. First John 5:2 (NIV) talks about carrying out the command-
     ments. First John 3:22, 24, and 5:3 (NIV) emphasize obeying, or keep-
     ing (KJV), the commandments.

What do the passages teach about the commandments apart from
     that they should be kept?

     1 John 3:22______________________________________________

     1 John 3:23______________________________________________

     1 John 3:24______________________________________________

     1 John 4:21______________________________________________

     1 John 5:2_______________________________________________

     1 John 5:3_______________________________________________

       John says that keeping God’s commandments and doing what
     pleases Him (1 John 3:22) give Christians confidence that God hears
     their prayers. God’s command is to believe in Jesus and to love one
     another. Keeping the commandments allows for mutual abiding—we
     in God and God in us. To love God includes keeping the command-
     ments, and indeed, they can be kept because they are not burdensome.
       When John talks about commandment in the singular, he mentions
     the commandment to believe in Jesus as the Messiah and to love one
     another. In chapter 4 the commandment is that we who love God
     should also love our brothers and sisters.
       When Jesus was asked which of the commandments was the most
     important, He responded by pointing to the commandment to love God
     with all one’s heart, soul, mind, and strength and to love one’s neighbor
     as oneself (Mark 12:28–31). Yet, He stressed that those who love Him
     keep His commandments (John 14:15), and in the Sermon on the
     Mount He referred to a number of different commandments.
       By switching from the commandment (singular) to the command-
     ments (plural), John may have indicated that the one commandment of
     love expresses itself in a multiplicity of commandments.

      How can we experience God’s commandments as something
      more than a set of rules? Is that all they are? Or are they some-
      thing more?
                                                                          69

    Further Study: Read 1 Corinthians 13; Ellen G. White, “A
         Faithful Witness,” p. 548, in The Acts of the Apostles.

            “Never should we pass by one suffering soul without seeking to
         impart to him of the comfort wherewith we are comforted of God. All
         this is but a fulfillment of the principle of the law,—the principle that
         is illustrated in the story of the good Samaritan, and made manifest in
         the life of Jesus. His character reveals the true significance of the law,
         and shows what is meant by loving our neighbor as ourselves. And
1
         when the children of God manifest mercy, kindness, and love toward
         all men, they also are witnessing to the character of the statutes of
         heaven. . . . The love of God in the heart is the only spring of love
         toward our neighbor.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 505.
            “You should get rid of your cold, frozen formality as soon as possi-
         ble. You need to cultivate feelings of tenderness and friendliness in
2
         your everyday life. You should exhibit true courtesy and Christian
         politeness. The heart that really loves Jesus loves those for whom He
         died. Just as truly as the needle points to the pole, so will the true fol-
         lower of Christ, with a spirit of earnest labor, seek to save souls for
         whom Christ has given His life. Working for the salvation of sinners
         will keep the love of Christ warm in the heart and will give that love
         a proper growth and development.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for
         the Church, vol. 3, p. 466.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 We tend to think of all the admonitions to love as a personal
          issue, one between God and ourselves. And though that is true, it
          certainly isn’t limited to just us as individuals, is it? That is, what
          can your local church do, as a church body, to show love in ways
          that you as an individual can’t? How well is your local church
          revealing the love of God to the community? What can you do to
          help it along in this important area?

          ●
          2 In class, talk about various individuals who have displayed the
          kind of love talked about this week. What did they do? What kind
          of self-sacrifice was involved? What did their actions have in
          common that can help us better understand what true love is?

          ●3 The Bible says that love is from God. Why must that be so?
          Think about it—where else could love come from? It’s hard to
          imagine how pure matter and energy alone, the stuff of physics
          and atoms, could ever of itself create something like love. How
          does the reality of love help us better understand the reality of
          God? How does our expression of love reveal to others the exis-
          tence of God? In what ways might the manifestation of love be
          the best evidence yet for God’s existence?

The Persistent Porter
by INNOCE CHAPAMBA
   A few years ago my family was returning home from Malawi to Zambia.
At the border we had to wait several hours for the bus that would take us
home. When the bus arrived, we stowed our luggage and found a seat. But
just as we were about to leave, a porter told our family to get off the bus and
wait for the next one. Mother argued, for the next bus wouldn’t leave until the
next day. But the porter politely but firmly insisted. Reluctantly we obeyed.
   As he retrieved our luggage from the roof rack, my mother started crying.
“Why us?” she said. “We have no place to sleep except out in the open.”
Other passengers tried to convince the porter to allow us back on the bus, but
he politely refused. Finally we accepted the situation and sat down to wait
until the next bus the following morning.
   During the night the loudspeaker at the bus terminal crackled, awaking us.
“The bus that left for the capital city yesterday afternoon was involved in a
fiery crash. Everyone aboard that bus is dead.”
   Mother sat up and started crying. “My dears,” she said through her tears as
she gathered us close to her. “We should have been on that bus. The porter
who forced us off the bus saved our lives. God saved us.”
   We sat stunned, trying to comprehend that God had saved us from death.
We were Christians but not Adventists at the time. We recalled that although
the porter had insisted that we get off the bus, he was never rude. “Is it pos-
sible that he was an angel?” we whispered among ourselves. When we
arrived home, Mother told Father what had happened, and we all rejoiced in
God’s salvation.
   Later I met some Adventist students who impressed me with their dili-
gence and commitment to God. When told to help clean the campus on
Sabbath, these students refused but politely offered to do their share of work
on Sunday. One day I asked one of them about his faith, and he explained that
Saturday is God’s true Sabbath, the day God set aside for us to spend with
Him. When I learned this, I wondered, Could they be right about the
Sabbath?
   I visited the Adventist church and eventually was baptized. I shared my
faith with my family, and they, too, became Adventists.
   I don’t know why God sometimes intervenes and other times He doesn’t.
I’m sure many of us have been protected from harm without realizing it. I
was blessed to have seen God’s hand in a marvelous way.
   Your mission offerings help spread God’s love from person to person. Soon
the whole world will know, and Jesus can come. Thank you for hastening that
day.

      Believing in the Son of
      God


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 16:24, 25; John
      1:1–3; 3:36; 5:24; Rom. 6:1–6; Heb. 12:4; 1 John 5:1–12.

Memory Text: “Who is it that overcomes the world except the
      one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?”(1 John 5:5, ESV).

          deas about who Jesus is have varied not only in antiquity but also

      I   today. Some separate the biblical Jesus from the so-called histori-
          cal Jesus and claim that the two may not have had much in com-
      mon. The historical Jesus was, supposedly, a common man with a
      strong sensitivity to the divine, that’s all. And He certainly was not the
      Son of God raised from the dead! Others believe that Jesus was a mere
      political revolutionary who, in a subtle way, tried to overthrow the
      Roman Empire.
         We may be tempted to consider these topics as mere academic and
      philosophical exercises. But who Jesus is and what He claimed about
      Himself impact every human being. The way we think about Jesus
      influences dramatically how we relate to God, how we understand the
      plan of salvation, and how we can have assurance of salvation.
         That’s why John deals with the topic in his letters.

The Week at a Glance: What promises of victory are we
      given? What does John mean when he talks about “by water and
      blood”? What reasons are we given for faith? What does John say
      about the divinity of Christ? What does John teach about the
      promise of eternal life?

      Believing in Jesus and Victory (1 John 5:1–5)
        “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
      and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
      begotten of him” (1 John 5:1).

        After having studied John’s teaching about brotherly love, we now
      turn to the subject of faith in Jesus as the Christ/Messiah, the Son of
      God. In fact, the two topics, belief and love, overlap in the first verses
      of chapter 5.
        John wants his audience to believe in Jesus as the Christ. Those who
      do are, he says, born of God. They love God, love one another, and
      keep the commandments. Believers in Jesus as the Son of God also
      overcome the world (1 John 5:1–5).
        Throughout history some people have understood the battle that
      Christians have to fight in overcoming the world as some kind of literal
      military conflict. Yet, that is wrong. Nowhere in Scripture are Christians
      called to set out as crusaders and force others to convert. Nowhere in the
      New Testament is a nation equated with the kingdom of God and, as
      such, to be defended or expanded by violence. The battle that Christians
      have to fight is a spiritual battle. In the Johannine literature, the way to
      overcome is not by the use of violence and physical force. The way to
      overcome is by faith, and faith is exhibited by the kind of life one lives.

In the following texts, John is talking about conquering and overcoming.
      What can we learn about these promises from the following texts?

      John 16:33______________________________________________

      1 John 4:4 ______________________________________________

      Rev. 2:7, 11; 3:5, 21_______________________________________

      Rev. 12:11_______________________________________________

        The conqueror par excellence is Jesus Christ. Because He has won
      the victory, His followers are able to overcome too. To some extent,
      they already have the victory, His victory in their behalf. The over-
      comers receive wonderful promises from God that we no longer have
      to be slaves to sin (Rom. 6:1–6) but that in Jesus and in the new life
      we have in Him, we serve the Lord, not Satan, our old master.

       In what areas of your life have you experienced the promise of
       victory and overcoming? In what areas have you fallen short,
       and why? How can you have the victory that is promised you?
       What is holding you back?
                                                                              73
               M ONDAY August 24

     The Jesus in Whom We Believe (1 John 5:6–8)
        After having pointed to the importance of having faith in Jesus as
     the Messiah and Son of God, John goes on to show his audience who
     this Son of God was, and one of the things he says about Jesus is that
     He came “by water and blood” (1 John 5:6).
        What does that mean?
        In 1 John, water is mentioned only in these verses for today.
     However, it appears quite frequently in the Gospel of John and also in
     Revelation. The water that John mentions in 1 John 5:6, 8 must be—
     according to the passage—somehow related to Jesus and His first
     coming, and it must be one of the three elements that testify that Jesus
     is the Messiah and the Son of God.
        The phrase “blood and water” is used in John 19:34 in connection
     with Jesus’ death but does not seem to be the water that John mentions
     in 1 John 5:6–8. Rather, in the beginning of John’s Gospel, water is
     associated with baptism (John 1:26, 31, 33; 3:5, 23). This seems to be
     the setting for 1 John. Jesus came as incarnate Lord and began His pub-
     lic ministry by being baptized with water. He ended His earthly min-
     istry on the cross, when He shed His blood. Apparently, water points to
     Jesus’ baptism and blood to His death on the cross (1 John 1:7).
        Baptism and crucifixion, then, point to who Jesus was and what He
     was to accomplish for us. In both cases divine manifestations and
     human reactions showed that indeed He was the Son of God (Matt.
     3:17, 27:50–54).
        In these verses John was still dealing with the false teaching of
     these antichrists. These concepts were impacting the minds of believ-
     ers. If Jesus was neither the Messiah nor the Son of God, their mes-
     sage would be, The atoning death of the Son of God is not necessary
     for our salvation. The Son of God did not die on the cross in our place
     in order to redeem us. Such a concept would lead to a completely dif-
     ferent understanding of salvation and of the Godhead. Redemption
     would be through knowledge (gnosis), not through the Cross. Hence,
     John wanted the people to know exactly who Jesus was and what He
     had done for them through His life and death. He didn’t want people
     to be deceived by these false teachings.

      Water and blood. Think on those two images and how they
      apply to Jesus. In what ways are we to experience the reality of
      water and blood in our own lives? In other words, what did your
      baptism mean to you? What does it say about you, and what
      changes have come in your life? The same with blood: What
      does the concept of shed blood mean, at least in terms of being
      a Christian? See Matt. 16:24, 25; Heb. 12:4.

                 T UESDAY August 25

      Jesus and the Testimony of God (1 John 5:9, 10)
        The first and second witnesses to the divine Sonship of Jesus are
      water and blood. The third witness is the Holy Spirit (1 John 5:6, 8).
      According to John’s Gospel, Jesus had announced that the Holy Spirit
      would testify about Him (John 15:26).
        Why are these witnesses needed? Two to three witnesses were
      required in the Old Testament to confirm a matter (Deut. 19:15). John,
      apparently, wants to make clear that the case of Jesus has a sound
      foundation. He wants to show that we have good reasons for believ-
      ing.

What is John saying to us in 1 John 5:9, 10? What does He want us to
      believe?


         For John, the idea of witnesses or various testimonies about Jesus is
      quite important. In his Gospel he mentions several others: John the
      Baptist’s testimony (John 1:6, 7), Jesus’ own testimony (John 3:32),
      the testimony of the Samaritan woman (John 4:39), the testimony of
      Jesus’ works (John 5:36), the testimony of Scripture (vs. 39), the tes-
      timony of God the Father (John 8:18), the testimony of the people
      who watched the resurrection of Lazarus (John 12:17), the testimony
      of the Holy Spirit (John 15:26), and the testimony of the apostle John
      himself (John 21:24). This is very impressive. John wants to establish
      that belief in Jesus rests on powerful testimonies.
         The testimony of the Father in our text has been understood differ-
      ently. It seems to make the most sense if connected with the threefold
      testimony mentioned in the preceding verses. That is, this threefold
      testimony is, basically, God’s testimony.
         John says that if we are willing to accept the witness of humans,
      how much more so the witness of God Himself? Indeed, often we take
      at face value what people tell us, whether in print or television media,
      even if we have no good grounds for believing what we hear. How
      much more should we accept God’s own witness and believe in Jesus
      as portrayed in the New Testament!
         God is reliable and true (1 John 5:20). If we do not accept His tes-
      timony, we claim that God is a liar, a serious accusation indeed.

       What are all the reasons you have for believing in God, in Jesus,
       in the hope that the Adventist message presents to us? Go back
       over those reasons, write them down, pray over them, and bring
       them to class to share with others.




                                                                          75

     The Issue of the Trinity (1 John 5:7, 8)
        In some versions of the Bible the words “in heaven: the Father, the
     Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three
     that bear witness on earth” appear in 1 John 5:7, 8 (NKJV). The only
     problem is they are a later addition, not found in the original manu-
     scripts.
        Among biblical scholars there is agreement that this statement is
     not genuine and has been added, probably to support the doctrine of
     the Trinity. Of course, biblical texts should never be tampered with,
     for many reasons (Rev. 22:18), one of the most important being that
     people may start having doubts about the reliability of Scripture as a
     whole and start to mistrust God’s Word.
        The fact is, even without these words the doctrine of the Trinity is
     firmly established in Johannine literature. Although the authors of the
     New Testament believe that God is one, they portray Jesus and the
     Holy Spirit as God. To reconcile the oneness of God with the divinity
     of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the concept of the Trinity is crucial.

John has powerful statements about the divinity of Jesus. What does
     he teach about Jesus Christ in the following texts?

     John 1:1–3, 14___________________________________________

     John 8:58, 59____________________________________________

     John 10:30, 31___________________________________________

     John 20:28______________________________________________

     1 John 2:23______________________________________________

     1 John 5:20______________________________________________

       Though there’s no question about the divinity of Jesus as established
     by these texts (and many others), the passage that we are studying this
     week does not try to establish the doctrine of the Trinity. That wasn’t
     the point. It is, instead, a passage about faith in Jesus as the Son of
     God and the witness given to the world about Him.

      Keeping in mind the divinity of Jesus, go back over the final
      scenes of His life, right up through the Cross. As you do, remem-
      ber that this person was also God the Creator. Dwell on the
      implications of these truths. Why should this reality change our
      lives?

      The Result of Believing in Jesus (1 John
      5:11, 12)

         God has provided a wonderful gift for humanity. This gift is eternal
      life (1 John 5:11, 12). However, it is available in Jesus Christ only.
      How can we receive this gift? By accepting God’s testimony about His
      Son, for instance, by believing in and accepting Jesus.

      John 6:54_______________________________________________

         John’s discussion on faith in Jesus and who Jesus is and why we can
      accept God’s testimony is not an academic exercise. It has a clear,
      practical goal, namely, finding eternal life in the Son of God. John’s
      opponents—who questioned the true divinity of Christ, or who ques-
      tioned the true humanity of Christ, or who wanted to separate the
      divine from the human—had a different view of Jesus and did not
      believe in Him in the biblical sense. Because they did not have the
      Jesus of Scripture, they did not have eternal life. Even if they would
      claim to have eternal life, even if they had superior knowledge and a
      good feeling about possessing eternal life, their claims would not be
      true.

“Eternal life is possible through Jesus Christ only.” What are the
      implications of such a statement? 1 John 5:11, 12.


        John clearly states that those who do not have the Son of God do not
      have life, while those who have Jesus have everlasting life. These are
      very strong words, full of incredible implications for the entire human
      race. No wonder the issues of salvation are so important. They are, lit-
      erally, a question not just of life or death but of eternal life or eternal
      death. You can’t get much more serious than this.

       What about folk who have never had the opportunity to hear
       the gospel presented in a clear manner? Are they all automati-
       cally lost? As you think about your answer, don’t forget to take
       into account God’s universal love for all humanity. How can you
       learn to better trust the Lord on this difficult question?

    Further Study: Read Matt. 16:13–17, John 12:37–46.

            “ ‘In him was life; and the life was the light of men’ (John 1:4). It is
         not physical life that is here specified, but immortality, the life which
         is exclusively the property of God. The Word, who was with God, and
         who was God, had this life. Physical life is something which each indi-
         vidual receives. It is not eternal or immortal; for God, the Life-giver,
         takes it again. Man has no control over his life. But the life of Christ
         was unborrowed. No one can take this life from Him. ‘I lay it down of
         myself’ (John 10:18), He said. In Him was life, original, unborrowed,
1        underived. This life is not inherent in man. He can possess it only
         through Christ. He cannot earn it; it is given him as a free gift if he will
         believe in Christ as His personal Saviour. ‘This is life eternal, that they
         might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast
         sent’ (John 17:3). This is the open fountain of life for the world.”

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 In class, go over your answer to Tuesday’s final question. How
          can you draw strength and encouragement from each other’s
          answers?

          ●2 John talks about the witnesses we have been given regarding
          Jesus. What about the witness that we ourselves present to the
3
          world? If someone had viewed every aspect of your life during
          the past 24 hours, what kind of witness would you have pre-
          sented? If you had known someone was going to be watching,
          what would you have done differently? After you give your
          answer, ask yourself, Why would I have done it differently? Also,
          don’t you know that Someone is watching anyway?

          ●
          3 OK, so you have the promise of eternal life. But what does that
          mean? How should it impact how you live here, now? What do
          you do differently now, knowing that you have this promise?

          ●4 Go back over the Ellen G. White quote given above. What
          stands out and especially speaks to you? What hope and encour-
          agement can you get from it?

          ●
          5 With so much at stake, eternal life or eternal destruction, why
          is it still so easy for us to get caught up in the things of the world,
          things that we know cannot satisfy us and that cannot last or give
          us eternal life? What is the secret of being able to break the hold
          of the world on us? How can you help someone who truly wants
          to be a Christian, who wants these promises for himself or her-
          self, and yet can’t seem to break away from the world?

The Angel’s Visit
by HADJILYN PRECIADO
  SULADS, student missionaries from Mountain View College, are
assigned to teach and minister throughout southern Philippines. My
assignment as a student missionary was to teach in a Manobo village in
northeastern Mindanao. The village is a challenging climb up mountains
and through thick jungle. Life is difficult in these places, but God encour-
ages us as we spend a year serving Him.
  At first teaching was difficult because many of our students were big-
ger and stronger than we were. But soon they realized that we meant busi-
ness and cared about them. Soon the once-empty church came alive with
young people who had strayed during the time that no teacher worked
here. Many agreed to take Bible studies.
  Datu Daging, the chief, wanted his people to learn to read, but he
wanted nothing to do with God. Often he jeered as we studied the Bible
with people. “This is nonsense!” he would say. “I have an abyan (a spirit
who the people believe gives power to heal or protection from enemies).
My abyan gives me all the help I need, so I don’t need God in my life!”
While others worshiped with us, the datu scoffed and boasted that his
abyan, his god, was more powerful than God.
  Then one night the datu told us he had a dream. A big man in white
appeared to him. His face radiated calm and love. But the datu couldn’t
understand him and was about to talk to the being when he awoke. When
he opened his eyes, he saw that the being stood before him. He pinched
himself to wake up, and still the stranger stood looking at him.
  Then the stranger spoke. “If you want to be saved in God’s kingdom,
you must worship God with the Sabbath keepers. They’re God’s true peo-
ple who worship on His Sabbath. God is coming soon to take His children
to heaven. So hurry! Your soul is precious to God.”
  Datu Daging bowed his head and considered the message he had heard.
When he looked up, the stranger was gone.
  That Sabbath Datu Daging was in church with his wife and children. He
asked for Bible studies and was baptized recently in a regional rally. Datu
Daging now is an active member of our little village church. Though we
SULADS don’t often see them, we know that angels have appeared to
many who live in the mountains of the Philippines, assisting the SULADS
missionaries in their work.
  Your mission offerings support Adventist colleges and universities in
the Philippines, which send missionaries throughout the Philippines and
beyond to share God’s love with those who have never heard. Thank you.

        LESSON            10 *August 29–September 4
      Confidence



      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: John 3:36, Acts 4:29, 1 Cor.
      9:27, Heb. 4:16, 1 John 5:13–21, Rev. 12:9.

Memory Text: “And this is the confidence which we have in him,
      that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us” (1 John
      5:14, RSV).

             en Franklin once said that only two things are certain in this

      B      life: death and taxes. There’s a third certain thing, as well: life
             is full of uncertainty!
         We do not know how secure our jobs are. Nothing guarantees our
      protection from sickness, terrorism, war, and natural disaster. We have
      no guarantee that when we go to bed we will wake up the next day.
         Facing this, we do our best, trying to protect ourselves from these
      troubles the best we can, and yet, in the end our best efforts can guar-
      antee us nothing.
         But what about God? And God’s promises to us? Are they not cer-
      tain? How can we live without confidence and assurance when it
      comes to God? Our relationship with God and living with Him forever
      are more important than anything else. What does John have to say to
      us about this, the most important thing in our lives?

The Week at a Glance: What can we have confidence in?
      How do we not turn our confidence into presumption? What con-
      fidence can we have that our prayers will be answered? What pro-
      tection are we offered against Satan? How can we come to a
      knowledge of God?

                S UNDAY August 30

     Having Confidence                    (1 John 5:13–21)

        First John 5:14 contains the word confidence, which also has the
     meaning of “assurance,” “boldness,” or in other contexts “frankness”
     (Acts 4:29, 31) and “openness” (John 16:25, 29).
        According to Hebrews 4:16 and 10:19, Christians can draw near to
     the throne of God with confidence. Why? First, because Jesus shed
     His blood for them on the cross. And second, because Jesus has
     ascended to heaven to serve there as High Priest on their behalf.
        The same term is used by John in 1 John 4:17 talking about “confi-
     dence” or “boldness” in the day of judgment. Christians are not afraid
     of judgment. They rely on what Jesus has done for them. Their confi-
     dence is not in themselves, or what they have done or could ever do.
     This confidence rests, instead, entirely on Jesus.
        Another way that John expresses this idea of confidence is by the
     repeated use of the phrase “we know” at the end of 1 John. While this
     phrase is found throughout the letter only twice (1 John 3:2, 14), it
     occurs five times in the conclusion of the epistle and additionally
     stresses the topic of “confidence.”

According to the following texts, what can we be confident about?
     1 John 5:13______________________________________________

     1 John 5:15______________________________________________

     1 John 5:18______________________________________________

     1 John 5:19______________________________________________

     1 John 5:20______________________________________________
       In 1 John 5:13 the apostle says “you may know” and talks about assur-
     ance of salvation. From 1 John 5:15 onward he uses “we know.” In
     1 John 5:15 he emphasizes that our prayers are heard. We can be confi-
     dent. In 1 John 5:18 “we know” is followed by the promise of divine pro-
     tection. In 1 John 5:19 the same phrase “we know” introduces the won-
     derful concept of belonging to God, and 1 John 5:20 stresses that we
     know Jesus and thereby, through Jesus, we know God and are in Him.
     Therefore, Christians have confidence with regard to their relationship to
     God, their prayer life, and their present state and future destiny.
      How many times have you disappointed yourself in the last
      month, week, or even day? We would say, “Keep a record of those
      disappointments,” but that might be too discouraging. How does
      the reality of your own foibles bring home the need to make sure
      that your confidence rests in Jesus and not in yourself?
                                                                           81
               M ONDAY August 31

     Having Eternal Life (1 John 5:13)
Read 1 John 5:13. What can we be sure of, according to this text?


        Verse 13 provides an important reason John wrote his letter. He
     wanted his audience to have assurance of salvation. His hearers and
     readers should know that they already have eternal life. Everlasting
     life is a present reality. John made a similar statement at the end of his
     Gospel (John 20:30, 31).
        First John 5:13 surpasses the other texts in the New Testament that
     deal with everlasting life. They mention a condition and contain a
     promise (e.g., John 3:36), but 1 John 5:13 states that children of God
     should know that they have eternal life. It is not an option, something
     that can be added to a Christian life or can be left out. God wants us
     to have assurance of salvation. Moses (Exod. 32:32), Peter (1 Pet.
     5:1), Paul (2 Tim. 4:7, 8), the Christians in Ephesus (Eph. 2:8), and
     the believers in Colossae (Col. 1:12–14) had this certainty.

How, though, can we be protected from taking assurance and turn-
     ing it into presumption? See Matt. 10:22, 1 Cor. 9:27, Rev. 3:11.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Some folk have taken this “confidence” of salvation and turned it into
     an “unconditional guarantee,” the idea of “once saved, always saved.” If
     this were true, what would stop us from forgetting all about God and liv-
     ing an immoral and unethical life—one that would, according to the
     Bible, bar us from heaven (Gal. 5:21, Rev. 21:8)? After all, it’s hard
     enough, even knowing that we can fall away from God, to keep our-
     selves pure. Imagine if we thought it didn’t matter at all how we lived!
        The Bible teaches that there is assurance of salvation, but this cer-
     tainty can be lost through our own choices. We need to hold on to the
     crown of life by keeping ourselves daily surrendered to the Lord in
     obedience and in repentance and faith. We must, always, watch and
     pray, for Satan is seeking whom he may devour (1 Pet. 5:8). And if
     that’s not us, then who?

      Look at yourself closely (we know, it’s painful!). Are you strug-
      gling with assurance of salvation? If so, isn’t it because of the
      things that you are doing? If so, then you must first claim the for-
      giveness that is yours and then claim the power to overcome that
      is promised you. What’s holding you back but your own choices?

               T UESDAY September 1

     According to His Will (1 John 5:14–17)
Read 1 John 5:14, 15. What promise do we have there? Most impor-
     tant, what should it mean to us?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       We can come to God with all our joys, burdens, and requests. We
     can tell Him that we need money. We can tell Him that we have prob-
     lems with our kids and need His intervention. We can tell Him that we
     are seriously ill and need healing. Do we know that He will send us a
     check, straighten out our kids, or heal us from a vicious disease? Not
     necessarily. When Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, He added to His
     prayer “Your will be done” (Matt. 26:42, NKJV); and God did not
     deliver Him from the cross.
       However, if we confess our sins and ask for forgiveness, God does
     not put us on a waiting list; rather, we can have confidence that, as we
     end our prayer, forgiveness has become a reality. If I ask Him to make
     me His child because I accept Jesus as Savior and Lord, God will
     answer such a prayer right away. Whenever the will of God is revealed
     in Scripture—whether in a commandment or a promise—and we
     claim that expression of His will, we know that the prayer is answered.
     In cases in which we are not sure how God will lead us, we should add
     “Your will be done” to our prayers and in confidence trust that the
     Lord will do what is best.
       First John 5:16, 17 is not easy to understand. Scholars are divided
     on what it means (some say it’s the sin against the Holy Spirit). We do
     know, however, that all sin is unrighteousness and cannot be justified
     or tolerated. But what is the distinction of sins that John has made in
     these verses? This is not easy to answer. Whatever John is saying, we
     can be sure that he’s not downplaying the seriousness of sin.

      We’ve all had prayers that have not come to pass in any way,
      shape, or form. A loved one dies despite prayer. A job is lost
      despite prayer. And so forth. In some cases, later on we can see
      how things really did turn out better when the prayer wasn’t
      answered as we had wanted. In others, all we see is disappoint-
      ment, heartache, and sorrow. How are we to deal with the lat-
      ter? How are we to continue to live by faith and trust God when
      seemingly unanswered prayers leave us filled with sorrow, dis-
      appointment, and, yes, even doubt?




                                                                         83

     Confident of Being Protected (1 John 5:18, 19)
       In 1 John 5:18, 19, John twice states that “we know.” Both verses
     begin with this statement. However, John is not concerned with
     knowledge only.

What indirect challenges do verses 18 and 19 contain?

       In verse 18 (NKJV), the phrase “born of God” is used twice. However,
     the first phrase refers to every true believer, while the second phrase
     refers to Jesus. In Greek there is a difference of tenses that may be
     quite important. “Anyone born of God” (the first phrase) occurs in the
     perfect tense and may describe the lasting effect of regeneration. The
     second phrase occurs in a tense that refers to one specific event in the
     past only. The second phrase describes Jesus’ incarnation. Jesus was
     born of Mary in Bethlehem. The first phrase refers to the experience
     of humans who are born again (John 3:3, 5; 1 John 3:9). The usage of
     the same term for Jesus may point to the fact that Jesus has come close
     to us, even became one of us. On the other hand, Jesus is different
     from us. He is the Son of God in a sense that we never will be.

What comfort do these verses contain? 1 John 5:18, 19.

       Both verses mention “the evil one.” The term is also used in 1 John
     2:13, 14; 3:12. It describes Satan. Additionally John calls him “devil”
     (1 John 3:8, 10). According to Revelation 12:9 he is the old serpent,
     the devil. First John 5:18, 19 provides a short glimpse of the great
     controversy between Christ and Satan. This controversy is revealed in
     the book of Revelation, especially chapter 12. However, the different
     parties are already pointed to in 1 John.
       In verses 18 and 19 John refers to the world as the arena of the evil
     one. On the other side of the conflict, the disciples of Jesus are found
     together with God the Father and Jesus. These believers are protected
     by Him. Jesus keeps them and does not allow Satan to touch them.
     Therefore, they are able to say No to sin and to withstand temptations.
       Verse 19 states that we are of God. We can be confident because we
     have a direct and intimate relationship with God and are separate from
     the world. As children of God we can claim His promises.
      How are you experiencing the reality of the great controversy in
      your own life? How can you make these promises of victory and
      protection your own? That is, what are you doing that might
      make it impossible for those promises to be realized for you
      now? At the same time, what hope can you draw from the fact
      that Jesus has already won the war against Satan for us and
      offers us His victory?

     Having True Knowledge of the Godhead
     (1 John 5:20, 21)

       Again John states that “we know.” We know Him who is true. The
     Son of God, Jesus, has come into this world and has revealed to us
     God the Father. This knowledge is not merely head knowledge but
     knowledge that leads us to a close connection with God.

According to 1 John 5:20, who is the One who is true?


        Throughout his first letter we have seen that John switches easily
     from the Father to Jesus. In some cases the personal pronouns He and
     Him may even refer to both Father and Son. This is no surprise,
     because he “who confesses the Son has the Father also” (1 John 2:23,
     RSV). First John 5:20 includes the word true three times. The first ref-
     erence clearly points to God the Father: Jesus has come and has given
     us insight so that we understand the Father, at least to some extent.
        The second reference may refer to Jesus: “We are in Him who is
     true, in His Son Jesus Christ” (NKJV). The last part of this clause
     seems to explain the first: The Son of God is the one who is true. The
     word true is found in 1 John 2:8, describing Jesus (see also Rev. 3:7,
     14), but it also is an attribute of the Father (John 7:28).
        The last reference in 1 John mentioning the word true occurs in the
     sentence, “This is the true God, and eternal life” (NKJV). This sentence
     may refer to God the Father, to Jesus, or to both. Expositors are divided
     on this issue. In any case, it makes perfect sense if it relates to Jesus.

What does 1 John 5:21 say, and how could we apply the principle to
     ourselves?


        So far in the entire Epistle, John has not mentioned idolatry. Instead,
     he has wrestled with false conceptions of Jesus and their influence on
     those church members who had not left the church. Why would he at
     the end of his letter, as a final admonition, introduce a topic not found
     before? Perhaps John considers the false views of Christ as idolatry,
     and so idolatry is associated with the teachings of the antichrists about
     God and Jesus. Their understanding of the Godhead could be seen as
     worshiping false gods instead of the Father, who in Jesus gives eternal
     life and confidence to all true believers.

            “When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer may
         be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask, but not
         so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us
1
         from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life.

            “If the life of the sick can glorify Him, we pray that they may live;
         nevertheless, not as we will but as He will. Our faith can be just as
         firm, and more reliable, by committing the desire to the all-wise God,
         and, without feverish anxiety, in perfect confidence, trusting all to
         Him. We have the promise. We know that He hears us if we ask
3
         according to His will. Our petitions must not take the form of a com-
         mand, but of intercession for Him to do the things we desire of
         Him.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 149.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 As a class, discuss what you wrote at the end of Thursday’s les-
          son. What can you learn from each other?

          ●
          2 Many have struggled with the question of “assurance of salva-
          tion.” What usually is the reason for this problem? How can you
          help those who are struggling here?

          ●
          3 Considering all the wonderful promises in the Bible for vic-
          tory over sin, why do so many of us still fall into the same sins
          again and again?

          ●4 How are we seeing the reality of the great controversy being
          manifested in our world today? How is it being played out in our
          own communities, or even our own homes? What are we doing, in
          the controversy, for the cause of Christ? What can we as individ-
          uals, or together with our church, do for the cause of Christ in
          His battle with Satan?

God Chose a Child
by VIJAYANANDA AND GEETARANI PARICHHA
   When 3-year-old Vigee greeted the woman walking by his home, she
stopped and chatted with him. The next day Vigee greeted her again, and
soon the two became friends. He called her Auntie. Sometimes Auntie’s
husband joined her, and they both stopped and talked with Vigee.
   The child’s parents noticed their son speaking with this couple and
greeted them as well. When Viju, the boy’s father, learned that Auntie and
Uncle were Christians, he began debating the Bible with them. “No
Christian church has the truth!” Viju challenged.
   Auntie and Uncle told their Adventist pastor about the strong-willed
neighbor and invited the pastor to accompany them to visit Viju.
   Viju welcomed the men into his home. “Do you have some questions to
ask about God or the Bible?” the pastor asked. Viju had plenty of ques-
tions! He asked about rebirth, and the pastor explained what the Bible
means when it talks of being born again. Viju believed in reincarnation
and refused to agree with the pastor.
   After talking for hours, the pastor promised to return the next day to
continue their discussion. He returned almost every evening for several
months to talk about the Bible. Sometimes Viju listened, and other times
he argued.
   One evening when Viju asked a question, the pastor simply prayed and
left, saying that God would answer his question. That night Viju dreamed
that a man in a white robe told him to throw three jackfruit seeds into a
fire. He obeyed and watched as the outer fruit burned away but the seed
was unharmed. Then the man said that his sins must be burned like the
jackfruit flesh in order to have a new birth experience. Viju realized that
God had sent this dream.
   Viju’s wife, Geeta, had longed to be a Christian and was disappointed
when Viju chose to follow other gods. Now she rejoiced that her husband
was surrendering his life to the Savior.
   The couple prepared for baptism, but their relatives were unhappy about
their decision. Many held high positions in their own churches, and they
hoped that the couple would join their denomination. But as the couple’s
relatives learned the Bible truths Viju and his wife embraced, some
accepted the Adventist message.
   “When no pastor could convince me, God used my own son and a kind
woman to lead us to the Lord,” Viju says. Now we seek to lead others to
Him. Your mission offerings help make one-to-one evangelism possible
around the world.
VIJAYANANDA PARICHHA and his wife, GEETARANI, are teachers in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.

        LESSON             11 *September 5–11
      Important Themes
      in 1 John




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 5:13, John 14:6,
      Eph. 4:25–5:21, 1 Tim. 3:15, 1 John.

Memory Text: “Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has
      not appeared as yet what we shall be. We know that, when He
      appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him just as He
      is” (1 John 3:2, NASB).

               f all the tragedy that came out of the September 11, 2001, terror-

      O        ist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., there was one posi-
               tive development: for many people it sounded the death knell for
      moral relativism. The cold-blooded slaughter of thousands, in broad day-
      light, right on our TV sets, brought home for many people in real time the
      horror involved in such mass murder. It was suddenly obvious that evil
      like this could never be justified on the basis of culture. On September 11,
      people saw the face of a moral evil, an evil that transcended all culture, all
      traditions, all epochs; and suddenly for many the objective nature of
      morality, particularly of evil, finally hit home as never before.
         Of course, for John, moral relativity was never an issue. He knew that
      there was absolute truth, and it was centered in Christ. This week we’ll
      review some of the major themes of 1 John, including His understanding
      of the nature of truth, which always forms the foundation of morality.

The Week at a Glance: What does John teach us about
      the work of the Godhead? What images does he use to convey the
      idea of what the church should be like? What is the only basis of
      our salvation? What does John teach about truth?

     The Godhead
        In 1 John, we are given a glimpse of the Godhead: the Father (1 John
     2:16), the Son (vs. 23), and the Holy Spirit (1 John 5:6). The main
     emphasis, however, is on Jesus and the Father. The letter tells us that
     God is light and that darkness (evil) is not found in Him. It tells us that
     God is righteous and that He is love. Indeed, our ability to love is
     dependent on the God who is love. God’s relationship to the believers
     is expressed with the term children, which itself reveals the love and
     care He has for us. In short, 1 John paints for us a very positive and
     hopeful picture of what our God is like.
        But the chapter also tells us something else. It tells us what the Lord
     is doing for us. Here’s where our real hope and encouragement should
     lie.

According to 1 John, what has God done for us, and what is being
     done now for us?

     1 John 1:9_______________________________________________

     1 John 2:1, 2_____________________________________________

     1 John 2:27______________________________________________

     1 John 3:8_______________________________________________

     1 John 4:8–10____________________________________________

     1 John 5:11______________________________________________

     1 John 5:14______________________________________________

       The letter refers to Christ’s coming in human flesh, as well as His
     death for us, which offers us the opportunity to have eternal life. At
     the same time, His death defeated the works of the devil, our enemy.
     According to 1 John, God forgives our sins, cleanses us, intercedes for
     us, and gives us eternal life. He offers us assurance and makes us His
     children. The bottom line is that it is the Cross and the blood of Jesus
     alone that saves us, nothing else.

      Are there any areas of your life that you have not fully surren-
      dered to the Lord? That is, are you doing things that you know,
      deep down, are wrong and yet haven’t given up? If so, in the end
      only you can make the choice to give it up. If the Spirit is touch-
      ing you, why not make the choice now? The longer you wait, the
      harder it gets.
                                                                            89

      The Church
         In the New Testament the church is presented with a number of
      images such as salt (Matt. 5:13), a pillar (1 Tim. 3:15), a building or
      house (Eph. 2:21, 22), a temple (1 Cor. 3:16, 17), a mother (Rev. 12:
      1, 2), a bride (Rev. 21:2), and Christ’s body (Eph. 1:22, 23).

In 1 John, though the word church itself does not appear, the concept
      does. What imagery is found in the book that better helps us
      understand what the church should be all about?

      1 John 2:9–11____________________________________________

      1 John 2:13, 14___________________________________________

      1 John 2:12, 18___________________________________________

      1 John 3:1_______________________________________________

         In 1 John it seems that the church primarily is portrayed as a fam-
      ily. There is the heavenly Father (12 times). In addition, John himself
      is a father figure of sorts, calling the church members “little children”
      (1 John 2:18). The church members are “children” (13 times), “fathers
      and young men” (each twice), and “brothers” (13 times).
         These terms imply a certain kind of intimacy, a close relationship
      and love for each other, and contain the notion of belonging together.
      Everyone is needed, and everyone has a place in God’s family. In addi-
      tion, this family includes the Godhead. Consequently, this community
      has a horizontal and a vertical dimension. As members of the church,
      we are literally part of the family of God.

“Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
      that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God” (1 John 4:7). How
      does this text reflect the key to what it means to be part of God’s
      church?

       How would you describe your relationship to the church family?
       Are you a wayward child? Domineering father? Loving mother?
       Helpless babe? What changes do you need to make in order to
       be a more productive part of this special family?

     Salvation
       The Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, is all about Jesus. But not
     about Jesus in a vacuum. It’s about Jesus and Redemption. It’s about
     what God has done in behalf of the fallen race. It’s about the amazing
     self-sacrifice of God Himself in order to restore us to what we were
     originally given, and even more.
       In short, the Bible is about salvation, and that’s a key theme in
     1 John, as well.

According to the following texts, how are we given salvation?

     1 John 1:9 ______________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     1 John 2:2 ______________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     1 John 4:9, 10 ___________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The means of our salvation is Christ’s blood (1 John 1:7; 5:6, 8);
     that is, His atoning sacrifice (1 John 2:2, 4:10). The Cross is not men-
     tioned in 1 John directly. However, blood and atoning sacrifice point
     to the Cross. It is not the example of Jesus that saves us, as important
     as that is. It is His death. And yet, His example calls us to walk as He
     did (1 John 2:6).
        For John, the salvation of the believers is a present reality. He
     describes it in various ways:

       • They have come to know Him (1 John 2:2, 3).
       • They are in Him (1 John 2:5, 5:20).
       • Their sins have been forgiven (1 John 2:12).
       • They have overcome the evil one (vs. 13).
       • They have passed from death to life (1 John 3:14).
       • They have eternal life (1 John 5:12, 13).

       This is a wonderful portrayal of what salvation is all about.

      Considering the great promises and hope that we have in Jesus,
      what more could you do in order to reach more people with the
      good news? What sacrifices are you willing to make in order to
      give others the opportunity to know Jesus and His salvation?
                                                                         91

     Christian Behavior
       Although John in his first letter deals with erroneous theology, he
     again and again deals with ethics. John clearly sees that theology
     informs ethics and that a wrong theology can lead to wrong actions.
     Hence, it’s important to be as correct in our theology as possible. A
     wrong understanding, for instance, of the law and grace has caused
     untold millions to trample on God’s Sabbath day. Thus, we must make
     sure that our theological understanding of God and Scripture is
     mature, growing, and correct.
       We also must make sure that our theology correctly translates into
     practice. It is sad to see someone, a great defender of orthodox theol-
     ogy, run away with his neighbor’s spouse. It is tragic for theology
     majors and seminarians to cheat on their exams. It is lamentable when
     Sabbath keepers who know the truth about salvation, the heavenly
     sanctuary, and the state of the dead nevertheless lie to each other.

Review the following texts and on the lines below summarize what
     they teach us about ethical behavior. 1 John 1:7; 2:1, 15, 16; 3:4, 7,
     15, 17, 18; 4:7; 5:2, 3.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        John stresses ethical behavior with direct and indirect appeals. He
     calls for Christians not to lie, not to sin, not to hate brother or sister,
     not to love the world with its lusts and boastful pride, and not to prac-
     tice lawlessness. Instead, he says that we must be obedient, do what is
     right, and love each other in a tangible way. Although Paul is more
     detailed than John (see, for example, Eph. 4:25–5:21), John has sum-
     marized all of this when he points to keeping God’s commandments
     and walking as Jesus walked and lived (1 John 2:6).
        John makes it clear that to be born of God, to know God, to love
     God, is something that will change our lives. For John, truth isn’t just
     something believed; it is something lived out. Perhaps no verse says it
     clearer than 1 John 3:7: “Little children, let no man deceive you: he
     that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.”

      How are we to walk and live as Jesus lived? What does that
      mean on a practical and daily basis? Are you facing something
      right now, perhaps, that will require a lot of grace and strength
      to act as Christ would act?

      Truth and Lies
         From the time of the ancient Greeks through even today, there has
      been the notion that truth is relative, that there are no absolutes, and
      that human beings, far from having some transcendent absolute stan-
      dard to guide them and their actions, pretty much have to decide for
      themselves what is truth and what is error, what is good and what is
      bad, what is moral and what is immoral. It’s known basically as rela-
      tivism, and though it comes in various guises, the basic point is the
      same: There is no absolute standard of truth, goodness, or morality. In
      this view, we have to come up with these things ourselves—doing the
      best we can according to our own culture, community, and traditions.

Read John 14:6. What is Jesus saying here about the nature of
      absolute truth?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Jesus doesn’t accept the idea that truth is relative. In words as clear
      and unambiguous as possible, Jesus shows us the reality of absolute
      truth, and in Him we see it manifested in the form of a person!

What does John teach about truth? 1 John 2:4, 21; 3:19; 4:6; 5:20.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         John knows that there are absolutes; more so, he makes it very clear
      that there is a sharp distinction between truth and lies, a contrast that
      tends to be blurred in relativistic worldviews. There is absolute truth.
      God is true. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are truth. On the other hand, a
      liar is a person who makes unsubstantiated claims, who confesses to
      love and does not keep the commandments, and who denies that Jesus
      is the Christ. In contrast, sincere Christians know the truth, love the
      truth, and belong to the truth. Thus, truth is both what we intellectu-
      ally grasp and what we practice.

       No question: according to the Bible, absolute truth exists. But is
       everything absolute? Are there not things that are not so firm, but
       rather contingent, personal, cultural, and changing? How can we
       learn to differentiate between what must be absolute and
       unchanging and what can change and be relative, depending on
       circumstances?
                                                                            93

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “A Faithful Witness,”
         pp. 546–554, in The Acts of the Apostles.

            Today, 1 John is very much needed, because all sorts of false ideas
         are being promoted. John calls his audience, and us, not to believe
         everyone and not to accept uncritically new doctrines, but to test
         whether or not a teaching is truly biblical. Discernment to distinguish
         truth from error is needed.
1
            According to John, authentic Christianity has these marks: (1) belief
         in Jesus as the Son of God, who has come in the flesh; (2) observance
         of the commandments of God; and (3) love toward God and others.
         John wants to lay a solid foundation and help his audience have assur-
         ance of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as proclaimed in
         Scripture.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 However hard for those who believe in moral absolutes to
          understand, the idea of moral relativism makes a certain amount
          of logical sense. If there is no God or Creator and we are purely
          the results of random forces, where else should morality come
          from other than from ourselves? And if we change our minds
3
          about what is moral . . . well, so what? From a purely practical
          level, what is wrong with that kind of thinking?

          ●2 Years ago, when asked what the British government could do
          to help citizens be more moral, Prime Minister Harold McMillan
          responded, “I’m only the prime minister. Go talk to the arch-
          bishop.” How could what we have studied this week help church
          members be more moral? Or is it even the purpose of the gospel
          to make us more moral?

          ●
          3 Fiorello Enrico La Guardia was a judge during the hard years
          of the Depression in America. One day, a father was brought into
          his courtroom, having stolen bread. When asked by Judge La
          Guardia why he did it, the man, sobbing, said that it was to feed
          his hungry children. La Guardia told the man, “You have com-
          mitted a crime, you know that?” The man, penitent, barely rais-
          ing his eyes, nodded and said, “Yes, sir.” La Guardia then said,
          sternly, that “the law makes no exceptions.” The man nodded.
          Judge La Guardia then put his hand into his pocket, took out
          $10.00, and said, “Here’s the payment for your fine. I pay it
          myself. Though guilty, you will not face the penalty.” How does
          this story help us understand not only the gospel but also what it
          means to live like Jesus?

Stranger in the Village
by BENJAMIN SCHOUN
   The man watched in horror as his companion’s body floated past him on
the river. He had been killed while trying to enter a restricted region with-
out government permission. Though not a Christian missionary, this man’s
death underscores the difficulty of entering some areas of the world where
the government restricts access to outsiders. One such place is an isolated
area in Asia that is home to tribal people who worship nature and their
ancestors.
   Despite the restrictions against outsiders, the church has learned that a
large number of people living in this area are worshiping God and keep-
ing the Sabbath. A contact person was able to confirm these reports. He
sneaked into the restricted area and entered a large village. The chief con-
firmed the reports that villagers were keeping the Sabbath. “How can that
be?” the informer asked.
   “One day a tall stranger entered my village,” the chief said. “He had an
aura of bright light about him and asked to see the chief. In his hand he
held a radio. He showed me how to tune the radio dial to hear the
Adventist World Radio (AWR) programs. He told me the time of day that
programming is broadcast in our language. Then he told me to share this
information with the village, as it would be a great blessing to them.
   “I picked up the radio and turned to show it to the person on my right.
We turned back to the stranger, but he was gone. We never saw him again.
But we took this as a special sign that we should do what he said.
   “We called the villagers to gather around and listen to the radio pro-
grams. People listened and began changing their lives as they learned
about a new way of living from the broadcasts. Today most of the people
in this village keep the Sabbath.”
   The contact person verified that these villagers are indeed devout
believers who are worshiping while listening to the radio programs. He
also learned that several different tribal groups lived in remote regions of
this mountainous area. The villagers have no contact with one another, for
they are geographically isolated. Yet when the contact person visited six
areas, he found that every chief told the same story. “One day a tall
stranger entered the village carrying a radio. He asked for the chief….”
   God has a thousand ways to bring the gospel light to those whom gov-
ernments would seek to keep in darkness. Your mission offerings help
make the work of Adventist World Radio possible. Thank you.

        LESSON            12 *September 12–18
      John’s Letter to the Chosen
      Lady


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 20:1–17; Rom.
      6:17; 2 Thess. 2:10; Heb. 13:2; 2 John; Rev. 2:14, 15; 14:12.

Memory Text: “Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in
      the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in
      the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son” (2 John 9,
      NASB).
          ohn’s second letter resembles the first one in many respects.

      J   Although shorter, the same vocabulary is used, the same themes
          occur, and the same concern for believers prevails. A personal
      touch is also found in both.
        However, in contrast to the first letter, the second is clearly cast in
      a letter form, with both a formal introduction and conclusion. The
      main body contains praise, an exhortation to love and to walk accord-
      ing to the commandments, and a section dealing with the antichrists.
        The shortness of 2 John, as well as 3 John, may have been dictated
      by the size of a papyrus sheet. If this is true, the apostle must have
      weighed his words carefully as the Holy Spirit moved upon Him to
      write.

The Week at a Glance: What is John’s basic message, and
      how is it like his first one? How does he relate the concept of
      “love” to the concept of “truth”? What is the link between love
      and keeping the commandments? Why does John take the issue of
      false teachings so seriously? Why does John tell members not to
      be hospitable to false teachers?

     In Love and Truth
Read 2 John. What similarities to 1 John do you find in it? What’s
     the essential message?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        A cursory reading of 2 John suggests that the letter is addressed to
     a group of believers (as opposed to a single woman). This makes good
     sense, because in other places in the New Testament the church is por-
     trayed as a woman (Eph. 5:22–32, Rev. 12:1–6). These believers, then,
     are mature Christians, not literal children.

Read 2 John 1–4. What word appears again and again, and how is
     John using it? See also 2 Thess. 2:10.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Notice, too, that John’s use of the word truth is combined with love
     in verses 1 and 3. To understand the nature of true love among
     Christians, a qualifier is needed, namely truth. Love can be interpreted
     in a purely emotional, even sensual and superficial way. Christian love
     is “true” love, love expressed in the context of truth.
        If we talk about truth, we are reminded of God; of Jesus, who is the
     truth (John 14:6); and of the Holy Spirit. As the Holy Spirit is with the
     believers forever (John 14:16), so truth is with them forever (2 John
     2). Both truth and love ultimately point back to God and belong
     together in Christian faith and experience.
        At the same time, truth and love seem to form the main theme of
     2 John. Love is further discussed in verses 5 and 6. Truth is necessary
     to discern deceptions and their results (vss. 7, 8) and to abide in the
     teaching of Christ (vss. 9, 10).

      We often look at the concept of “love” as something good in and
      of itself, regardless of the context. When, however, can love be
      very destructive? Have you ever experienced the reality of how
      love, outside of truth, can be so terrible? How does that experi-
      ence help you better understand the importance of love in the
      context of truth, as opposed to outside it?




                                                                          97

     Walking According to the Command-
     ments (2 John 4–6)
        Verse 4 is an encouragement for both the church and John. It is
     stimulating and encouraging for church members to hear that the elder
     rejoices greatly that they are “walking in the truth” (NIV). It motivates
     them to continue their Christian life “in the truth, just as the Father has
     commanded” (NIV) them. The commandment to walk in the truth may
     be found in 1 John 3:23, where he is calling us to believe in Jesus and
     to love one another.

How are love and the commandments related to each other? See
     2 John 5, 6. Why is this especially important to us as Seventh-day
     Adventists? See also Rev. 14:12.

     _______________________________________________________

       After the rejoicing (vs. 4) comes a request that at the same time is
     an exhortation (vss. 5, 6). John again talks about a commandment (vs.
     5). It is the commandment (singular) to love one another. So, he moves
     from the concept of “commandment” to the concept of “love,” and
     indeed this commandment has love as its content.
       In verse 6 he continues the other way around, namely, with love, and
     moves on to commandments (plural). Love is shown by keeping God’s
     commandments. In other words, we have this commandment, and this
     commandment is to love one another, and we reveal this love by keep-
     ing the commandments.

How does keeping the commandments (Exod. 20:1–17) reveal love for
     one another?

     _______________________________________________________

       How interesting that something such as keeping the law, the rules,
     and the dos and the don’ts would be so closely linked with love. And
     yet, it makes perfect sense. Love isn’t just what we feel; love is what
     we do; it’s how we act; it’s how we relate to others. Though it is more
     than just obeying the Ten Commandments, true love cannot be sepa-
     rated from the principles found in them.

      Think about someone you love. How do you treat that person?
      What things do you say and do that reveal your love? In what
      ways could you even better show your love to that person? How
      does your own selfishness sometimes get in the way of showing
      this love as you know you should?

      Going Beyond the Teaching of Christ
      (2 John 7–9)

Read 2 John 7–9. What is John warning about here? What can be the
      results of falling for the deceptions he’s warning about?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         With verses 7 through 9 we are back to the deceivers and their false
      understanding of Jesus. It seems to be the same situation that we have
      already encountered in 1 John. It is so bad that many people have left
      the church and even have become “deceivers” themselves. Sure, there
      are those who are still walking in the truth (vs. 4), but a shepherd
      mourns for everyone who has left God and His church.
         The antichrists’ views of Jesus differ from the apostles’ teaching.
      Church members have to watch out in order not to be affected by them
      and their false views. John is very clear here, too, that believers can
      lose their way, and that there’s no such thing as “once saved, always
      saved.”

Read 2 John 9. What is he saying about the importance of having cor-
      rect “doctrine”? See also Matt. 16:12; Acts 2:42; Rom. 6:17; Rev.
      2:14, 15.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         John is under no illusion that doctrine does not matter. For him,
      false teaching can lead to the loss of one’s eternal life. Thus, doctrine
      matters!
         In our passage it is obviously the apostles’ teaching about Jesus that
      is being challenged. Those who accept this biblical teaching and faith-
      fully remain in it have the Father and the Son. God the Father and
      Jesus are placed on the same level. The rejection of the teaching about
      Jesus leads to a loss of the relationship with the Father.

       What has been your own experience with false teachers and
       false doctrines? Were you able to see, especially in the begin-
       ning, where these teachings could have led you? What have you
       learned from these experiences that could help others strug-
       gling with something similar?


                                                                           99

      Refraining From Hospitality? (2 John 10, 11)
The Bible sees great value in hospitality (Heb. 13:2, 1 Pet. 4:9). Jesus
      mingled with tax collectors, Pharisees, and others who may not
      always have had their theology or their lifestyle straight. How does
      such a call fit with what John is saying in 2 John 10, 11? See also
      Matt. 10:14, 15; 18:15–17.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Although hospitality is a Christian virtue, there are limitations. If
      hospitality leads to directly or indirectly supporting false doctrines, it
      must be abandoned. In the first century A.D., teachers were traveling
      around, preaching in various places, and staying with church members
      who would provide food and lodging.
        If such a teacher would propagate false doctrines, hospitality would
      be understood as an encouragement of his position and would actually
      help his work. Furthermore, church members who were wavering
      between the apostolic teaching and the false ideas could be puzzled or
      could even make a wrong decision if they saw a prominent church
      member letting a deceiver stay with him or her.
        John is not proposing to hate these people or to avoid any contact
      with them, but we must be aware of the fact that our behavior could
      be understood as endorsement of ideas opposed to truth. If this is the
      case, we must be very careful.
        It has been suggested that in verses 10 and 11 John is concerned not
      so much with the behavior of an individual believer as with that of the
      entire church, and that the “house” mentioned in verse 10 is not a pri-
      vate dwelling place but the place where the church meets for worship.
      The church should not encourage a teacher who preaches heresy.
        In short, to welcome a false teacher would be perceived as encour-
      agement of what he or she presents. Today we may have lost the sense
      of how problematic heresies can be. It is considered by some as judg-
      mental or arrogant even to talk about “heresy” at all, although
      Scripture addresses this topic frequently. John reminds us that there is
      a basic difference between truth and error.

       Think about how your actions impact others. Think about how
       easily your example can influence others for good or for evil.
       What kind of example of Christ do you present? In what ways
       could you do better?

     Communicating With One Another
     (2 John 12, 13)

       With verses 12 and 13 we have reached the end of 2 John. These
     verses form the conclusion of the letter, and they allow us to see John’s
     personal interest in his audience and his desire to meet with these
     believers personally.

Look at what John has written in 2 John 12, 13. What advantages are
     there to speaking face to face, as opposed to a written letter? What
     hint can you find from his expression “that our joy may be full” as
     to why he wanted to meet with them? See also Acts 2:42–47.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The message that John communicates is quite strong. When it
     comes to the antichrists, John leaves no room for negotiation or a
     compromise. We are reminded of Paul’s attitude when he wrote to the
     Galatians (Gal. 1:6–9).
       John may have been able to share his message orally, but there also
     are advantages to a written form of communication:

           • Letters by the apostles were regarded to have special impor-
             tance and authority and were taken seriously.
           • The letter may have reached the audience earlier than a per-
             sonal visit would have. The urgency of the situation demanded
             a quick response.
           • The message was preserved for other churches and later gener-
             ations that found themselves in similar situations.
           • A letter can be drafted very carefully and often can be more
             precise than an oral presentation.
           • The Holy Spirit prompted him to record his message in writing.

       Despite all this, John still wanted to meet with them face-to-face.

      Why is face-to-face contact often so important for developing
      good relationships? What are the advantages of this kind of per-
      sonal contact? What kind of example of personal contact did
      Jesus leave us? How can you improve your face-to-face dealings
      with others?




                                                                         101

    Further Study: Read the following passages: Gal. 2:11–16; 1 Tim.
          4:1–7; 2 Tim. 2:14–19; Rev. 2:1–3, 12–16, 18–25.

             “The apostle teaches that while we should manifest Christian cour-
          tesy, we are authorized to call sin and sinners by their right names—
          that this is consistent with true charity. While we are to love the souls
          for whom Christ died, and labor for their salvation, we should not make
          a compromise with sin. We are not to unite with the rebellious, and call
          this charity. God requires His people in this age of the world to stand,
          as did John in his time, unflinchingly for the right, in opposition to
1         soul-destroying errors.”—Ellen G. White, The Sanctified Life, p. 65.
             “The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not
          be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and honest,
          men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose conscience
          is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will stand for the
          right though the heavens fall.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 57.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●1 Discuss the idea that doctrine, or teaching, is not that impor-
           tant, that what matters is how kind and loving and accepting we
           are. What should we think of this idea?

           ●
           2 Go back over the idea of how obedience to the Ten
           Commandments is an expression of love. Try to imagine what it
3          would be like expressing love while in violation of the principles
           of the Ten Commandments. How well would that work?

           ●3 In class, ask the question “What is truth?” Make sure that the
           members don’t merely give examples of truth but look for a
           working definition, one simple expression that covers the whole
           concept. What can you learn from this exercise?

           ●
           4 What do you do with the question of “calling sin by its right
           name”? How can we deal with wayward members without being
           judgmental or condemnatory? At the same time, are we not
           shirking our Christian duty if we don’t confront brothers or sis-
           ters in the church who are doing wrong? How do we deal with
           this difficult subject?

           ●5 How well does your local church do in the area of hospitality
           in general? How can you help the church do better in that area,
           if need be?

The Red Bible
by KINGSLEY SABENG AMOATENG
   I was born in Ghana and moved to the Netherlands several years ago. I
was a Christian, but I sensed that there must be something more to wor-
shiping God than I was experiencing. I asked God to show me His truth.
   My close friend, who was an Adventist, often invited me to visit his
church. But I was busy on Saturdays. One day while visiting his house, I
found a Bible with a red cover. I opened it and found a section that con-
tained questions and answers. I asked him where he bought the Bible, but
he said he’d gotten it during a series of meetings he’d attended. He offered
to tell me the next time the church held evangelistic meetings so I could
get one.
   I wasn’t interested in attending Adventist meetings, for I thought the
church was strange to worship on Saturdays. But a few months later my
friend told me that the church was planning evangelistic meetings. I agreed
to go, but only to get the Bible. The meetings were shown via video and
satellite. I learned about many different subjects that I’d never thought about
before, such as the state of the dead. And when we studied the Sabbath, I
realized that it wasn’t strange at all. In fact, this was the very truth I had been
praying about for two years. I didn’t get my red Bible, but I got something
so much better—God’s truth and a new church. I asked to be baptized.
   However, my wife and daughter still attended our former church. My
wife asked me why I refused to attend with them, and I told her that I had
found the church that teaches only the Bible. She attended my baptism,
and the next week she came to church with me. On the way home she told
me that maybe this new church did have truth that her church had missed.
However, she continued to attend her church on Sunday and worship with
me on Sabbaths. Then one Sunday morning she didn’t get dressed for
                               church. “Aren’t you going to church this
                               morning?” I asked. “No,” she said, “I’ve
                               decided that your church has the truth.”
                                  God is so wonderful. When the pastor
                               learned that I had wanted one of the red
                               Bibles, he asked his mother to give hers to
                               me. I treasure that Bible, but I treasure my
                               Lord even more.
                                  Your mission offerings have helped grow
                               the church in the Netherlands. Thank you!

        LESSON            13 *September 19–25
      Power Struggle




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 14:13, 14; Mark
      9:35; 1 Cor. 12:7–31; 1 Corinthians 13; Phil. 2:3; 3 John; Rev. 14:6.

Memory Text: “Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is
      good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not
      seen God” (3 John 11, NKJV).

            ower struggles come in various forms. Whether over the rulership

      P     of empires, over companies, or even over religious position and
            authority, the fight for control can be ugly, even violent. In a real
      sense, the great controversy in heaven began with a power struggle—
      Satan seeking the position and authority that belonged only to Jesus,
      the Creator, and not to a creature. Unfortunately, even in the church
      that same spirit can be manifested.
        Third John, the final letter in this series, deals with a power strug-
      gle in one of the early churches. On one side are the apostle John,
      Gaius, and Demetrius. On the other side is Diotrephes, who is trying
      to establish his supremacy. A power struggle in a local church?
      Certainly as Christians today, we don’t face anything similar, do we?

The Week at a Glance: To whom did John write this let-
      ter? What do we know about Gaius and his character that could
      be of value for ourselves? What kind of power struggle was going
      on in the church?

     The Elder and Gaius (3 John 1–4, 13–15)

        This is one of the few letters in the New Testament (along with
     Philemon, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus) that are addressed to an indi-
     vidual person, not to a congregation.
        Interestingly enough, John refers to himself here as an elder (3 John
     1). But John was an apostle, not a local church elder, so why did he do
     that? There are a number of possible reasons, some of which do not
     necessarily exclude each other: (1) The title elder may refer to posi-
     tion, age, or both. In the case of John, the latter use seems to be prob-
     able. (2) By using the title elder, John indicates that the letter is not
     just a letter to a friend but an official communication. (3) The title
     points to respect and authority, which were due its holder. (4) In
     1 Peter 5:1 Peter addresses the elders and calls himself their fellow
     elder, although he is an apostle. John may be following this usage. (5)
     The use of elder by John may point to his humility and collegiality,
     which differs widely from the attitude of Diotrephes.

What do we learn about Gaius in 3 John 1–4?


        John must have had a good relationship with Gaius. He calls him
     beloved and tells him that he truly loves him. Three times derivatives
     of the word to love are used in verses 1 and 2 to describe John’s rela-
     tion to Gaius.

How do we understand what it means, as Christians, to love each
     other? How do we show that love? See 1 Corinthians 13.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       John rejoices that Gaius is walking in the truth; he mentions that
     twice in verses 3 and 4 and says that even brothers who had met Gaius
     were praising his wonderful Christian attitude and lifestyle. John, on
     his part, longs to meet Gaius soon and talk to him personally. The
     greetings to and from Gaius show that there was a larger circle of
     believers who were acquainted with him and who supported him.

      Go over 1 Corinthians 13. How well do you manifest the princi-
      ples that Paul talks about there? In what areas do you do fairly
      well; in what areas could and should you improve?

      Gaius and His Ministry to the Church
      (3 John 5–8)

Read 3 John 5–8 and paraphrase what John is saying. What impor-
      tant lesson is here for us?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         In his second letter John had addressed the issue of hospitality and
      had warned against being hospitable to traveling missionaries who
      were teaching heresy. True believers cannot support antichrists. In
      3 John the apostle comes back to the issue of hospitality. And here he
      stresses that some traveling missionaries needed help. They were
      preaching the gospel for free but needed a place to stay overnight and
      some food. Unlike the heretical missionaries John had already dealt
      with, these missionaries were people dedicated to God in all respects.
         Gaius had supported them and had shown hospitality toward them.
      The missionaries were quite impressed and had mentioned Gaius
      favorably in church.
         What we see here deals not just with hospitality, not just with giving
      someone a place to sleep for the night, but with the whole principle of
      support for the work of ministry and missions. John is thankful that
      Gaius had treated these people as he has. It shows his openness and
      willingness to give of himself for the work of spreading the gospel. In
      this sense, Gaius should be an example to all of us. The Lord has cho-
      sen us, as believers, to spread this truth to the whole world.

Read Revelation 14:6. Who is that angel, and how broad and wide is
      his mission?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         As Christians in general and Adventists in particular, we must be
      aware of our calling to support the work of spreading the gospel
      everywhere in the world. Whatever our position, whatever our role, we
      all can have a part to play.

       How involved are you in helping to spread the truths we have been
       given? What more could you do? How much of your own time,
       money, and pleasure would you be willing to give up for the sake
       of helping others hear the good news of Jesus Christ and the
       promise of His return?

     Diotrephes           (3 John 9, 10)

       “Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, ‘If anyone
     wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all’ ”
     (Mark 9:35, NIV).

What important Christian principle is found in this verse? More
     important, how can we learn to follow it ourselves?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       After having pointed to Gaius and his ministry, John is now ready
     to tackle the problem with Diotrephes, the leader of the church to
     which Gaius belonged. This man was, obviously, a source of many
     problems, and John is determined to deal with him at the right time.

Read 3 John 9, 10. What was the problem with this man? From the
     little information we have, in what ways was he going completely
     against what it means to be a Christian? See also Isa. 14:13, 14;
     Matt. 12:37; 18:3–6; Phil. 2:3.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Whoever this Diotrephes was, he was a problem. Church members
     were being pushed aside or even disfellowshiped for showing basic
     Christian courtesy to others. But this was not all. Probably Diotrephes
     was trying to establish himself as the only leader of the congregation
     or at least as the one in control. He may have confused lust of power
     with zeal for the gospel. Arrogantly he rejected the authority of the
     apostle John and others; Diotrephes even went further and slandered
     John.
       This was a dangerous development, because it sounds as if
     Diotrephes wanted to be independent from those who were overseeing
     the church on a larger scale. Such an attitude had the potential to dra-
     matically change the nature of the church and the role church mem-
     bers would play in the church.

      Might there not be a bit of Diotrephes in all of us? Look at your-
      self. Are you greedy for power? Do you speak out against those
      you don’t like? Most important, are you making the sad mistake
      of automatically assuming that what is best for you personally
      is best for the church as a whole?
                                                                        107

      Bearing Witness About Demetrius
Read 3 John 11. Why would John write this when he did? What
      important point is he making here, especially given the context,
      that of warning about a church leader who was acting contrary to
      the principles of Christ?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Verse 11 is a transitional statement. It builds a bridge between what
      John has said about Diotrephes and what he is going to say about
      Demetrius. Evil has a representative, and this is Diotrephes. The arrogant
      and ambitious leader is clearly identified as belonging to that which is
      evil. On the other hand, a good example for Gaius to follow is Demetrius.

What do we know about Demetrius? 3 John 12.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         There is another Demetrius in Acts 19:23–29. He was the silversmith
      who was responsible for the riot in Ephesus when Paul preached the
      gospel there. Nothing in the text indicates that this is the same person.
         Demetrius was a Gentile Christian. Demetrius supported the apos-
      tle John and may have been one of his associates and one of the trav-
      eling missionaries. John may have wanted him to be present when he
      planned to confront Diotrephes.
         Perhaps the most important principle we can take away from this one
      verse about Demetrius has to do with the power of influence. Read the
      verse again. Who was able to testify about the “faithfulness” of
      Demetrius? It came from many directions. The point is that if we are liv-
      ing a Christian life, if we are faithful, others will know. Others can bear
      witness and testimony to it. And most important, others can be influ-
      enced by it. In the end, one way or another, our life, our existence, sends
      a message, and that message can be a positive or a negative influence.
      This doesn’t mean we are perfect, this doesn’t mean we don’t make mis-
      takes, this doesn’t mean we don’t have room to improve. It means,
      instead, that others are watching us, others are listening to us, and others
      are influenced by us. The question is, What kind of witness do we bear?

       Imagine someone giving a report about you and your Christian
       behavior. What would that person write, and why? Dwell on the
       implications of your answer.

     Leadership Crisis in the Early Church
        Thus, from what we have seen, there was a leadership crisis in at
     least one of John’s churches. According to this letter, the problem here
     concerned not so much theology but rather personal ambition and a
     change in how churches were governed. However, often when a con-
     flict begins, it involves some issues and later moves on to others. So
     here, too, the doctrines of the church may have been affected in the
     long run.
        We noticed a certain kind of power struggle and some desire for
     independence. This is found today in the idea of congregationalism, in
     which local churches try to be completely independent from any gov-
     erning church body and rather strike out on their own. This is not the
     New Testament model.
        Instead, all believers are the people and body of Christ. All believ-
     ers are also part of the royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). All have received
     spiritual gifts, which are necessary for the church (1 Cor. 12:7–31). A
     distinction between laity and clergy is foreign to the New Testament.
     However, God has called some persons to leadership positions in the
     church and has gifted them. These persons should be respected.
     Leaders are not infallible and should not pretend to be. In some cases
     there even may be justified reasons for complaints (1 Tim. 5:19). If the
     leader must be confronted, it should be done carefully and lovingly.
        Leaders must indeed lead, but they also need to be shepherds, and,
     most of all, they need to be examples for the rest of the body of Christ.
     Qualifications for leaders are listed in both the Old and New
     Testaments. The terms overseers and elders are still used interchange-
     ably in the New Testament (Acts 20:17, 28), although this changed
     dramatically in church history when a strict hierarchy was created and
     the church became more or less identical with the so-called clergy.

What can we learn from the following texts about how the church is
     to be governed? Mark 10:42–44; Acts 6:1–7; 15:6, 22–25; 1 Tim.
     4:14; James 5:14.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The New Testament is opposed to chaos and anarchy in the church.
     Leadership is mentioned for the local level, as well as the universal
     church. However, Jesus Himself stressed that leadership in the
     church/churches must be servant leadership. Local churches were
     governed by a group of elders rather than by one person only.
     Decisions were made by involving the entire church or representatives
     of the church.
                                                                         109
                      F RIDAY September 25

    Further Study: Read the following passages on church gover-
          nance/leadership: John 13:1–12; Eph. 4:11–16; 1 Thess. 5:12, 13;
          1 Tim. 1:3, 4; 4:13; 5:22; Titus 1–3; 1 Pet. 5:1–4.

             “Those who are inclined to regard their individual judgment as
          supreme are in grave peril. It is Satan’s studied effort to separate such
          ones from those who are channels of light, through whom God has
          wrought to build up and extend His work in the earth. To neglect or
1         despise those whom God has appointed to bear the responsibilities of
          leadership in connection with the advancement of the truth is to reject
          the means that He has ordained for the help, encouragement, and
          strength of His people.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 444.
             “God has not set any kingly power in the Seventh-day Adventist
          Church to control the whole body or to control any branch of the
2         work. He has not provided that the burden of leadership shall rest
          upon a few men. Responsibilities are distributed among a large num-
          ber of competent men.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
          vol. 8, p. 236.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 Think about power and how power is used. When is power a
           good thing, when is it a bad thing, and how do we know the dif-
3          ference?

           ●
           2 What Christians in your local church could be held up as role
           models? What about them is admirable? At the same time, what
           dangers arise when looking toward any sinner as a role model?

           ●
           3 Have you ever been greatly disappointed by someone you
           regarded as a role model? What lessons did you learn from this
           that could be of value to others? How can we learn from the good
           example of others and yet be protected from disappointment if
           they fail?

           ●
           4 How should a church react when it has a problem in leader-
           ship itself? How can it strike the right balance in dealing with the
           problem firmly, while at the same time showing the grace and
           mercy of Christ?

           ●5 Outside of Jesus Himself, which Bible character is your
           favorite role model, and why? In class, share your answers with
           each other and see what you can learn.

The Thief Who Helped Build
a Church
by BERTIN ADJIGNON
   I live in a small fishing village in Benin, West Africa. We had a small
church until we invited a thief to join us. Francis* was the leader of a
group of bandits who troubled people in the area.
   One Sabbath afternoon as we were going to study the Bible with some
people, we met Francis. We shared our faith and offered to visit him and
study the Bible with him. Some people standing nearby said, “He’s a bandit;
he’ll never change.” But we began visiting Francis, and soon he came to
church.
   We live on the water and travel by canoe. One Wednesday we invited
Francis to ride with us in our canoe to our weekly prayer meeting. Some
town leaders saw Francis in our canoe and stopped us. They arrested Francis
and took him to jail. We went on to prayer meeting, where we prayed for
Francis. Then we visited the mayor and told him that Francis was changing
and was no problem to us. “Once he was a bandit,” I said. “But if you let
him go, you will see that he will change when God touches his heart.”
   The mayor released Francis to us, but he warned us that if Francis stole
again, he would be thrown into prison.
   As the people saw that Francis was changing, their attitudes toward him
changed. Some business people from whom Francis had stolen even offered
him odd jobs and a small stipend to help him survive without stealing. But
the members of his bandit gang wanted Francis back. They begged him and
even threatened to steal the church’s canoe unless Francis came back to the
gang. But Francis refused. “Leave these Christians alone,” he demanded.
   Eventually Francis was baptized and became a leader in the church.
People saw that he truly was converted. One day the mayor told Francis
that he needed someone to purchase supplies to build a new school and
wanted Francis to take the job. So the former thief became a trusted
worker in the village. The church grew after Francis became an Adventist,
and today we have 25 members in our church.
   We don’t have a permanent church building—something that is impor-
tant in a country such as Benin, where voodoo is rampant. We continue to
worship in a thatched-roof building. We have built a foundation and
started on the walls of our new permanent church, building as we can buy
the blocks. Your Sabbath School offerings will help us realize our dream
of having a church that will shine as a light to a dark community leading
others like Francis to the love of God.

2009    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter

          Next quarter’s Bible study guide will center on the nation of
       Israel as it headed into the Promised Land. People on the Move: The
       Book of Numbers by the late Frank Holbrook will show there is
       much to learn from this young nation. Its example should serve as
       a warning to us. But despite the setbacks, delays, and devastating
       judgments, perhaps the most important lesson we can learn from
       this book is that God fulfills His promises.

Lesson 1—A New Order
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Organizing the Army (Num. 1:1, 2)
       MONDAY: The Presence of the Lord (Num. 1:50–54)

       Memory Text—1              Corinthians 10:11

       Sabbath Gem:      God’s order can be seen in the ways He dealt
       with His covenant people. We, too, can learn invaluable lessons
       from the example of the Israelites.

       Memory Text—3              John 1:2

       Sabbath Gem: God’s regulations can protect us from a world
       filled with sin and idolatry just as they did for the Israelites.
