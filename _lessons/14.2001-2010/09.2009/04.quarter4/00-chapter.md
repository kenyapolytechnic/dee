         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of worldwide evaluation committees and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

People on the Move: T
  I
      n the book of Exodus, the Lord described the birth of a nation.
      Exodus and Leviticus detailed the rules and laws for this nation. In
      the book of Numbers (the topic for our quarter), we see another
  dimension of this nation, that of God’s people on the move.
     But not just moving anywhere. They are to go and take possession of
  the land promised to them—promised not because of their inherent
  holiness, not because of their inherent goodness, but because of God’s
  words to their father Abraham centuries earlier: “For all the land which
                              thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed
“Perhaps the most             for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust
important lesson in of the earth: so that if a man can number the
                              dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
Numbers is that               numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the
God will fulfill His length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will
promises.”                    give it unto thee” (Gen. 13:15–17).
                                Directly tied to this promise is another
  aspect of this nation, that of the nation as an army, a mighty army of
  God, a conquering army that cannot be defeated by external enemies
  because the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth, is in their midst.
     And because of God’s presence, they were not only an army, they were
  a holy army and thus were expected to act like one, as well.
     Unfortunately, that isn’t exactly what happened. This mighty, power-
  ful, and conquering army, hovering on the edges of the Promised Land,
  was defeated, not by the Canaanites but from within. Satan knew that as
  long as they obeyed the Lord, as long as they trusted in God and lived by
  faith and obedience to His commandments, he would be helpless against
  them. All he could do, therefore, was use them against themselves.
     And it worked. No wonder Ellen White warned: “We have far more to
  fear from within than from without. The hindrances to strength and suc-
  cess are far greater from the church itself than from the world.”—Selected
  Messages, book 1, p. 122.

The Book of Numbers
    Hence, it should be obvious that, as a people on the move, as a people
 seeking to reach the Promised Land, as a people called out by God, we
 can learn from the book of Numbers. We can learn from how God
 organized the camp and assigned duties to the priests and the Levites. We
 can learn from the festivals and ordinances of the sanctuary service. We
 can learn from their cries about returning to Egypt, which they called “a
 land that floweth with milk and honey.” We can learn from Miriam’s lep-
 rosy, from the twelve spies, from Caleb’s faith, from the intercession of
 Moses, from Korah’s rebellion, and even from Balaam’s recalcitrant don-
 key.
    “These things happened to them as an example, and they have been
 written down as a warning to us, upon whom the end of the ages has
 come. Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing secure should take care
 not to fall. No trial has come to you but what is human. God is faithful
 and will not let you be tried beyond your strength; but with the trial he
 will also provide a way out, so that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor.
10:11–13, NAB). These words contain not just a warning but a prom-
 ise, as well.
    Despite the setbacks, the delays, and the devastating judgments, per-
 haps the most important lesson in Numbers is that God will fulfill His
 promises. Whether He will fulfill them through us, despite us, or with-
 out us at all is, indeed, another question entirely. But they will be ful-
 filled, and that’s for sure.
    In the context of the Cross and the New Covenant, the book of
 Numbers reveals that God has already made His choice regarding us.
 The only question left is, What will be our choice regarding Him?

           LESSON           1      *September 26–October 2



      A New Order




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 15:14–16; Lev.
      10:1–11; Numbers 1–4; Jer. 23:23, 24; John 14:15–18, 23.

Memory Text: “Now all these things happened unto them for
      ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
      the ends of the world are come” (1 Corinthians 10:11).

              Christian struck up a conversation with another man, a profes-

      A       sional biologist. Looking for a way to witness, the Christian
              asked, “Don’t you see the hand of a Creator when you study
      the things that you do?”
        Without missing a beat, the biologist answered, “Wherever you
      look, either outwardly or inwardly, you see order.”
        However much our world has been damaged by sin, we still can see
      the working of our Creator in the design and order of the natural
      world. Even one fanatical Darwinist was forced to admit that nature is
      something that gives “the illusion of design.”
        Illusion? Please. Design and order are real, and they represent the
      hand of our Maker.
        But God’s order doesn’t end merely with nature. It is seen also in
      His dealing with His covenant people, the Israelites, even as they wan-
      dered in the wilderness. This week we’ll look, firsthand, at how God
      organized His people for their sacred calling, and we’ll draw some les-
      sons for ourselves today.

      Organizing the Army
         Having miraculously escaped from Egypt, the multitudes of Israel
      flowed into the wilderness of Sinai. Encamped around the mountain,
      they heard the voice of God proclaiming His will (Exodus 20).
      Despite such an incredible manifestation of God’s power, some fell
      away and worshiped the golden calf (Exodus 32). After that debacle,
      the repentant nation spent time building a portable sanctuary (Exod.
      25:8). The work was completed on the first day of the first month in
      the second year (Exod. 40:17).
         It was in the following month that the Lord proceeded to organize
      the nation more thoroughly (Num. 1:1) than it previously had been.
      And it’s at this point, with the new organization, with this new order,
      that the book of Numbers picks up the sacred story of God’s working
      with His covenant people.

What kind of census did the Lord ask Moses and Aaron to draw up,
      and why? Num. 1:2, 3.


         The Israelites were not a warlike nation. Their occupation had been
      that of shepherds, cattle herding (Gen. 47:3). Furthermore, at this point
      they were recently freed slaves, without weapons or training for war. It
      may seem strange for the Lord now to organize them into troops. But
      it must be remembered that their task involved the displacement of sev-
      eral nations of the most wicked and corrupt people in the Near East,
      including the Amorites and Canaanites. Israel would serve as God’s
      executioners of these nations who had filled the cup of their transgres-
      sions (Gen. 15:14–16). Israel was now a theocracy, directed by God
      Himself, and they were a people, a might army, on the move.
Read Genesis 15:14–16 (see also Deut. 9:5). What’s implied here? How
      can these texts help us understand Israel’s wars with the Amorites?


         At the time of Abraham, God would not allow the Amorites to be
      destroyed. Here God revealed His long-suffering. “The Amorites were
      at enmity against His law; they believed not in Him as the true and liv-
      ing God; but among them were a few good persons, and for the sake
      of these few, He forbore long.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA
      Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1093.

       Many folk are troubled by the Israelite destruction of these peo-
       ple, and understandably so. Why, in cases such as this, in which
       there is much we don’t understand, do we simply need to go by
       faith, trusting in the goodness of God, who has revealed Himself
       to us in Jesus? John 14:9.
                                                                             7

      The Presence of the Lord
To what task was the tribe of the Levites appointed? Num. 1:50–54.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Moses pitched the portable tabernacle in the middle of Israel’s
      encampment. The Levites pitched their tents around it, on all four
      sides. Their presence acted as a kind of barrier, protecting the place
      where God manifested His presence.
        Why was it set up this way? The Bible doesn’t come right out and
      say, yet some important lessons can be learned from this arrangement.
        Yahweh, the living God, was in their midst. He, the Creator, was
      among His people—so what could overcome them if they remained
      faithful? And yet, at the same time, they pitched their tents at a dis-
      tance from the tabernacle (Num. 2:2), and that was because He was
      holy, and so they, as sinners, as fallen beings, could come only so
      close. Thus, on one hand, they had the reality of God’s closeness and
      compassionate care; at the same time, they constantly were reminded
      of His greatness and holiness and that only through mediation could
      they, as sinners, approach a holy God.

What do other Bible writers say about God’s distance (transcen-
      dence) and nearness (immanence) to humanity? Ps. 139:1–10; Isa.
      57:15; Jer. 23:23, 24; John 14:15–18, 23.

         “At all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflictions,
      when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel
      helpless and alone, the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer
      of faith. Circumstances may separate us from every earthly friend; but
      no circumstance, no distance, can separate us from the heavenly
      Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may go, He is always at our
      right hand to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.”—Ellen G. White,
      The Desire of Ages, pp. 669, 670.

       In what ways have you experienced the reality of God’s pres-
       ence, His compassionate care, and closeness? On the other
       hand, what things are you doing that keep you from an even
       deeper intimacy with God?

     Under the Standards
       “So the Israelites did everything the Lord commanded Moses;
     that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the
     way they set out, each with his clan and family” (Num. 2:34, NIV).

Read Numbers 2. Talk about organized religion! What is one thing
     that becomes apparent about how the Israelites were supposed to
     live?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The government of Israel was characterized by a very precise orga-
     nizational structure, seen, for example, in how the Lord had arranged
     for the camp itself to be ordered and where the people were to pitch
     their tents. The Hebrew camp was separated into three great divisions,
     each having its appointed position in the encampment, all based on
     family and tribal ties.
       The position of each tribe in the camp also was specified. Each was
     to march and to encamp beside its own standard. Nothing was left to
     chance. The Lord carefully and precisely had organized the nation.
     And though they were one people, their distinctive family connections
     were not broken.

Read Numbers 2:34. What does this tell us about how, despite the
     clear organizational pattern, the Lord left room for the distinct-
     ness and uniqueness of the various tribes? What lessons can we
     draw from that for ourselves?

     Call to Ministry

       In memory of their deliverance from Egyptian slavery, the death of
     the Egyptian firstborn, and the deliverance of their own under the sign
     of the blood, God requested Israel’s firstborn to be dedicated to Him
     (Exod. 13:2, 12–15).

Giving God our firstborn? That’s very intense. What powerful les-
     son should we take from this about how much we owe the Lord for
     our redemption and deliverance? Why, in this context, are pride
     and self-sufficiency so sinful?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        At Mount Sinai, the Lord did an exchange for the firstborn of all
     Israelites. Instead of them, He would take the Levites in their place
     (Num. 3:12, 13). This act, then, required the numbering of the Levites,
     who until that point had not been numbered with the rest of Israel.
     Moses is told to number the Levite males from a month upward (vss.
     14, 15). To make the exchange, Moses then counted the male firstborn
     Israelite children of a month old and older. Their total came to
     22,273—that is, 273 more firstborn Israelites than there were Levites
     (vss. 39, 43).

What were the extra Israelites to do for their redemption? To whom
     was it given? Num. 3:46–51.


       The Lord also dedicated the Levites to Aaron and his priestly sons
     and descendants; they were to assist in the worship of God and the
     care of the tabernacle. In a sense, they were called to the ministry of
     the church in the wilderness.
       Once the Hebrews reached the Promised Land, the Levites contin-
     ued to be attached to the sanctuary in a variety of tasks (1 Chron.
     23:27–32). Scattered through the tribal areas, some became teaching
     Levites (2 Chron. 17:7–9); others became judges (2 Chron. 19:8–11),
     instructing the people in the ways of God.

      In what ways can you see the Cross, the substitutionary death of
      Jesus (John 3:16), prefigured in these substitutionary rituals?
      What does it mean that Jesus substituted Himself for you? How
      should knowledge of this reality change your life?

     Protecting the Sacred
       In establishing the system of worship at Sinai, God selected one
     family of the Levites to function as priests. This work is laid out in
     Numbers 4. Moses consecrated Aaron as high priest and his four
     sons—Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar—as assistant priests. The
     rest of the tribe of Levi would help the others but would not function
     as priests. It is obvious that every working Levite had his place and
     service, harmoniously working together to preserve and protect the
     sacredness of Israel’s worship system.
       No question, the Levites had been given a solemn responsibility. The
     same with the sons of Aaron, who would function as priests before the
     Lord in the tabernacle. Think about what they were called to do. The
     Lord Himself, the Creator, revealed His presence among them in the
     sanctuary (Num. 14:10, 11), a powerful reminder to them that their
     safety and security existed only in Him, the One who had redeemed
     them from Egypt. These priests were the mediators between a Holy God
     and a fallen people. In their roles, too, of course, they were symbols of
     Jesus, our true High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8).

Read Leviticus 10:1–11. What happened, and what lessons are there
     for us today?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        It is hard to imagine that these young men, given such a sacred
     responsibility and who already had been given so much (see Exod.
     24:9–11), would violate so openly an express command of God.
     However hard and harsh their punishment might seem to us, it only
     underscores the reality of just how sacred the responsibility given them
     was. No doubt others got the message about how seriously the Lord
     expected His commandments regarding the sanctuary to be carried out.
        “To handle sacred things as we would common matters is an offense
     to God; for that which God has set apart to do His service in giving
     light to this world is holy. Those who have any connection with the
     work of God are not to walk in the vanity of their own wisdom, but in
     the wisdom of God, or they will be in danger of placing sacred and
     common things on the same level, and thus separate themselves from
     God.”—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 639.


      Read carefully Leviticus 10:10. How can we today distinguish
      between the holy and the common, between the clean and
      unclean? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.
                                                                          11

    Further Study: The theme of God’s holiness runs like a silver
         thread throughout Scripture. Define it. What relation does it have to
         the believer? Exod. 28:36; Lev. 11:44, 45; Isa. 6:1–7; Heb. 12:14;
         1 Pet. 1:15, 16.

           “Angels work harmoniously. Perfect order characterizes all their
         movements. The more closely we imitate the harmony and order of the
         angelic host, the more successful will be the efforts of these heavenly
         agents in our behalf. If we see no necessity for harmonious action, and
         are disorderly, undisciplined, and disorganized in our course of action,
         angels, who are thoroughly organized and move in perfect order, can-
1        not work for us successfully. They turn away in grief, for they are not
         authorized to bless confusion, distraction, and disorganization. All
         who desire the cooperation of the heavenly messengers must work in
         unison with them. Those who have the unction from on high will in all
         their efforts encourage order, discipline, and union of action, and then
         the angels of God can cooperate with them.”—Ellen G. White,
2        Testimonies to Ministers, p. 28.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Talk about the idea of organized religion. Why are some peo-
          ple so hostile to it? Why, though, is it necessary? At the same
          time, what are the potential problems that it brings? How can we
          learn to work better with the church system, despite the prob-
          lems that arise?
3
          ●2 Talk about your answer to Thursday’s question. In class, make
          a list of what is holy and what is common. How can we know the
          difference? In what ways does our culture impact our under-
          standing of these things? Or our education? How, for instance,
          might the idea of melding Darwinian natural selection with our
          faith be a mixture of the sacred with the profane? What other
          examples can you think of?

          ●
          3 Dwell more on the idea of substitution, as revealed in
          Wednesday’s lesson study. Why is this concept so central to the
          whole plan of salvation? How did, and still does, Jesus function
          as our Substitute, and why is that so important?

    Summary: God is a God of order. Once the tribes were assembled in
         the wilderness before Mount Sinai, He began to organize them around
         the tabernacle. First, Israel’s armies were organized, and the encamp-
         ment of each tribe was selected, as was their order of march. The Levites
         encamped as a barrier around the tabernacle and were given specific
         directions regarding their service in transporting it and erecting it. The
         Holy God was in their midst as Israel was on the move.

The Eager Student
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Lijalem grew up as a farmer’s son in Ethiopia. He was very bright, but his
parents saw no need to send him to high school. After all, why would a farmer
need so much education? But Lijalem had a burning desire to study, and
because his parents recognized his special gifts, they allowed him to enter
secondary school. He was older than most students in high school, but he was
determined to do well.
   The secondary school was some distance from home, so Lijalem rented a
small house in which to live. Every weekend he returned home to see his par-
ents, to serve in his local church, and to help on the farm. When he returned
to school, his mother made sure that he had enough food to last a week.
   Lijalem noticed that many students at the secondary school were Seventh-
day Adventists. He had seen Adventist churches in his neighborhood and
wondered what these people believed. He listened as students shared their
beliefs with him. He was curious about the Sabbath, for traditionally his
church also worshiped on the Sabbath. But over the years the tradition was
set aside in most congregations. Only a few old priests remembered wor-
shiping on Sabbath.
   Lijalem’s Adventist friends invited him to visit the Adventist church in
town, and he accepted the invitation. Soon he was attending regularly. His
friends taught him how to keep the Sabbath, and in time he joined the bap-
tismal class.
   He began telling his family and friends what he had discovered. Some,
including his father, thought he was crazy; but others listened to what he said.
However, when he was baptized, his parents sent him away from his home.
   His friends saw how he was treated and noticed that he did not retaliate
when treated badly. One by one those with whom he had shared his faith fol-
lowed him to the Adventist Church. Today 18 former members of his former
church have joined the Adventist Church. All of these have experienced dif-
ficulties similar to Lijalem. But they are not discouraged.
   Lijalem says that it was the youth of the secondary school that he attended
who prepared the way for him to become an Adventist. After finishing high
school, Lijalem became a lay evangelist. Because of his love for sharing the
gospel, he has been assigned to serve as a Global Mission pioneer in western
Ethiopia. In the first nine months in the field, Lijalem led 15 people to the
Lord.
   Some 85 percent of the Adventists in western Ethiopia are young people.
Adventist youth are reaching out to their friends and bringing them to Christ.
Our mission offering helps provide materials and support for these young
people as they share their faith. Thank you!

          LESSON             2      *October 3–9



      Preparing a People




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 5; 6; Ezek.
      33:15; Luke 19:8, 9; Acts 17:28; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

Memory Text: “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest
      prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth” (3 John 2).

                nless you have been a refugee, you’re probably not going to

      U         relate completely to the situation of the children of Israel. Of
                course, unlike many refugees today, the children of Israel
      wanted to leave Egypt, as opposed to being driven out. Yet still, it must
      have been disconcerting to have left the only land they knew and to be
      wandering in a hostile desert.
         It’s in this context that we better can understand some of the rules
      and regulations given to these people, rules that would help them sur-
      vive in the wilderness. At the same time, though some things were
      ended after they finally entered the Promised Land (such as the
      manna), many regulations remained because in them were principles
      that, if followed, greatly would have blessed their lives in a world
      filled with sin and idolatry.
         This week we’ll look at some of the provisions that the Lord insti-
      tuted for His ancient people, which includes such things as how to
      deal with some sickness and disease, how to deal with marital infi-
      delity (or the fear of it), and how to deal with the personal clashes that
      inevitably arise when people live together.

     Disease Control
        Imagine the scene of ancient Israel in the wilderness desert before
     Mount Sinai. Thousands upon thousands of nomads with their cattle,
     miles away from any kind of civilization. What kind of medical facili-
     ties did they have at their disposal? None. And considering how medi-
     cine often was practiced back then, they might have been better off
     anyway. Nevertheless, in such an environment, how easily an epi-
     demic of one sort or another could spread.

What three classes of people did the Lord command Moses to “put
     out of the encampment”? Num. 5:1–4.


        Apparently, anyone with a serious skin disease might be designated
     a leper. True leprosy (now called Hansen’s disease) also was included
     in this class. Any infectious skin disease would be regarded as a dan-
     ger to the community. So, also a bloody flux or discharge or the han-
     dling of a decaying corpse in the desert heat might spread disease of
     epidemic proportions through the camp. Both men and women were
     expelled until, if possible, they improved in health. The Lord didn’t
     hate these physically impaired persons, but for the sake of the health
     of the nation, He separated them to an area outside the camp, a kind
     of quarantine. Even in modern times we have special wards in hospi-
     tals for persons with infectious diseases.

For what theological reason were these impaired persons removed for
     a time from the nation’s encampment? Num. 5:3, last phrase. What
     spiritual message can we take away from this for ourselves?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Look at this whole thing from a spiritual perspective, from the idea
     of defilement, of sin, and of what sin does to us. What believer hasn’t
     experienced the reality of how sin separates a person from the sense
     of God’s presence? Who hasn’t experienced the sense of spiritual iso-
     lation that comes from being defiled before God?

      What things are we watching, reading, eating, doing, or even
      thinking that make us feel as if we are exiled spiritually out of
      the camp? More important, what’s the only solution to this
      problem? 1 John 1:8, 9.
                                                                         15

     Social Control
        It is difficult for us today to grasp the enormous problems entailed
     in the migration of thousands of people together with herds and flocks
     of cattle and sheep. Now they are packed into the wilderness before
     Mount Sinai. The physically impaired had been removed for the sake
     of the nation’s health. But another serious problem needed to be
     addressed. Although they were being instructed to “love” one another
     (Lev. 19:18), as anyone who lives in a community knows, that’s not
     always so easy. Even in the best of times, conflicts arise.

When an Israelite sinned against a person in the camp, whom did he
     or she really sin against? Num. 5:6; see also Ps. 51:3, 4. How do we
     understand this concept?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        To wrong our neighbor is to sin against God Himself. In one sense
     this shouldn’t be that hard to understand. We all belong to God; we are
     all His property, both by creation and by redemption (1 Cor. 6:19, 20;
     Acts 17:28). If someone were to come onto your property and damage
     it, the sin wouldn’t be just against the property itself as much as
     against you, the one who owns it. It works the same way when we sin
     against someone else; we are sinning against the One who created that
     person and who, at the cross, bought that person back with His own
     blood. No wonder, then, that the Bible expresses this idea that by sin-
     ning against others we are sinning against God Himself.

What was the guilty person to do? Num. 5:6–8; see also Ezek. 33:15
     and Luke 19:8, 9.

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Though the principle of righting wrongs with other people still
     applies today, how do we right the wrong we have done to God,
     against whom we’ve sinned, as well? The fact is, we can’t. It’s way too
     late for us to make ourselves right with God. That’s, of course, why
     Jesus came: to set us right with God, not through anything we could
     do but only through what Jesus has done for us (Col. 1:20).

      Keeping in mind what Jesus has done to make things right
      between you and God, what do you need to do to make things
      right with someone whom you might be in conflict with?

     Marital Fidelity
       The Creator established the marriage bond in Eden by creating
     humankind in two sexes and celebrating the first union (Gen.
     1:26–28, 2:21–24). Two precepts of the Decalogue, the seventh and
     the tenth, protected the institution of marriage. In the theocracy, infi-
     delity was punishable by the death of both parties (Lev. 20:10).

Read Numbers 5:11–31. How are we to understand this today?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Lord, obviously, wanted to stress how seriously He took the
     whole question of marital infidelity, which is by far the greatest threat
     to family stability.
        In this procedure, which obviously included a supernatural ele-
     ment—the focus was on the drink. The water was holy; so was the
     ground from which the priest took a pinch of dust. Holy water and
     dust didn’t embitter the water; it simply underscored its holiness. The
     written judgments/curses that were washed off into the water symbol-
     ized its potential bitterness. “Everything depended on whether the
     woman was holy (guiltless) or unholy (guilty). If the holy met the
     unholy, judgment was inevitable. If the holy met the guiltless, har-
     mony prevailed.”—Raymond Brown, The Message of Numbers
     (Leicester, England: InterVarsity Press, 2002), p. 46.
        This procedure (strange to us) was not an instance of magic. Rather,
     it was a concrete visual aid that ex-slaves could grasp. It was not the
     water but the Lord who read the wife’s heart and who punished or
     cleared her.

How was this procedure also a protection for the woman, who could
     be the victim of a husband’s unwarranted jealousy?


       However strange this whole thing seems to us today, the point it
     brings out is how important the marriage vow is in the eyes of God.
     God alone knows just how much pain, suffering, and damage has been
     caused by marital infidelity by one partner or another. What a tragedy
     that in so many societies marriage vows seem to hold about as much
     sanctity as a handshake.

      What things can you do, what choices can you make, to enable
      you to have a pure heart?

                                                                          17

     Consecrated Commoners
        God purposed to organize Israel in the broadest sense to be for Him
     “a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation” (Exod. 19:6). They would
     thus witness to the nations far and near about the truths concerning the
     living God and the Creator of all things. However, at Sinai the Lord
     especially appointed priests and Levites to serve Him in connection
     with the sanctuary-tabernacle worship.

What vow could a commoner (woman or man) take to devote a spe-
     cific period of time to the Lord? Num. 6:1–21. What spiritual les-
     sons can we take from this for ourselves today, in the context of
     deepening our own spirituality and our commitment to the Lord?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       A Nazirite was a “consecrated one” who purposed to dedicate him-
     self or herself to the Lord for a varying length of time. A parent could
     dedicate a child to be a lifetime Nazirite. For example, Samson’s
     mother dedicated her son according to the instruction of an angel,
     with the intent that he would begin to deliver Israel from the
     Philistines (Judg. 13:2–5, 16:17). Likewise, the angel Gabriel
     instructed Zacharias to rear John (the Baptist) as a Nazirite for his
     service as the forerunner of the Messiah (Luke 1:15). Hannah also
     vowed Samuel to be a lifelong Nazirite (1 Sam. 1:10, 11).
       Interesting, too, is the injunction about drink. The vineyard, and its
     products of juice, wine, and grapes represented to the ancient mind a
     cultivated land of farms and homesteads. When the Nazirites wouldn’t
     drink from the vineyard, they were expressing in a concrete way their
     belief that they were heading to a better land. The vineyard symbol-
     ized the settled life; the Nazirite, however, by the way he lived, showed
     in a concrete way a desire for “a better country, that is, an heavenly:
     wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath pre-
     pared for them a city” (Heb. 11:16).

      How do we, as Seventh-day Adventists, live in anticipation of a
      better country, regardless of whatever country we are living in
      now? What are concrete ways that we can protect ourselves
      from getting so caught up with our vineyards here that we lose
      sight of our final destination?

      The Aaronic Prayer
        “The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: The Lord make his face
      shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: The Lord lift up his
      countenance upon thee, and give thee peace” (Num. 6:24–26).


After reading carefully the above blessing, answer the following ques-
      tions:

      • How is the nature of the Godhead hinted at here? Matt. 28:19.

      _______________________________________________________

      • How does this prayer reveal Israel’s total dependence upon God?
      John 15:5.

      _______________________________________________________

      • What significance is there to the fact that the priests themselves
      were the ones to pray this prayer on behalf of the people? Heb. 7:25.

      _______________________________________________________

         There are several points of interest here. Each of the lines begins
      with God’s personal, covenant name (Yahweh, Lord). The congrega-
      tion addressed is in the singular number. That is, each person was
      talked to as an individual. Each person could know what the blessing
      meant personally, individually. That is, no matter how much of a com-
      munity Israel was, each one could have a personal relationship with
      the Lord.
         Israel had no Scriptures at this time. The Lord’s blessings would be
      seen in their deliverance from slavery, the crossing of the Red Sea, and
      the provisions made for their food and water. His keeping power
      would have been seen by His presence in the sanctuary, whose ritual—
      burnt offering, incense, and menorah—always burned day and night.
         Here is clear evidence that Old Testament religion was all of grace
      (Gal. 3:7–14; Heb. 4:1, 2). The third line assures the believer of God’s
      smile and peace (see Matt. 11:28–30).

       How have you experienced the blessings listed above in your own
       life? What things might you be doing that are making it difficult
       to see these things realized in your walk with God? What
       changes, no matter how painful, must you make?

    Further Study: “Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make
         this your very first work. Let your prayer be, ‘Take me, O Lord, as
         wholly Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy serv-
         ice. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.’ This is a
         daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day.
         Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as His
         providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life
         into the hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and
         more after the life of Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 70.
            “Circumstances may separate friends; the restless waters of the
1
         wide sea may roll between us and them. But no circumstances, no dis-
         tance, can separate us from the Saviour. Wherever we may be, He is at
         our right hand, to support, maintain, uphold, and cheer. Greater than
         the love of a mother for her child is Christ’s love for His redeemed. It
         is our privilege to rest in His love, to say, ‘I will trust Him; for He gave
         His life for me.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 72.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Though we all know the dangers of getting too caught up in
          the things of this world, and losing sight of our real home, is it
          possible to be so wrapped up in our desire for heaven that we
          shirk our responsibilities here? If so, how? How can we strike the
          right balance in this important topic? What examples can you
3
          think of in which people have gone too far in their anticipation of
          heaven at the expense of their responsibilities here?
          ______________________________________________________
          ●
          2 What are some of the stresses and strains that your particu-
          lar society places on marriage? How can your church, in that
          society, deal with these challenges in a way that protects the God-
          given sanctity of marriage?
          ______________________________________________________
          ●
          3 In class, talk about situations in which you were wrong, or
          wronged someone else, and how you were able to resolve the
          problems. What lessons did you learn from these experiences?
          How do you deal with situations in which it appears that the
          wrongs are all but unforgivable?
          ______________________________________________________
    Summary: The Lord would have His people happy and at peace.
         Physical and spiritual wholeness are obtained by loving obedience to
         His laws of life, kind relationships with spouse and neighbors, and
         daily consecration of the will to the Father. This doesn’t mean that life
         is always easy in this sin-cursed earth, but it can be improved greatly
         if we seek to walk in His paths.

God’s Thousand Ways
by SUMIKO SAKAMOTO
   God has a thousand ways to lead someone to Jesus. I know because He
used several ways to lead me to Him.
   Like most people in Japan, I was not a Christian. In university my short-
hand teacher encouraged us to attend lectures and take shorthand notes to
practice. So when I saw an advertisement about a seminar in town, I decided
to go. I didn’t know that the meetings were religious meetings. I simply sat
down and waited for the speaker to begin.
   I found the lectures interesting and attended every night. After all, it was
homework. When a girl my age asked if I would like to study the Bible, I
agreed. As I studied the Voice of Prophecy correspondence course I became
convinced that God exists and that He loves me and wants a relationship with
me. The Bible course led me to the Adventist church, and I was baptized.
   It was easy to be a Christian in church, but outside of church I had prob-
lems and began to doubt whether I really was a Christian. Eventually I
stopped attending church, but I never stopped believing in God.
   After university I found a job. A colleague, a young man, visited my home
and saw the Voice of Prophecy course on my bookshelf. He looked through
the lessons and asked if what they said was true. I assured him that it was
true, and he asked if he could study the Bible lessons. I offered to take him
to evangelistic meetings, and because he wanted to attend all of them, I felt
obligated to go as well. Once more I was grounded in my faith. My friend
asked to be baptized.
   I attended the church because my friend wanted to go. We found the young
people’s class enjoyable. As we grew in faith, we also discovered we were
more than friends. Eventually we married.
   My husband was active in the church in addition to his heavy work sched-
ule. One day he suddenly became seriously ill and was rushed to the hospi-
tal. I rushed to the hospital, praying all the way that he would be alive when
I arrived. He was, but the doctors said he was critically ill.
   During the next few weeks I prayed constantly for him. Prayer strength-
ened my faith and expanded to include family, friends, and colleagues. I real-
ized how fragile life is, and daily I committed my life and my family to God.
   I realize that God turned my husband’s illness into a blessing. We have
learned that our lives are in God’s hands. Now we host a small-group meet-
ing in our home where others can learn God’s precious message of love.
Thank you for giving your mission offerings so that people such as we can
experience and share God’s love.

          LESSON            3       *October 10–16


      Worship and
      Dedication


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 25:22; Numbers 7;
      8; Zech. 4:1–6, 11–14; Rev. 4:2, 5; 11:4.

Memory Text: “Every man according as he purposeth in his
      heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God
      loveth a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians 9:7).

              o question, the children of Israel are separated from our mod-

      N       ern world through the vast gaps of time and culture. Their
              world is, in many ways, as incomprehensible to us as ours
      would be to them.
        Nevertheless, the unifying factor is the Lord, the One who created
      and redeemed them, as well as us. Whatever the gaps in culture, lan-
      guage, and history, we worship the same God, no matter the differ-
      ences in our forms and expressions. Indeed, the basic truths taught to
      them through their rites and rituals are, in principle, the same ones we
      are to learn today.
        This week we’ll continue to follow our spiritual ancestors on their
      journey of faith. We’ll examine more of the rituals, laws, and com-
      mands that God gave His people at that time. Among other things,
      we’ll look at the dedication of the altar of burnt offering, at the meno-
      rah (lampstand) in the earthly sanctuary, as well as the ordination of
      the Levites to their sacred calling of working with the priests in their
      ministration of the sanctuary in the wilderness.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, October 17.

     Altar Dedication
        In the wilderness sanctuary, the sacrifices centered on the altar of
     burnt offering. Constructed of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, the
     altar stood within the courtyard near the entrance to the two-apartment
     sanctuary. The golden altar before the veil of the Most Holy Place
     served only for the burning of incense.

Read Numbers 7. What thoughts come to your mind as you read
     about the offerings given during this solemn ritual? What spiri-
     tual points from this account can be applied to ourselves today?
     For instance, where do you see the Cross represented here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________


        The altar already had been consecrated for seven days (Exod.
     29:37). Now the princes—as representatives of the full nation—
     brought offerings to celebrate the dedication of the altar over a period
     of 12 days. Each prince and his tribe had their special day. All the gifts
     were identical; perhaps this was a way of showing that no matter who
     we are or our station in life, we all stand before God in the same posi-
     tion, that of sinners needing grace.
        “The Jews saw in the sacrificial offerings the symbol of Christ
     whose blood was shed for the salvation of the world. All these offer-
     ings were to typify Christ and to rivet the great truth in their hearts that
     the blood of Jesus Christ alone cleanseth from all sin.”—Ellen G.
     White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 106, 107.

      It’s so easy to get caught up in the things of the world, isn’t it?
      What can you do each day to help keep the reality of the Cross,
      and what was done for you there, first and foremost in your mind?

      Communion With God
        As a symbol, the ark was at the hub of Israelite worship. It symbol-
      ized God’s heavenly throne. “The Lord of hosts . . . sits enthroned on
      the cherubim” (2 Sam. 6:2, RSV). In the Most Holy Place, the visible
      Shekinah glory, hovering between the cherubim, represented the
      Lord’s presence. The Ten Commandments beneath the cherubim
      throne attested to the Divine will, the foundation of the covenant
      between God and His people—and the moral basis for His universal
      rule and government. The law provided the worshipers an insight into
      the character of God, in addition to stipulating His righteous require-
      ments.

Read Exodus 25:22 and Numbers 7:89. Try to imagine what kind of
      an experience this would be. How would you like to have that kind
      of close encounter with God? What makes you think that you
      wouldn’t be destroyed completely were you to get too close to
      Him? See Exod. 20:19.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

In what sense can you today get even closer to the presence of God? See
      Heb. 4:14–16. How has Jesus made this approach possible?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Notice, too, how Moses had gone into the sanctuary to speak to the
      Lord. Yet, according to the text, the Lord spoke to Moses instead. The
      point is, most of us know how to pray, most of us know how to speak
      to the Lord, to plead our case, to ask for this or that.
        But communion isn’t just one way. In most relationships, each party
      will communicate with the other. Should it be any different between
      us and our Maker? Of course not.
        The question for us, then, is, How open are we to hearing the voice
      of God when He is speaking to us?

       What have your experiences in communion with God been like?
       How has the Lord communicated His will to you? How open are
       you to hearing His voice? What things in your life might be
       keeping you from a fuller communion with the Lord?

     Light in the Sanctuary
        When Moses entered the sanctuary after the 12 days devoted to the
     dedication of the altar in the court, we may assume that it was dark
     inside the Holy Place. In that conversation, the Lord directed that
     Aaron should light the seven lamps of the “candlestick,” known in
     Hebrew as the menorah, based on the Hebrew word or, for light (Num.
     8:1–4).
        The menorah (or candlestick) with its main shaft and six branches
     (three on either side) was hammered from a single talent of gold. It
     was in the form of a stylized almond branch (Exod. 25:31–40). The oil
     lamps, resting atop each branch, were attended by the priests twice a
     day—morning and evening (Exod. 30:7, 8). “[Aaron] shall keep the
     lamps in order upon the lampstand of pure gold before the Lord con-
     tinually” (Lev. 24:4, RSV; emphasis added).

What insights do the following texts give as to the meaning of the
     menorah?

     Zech. 4:1–6, 11–14
     ____________________________________________________________________


     Rev. 4:2, 5; 11:4
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Zechariah’s vision implies that the oil piped to the menorah lamps,
     enabling them to burn, is God’s Spirit (vss. 5, 6). The Hebrew word for
     the almond (Jer. 1:11, 12) means “to watch” or “to wake.” The almond
     literally was named the “wake tree” or “watch tree” because it was the
     earliest tree “to waken” and flower. John sees in the heavenly repre-
     sentation of the sanctuary a menorah of seven lamps of fire burning
     before the throne, which are identified as “seven Spirits of God”—
     John’s mode of referring to the Holy Spirit in His multiple operations.
        Thus, Israel in the wilderness was assured day and night of God’s
     presence in the first apartment, as well as in the second.

      How has the Lord shown you the reality of His presence in your
      own life? Go back over those times when clearly you’ve experi-
      enced God’s presence in a remarkable manner. How can revis-
      iting these experiences help you to stay firm in times that you
      feel yourself wallowing in fear and darkness? See Psalm 23.

     Dedication of the Levites: Part 1
Read Numbers 8:6–26, describing the dedication of the Levites to
     their special work in the service of God. What points impress you
     regarding this service? What does this teach us about holiness,
     about sin, about purification, and about dedication to God? What
     principles can we take away from this for our lives today, regard-
     less of whatever role we play in the Lord’s service?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The families of the three divisions of the Levites were encamped
     around the sanctuary. Because they numbered more than 20,000
     (Num. 3:39), it is obvious that some parts of their dedication were
     done by symbolic representation. That is, only certain ones, represen-
     tatives, as opposed to all the Levites, were involved directly and
     immediately.
        What’s fascinating here, too, is the idea that the Levites—after they
     were cleansed and shaven, and after they offered a sin offering (Num.
     8:7, 8)—were called an “offering” or a “wave-offering” (vs. 11). This
     certainly wasn’t anything related to human sacrifice. Instead, it gave
     the idea of dedication, of consecration, and of acknowledgment that
     these Levites were going to be doing a work in behalf of Israel, doing
     for them what they couldn’t be doing for themselves.
        This is seen even more when Moses said that “the children of Israel
     shall put their hands upon the Levites” (vs. 10), acknowledging that
     these responsibilities had been passed on to the Levites. The tribe as a
     whole was offered as a living sacrifice to God, who in turn gave them
     as a gift this special ministry in the sanctuary in place of the firstborn,
     whom they now represented.

      Keeping the principles in mind seen in this ceremony, how do we
      understand what Paul says in Romans 12:1? How can we be a
      “living sacrifice”? What does that mean in our daily lives?

     Dedication of the Levites: Part 2
        “For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
     Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the
     firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me”
     (Num. 8:16).

        Notice how emphatic the Lord was regarding the special calling of
     the Levites. They were “wholly given” to Him. The Hebrew reads
     more literally that they are “given given to me,” emphasizing by repe-
     tition just how serious their calling was.

Read Numbers 8:19. What is meant by the phrase that the Levites
     were to “make an atonement for the children of Israel”? How are
     we to understand this in light of the Cross? Rom. 5:11, Heb.
     9:25–28.

       Scholars are divided on the precise meaning of the phrase here.
     Obviously, it does not mean “to make atonement” in the sense of
     dying for the sins of others. The verb translated “make atonement” in
     this context has a broader meaning than how it’s commonly used. In
     this case, the answer could be found in the same verse, in which it says
     that the Levites, by doing their service on behalf of Israel, would spare
     them from the plague. That is, in their work of ministry, they were
     helping protect the children of Israel from the Divine wrath that they
     would face were they to come “nigh unto the sanctuary” (Num. 8:19).
       Thus the Levites, like the priests themselves, were doing something
     on behalf of the people that they couldn’t do themselves. In this looser
     sense, then, they were said to “make an atonement” for the people.

      Though certainly nothing we do can make any kind of atone-
      ment, how can we, by faithfully doing our duties, work as the
      Levities did on behalf of the people? What are you doing in your
      local church for the betterment of the church and its mission?

    Further Study: Trace the ancient Jewish custom of “laying on
         hands.” What seems to be its essential significance? Gen. 48:8, 9, 13,
         14, 17–20; Num. 27:18–23; Matt. 19:13–15; Acts 13:1–3.

            “To the Jew this form was a significant one. When a Jewish father
         blessed his children, he laid his hands reverently upon their heads.
         When an animal was devoted to sacrifice, the hand of the one invested
         with priestly authority was laid upon the head of the victim. And when
         the ministers of the church of believers in Antioch laid their hands
         upon Paul and Barnabas, they, by that action, asked God to bestow His
1        blessing upon the chosen apostles in their devotion to the specific
         work to which they had been appointed.
            “At a later date the rite of ordination by the laying on of hands was
         greatly abused; unwarrantable importance was attached to the act, as
         if a power came at once upon those who received such ordination,
         which immediately qualified them for any and all ministerial work.
2        But in the setting apart of these two apostles, there is no record indi-
         cating that any virtue was imparted by the mere act of laying on of
         hands.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 162.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In what way does the local pastor today function in the role of
          the Levite? What can we do to support the pastor in this role?

          2 How does the act of giving impact our relationship with God?
          How is giving from our income an act of worship, of faith? Why
          is it so important to give generously?

          ______________________________________________________

          ●
          3 What is our understanding of what Jesus did on the cross for
          us that we could not do for ourselves? Why did Jesus have to die?
          Couldn’t just reforming our lives and obeying the law and loving
          others unconditionally be enough to make us right with God?

          ______________________________________________________

    Summary: The forms of ancient Israel’s worship differ from that of
         the modern church in the world’s wilderness, but its substance is the
         same. Dedication of our material goods, contemplation of the mean-
         ing of the Cross, prayer, reflecting the light of the indwelling Holy
         Spirit, and total dedication to the Lord all spell out the same biblical
         faith.

Mom’s Powerful Prayers
by NASTYA BYKOVA
   I am the youngest child and the only girl in my family. When I was grow-
ing up, I remember that my mother had an overpowering fear that I would
die. Her fears were so immobilizing that she couldn't even sleep at night.
Although we were not a religious family, my mother’s fears drove her to pray
and beg God to save my life.
   She decided she would do anything to keep me safe, so she started going
to different churches and even to magicians, looking for help. Then an
Adventist pastor came to hold meetings in our town. Mother went and lis-
tened intently. She was amazed at what the preacher said. She asked the pas-
tor to pray for her, and her fears disappeared. She devoted her life to Jesus
from that day.
   My mother had enjoyed a career as a professional dancer, but she laid it
aside when she met Jesus. Her actions shocked my father, but he never com-
plained. My brothers, who also were dancers, found it hard to give up danc-
ing to follow Christ, but Mother never stopped praying for them until they
all had given their lives to Christ.
   With Mom no longer dancing, we lived on Father’s income. Money was
tight, and often we could barely pay the bills. One day we had only some
stale bread in the house. Mother gathered us around and prayed, asking God
to provide. That evening we heard a knock on the door. It was the pastor,
holding two large bags of groceries and soap. My father was so surprised
when he learned that God had answered our prayer for food.
   God has continued to answer our prayers. He made a way for me to study
at Zaoksky Adventist University when my parents couldn’t possibly afford
to send me. After I graduated from high school I received an e-mail from
some people I had translated for. They wanted to pay my school fees for one
year. After that God provided translating jobs that paid my school fees until
                              I finished my studies.
                                 My mother’s fear drove her to God, who took
                              away the fear and replaced it with great faith.
                              Since then her prayers have kept us all close to
                              Him. I believe that God has a special purpose
                              for my life, and I am happy to follow Him and
                              to live my life by prayer.
                                 Thank you for giving your mission offerings.
                              They lead thousands like my mother to Christ
                              every year.

      Trumpets, Blood, Cloud,
      and Fire




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 12:1–29; Numbers
      9; 10; Matt. 26:36–43; Luke 22:15, 19, 20; 1 Cor. 15:52.

Memory Text: “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may
      be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover
      is sacrificed for us” (1 Corinthians 5:7).

              t the last Passover that Jesus ate with His disciples, He insti-

      A       tuted the Lord’s Supper. Taking some of the same elements of
              the Passover meal, Jesus said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And
      of the cup, He said, “This is my blood of the new testament, which is
      shed for many for the remission of sins” (Matt. 26:26–29). And Paul
      wrote: “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
      shew the Lord’s death till he come” (1 Cor. 11:26).
         The Lord’s Supper is the Christian Passover, the New Testament
      parallel to Israel’s deliverance from Egypt. This week we’ll look at
      Israel’s first anniversary of that deliverance. We’ll look also at the
      Lord’s guiding presence among the camp of the Israelites, as well as
      the silver trumpets that were blown at certain times, and a few other
      accounts that reveal the situation of God’s ancient people in their
      unique circumstances.
         As always, we’ll look for lessons that we can take for ourselves as
      we face, in our time and context, some of the same kinds of trials and
      temptations that they did, no matter how radically different the cir-
      cumstances.

     In Remembrance of Me
Read Numbers 9:1–5 and Exodus 12:1–29. What spiritual truths can
     we take away from these accounts for ourselves? As you read,
     think, for example, about such things as obedience, grace,
     redemption, faith, and judgment.

       This was the first anniversary of the amazing night in Egypt when
     the Lord’s angel slew the firstborn of the Egyptians but “passed over”
     (hence the name Passover) the dwellings of Israel marked by the blood
     of the sacrificial lamb. Now, in what was to be an annual ritual, they
     were to remember the night of their special deliverance from Egypt
     and the salvation that God had wrought in their behalf.

How are the followers of Jesus to commemorate the Passover today?
     Luke 22:15, 19, 20. What is this service to remind us of?

        “Christ was standing at the point of transition between two
     economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb of God,
     was about to present Himself as a sin offering, that He would thus
     bring to an end the system of types and ceremonies that for four thou-
     sand years had pointed to His death. As He ate the Passover with His
     disciples, He instituted in its place the service that was to be the
     memorial of His great sacrifice. The national festival of the Jews was
     to pass away forever. The service which Christ established was to be
     observed by His followers in all lands and through all ages. . . .
        “The ordinance of the Lord’s Supper was given to commemorate the
     great deliverance wrought out as the result of the death of Christ. . . .
     It is the means by which His great work for us is to be kept fresh in
     our minds.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 652, 653.

                                                                           31
               M ONDAY October 19

     The Guiding Presence
       One of the most wonderful assurances that Israel had in the wilder-
     ness was the visible sign of God’s presence, as manifested in the most
     remarkable way: the cloud by day and the fire by night.
       Think about it. Composed of perhaps two million people living in a
     barren and dangerous wilderness, the camp must have spread out for
     many miles in all directions. With no means of instant and direct com-
     munication (no radio, telephone, Internet), there had to be some way
     of letting them know when and where they were to go.

Read Numbers 9:15–23. How did this manifestation of God’s pres-
     ence reveal to them God’s will, at least in terms of their move-
     ment?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The Lord’s leading of Israel by means of the visible cloud was not
     always through easily traveled highways. Jeremiah records that He led
     them “through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits,
     through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land
     that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt” (Jer. 2:6).
       But there’s a deeper issue here than just where and when to go. The
     existence of the cloud by day and the fire by night was also a very
     powerful reminder to them of God’s abiding presence. According to
     Numbers 9:16, “So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
     appearance of fire by night.” No matter where they were, what trials
     they would face, what foes they would meet, there—hovering in the
     sky—was a visible marker of God’s presence among them.
       It must have been nice to have had that. This cloud and fire certainly
     would have been more than enough to keep them faithful, trusting,
     and obedient to God, right?

      When seeking to make a decision about where to go, how often
      have you wished you had a cloud by day and a fire by night to
      guide you? What promises, though, can you find in the Bible of
      God’s willingness to lead us, and to be present among us even
      today? What choices can you make that will enable you to be
      more open to God’s leading and more aware of His presence?

     Silver Signals
       Ancient Israel had two kinds of horns: the common ram’s horn (the
     shofar), and the two silver metal horns that essentially belonged to the
     sanctuary and were blown only by the priests (Num. 10:8). The latter
     were made of hammered work, each wrought from one piece of metal.
     The silver horn was like a long tube, flared on one end.

Read Numbers 10:1–10. What was the purpose of the blowing of
     these trumpets? What kind of spiritual lessons can be drawn from
     the use of these trumpets?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The blowing of these silver trumpets carried a meaning in addition
     to their more practical applications. Their blowing was to be consid-
     ered an “ordinance.” In war it assured them that they would “be
     remembered before the Lord your God,” and they would be saved
     from their enemies (vs. 9). Thus, the sounding of these horns served
     as “a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God” (vs. 10).
       How interesting, then, that even with all the manifestations of God’s
     leading, guiding, and presence, the Lord used these trumpets, too, in
     order to remind Israel of His presence and care. Both by sight (the
     cloud and the fire) and by sound (the trumpets) they were given spe-
     cial reminders of God’s guidance and presence among them.
       Today, we don’t have the cloud, the fire, or the silver trumpets to
     remind us of God’s guidance and presence. We do, though, have the
     New Testament revelation of what God has done for us through Jesus,
     which gives us an assurance of His love and care that ancient Israel
     couldn’t have appreciated fully. They knew, only in types and shad-
     ows, what we now have in reality, and that is the knowledge of God’s
     love as revealed through the Cross.
       What would you rather have: a silver trumpet bellowing in your ears
     or the knowledge of the love, the character, and care of the One who,
     “being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
     God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
     of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in
     fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto
     death, even the death of the cross”? Phil. 2:6–8.

      What one trumpet sound do you really want to hear, and why?
      1 Cor. 15:52.

     “Be to Us Eyes”
       After Sarah’s death, Abraham remarried. Keturah bore him a num-
     ber of sons, one named Midian (Gen. 25:1–6). Jethro (also named
     Reuel [Exod. 2:18], friend of God) became Moses’ father-in-law
     when Moses married his daughter, Zipporah. Jethro is designated “the
     priest of Midian” (Exod. 18:1) and worshiped the true God (vs. 12).
     Other descendants of Midian turned away from the faith of Abraham
     to pagan gods; these were often enemies of Israel.

What request did Moses make of Hobab, Jethro’s son? What was his
     response? Num. 10:29–32.

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Moses didn’t consult God before he tried to persuade Hobab to
     accompany Israel. Was not the presence of God in the pillar of cloud
     by day and fire by night more than sufficient to guide the migrating
     nation through the wilderness? Here we see Moses’ humanity waffling
     before the challenge that faced him, and failing to remember that the
     God who opened the Red Sea also could open a path through the
     deserts and provide both food and water.


Read Matthew 26:36–43. What does this tell us about Jesus in His
     humanity?


       Even our Savior felt at times the need for human sympathy and sup-
     port. While He loved all the disciples, He was especially close to
     Peter, James, and John. In Gethsemane He solicited their prayers. On
     the mount of transfiguration the same trio slept instead of praying. But
     Heaven sent Moses and Elijah to encourage Christ to go forward with
     His atoning death (Luke 9:28–31). “Now heaven had sent its messen-
     gers to Jesus; not angels, but men who had endured suffering and sor-
     row, and who could sympathize with the Saviour in the trial of His
     earthly life. Moses and Elijah had been colaborers with Christ. They
     had shared His longing for the salvation of men. . . . The hope of the
     world, the salvation of every human being, was the burden of their
     interview.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 422, 425.

      Though we are to lean on the Lord, how often we find human sym-
      pathy so comforting and helpful. Go over times when you espe-
      cially have been blessed by someone who gave you comfort and
      sympathy in time of need. What made it so helpful? How might
      you now provide comfort and encouragement to someone in need?

             T HURSDAY October 22

      Heading Home?
Read the account in Numbers 10:11–36 of the Israelites’ first journey
      as God’s organized, covenant people. What’s the one thing that
      stands out regarding the manner in which they moved? Why
      would that be so important?


         According to Moses, it was only an 11-day journey from Mount
      Sinai (Horeb) to Kadesh-Barnea, a city or area near to what eventu-
      ally would become the southern border of Judah.
         Note the order. Three tribal armies followed the cloud and the ark.
      Then the Levites with their wagons carried the various parts of the
      portable sanctuary. Three more tribal armies followed. Then came the
      Kohathites, bearing the sanctuary furnishings. Six armies followed,
      protecting the rear from attack. Everything was done in a very orderly
      manner. Considering what was going on, if it were done haphazardly
      at all, it would have been an incredible disaster just waiting to happen.
         The quickest way to Canaan from Egypt lay through the coastal area
      along “the way of the land of the Philistines.” But God knew Israel was
      not ready for war (Exod. 13:17). Consequently, when the pillar of
      cloud signaled the tribal march, it led the nation east and north into the
      wilderness of Paran (Num. 10:11, 12), a journey of three days (vs. 33).
         “As they advanced, the way became more difficult. Their route lay
      through stony ravine and barren waste. All around them was the great
      wilderness. . . . The rocky gorges, far and near, were thronged with
      men, women, and children, with beasts and wagons, and long lines of
      flocks and herds. Their progress was necessarily slow and toilsome;
      and the multitudes, after their long encampment, were not prepared to
      endure the perils and discomforts of the way.”—Ellen G. White,
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 377.

       Read Numbers 10:35, 36. How could you apply the principles
       there today in your struggles and battles in the faith? Also, ask
       yourself this question: why didn’t God, using His awesome
       power, just automatically make the way clear and easy for
       them? Couldn’t He just have done that? If so, why didn’t He
       just do it for them instead of putting them through such a severe
       trial? How can your answer here, perhaps, help you understand
       why He simply doesn’t make your paths and journey simple and
       obstacle-free? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

    Further Study: We face decisions every day—some more serious
         than others. Contemplate the following promises regarding God’s guid-
         ance: Ps. 31:3; 32:8; 48:14; 78:52; Isa. 58:10, 11.

            “If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have no
         need to be anxious for tomorrow. He whose servant you are, knows
         the end from the beginning. The events of tomorrow, which are hid-
         den from your view, are open to the eyes of Him who is omnipotent.
            “When we take into our hands the management of things with
         which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for success,
         we are taking a burden which God has not given us, and are trying to
1        bear it without His aid. We are taking upon ourselves the responsibil-
         ity that belongs to God, and thus are really putting ourselves in His
         place. . . . But when we really believe that God loves us and means to
         do us good we shall cease to worry about the future. We shall trust
         God as a child trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments
         will disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God.”

          Why do we face the trials we face when God could, it would seem,

          ways does God minister to the needs of people through human
          support? How well does your local church do in this area?

          ●3 When we partake of the Lord’s Supper, how can we better
          appreciate exactly what it means? Go over in your mind the great
          truth of salvation by faith alone and how through faith in Jesus’
          death for us we have the promise of eternal life.

    Summary: Before leaving their year-long encampment at Sinai, Israel
         celebrated their first Passover anniversary in freedom. God would not
         have them forget their marvelous redemption from Egyptian slavery.
         On their tribal march of three days, the nation was led by God in the
         pillar of cloud and fire. The march took place in an orderly manner at
         the signals of the silver trumpets and the priests bearing the ark in the
         forefront. The cloud led eastward and northward in the wilderness of
         Paran. In the same way, God’s leading sometimes seems hard to us.
         But the key is to trust Him, our all-wise Father.

Making Up for Lost Time
by OSVALDO FERREIRA DE SOUSA
   I was born into an Angolan family who claimed to be Christian. But no
one ever told me what the Bible says or what it means to follow God.
   During Angola’s long civil war, I was drafted into the military. I married
a wonderful woman. But shortly after our marriage, she began attending
the Adventist church. Although she didn’t join the church, she attended
faithfully and often talked to me about the pastor’s messages and invited
me to worship with her. But I rudely refused. I troubled her over religion
and told her that I wasn’t interested in her church—or any church. Even
special events that she invited me to attend received a cold shoulder.
   Then in 2002 she invited me to attend a large camp meeting-like con-
ference that the church was sponsoring. She said that she wanted to be
baptized at this meeting. I didn’t object to her being baptized, and I agreed
to go with her. I had no idea that God had a special appointment with me
at that conference.
   While witnessing my wife’s baptism, God spoke to me, inviting me—
the doubter, the antagonist—to give Him a chance and to attend church
with my wife. I accepted God’s invitation, and the following week I sur-
prised my wife by going to church with her. And when I continued to
attend worship services with her, she asked the pastor to put my name on
the list of potential baptismal candidates. In March of 2007, I was bap-
tized.
   I am no longer the stubborn husband I once was. I know now that the
Holy Spirit used my wife’s persistent faith to touch my heart. I thank
God—and my wife—for being patient with me all those years when I
refused to listen to the Spirit’s urging.
   Today I love to share God’s love with anyone who will listen. I tell them
how wonderful it is to surrender their lives to Jesus. Many refuse to listen,
even as I refused. But I am not discouraged. God has blessed my efforts,
and two of my colleagues from work now study the Bible with me.
   I want everyone in my city to know this wonderful Jesus and His mes-
sage for these last days of history. I wasted a lot of time refusing to listen,
but I want to make the most of the time I have left and share God’s love.
This work cannot stop until Jesus comes.
   Thank you for your support of mission through your prayers and offer-
ings. You helped bring me to Jesus.

      From Complaints to
      Apostasy


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 11–14.

Memory Text: “Do all things without murmurings and disput-
      ings: that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, with-
      out rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among
      whom ye shine as lights in the world” (Philippians 2:14, 15).

                hen the pillar of cloud lifted from the tabernacle in Sinai and

      W         the priests set forward with the ark, Moses proclaimed:
                “Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let
      them that hate thee flee before thee” (Num. 10:35). It was like a vic-
      tory cry, and the vast hosts of Israel took to their journey with good
      cheer. At last they were on their way to the Promised Land!
         Imagine what it would be like having such a visible presence of God
      in your midst! One would think that with something so clear and obvi-
      ous before them, they so readily and willingly would have obeyed His
      every command as they journeyed toward the fulfillment of the prom-
      ise made to their fathers long ago.
         Of course, that’s not quite how things tend to work, even with God’s
      people. This week we’ll look at one mess after another, one expression
      of doubt, disbelief, and ingratitude after another. As we study, let’s
      keep in mind whatever relevant parallels there might be to us, today,
      as we await the fulfillment of an even greater promise (Heb. 11:40).

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, October 31.

     The Sin of Ingratitude
Read Numbers 11 and ask yourself the following questions:

     • What does this incident tell us about the importance of not for-
     getting how the Lord has led us in the past?

     _______________________________________________________

     • How do we understand the Lord’s reaction to the Israelites?

     _______________________________________________________

     • What can we learn from this account about the importance of
     controlling our appetites?

     _______________________________________________________

        Literally, the Hebrew describes these discontented persons as “mur-
     murers of evil.” We only can imagine what “evils” they complained
     about. Perhaps they felt that God had led the nation into a death trap in
     the wilderness—and not to the Promised Land of “milk and honey.”
     After all the miracles they had witnessed in Egypt and the crossing of
     the Red Sea, their murmuring was rebellious. Their influence could
     have been contagious and destructive to the young nation. And fire from
     the Lord destroyed them in “the uttermost parts of the camp” (vs. 1).
     Only the intercession of Moses quenched the fire.
        The people really had no true basis to complain about their diet. The
     manna could be prepared in various ways—ground in a mill, or beaten
     in a mortar; it could be baked or boiled (Exod. 16:23, Num. 11:8).
     Certainly the God who created so many tasty wonders for all humans
     wasn’t going to make His covenant people eat something unpalatable.
     Furthermore, they had milk from the goats, sheep, and cattle. From
     this they also made curds (“butter,” Deut. 32:14). As for flesh foods,
     the various “peace sacrifices”—vows, thank offerings, and freewill
     offerings—all ended with a communal meal in which the priest, the
     offerer, his family and servants, and invited Levites partook of the sac-
     rifice. No question, they weren’t going to go hungry.

      There’s a saying, “Be careful what you ask for or pray for; you
      might get it.” What does that mean, and what can we learn from
      it for ourselves?

     Pressures on Leadership
       When Israel so quickly reverted to idolatry and worshiped the
     golden calf, Moses pleaded with God to forgive them, but “if not,” he
     prayed, “blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written”
     (Exod. 32:32).
       Later, when Moses heard and saw the people “weeping” at the door
     of their tents and crying out, “Who shall give us flesh to eat?” (Num.
     11:4), how did he react? Why was his attitude unjustified? Where do
     we see the flawed humanity of this great man of God coming through?
     Vss. 10–15.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

Read Numbers 11:21–23. How again does the humanity of Moses
     come through?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Despite the mistakes of Moses, and his lack of trust, the Lord did
     help ease the burden that Moses felt himself under, and that was by
     appointing 70 elders to assist Moses in his work (vss. 16, 17). The
     experience of the 70 was similar to the Spirit’s descent upon Christ’s
     disciples at Pentecost, except that they “prophesied.” Thus, they were
     honored by God before all the people.
       “They would never have been chosen had Moses manifested faith
     corresponding to the evidences he had witnessed of God’s power and
     goodness. But he had magnified his own burdens and services, almost
     losing sight of the fact that he was only the instrument by which God
     had wrought. He was not excusable in indulging, in the slightest
     degree, the spirit of murmuring that was the curse of Israel.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 380.

      Read carefully Numbers 11:20. They had “rejected the Lord, who
      is among you” (NIV). Rejecting the Lord, then, doesn’t mean out-
      right apostasy, denial of God’s existence, or taking one’s name off
      the church books.What can we learn from this incident about how
      easy it is to deceive ourselves regarding our relationship to God?

               T UESDAY October 27

     Family Nastiness
        Zipporah, Moses’ wife, and their two sons had stayed with her
     father, “the priest of Midian,” during the plagues on Egypt. After
     Israel had become settled in Sinai, Jethro brought Zipporah and the
     children to Moses. Zipporah noticed how wearied her husband
     appeared and informed Jethro, who took a closer look at Moses’
     method of administration and suggested a reorganization by appoint-
     ing rulers of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. He suggested that
     they could judge the small matters. Moses would bring the larger
     cases to God. Moses agreed, and these chosen men “judged the peo-
     ple at all seasons” (Exod. 18:13–26). This move on the part of Moses
     was eventually to excite the jealousy and envy of Miriam and Aaron.

Read Numbers 12. What wretched human traits are being revealed
     here by Miriam and Aaron? How is their sin contrasted with the
     attitude and character of Moses? What should this sordid story tell
     us about how God views the bad attitudes revealed by these people?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The verb spake (vs. 1, KJV), or “began to talk” (NIV), is feminine
     singular, indicating that it was Miriam who initiated the charge follow-
     ing verse 1. She was jealous of Zipporah and blamed her for influenc-
     ing Moses to appoint the judges Jethro had suggested. She called
     Zipporah a Cushite, probably because she may have been dark-
     complexioned. Actually, Zipporah was a Midianite, a descendant of
     Abraham through his son Midian by Keturah, and a worshiper of the
     same true God. Also, the sneer may have been picked up from the fact
     that some of the Cushite tribes lived among the Midianites in the terri-
     tory east of Sinai and east of the Gulf of Aqabah in Arabia. She could
     have been designated by either term. For example, a person of German
     descent born in the United States could be called a German or an
     American. But most likely the term was used in a slanderous manner.

      Despite the powerful manifestations of God’s power among
      them, these two faithful people displayed some very bad atti-
      tudes. Examine your own heart: What bad attitudes need to be
      purged from you before they lead to your own spiritual ruin?

                                                                         41

     At the Borders
       The time was probably about September; the vineyards were ripen-
     ing and the second crop of figs had matured. It took the Israelite
     migration only about 11 days to reach Kadesh-Barnea, near the south-
     ern border of Canaan. We only can imagine the tremendous waves of
     joy and happiness that rippled through the immense throng as it
     approached the cherished object of their dreams.

Read Deuteronomy 1:19–23. What mistake was made here?

Read Numbers 13 and answer the following questions:

     • Though the Lord agreed to let them send spies, why was that a
     compromise? What were the fruits of that compromise?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     • What did the reaction of most of the people reveal about them,
     even after all the manifestations of divine power?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The people no doubt rejoiced to hear about the productivity of their
     new home-to-be. They marveled at the huge cluster of grapes carried
     between two men. This truly was going to be as good as, or even bet-
     ter than, they had imagined.
        As usual, with anything in this sinful world, there always are prob-
     lems, even when God leads us. Of course, the Lord knew those pagan
     people were there. Did not the Hebrews think that the Lord could have
     taken care of the situation for them? After all, look what He had done
     to the Egyptians!
        Nevertheless, forgetting about the power and promises of God, they
     saw the obstacles set before them and, despite the pleadings of Caleb
     and Joshua, the other spies filled the ears of the Israelites with gloom
     and doom.

      How can you learn to trust God despite the seemingly impossi-
      ble obstacles in your path? What choices are you making today
      that will determine how you will respond to what you face
      tomorrow?

     Back to Egypt
Read Numbers 14. What’s the most powerful and important spiritual
     lesson you can take away from this story? In what ways have you
     ever done the same thing?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Of all the horrible things they said, perhaps the worst was saying
     that they wanted a captain to take them back to Egypt (vss. 3, 4).
     When we consider that Egypt symbolized the bondage and slavery of
     sin, of death, of alienation from God, for these people to act as they
     did, after having had such an incredible deliverance, was inexcusable.
       “The unfaithful spies were loud in denunciation of Caleb and
     Joshua, and the cry was raised to stone them. The insane mob seized
     missiles with which to slay those faithful men. They rushed forward
     with yells of madness, when suddenly the stones dropped from their
     hands, a hush fell upon them, and they shook with fear. God had
     interposed to check their murderous design. The glory of His pres-
     ence, like a flaming light, illuminated the tabernacle . . . and none
     dared continue their resistance.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 390.

How do we see the mercy and grace of God revealed even here with
     these people who openly rebelled against Him?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      Look at their reaction to the punishment that they had received.
      In a sense, having rejected what God would have done for them,
      they decided to try to do it themselves, which, of course, resulted
      in disaster. If only they had trusted in God, who already had done
      so much for them, their disaster could have been averted. Sad,
      too, as is always the case with sin, many innocents—who had
      nothing to do with the rebellion—suffered for the sins of others.

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “From Sinai to Kadesh,”
         pp. 376–386; “The Twelve Spies,” pp. 387–394, in Patriarchs and
         Prophets.

            “These men, having entered upon a wrong course, stubbornly set
         themselves against Caleb and Joshua, against Moses, and against
         God. Every advance step rendered them the more determined. They
1
         were resolved to discourage all effort to gain possession of Canaan.
         They distorted the truth in order to sustain their baleful influence. It
         ‘is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof,’ they said. This was not
         only an evil report, but it was also a lying one. It was inconsistent with
         itself. The spies had declared the country to be fruitful and prosperous,
         and the people of giant stature, all of which would be impossible if the
2
         climate were so unhealthful that the land could be said to ‘eat up the
         inhabitants.’ But when men yield their hearts to unbelief they place
         themselves under the control of Satan, and none can tell to what lengths
         he will lead them.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 389.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Why is it so important to cultivate, in whatever situation we
          face, an attitude of praise and gratitude toward the Lord? No
3         matter our circumstances, don’t we all have things to be thank-
          ful for? Why is it so important to dwell on them, as opposed to
          the troubles that come upon us all? Why is gratitude and praise
          so important for keeping our faith strong?
          _____________________________________________________
          ●2 Have you ever noticed how contagious criticism and mur-
          muring can be, and how easily those attitudes in others can spread
          to you? What should this tell us, then, about how careful we
          need to be regarding the words that come out of our mouths?
          _____________________________________________________
          ●
          3 In what ways, even subtly, as we await the Second Coming
          (which seems to be taking so long), could we be in danger of dis-
          playing the same attitudes we find so repugnant as manifested
          by the Hebrews here?
          _____________________________________________________
          Summary: The 11 days between Sinai and Kadesh-Barnea on
          the borders of Canaan were some of Israel’s worst wilderness times.
          There was an outcry against the manna that was so overwhelming
          that Moses begged God to let him die right then. Miriam and Aaron’s
          sharp challenge of Moses’ leadership was another low blow. Finally,
          after the evil report of the spies, the nation crossed a line, which
          resulted in 40 years of wandering in the wilderness.

Before I Knew Him
by ANTHONY BARTHOLOMEW
   God had His hand on my life long before I knew Him. I live on the island
of Grenada in the Caribbean. I dropped out of school when I was 15 and sold
drugs to earn big money. I didn’t use the drugs; I just wanted the money. But
life was hard, and I had lots of problems. Sometimes I just wanted to die.
   Then I got sick and was admitted to the hospital. While there, my room-
mate gave me a Bible to read. I started reading it and realized that I was liv-
ing far from God’s will. The Bible gave me hope, and I wanted to pray, but
I didn’t know how. I just talked to God as I thought I should.
   I recovered and returned home. I attended my mother’s church, but I also
kept reading the Bible on my own. I saw things in the church that didn’t
match what I was reading, and I asked some church leaders about it. They
didn’t have answers, so I searched for another church.
   I talked to my sister about God. She was not a Christian, but she told me
about some evangelistic meetings she had heard about. I went, and there I
learned the real truths of the Bible and accepted Jesus as my Savior.
   I had stopped selling drugs, and God took away my cravings for tobacco,
alcohol, and gambling. I started telling my former friends about my faith.
“You’re liming!” they said, meaning I was faking my religion. But I assured
them I was serious. With time they became convinced that my faith was real.
   I told them how God took me from the gutter and cleaned me up. I urged
them to try Jesus, and a few visited the church, but no one became a Christian.
   I moved to another area of Grenada, where I preach in open air meetings
and have seen dozens give their lives to God, but my former friends would
not surrender to Jesus. That’s pretty amazing to me.
   A few church members, including a drug dealer who was recently bap-
tized, have formed a group that goes out and intervenes with gang members
who fight each other. We urge them to consider accepting Jesus into their
lives to break the bonds of anger and violence. We hope to teach them how
                             to lead productive, healthful lives.
                                My sister who told me about the evangelistic
                             meetings has since been baptized, and an
                             adopted sister also has given her life to Christ. I
                             praise God for leading me into a life of peace-
                             making, of building people up instead of tearing
                             them down.

      Planning Ahead




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 15; 2 Cor. 2:15,
      16; Gal. 3:26–29; Eph. 5:2; Col. 3:11.

Memory Text: “But I said unto their children in the wilderness,
      Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
      judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: I am the Lord
      your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
      them” (Ezekiel 20:18, 19).

              t the beginning of Numbers 15, the scenes of tumult and rebel-

      A       lion, of shame and defeat (at the hands of the Amalekites and
              Canaanites), have now faded. The people have learned, the
      hard way, the suffering that disobedience brings.
         The masses are now on the way back into the wilderness out of
      which they had first come. And it’s at this point that the Lord com-
      municates with Moses as the chapter opens: “Speak unto the children
      of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your
      habitations, which I give unto you . . .” (vs. 2).
         Despite the major setback, the promise was still sure: God would
      bring His people into the Promised Land. Of that there was no ques-
      tion!
         Also, we come across some of the special instructions given to
      God’s chosen people. However unique the circumstances, however
      unique the specific commands, there are spiritual lessons and princi-
      ples given not only for them but for us, as well.

     Thankfulness
Read Numbers 15:1–10, 18–21. What were the purposes of these
     offerings? What did they represent? What was the purpose of
     bringing oil, drink, and grain, as well?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Hebrew term for “meat/grain” is minchah, meaning “gift” or
     “tribute.” It included the flour, olive oil, and wine, representing the
     offerer’s gratitude for God’s blessings on the fields and crops (see
     Deut. 8:18).
        In the context of Numbers 15, these directions really carried a
     promise to the younger generation that one day they would plant fields
     of wheat, barley, and other grains in their new home in Canaan. They
     would with their own hands establish vineyards on the hills and
     orchards of olive trees and other fruits such as figs and pomegranates.
     In other words, these nonbloody offerings helped point them to the
     material blessings that were to be theirs were they to remain faithful.
     No doubt, all these thoughts were wrapped up in their sacrifices to the
     Lord, which helped point them day by day to the land of promise that
     awaited them.

How did the apostle Paul apply this concept in New Testament times?
     Rom. 12:1; 2 Cor. 2:15, 16; Eph. 5:2.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       However difficult their circumstances at present, the Lord wanted
     His people to cultivate an attitude of praise and gratitude for what He
     had done for them and what He promised to do for them in the future.
     Should not we do the same?

      Whatever your present woes, why is it important to dwell on
      God’s goodness, love, and care? How does keeping the Cross
      before you help you better realize God’s love and care for you,
      even in the worst of times? What things can you be grateful for
      now, regardless of your situation? Why is dwelling on these
      blessings so important for us?

      The Stranger Within Your Gates
        One of the more radical ideas of ancient Israel dealt with their atti-
      tude toward strangers, toward those who were not of their heritage or
      of their faith.

What specific commands were given to the second generation of
      Israelites as they looked forward to settling in Canaan? Num.
      15:14–16. How is this same principle revealed in the New
      Testament? Gal. 3:26–29, Col. 3:11.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The “stranger” or foreigner would be a person who settled among the
      Israelites and who fully accepted the faith and, if male, duly was cir-
      cumcised. They were to be treated and loved as if they were Israelites.
      “One ordinance” or “one law” shall be for you, and “for the stranger
      that sojourneth with you” (Num. 15:16). Talk about inclusiveness!

In the dedicatory prayer at the opening of the first temple, what request
      did Solomon make of God in regard to non-Israelites? 1 Kings
      8:41–43. What does Isaiah have to say about the strangers who
      sought to worship at the temple? Isa. 56:6, 7.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         When one considers the whole purpose of God calling out His peo-
      ple and establishing them in the Promised Land, these texts all make
      perfect sense. Israel had to maintain its distinctive teaching and truths,
      the teaching and truths that made them God’s special representatives to
      the pagan world. Yet at the same time, they needed to be open and recep-
      tive to the pagans who wanted to learn about their God and follow Him.
         In many ways, our church today must do that same thing. We have
      specific truths to teach the world, truths that we need to guard and pro-
      tect, and yet at the same time, we have to be willing to embrace those
      who are seeking to know the Lord and His message for this time.

       In what ways is it so easy to be exclusive, judgmental, and con-
       demnatory of those who don’t see things as we do? How can we
       avoid that attitude, and yet at the same time, protect the truths
       we have been given?

      Sins of Ignorance
        We must keep in mind that the younger generation that God is
      addressing in this chapter (Numbers 15) was born in slavery. Thus,
      they had been influenced by the Egyptian culture that surrounded
      them, as well as by their parents, who as slaves also were influenced
      by that same culture. Hence, they had a lot of bad things to unlearn
      and a lot of new and good things to learn.

If the congregation became aware that, as a group, they had erred from
      the Lord’s commandments, what were they to do? What is the sig-
      nificance of the fact that they had to bring a “sin” offering to the
      Lord for what was done out of ignorance? Num. 15:22–27.

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The sin offering atoned for their sin. The burnt offering represented
      a renewal of the congregation’s consecration to God. How interesting
      that the Lord would distinguish between things done unintentionally
      and that which was deliberate. At the same time, however, even the
      things done unintentionally were deemed “sin” and needed to be
      atoned for.

How did an individual secure atonement for his or her sin of igno-
      rance? How did this procedure differ from that of the congrega-
      tion? Num. 15:27–29.

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “There are those who have known the pardoning love of Christ and
      who really desire to be children of God, yet they realize that their char-
      acter is imperfect, their life faulty, and they are ready to doubt whether
      their hearts have been renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I would say,
      Do not draw back in despair. We shall often have to bow down and
      weep at the feet of Jesus because of our shortcomings and mistakes,
      but we are not to be discouraged. Even if we are overcome by the
      enemy, we are not cast off, not forsaken and rejected of God. No;
      Christ is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
      Said the beloved John, ‘These things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
      And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
      the righteous.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 64.

       How often do you tend to doubt whether you truly have been
       renewed by the Holy Spirit? What happened at the Cross that
       should give you the courage to press on, even when filled with
       doubt about your own salvation? See Rom. 5:6–8.
                                                                            49

     Sins of Defiance
Read Numbers 15:30, 31. What’s happening here, and what lessons
     can we draw from it for ourselves? Why does the punishment seem
     so harsh? Where is grace in all this?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The phrase in the Hebrew is “with a high hand,” a posture of arro-
     gance and rebellion. Israel truly sinned “with a high hand” against the
     Lord at Kadesh. But God commuted the death sentence to banishment
     in the wilderness. The point is, sins were taken very seriously by the
     Lord. Often in cases like this, those who afterward say that they are
     sorry, are, in fact, sorry only because they got caught, not sorry for the
     sins themselves. Against such hardness of heart, what can the Lord
     do? Sin truly must be repented of before it can be forgiven.

Read Numbers 15:32–36. Why do you think the Lord had the whole
     congregation take part in this execution? What spiritual lesson
     can we draw from this?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       It must have been a difficult thing for a group of Israelites to stone
     one of their members to death. Evidently God was attempting to show
     His people the seriousness of sin. “The wages of sin is death” (Rom.
     6:23). Perhaps, too, He sought to show them the corporate nature of
     their community and that what they did influenced others around them.
     What each one did, individually, still impacted the welfare of the whole.
     After all, was it not because of the complaining of some people that the
     whole camp was made to suffer by remaining in the wilderness?
       As Christians, we especially need to be aware of the fact that our
     deeds, be they for good or for evil, impact others, as well as ourselves.
       Meanwhile, though in the theocracy of ancient Israel death often
     came immediately, we shouldn’t be fooled. Even though we aren’t
     immediately struck dead for our defiance, that does not mean that we
     are not going to reap our just rewards one day.

      How ready and willing are you to repent, confess, and admit
      your sins? Or, on the other hand, how often do you find yourself
      justifying your sins for one reason or another? Why is that so
      spiritually dangerous?

      Tassels of Blue
        If you have ever seen Orthodox Jews, you might have noticed them
      wearing something under their shirts with white tassels on it. Its ori-
      gins are found here, in the Bible.

What did the Lord direct Moses to instruct every Israelite to attach
      to their garments? Num. 15:38.

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Apparently attaching tassels of various colors was a common prac-
      tice among the ancient peoples of the Near East, and God adopted the
      practice. The “fringe” (KJV) or tassel was attached to the four corners
      of the outer garment with a thread (“ribband,” KJV) of blue on each
      tassel. The modern prayer shawl has four tassels—one on each corner,
      tied in a traditional knot with white and blue threads.

What reason was given for wearing tassels? That is, what specific
      things did God want the Israelites to remember? Num. 15:39–41.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The word remember stands out twice in these verses. Every time an
      Israelite saw the tassels, he or she was to “remember, and do all my
      commandments, and be holy unto your God” (vs. 40). When tempted
      to go after other gods—spiritual adultery—the blue in the tassels
      would call him or her back to their sworn loyalty to God, the God who
      had brought the nation out of Egyptian slavery (vs. 41).
         Apparently, even with the presence of God among them in such a
      marked manner, the Lord wanted to give them something even more
      immediate to help them remember what they needed to do.
         Though we don’t wear tassels today, we have something so much
      more powerful: the cross of Christ, which always should bring before
      our minds the cost of sin, the cost of our redemption, and the promise
      of salvation for all who, through faith, trust in the merits of Jesus and
      who “follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
      shall see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14).

       How could following Jesus’ words to “pray always” (Luke 21:36)
       help you remember what God has done for you and what He
       asks you to do in return?
       _____________________________________________________

                                                                           51

    Further Study: “Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven’s
         chosen agency for revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowl-
         edge His grace as made known through the holy men of old; but that
         which will be most effectual is the testimony of our own experience.
         We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the working of a
1
         power that is divine. Every individual has a life distinct from all oth-
         ers, and an experience differing essentially from theirs. God desires
         that our praise shall ascend to Him, marked by our own individuality.
         These precious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His
         grace, when supported by a Christ-like life, have an irresistible power
         that works for the salvation of souls.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
2
         Ages, p. 347.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Go through the Ellen G. White quote above. What is she say-
          ing? What important principles can we take from it? How do you
          understand the idea that our praise to God, along with a
          “Christ-like life,” can be a powerful influence on the salvation of
          others?
3
          ●
          2 What has your own experience of giving praise and glory to
          God done for you in your walk with the Lord? Why is this atti-
          tude so important?

          ●
          3 Dwell more on Monday’s lesson about how the Israelites were
          to treat the strangers among them. What other lessons can we
          take from this for ourselves today? How do we treat those who
          are not of our faith, those who hold views that we believe to be
          wrong? How should we treat them? At the same time, how do we
          show them that we believe we have something that they need to
          know, while not acting as if we are somehow superior? What les-
          sons can we learn from the Israelites in this area?

          ●4 What can we, as a community, do to help remind each other
          not only of what God has done for us but of what He expects us
          to do in response? What role does the Lord’s Supper have in
          helping us remember what we have in Jesus?

    Summary: Although that first generation was condemned to wander
         in the wilderness until they died, the Lord would encourage their chil-
         dren to look forward to Canaan. Hence came God’s further instruction
         regarding sacrifices, a loving attitude toward the foreigner who con-
         verted to the faith, how to deal with sins of ignorance and sins of open
         defiance, and finally the attaching of blue tassels to their garments to
         remind them of God’s commandments and that their obedience to Him
         demonstrated the only way to true happiness.

Francesca’s Special Ministry
by DEENA BARTEL-WAGNER
   Francesca Watkins is nine years old and lives in Tennessee in the
United States. She has lots of friends, but Ernestine is Francesca’s spe-
cial friend. Francesca enjoys being an example of Jesus to her friend
Ernestine.
   Ernestine has multiple sclerosis. She can’t walk and must use a
wheelchair to get around. When she first moved into Francesca’s neighbor-
hood, she didn’t know anyone. Then Francesca came into her life.
   “I learned that Ernestine doesn’t get many visitors,” Francesca says,
“so I visit her after school. I bring in her mail, and we talk.”
   When Francesca noticed that Ernestine wasn’t eating well because it
was hard for her to cook, Francesca asked her mother how they could
help. Now Francesca’s mom prepares two healthful meals a day for
Ernestine with lots of fruits and vegetables.
   Sometimes Francesca doesn’t feel like visiting Ernestine, but she
goes anyway. “I promised Ernestine that I would visit every day, and it
isn’t fair not to keep my promise,” Francesca says.
   One day when Francesca stopped by, she found Ernestine lying on the
floor of her garage. She had fallen from her wheelchair and couldn’t get
up. Francesca comforted her friend and then ran to get her sister, Sierra.
After praying, the girls were able to get her back into her wheelchair.
   Francesca and Ernestine talk of many different things, but Francesca
tries never to leave her friend before she has prayed with her. And
whenever they can, Francesca enjoys taking Ernestine shopping when
she goes. It’s a fun way to help Ernestine get out of the house.
   “It’s not hard to share Jesus with other people around us,” Francesca
says. “When you find someone who doesn’t know Jesus, you can just
be their friend. Help them with something that they can’t do and offer
                              to pray that they will have a good day. When
                              you do this, others will see Jesus in your
                              life.”
                                 Friendship evangelism is so simple that
                              many children are doing it. Our mission
                              offerings help support all types of evangel-
                              ism at home and in distant lands.

      Power Struggle




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 17:10–17, Numbers
      16, 17, Josh. 4:3–9, Matt. 26:13, Luke 22:19.

Memory Text: “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty
      spirit before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18).

              n ill-disguised hatred against Moses and Aaron still rankled in

      A       the hearts of the multitude. To be condemned to wander in the
              wilderness until the first generation out of Egypt died seemed
      more than many of them could bear. Instead of submitting to God’s
      judgment, some began to plot how they could rid themselves of the
      two brothers, as if somehow these two men, and not God, were the
      ones responsible for this situation.
        “Korah, the leading spirit in this movement, was a Levite, of the
      family of Kohath, and a cousin of Moses; he was a man of ability and
      influence. Though appointed to the service of the tabernacle, he had
      become dissatisfied with his position and for some time . . . had been
      secretly opposing the authority of Moses and Aaron. . . . He finally
      conceived the bold design of overthrowing both the civil and the reli-
      gious authority.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 395.
        This week’s lesson should be a powerful reminder to us of the cor-
      ruptness of the human heart. Pride, jealousy, and love of power, if
      cherished and left to fester, can manifest themselves in horrific ways.
      God alone knows how much pain, suffering, and loss have resulted
      and will result from those who, knowing better, allow these bitter
      seeds to bear their harvest. May we learn from the mistakes seen here
      and not make the same ones ourselves.

      Rebellion (Again)

Read Numbers 16:1–3. Read carefully the rebels’ words to Moses.
      What four lies are found there?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Moses’ reaction to this attack (vs. 4) reveals just how frustrated he
      must have felt at such twisted and distorted charges, especially by those
      who should have known better. “They were of the number who went up
      with Moses into the mount and beheld the divine glory. . . . Professing
      great interest in the prosperity of the people, they first whispered their dis-
      content to one another and then to leading men of Israel. Their insinua-
      tions were so readily received that they ventured still further, and at last
      they really believed themselves to be actuated by zeal for God.”
      —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 396, 397.
         Here, again, we see the manifestation of Satan’s original sin in
      heaven. No matter how exalted these men and princes were, or the high
      positions that they held, it wasn’t enough for them. They wanted more.
         How careful we must be!

What else was behind their rebellion? Why, too, were these charges so
      utterly false? Num. 16:12–14.
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        What’s so incredible are the words of these men, calling Egypt
      (Egypt!) the land flowing “with milk and honey.” It’s amazing how sin
      was so able to pervert their judgment that the country of their slavery
      and bondage was now referred to by them in terms that represented
      God’s Promised Land!

       What are ways in which we deceive ourselves, ways in which we
       rationalize or justify our sins and wrong deeds? How can we
       protect ourselves against this sad and dangerous spiritual trap?
                                                                                 57
                M ONDAY November 9

      If the Lord Creates Something New
        Look at Moses’ reaction to these men (Num. 16:4–11). Despite the
      exalted position that they had been given, they wanted more. Moses
      clearly saw that.
        Even more important, if you listened to their words, it seemed as if
      they were rebelling against Moses and Aaron, as if these two, of them-
      selves, had usurped all this authority, had overstepped their bounds,
      and had exalted themselves over everyone else, as well as having led
      them into the wilderness to kill them.

In reality, however, who were they truly rebelling against? Num. 16:11.


        Again, one has to wonder where these men came up with such false
      charges. Whose power split the Red Sea—God’s, or Moses and
      Aaron’s? Who brought manna for them every morning—God, or
      Moses and Aaron? Who was it that manifested the cloud by day and
      the fire by night—God, or Moses and Aaron? It’s hard to imagine how,
      with all that they had witnessed, they could have acted as they did.

Read Numbers 16:15–35. Notice Moses’ words in verses 28–30. What
      is Moses saying that shows what the real issue was?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Think of their situation. If these men had been able to incite a wider
      rebellion, who knows the horrible consequences that could have
      come. The children of Israel, as it were, hardly grounded in the Lord
      as they should be, easily could have gone totally astray. They had to
      know that the Lord was in control, that the Lord was the One who was
      leading them, and that Moses and Aaron were doing what God had
      called them to do and were not acting in their own behalf. All this
      should have been obvious, but again, sin has a powerful way of cloud-
      ing our minds. The spirit of rebellion, once fostered, is hard to quell
      and often takes on a momentum all its own.

       How susceptible are you to feelings of envy regarding those who
       have position or authority over you? What can you learn from
       Christ’s example that could help you overcome this potentially
       ruinous sentiment?

     Memorials
        Archaeological research in Palestine has not uncovered many writ-
     ten materials (other than the Dead Sea scrolls), yet the Scriptures refer
     to a variety of memorials as visible signs to recall continuously to
     Israel’s memory their meaning. For instance, in Genesis 28:11–22,
     Jacob set up a stone memorial in order to remember the covenant
     promises that God had made to him and to his descendants.

How was this terrible rebellion against Moses and Aaron memorial-
     ized? Num. 16:36–40. What especially was this memorial to
     remind them of?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Most of the memorials mentioned in the Old Testament reminded
     Israel of God’s will, His goodness, grace, and covenant blessings.
     They pointed the person Godward, upward, toward the Lord. For
     example, the rainbow after the Flood (Gen. 9:13), circumcision (Gen.
     17:10–17), the Passover festival (Num. 9:1–14), the blue tassels on
     their clothing (Num. 15:38–41), or the memorial stones Joshua
     erected at the Jordan crossing (Josh. 4:3–9).
        In contrast, the bronze plates in the court were a preventative
     memorial to warn a stranger or a nondescendant of Aaron from
     attempting to usurp the priesthood. In a broader sense, it would
     remind people of what happened when humans—rationalizing their
     own greed, ambition, and desire for power—rebelled against God. It
     was a memorial, warning people to “be not as Korah, and as his com-
     pany” (Num. 16:40).

What are some other memorials you can find in the Bible, and what
     are their purposes? See, for instance, Exod. 20:8–11, Num. 31:54,
     Matt. 26:13, Luke 22:19. In what ways were the animal sacrifices a
     kind of memorial?

     Between the Living and the Dead
        We would think that the judgments that fell upon Korah, Dathan,
     Abiram, and the 250 princes would have sobered the wilderness con-
     gregation. After all, fire was coming down from heaven and consum-
     ing some, while the earth was opening up and consuming the others.
     What more could the Lord have done to show His righteous indigna-
     tion at such outright rebellion and apostasy?

Read Numbers 16:41–50. What should this tell us about fallen
     human nature? How did their accusation reflect the same accusa-
     tion that Korah and the others had just made?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       What this amazing account should reveal to us is that the spirit of
     rebellion among some of the people hadn’t ended with Korah. It
     remained in the camp, even after all that just had happened. It’s hard
     to understand how anyone could have acted that way, especially after
     what they had just witnessed. Again, this only goes to show us how
     once we start the slide toward rebellion and apostasy, we might find
     ourselves doing some very crazy and irrational things. How crucial
     that we, through God’s grace, claiming His promises (1 Cor. 10:13,
     Phil. 1:6), die to these sentiments before they lead us toward ruin.

Read Numbers 16:48. What does the idea of Aaron standing between
     the living and the dead mean? How do we, in this scene, get a
     glimpse of what Jesus has done for us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       There are only two kinds of people in this world, the living and the
     dead, not the physically dead but the spiritually dead. “He that
     believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is con-
     demned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
     begotten Son of God” (John 3:18). Jesus stands between the living
     and the dead; He’s the border, the transition point from one to the
     other. Only through Him can we go from death to life.

      Are you among the living? Justify your answer.

     Aaron’s Rod That Budded
       Although thousands had died in the rebellion stirred up by Korah,
     the Lord knew the issue of priestly leadership had yet to be settled.
     Even with all that He had done, the powerful and painful judgments
     poured out on the rebellious, God must have known that the people
     were still restless. With justification, He could have wiped them all
     out, though it was never His desire to do that. Even after all that had
     happened, the Lord still was willing to work with these people and
     reveal His saving grace to them.

Read Numbers 17 and answer the following questions:

     • What was the reason for the test?

     _____________________________________________________

     • How was this test to be a means of preventing further rebellion
     and the resulting condemnation?

     _____________________________________________________

     • How does the reaction of the people reveal that they seem to have
     finally gotten the message that only certain people would be
     allowed to be priests?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The miracle of Aaron’s staff blooming and producing almonds
     could not be denied. The Israelites had to admit that God had wrought
     a miracle within the tabernacle that, once and for all, designated
     Aaron and his descendants as the priests of the Lord’s sanctuary. The
     tragedy is that it cost so much suffering to get the point across. What’s
     amazing is that the Lord was willing to do even more for them in order
     to set them straight.

      From our perspective, it’s so easy to condemn and judge the
      Hebrews. Yet, what if we look at ourselves, individually (2 Cor.
      3:15)? Why is it often so hard for us to learn the lessons that
      God seeks to teach us? Why, even when we have been given more
      than enough evidence of God’s love and grace, do we fail to trust
      Him? Why do we make the same mistakes again and again?
      Even more important, why is it crucial that we not seek to jus-
      tify our mistakes?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Rebellion of Korah,”
         pp. 395–405, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “I question whether genuine rebellion is ever curable. . . .
            “Rebellion and apostasy are in the very air we breathe. We shall be
         affected by it unless we by faith hang our helpless souls upon Christ.
         If men are so easily misled, how will they stand when Satan shall per-
         sonate Christ, and work miracles? Who will be unmoved by his mis-
         representations? Professing to be Christ when it is only Satan assum-
1        ing the person of Christ, and apparently working the works of Christ?
         What will hold God’s people from giving their allegiance to false
         Christs? ‘Go not ye after them.’
            “The doctrines must be plainly understood. The men accepted to
         teach the truth must be anchored; then their vessel will hold against
         storm and tempest, because the anchor holds them firmly. The decep-
2        tions will increase, and we are to call rebellion by its right name. We
         are to stand with the whole armor on.” —Ellen G. White Comments,

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What are ways in which sin deceives us? How can we know if
          we are being deceived by it? (After all, isn’t part of the deception
          of sin to make us think that actually we’re not being deceived?)
3         What role does the Bible play in answering this question? How
          can others help us, as well?
          ______________________________________________________
          ●2 However open and outright the rebellion we looked at this
          week, what are other ways that the same spirit can be manifest
          among us? How can we recognize it when it arises among our-
          selves, especially when it’s often cloaked under guises that make
          us think we’re not rebelling really, but instead, really standing up
          for what is right? How do we know the difference?
          ______________________________________________________
          ●
          3 Why are memorials, either religious or secular, important?
          What are some secular memorials common in your culture, and
          what do they represent?
          ______________________________________________________
    Summary: The rebellion of Korah and his associates against Moses
         and Aaron was so deep-seated that God had to destroy them and their
         followers by earthquake, fire, and plague. This account should serve
         as a warning against envy and jealousy, as did the memorial bronze
         plates on the altar. If we would pray for our leaders and cherish what
         God has done for them and us, we may be spared the internal troubles
         that beset ancient Israel in Korah’s uprising.

Long Journey to God
by SAM ABRAHAM
   Kiyasudeen grew up in a non-Christian home in India. When he was 11
years old he went to live with his aunt, who had no children. Kiyasudeen
noticed that his aunt worshiped a different God. He watched as she lit a can-
dle under a picture of a Man named Jesus and then prayed silently.
Sometimes Kiyasudeen went to the room where his aunt prayed and stood
before the picture of Jesus and prayed to Him too, saying, “Jesus, please take
care of me.”
   Three years later he returned home. He often went to the temple with his
father. While his father prayed to his god, Kiyasudeen prayed to Jesus.
   Then tragedy struck. Both his mother and his aunt died. Deeply depressed,
Kiyasudeen climbed a small hill outside town, where he fasted and prayed for
three days. “You are a holy God,” he said. “Auntie told me about the great
feast in heaven. Will I be there? How will I know if I am prepared to go?”
   He returned home to find a job. He needed to support himself, and he
hoped to earn enough money to pay his school fees and write his school leav-
ing exam. He found a job, but after several months the employer hadn’t paid
him. When Kiyasudeen asked for his money, the man beat him and sent him
away. The boy found a church, which he entered to pray. “God, be my help;
educate me,” he pleaded.
   The church’s pastor saw the boy and asked what he prayed for. Kiyasudeen
said that he wanted to study. The pastor said, “Why don’t you go to the sem-
inary? You can study theology and become a pastor.” Kiyasudeen accepted
and enrolled in the church’s seminary. After he graduated, he began preach-
ing.
   While visiting people one day, he saw a sign outside one house that said,
“Pastor, Seventh-day Adventist Church.” He asked the pastor what “seventh
day” meant. The pastor explained that the seventh day is the Sabbath.
Kiyasudeen was astonished. “I studied in a seminary, and no one told me
about the Sabbath. Is it Sunday?”
   The Adventist pastor pointed to the calendar. Kiyasudeen saw that
Saturday was the seventh day. He asked the pastor to teach him, and the two
studied and prayed together for three months. Then Kiyasudeen asked to be
baptized.
   Kiyasudeen tried to share with his family God’s love, but they rejected him.
So he shares his faith with anyone who will listen.
   Our mission offerings help bring the gospel of Jesus to those like
Kiyasudeen who are searching for the living God. Thank you.

          LESSON            8       *November 14–20



      Priests and Levites




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 9, 18, 19, 1 Pet.
      2:9, Rev. 14:6–12.

Memory Text: “And the Lord spake unto Aaron, . . . I am thy
      part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel” (Numbers
      18:20).

              fter Korah’s rebellion and the test of the staffs, it became nec-

      A       essary to emphasize further the distinct roles between the
              priests and Levites. Each had their God-appointed functions,
      and the Lord clearly drew the lines between those functions. And
      though all these roles and functions long ago have become obsolete,
      there still are lessons we can draw from them for ourselves today.
         Notice, for instance, just how sacred and solemn these roles were.
      Thus, we could learn for ourselves how we need to take seriously our
      sacred responsibilities and trusts, whatever they are.
         Notice, too, just how interdependent these people were with each
      other and the nation as a whole. We certainly can draw lessons from
      that for ourselves today as a church body.
         Also, pay attention to the role of grace in these chapters, especially
      in regard to the gifts given these people through no merit of their own.
      They had these positions only because God gave those positions to
      them, not because of any inherent worth in and of themselves.
         What a powerful symbol of the gospel.

      Division of Labor
        “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
      covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
      people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a king-
      dom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which
      thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel” (Exod. 19:5, 6).

How can we relate those words above to ourselves, today, as a church
      called to bring a message to the world? Is this calling uncondi-
      tional? See 1 Pet. 2:9, Rev. 14:6–12.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In Numbers 18:1, the Lord wanted to give assurance to the worshipers
      that they would not die, but only if they approached the sanctuary
      through His specially chosen priests, who would act as mediators
      between them and the Lord. The priests, as distinct from the remainder
      of the Levites, were responsible for seeing that no unauthorized person
      approached the tabernacle, thereby defiling it. This would allay the fears
      of the congregation that in coming near the tabernacle they risked death.

Read Numbers 18:1–7. What distinctions were made in the roles
      given these men?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         What’s important to note here is that although all the nation was to
      be a “kingdom of priests,” only certain people were allowed into cer-
      tain roles, as seen here in the division of the Levites and the family of
      Aaron from the general population and then in the division made
      between Aaron’s family and the Levites. Obviously, in New Testament
      times, hereditary roles, such as found with the Levites, clearly have
      been abolished, yet we find in the New Testament distinct roles in the
      church (1 Cor. 12:28–31, Eph. 4:11).


       What are your gifts, and how could you better use them to serve
       your local church?

      The Gifts of Divine Service
         When we read the Lord’s instruction in Numbers 18:1–7, a few
      points stand out. First, the Lord makes it clear that He is the One who
      is appointing the people to these positions. Perhaps this emphasis was
      made because of the previous problems, not just with Korah and his
      cohorts but even with Miriam and Aaron. Now, though, there would
      be no question as to why these people were given these roles. They
      were there because God put them there—period.
         Notice, too, the reason the Lord wanted to make these divisions. It
      was so that His “wrath may never again come upon the Israelites” (vs.
      5, NRSV). Here, again, we see God’s mercy even amid such powerful
      judgments. God seeks to save His people, not condemn or destroy
      them. The whole plan of salvation, from start to finish, reveals the
      Lord’s desire to redeem sinful fallen beings from the destruction that
      sin otherwise brings (John 3:16–18).

What term is used to describe what the Levites are to the priesthood
      and what the priesthood was to Aaron’s family? What lessons
      should we draw from it?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         When you think of a gift, you think of something that is not earned.
      It’s totally of grace. This was a privilege bestowed upon these people,
      not because of any merit on their part but simply through God’s grace
      and providence. In the end, the Lord needed someone to do this work,
      and in His divine wisdom these were the ones He chose.
         Of course, with this sacred task came sacred responsibilities. Issues
      of life and death, both physically and spiritually, were involved here, for
      the tabernacle was the place where God dwelt on earth. The sanctuary
      was also the model for what Jesus would do here on earth and for His
      ministry in heaven (Hebrews 9). It was like a miniature Calvary being
      played out in types and shadows. The destiny of souls lay in the balance.
      Hence, the solemnity the Lord placed on the roles given these men.

       Think about your innate talents, whatever they are. No matter
       how hard you work to cultivate them, they are still that—gifts,
       something given to you by God. What are you doing with those
       gifts? Are you using them for yourself or for the good of others
       and the furtherance of the Lord’s work? Might you need to do
       some serious soul-searching and changing?

     Sanctuary Support
       Having distinguished between the two groups of religious workers,
     the Lord next gives instruction regarding their economic support.
     Their positions were, apparently, full time. That is, they didn’t “serve
     tables” (Acts 6:2) in order to support themselves. The support had to
     come from elsewhere.

Read Numbers 18:8–20. What points seem most pertinent to you?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

         Many interesting thoughts come through these texts. Notice, for
     instance, how closely the Lord related the offering given to Him with
     what was given to the priesthood. That is, though the offerings and
     gifts were made to Him, He gave them to the priests. Thus, by giving
     the offering to the Lord, they were at the same time giving them to the
     priests. This shows the close link between the Lord and the priesthood,
     which served as intermediaries between God and the people.
        At the same time, we can see the humanity of the priests, as well.
     Though in this privileged position, they still were depending on the
     people they served for their sustenance. No doubt, with the people giv-
     ing them of their best oil, wine, grain, and so forth, the priesthood con-
     stantly was reminded of their obligation to serve these people faithfully
     and not to take advantage of the position that they had been given.
        Also, to redeem a child or an animal by means of money was one
     of the ways the Lord taught Israel the concept of substitution. One day
     in the future Christ would give His life as a substitute for sinners (see
     1 Pet. 1:18, 19). Salt, added to every sacrifice, was a symbol that sig-
     nified the permanence of God’s covenant with His people (see Lev.
     2:13).

      What kind of sacred responsibilities do you hold? How faithful
      are you in the tasks that others are trusting you with? How
      could you do better in faithfully executing your responsibilities?

      The Tithing Plan
         Although the tribe of Levi had no land territory, they were given 48
      cities, 13 of which were for the families of the priests (Josh. 21:19, 41).
      The Lord declared that He was their “part” or portion (Num. 18:20).

In addition to their portion of the sacrificial offerings, what other plan
      did the Lord devise to care for both priests and Levites? Num.
      18:21–32.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Returning a tithe of one’s income to the Lord (Lev. 27:30) was an
      ancient practice. It is first mentioned in the Bible when Abraham gave
      tithes to Melchizedek, King-priest of Salem (Gen. 14:18–20; Heb.
      7:1, 2). Jacob promised the Lord he would render “the tenth” of all he
      would earn in his future (Gen. 28:22). Now, the Lord adapts the use
      of Israel’s tithe, giving it for the support of the entire Levitical tribe—
      including the families of the priests.
         Even the Levites, who were paid in tithe, tithed as well, their tithe
      going to Aaron. The Levites were to give the “best part” of what they
      received as tithe. Hence, not only did that tithe go toward the support
      of the priesthood; it also enabled the Levites to realize their depend-
      ence upon God and that all they received was from Him. They, too,
      needed to show their gratitude by faithfully returning the “tithe of the
      tithe.” If the people always needed to remember their dependence
      upon the Lord, how much more so the Levites?

Read Numbers 18:32. What point should be taken away from that
      regarding the sacredness of their calling?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

       In this divine plan, everyone had their role, everyone had some-
       thing to do. The priests and the Levites had their sacred duties
       to carry out regarding the service and ministry in the sanctuary,
       while the people had theirs in regard to the paying of a faithful
       tithe. The tithe was a small thing to give, considering what the
       Levites and priesthood performed in their behalf. In a sense, all
       the different groups were dependent upon the function of each
       other, and all were dependent upon the Lord.

      The Red Heifer
The sacrifice of an unblemished red heifer that never had been yoked
      is the strangest rite in Israel’s sanctuary system (Numbers 19).
      What lessons can we learn from it?


         This heifer was to be red, a symbol of blood, Christ’s blood obvi-
      ously. It had to be without blemish, as well, and never had borne a
      yoke—another symbol of Christ, a spotless sacrifice who came vol-
      untarily to accomplish the work of atonement. There was no obliga-
      tory yoke upon Him, for He was independent and above all law.
         The sacrificial heifer was brought forth without the camp, and slain.
      Thus Christ suffered without the gates of Jerusalem (Heb. 13:12), for
      Calvary was outside the city walls. This was to show that Christ did
      not die for the Hebrews alone but for all humanity (Rom. 5:12–20).
      He proclaims to a fallen world that He has come to be their Redeemer
      and urges them to accept the salvation He offers.
         After slaying the heifer, the priest, clothed in pure white garments,
      took the blood in his hands as it issued from the body of the victim,
      and cast it toward the tabernacle seven times. Thus, Christ in His own
      spotless righteousness, after shedding His precious blood, entered into
      the heavenly sanctuary to minister in the sinner’s behalf. And there His
      blood is brought into the service of reconciling God to humanity (see
      Heb. 10:21–23).
         The body of the heifer was burned to ashes, which signified a whole
      and ample sacrifice. The ashes then were gathered up by a person uncon-
      taminated by contact with the dead and laid up in a clean place without
      the camp. When the ceremony of cleansing was to be performed, these
      ashes were placed in a vessel containing water from a running stream. A
      clean and pure person then took the hyssop and sprinkled the contents of
      the vessel not only upon the tent where someone died but also upon its
      contents and the people inside of it. This purification ceremony was
      repeated several times in order to be thorough, and was done as a purifi-
      cation from sin.
         The cleansing water, sprinkled on the unclean, symbolized the blood
      of Christ spilled to cleanse us from moral impurities. The repeated sprin-
      klings illustrate the thoroughness of the work that must be accomplished
      for the repenting sinner. All that he has must be consecrated. Not only
      should the sinner’s own soul be washed clean and pure, but he or she
      should seek purity and holiness in all aspects of his or her existence.

       Look at your life. What things still need to be submitted to the
       purification process? What are you holding on to, and why?

    Further Study: “God’s plan in the tithing system is beautiful in its
          simplicity and equality. All may take hold of it in faith and courage,
          for it is divine in its origin. In it are combined simplicity and utility,
          and it does not require depth of learning to understand and execute it.
          All may feel that they can act a part in carrying forward the precious
          work of salvation. Every man, woman, and youth may become a treas-
          urer for the Lord, and may be an agent to meet the demands upon the
          treasury. . . .
             “Great objects are accomplished by this system. If one and all
1
          would accept it, each would be made a vigilant and faithful treasurer
          for God; and there would be no want of means with which to carry
          forward the great work of sounding the last message of warning to the
          world.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 223.

    Discussion Questions:
2          ●
           1 What are some of the issues regarding tithe in the church
           today? Why is tithing so important, not just for the function of
           the church but for the spiritual well-being of the one who tithes?
           _____________________________________________________
           ●
           2 Go back over Thursday’s lesson on the red heifer. Dwell on
           what it tells us about Christ’s death and ministry in our behalf.
           What does it tell us about our need to be cleansed from sin?
3
           What has Christ done that enables us to have victory over sin?
           _____________________________________________________
           ●3 Think about your home. Are there things there that you need
           to cleanse, things that could be defiling it? Books, DVDs, music,
           magazines, whatever? What are they, and why should you get rid
           of them?
           _____________________________________________________
           ●
           4 What are ways that we can help others, especially the young
           people in our church, use their God-given talents for the Lord?
           That is, how can we help steer folk, who do have gifts, in the right
           direction of using those gifts for the right purposes? What is our
           obligation to help them?
           _____________________________________________________
    Summary: Because of Korah’s rebellion and desire to hold the office
          of a priest, God instructed Moses (for the people) in regard to the dis-
          tinction between the priests and the Levites. The priesthood was a gift
          from God; the Levites were a gift to the priesthood. Both were sup-
          ported by a tithing plan. With the ashes of a red heifer mixed with
          water, the Lord provided for a special ritual cleansing, which signified
          the grace of God in cleansing a person from the stain of sin.

Poured Out
and Running Over: Part 1
by JOANNE W. LAFEVER
   My spirit was heavy as I walked upstairs into an empty classroom in the
Adventist elementary school in Taipei, Taiwan, that day in 1998. Just two
weeks before school started, I had received a phone call from the current
principal saying that he couldn’t return to Taiwan for health reasons.
Suddenly I was the new principal as well as a teacher.
   The little mission school had been established to serve the children of
missionary families working at the Taipei Adventist Hospital. It was reg-
istered with the Taiwan government as a foreign school, which allowed it
to take any students with foreign passports who wanted an American—
and Christian—education.
   My husband, Beech, and I were committed to continue teaching there if
God wanted us 10. But being the principal was a huge challenge, especially
since I spoke no Mandarin Chinese.
   The school board agreed to keep the school open as long as we
remained self-supporting and could fulfill our mission to lead people to
Jesus. I knew that winning souls is what Adventist schools are about, and
our school was ready to do it. Only one of the current students came from
an Adventist home.
   We faced many challenges that first year, and only prayer got us
through. But we knew that God had a plan. Then a radical idea hit me.
   Our family had seen God’s blessings as we returned tithe. Why not tithe
the increase of the school? We had no idea whether the school would break
even financially that year, but I told God I’d return tithe on any income the
school made. And by the end of the school year, we returned $450 tithe!
   We had never had the money to advertise our school, so getting new stu-
dents was always a challenge. As the next school year approached, we
decided to take out an ad in a major Chinese-language newspaper. It would
run for just four days over a weekend.
   The Monday after the ad ran, a man called to make an appointment. He
said he had seen our ad and wanted to enroll his first-grader in a foreign
school. Then he mentioned that he never bought newspapers—except this
one day!
   Then a colleague of his learned that he was transferring his child to our
school. She decided to transfer her three children, too. Over the years that
man has kept his three children in the Adventist school and recommended
our school to 40 others.

          LESSON            9      *November 21–27


      The Sin of Moses and
      Aaron


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 20; 21; John 3:14, 15; James
      4:4–15.

Memory Text: “Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up
      thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and east-
      ward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
      Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27).

              fter years of wandering in the wilderness, Israel finally

      A       reached Kadesh-Barnea, on the southern border of the
              Promised Land. After all that they had gone through, all the
      hard lessons the Lord had sought to teach them, all the powerful judg-
      ments issued upon those who openly rebelled, one would have thought
      that these people, once and for all, finally would have been ready for
      the Lord to use them to their fullest potential. As we know, that wasn’t
      quite how it happened.
         This week we’ll study what is a perennial theme all through the
      Bible: the mercy and grace of God in contrast to the faithlessness, sin,
      and ingratitude of His people. From Adam and Eve in Eden to the
      Laodicean church today (Rev. 3:14–18), again and again we see God’s
      mercy and grace in dealing with those who more often than not failed
      to claim the promises of victory, faith, and holiness that He offers. At
      the same time, we can see His willingness to forgive those who stum-
      ble and fall, even those who should have known better, such as the
      great Moses himself, who, in a moment of weakness and impatience,
      lost sight of the God who had done so much for him. Thus, if even
      Moses can fall, what about the rest of us?

     When Giants Fall
        When the water ceased to flow at Israel’s encampment at Kadesh-
     Barnea, a grand opportunity presented itself for Israel to look to God
     for help. He always had provided for them in the past, so why should
     it be any different now? However, they quickly forgot the past and
     turned on Moses and Aaron with their old complaints.

Read Numbers 20:1–13. What did the Lord command Moses to do,
     and what did he do instead? Why do you think that this meek,
     faithful, and devoted servant of God showed such an uncharac-
     teristic lack of faith and trust?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        On one level, it’s easy to understand Moses’ frustration. First, he
     just had buried his sister and no doubt was feeling pain over that. And
     then to hear these people utter, basically, the same complaint that their
     forefathers had made years ago? Nevertheless, in the Lord’s eyes,
     none of this excused his behavior.
        “The water gushed forth in abundance to satisfy the host. But a great
     wrong had been done. Moses had spoken from irritated feeling. . . .
     When he took it upon himself to accuse them, he grieved the Spirit of
     God and wrought only harm to the people. His lack of patience and
     self-control was evident. Thus the people were given occasion to ques-
     tion whether his past course had been under the direction of God, and
     to excuse their own sins. Moses, as well as they, had offended God.
     His course, they said, had from the first been open to criticism and
     censure. They had now found the pretext which they desired for reject-
     ing all the reproofs that God had sent them through His servant.”
     —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 417.
        Even the most faithful and diligent servants of the Lord need to be
     careful. What makes this sin even worse was that it was done by some-
     one who had been given great privileges. Think of all that Moses had
     seen of God’s power; think of all the incredible revelations of the Lord
     that he had, again and again, witnessed. And yet, even with all that, he
     allowed self to rise up and dominate? What a warning this should be
     for the rest of us.
      Think of a time when you felt pushed over the edge and did
      something rash and sinful. How often did you wish you could
      have turned back the clock and undone the damage? What les-
      sons have you learned from this incident that, ideally, could help
      prevent you from doing the same thing again?

                                                                          73

     Death of Aaron
Read Numbers 20:23–29. What points seem pertinent here in the
     depiction of the death of Aaron? What lessons can we take away
     from this for ourselves and whatever work we are doing for the
     Lord?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Chapter 20 opened with the death of Miriam and ended with the
     death of Aaron. It’s clear that the older generation was passing on, and
     the new one was to take up where they had left off. We see the same
     thing in our church today. One generation goes, and a new one arises
     to pick up the mantle. The crucial question remains: How much will
     the new generation learn from the mistakes, as well as the successes,
     of the older one?
        Notice the difference in the accounts of the deaths of Miriam and
     Aaron. Her death was mentioned in just one short verse. It’s almost as
     if her death came suddenly and unexpectedly. What a contrast to
     Aaron’s, which is clearly foretold.
        Before Aaron’s death, Aaron, Moses, and Aaron’s son, Eleazar, go
     to the top of Mount Hor, where in the sight of the congregation Moses
     takes off his brother’s priestly garments and puts them on his nephew,
     Eleazar, a powerful symbol of the transference of the role of one gen-
     eration to another. Though Aaron was soon to be “gathered unto his
     people,” the work of the high priest must go on. In other words, the
     work and mission of the church is greater than any one man or
     woman. If we choose, we can do our duty faithfully, but sooner or later
     we pass from the scene, and others pick up where we have left off.
        It’s hard to imagine just how emotional this incident must have been
     for everyone involved. Moses, knowing that soon his death surely
     would follow, strips his brother of the sacred garments and places
     them on his nephew, Aaron’s son; Aaron, no doubt remorseful over
     some of his failures, knows that he is soon to die; and Eleazar, stand-
     ing before his father, who will soon die, now bears the heavy respon-
     sibility of the high priest. Meanwhile, down below, the children of Israel
     watch the whole thing unfold.

      If you were to die tomorrow, what legacy would you leave? What
      have you done for the Lord’s work? How can you better use the
      little time that you, as do any of us (James 4:13–15), have left?

     The Sin of Ingratitude
        Because the nation of Edom (descendants of Esau) refused to let
     Israel pass through its borders, it was necessary to go around it. (See
     Num. 20:14–21.) The Edomites occupied the territory extending south
     from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqabah.

Read Numbers 21:1–5.What were the people’s complaints? Think about
     all that had happened to them and all that they had gone through.
     Could there have been some justification for their complaints?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        However much they might have thought that they had reason to
     grumble, the Lord obviously didn’t agree. After all, every day of their
     travels they had been kept by a miracle of divine mercy. They had all
     the water they needed, even in a desert; they had bread from heaven to
     eat, angels’ food (Ps. 78:25); and they had peace and safety under the
     shadowy cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. There was not a
     feeble one in all their ranks. Their feet had not swelled on their long
     journeys, neither had their clothes “waxed . . . old” (Deut. 8:3, 4; Ps.
     105:37). No doubt, they had their struggles, their problems, their
     fears, as we all do. But apparently, focusing only on those problems,
     they forgot the divine blessings that had been theirs for so long.
     Indeed, perhaps that might have been their problem: so used to God’s
     mercy, grace, and provision, they started to take it for granted. And
     once we take things for granted, it’s very easy to forget about them.

What are some things that you take for granted in your life? Why is
     that such a foolish thing to do?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The only cure for this is to day by day thank the Lord for what He
     has given us. This is why praise is so important. God doesn’t need our
     praise; we need to praise the Lord as much as we can, for this serves
     as a constant reminder to us of just how much we have to be thankful
     for to the Lord.

      Write out your own psalm of praise. Put in it all things that you
      have to be thankful for. Imagine if you were to sing it every day.
      How could this help you from falling into the sin of ingratitude
      and the dangerous traps it can lead to?

                                                                         75

      The Fiery Serpents
        However much the people thought that they had valid things to
      complain about, it’s clear the Lord wasn’t sympathetic to their griev-
      ances. After all these years in the desert, all these years of seeing God
      working among them, what do they do but regurgitate the same old
      complaint about having been brought into the desert in order to be
      killed? No wonder the Lord wasn’t sympathetic. What made their
      complaints even worse was that they just had experienced a victory
      over the Canaanites.

Read Numbers 21:5–9. How again do we see Moses in the role of inter-
      cessor? Why, especially now, did the people need an intercessor?

      ____________________________________________________________________

        There are about 35 different species of snakes in Palestine. Some
      are extremely poisonous. The poisonous serpents that infested the
      wilderness were called “fiery serpents,” on account of the terrible
      effects produced by their sting. As the protecting hand of God was
      removed from Israel, great numbers of the people were attacked by
      these venomous creatures. In other words, it wasn’t that God sent
      them upon the Israelites; rather, the Lord took His protection away
      from them, and they then suffered the consequences.

Read John 3:14, 15. How does Jesus relate the incident with the ser-
      pents to the plan of salvation? In what sense have we all been bit-
      ten by fiery serpents?

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The existence of the bronze serpent on the pole wasn’t enough to
      stop the bites from killing people. They had to look; they had to make
      the choice to obey and then receive the benefits of the provision made
      in their behalf. In the same way, the death of Jesus itself automatically
      doesn’t bring salvation to the world. His death provided the means of
      salvation, but just as the people in the wilderness needed to look, we
      have to look to Jesus and believe in order to receive what He so freely
      and graciously offers.

       How have you known in your own life the healing power of
       Christ, even now? What other hurts do you need to bring to
       Him for consolation, healing, and strength to move on despite
       what seems like insurmountable pain?

            T HURSDAY November 26

     Early Conquests
        Nearly forty years earlier Israel attempted to attack the Canaanites in
     this same area and were beaten badly (Num. 14:40–45). That generation
     now had died during the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and a
     new one now was prepared to pick up where the older one had left off.

Read Numbers 21:10–33 and answer the following questions:

      • What promises did the Hebrews make to the pagan king Sihon?
      What was offered in those promises?
     _______________________________________________________

      • Who attacked whom? Vs. 23.
     _______________________________________________________

      • What difference was there between how the Israelites
      responded to King Sihon and King Og?
     _______________________________________________________

       “These nations on the borders of Canaan would have been spared,
     had they not stood, in defiance of God’s word, to oppose the progress
     of Israel. . . . Although the Amorites were idolaters, whose life was
     justly forfeited by their great wickedness, God spared them four hun-
     dred years. . . . All His wonders in bringing Israel from Egypt were
     known to them. Sufficient evidence was given.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 434.
       Note the difference in strategy in regard to the two kingdoms. No
     courteous request is made to pass peacefully through Og’s land.
     Rather, the Lord drew the king and his armies away from their cities
     that “were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars” (Deut. 3:5). Away
     from their defenses, Israel—under the guidance and promises of God
     through Moses—was able to defeat King Og and his Amorite army in
     the field.
       The victory over Sihon and Og—the kings of the Amorites in
     Transjordon—was immortalized forever in song (Pss. 135:10–12,
     136:18–26) and in the national memory (Judg. 11:18–22).

      Forty years later the children of Israel finally were entering the
      Promised Land. Look at all the time wasted, all due to their own
      lack of faith and trust, despite all the evidence that they had of
      God’s leading. How much precious time are you wasting, not
      moving ahead on faith? How can you better learn to trust in
      God’s promises and then to act on those promises now instead
      of wasting time?
                                                                           77
                      F RIDAY November 27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Smitten Rock,”
         pp. 411–421; “The Journey Around Edom,” pp. 422–432; “The
         Conquest of Bashan,” pp. 433–437, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “Nicodemus was being drawn to Christ. As the Saviour explained to
         him concerning the new birth, he longed to have this change wrought
         in himself. By what means could it be accomplished? Jesus answered
         the unspoken question: ‘As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder-
         ness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever
         believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.’
1           “Here was ground with which Nicodemus was familiar. The symbol
         of the uplifted serpent made plain to him the Saviour’s mission. When
         the people of Israel were dying from the sting of the fiery serpents, God
         directed Moses to make a serpent of brass, and place it on high in the
         midst of the congregation. Then the word was sounded throughout the
         encampment that all who would look upon the serpent should live. The
2        people well knew that in itself the serpent had no power to help them. It
         was a symbol of Christ. As the image made in the likeness of the
         destroying serpents was lifted up for their healing, so One made ‘in the
         likeness of sinful flesh’ was to be their Redeemer. . . . Whether for the
         healing of their wounds or the pardon of their sins, they could do noth-
         ing for themselves but show their faith in the Gift of God. They were to
         look and live.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 174, 175.
3   Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Think about the story of the fiery serpents. Talk about having
          to act on faith. That is, just by looking at the brazen serpent, the
          Israelites were promised to be spared what would otherwise have
          been a certain death. There was no natural explanation; their life
          depended upon a supernatural act on their behalf. How does that
          reflect the plan of salvation, as well? What should this tell us about
          just how helpless we are on our own, apart from God, for eternal
          life? How should this reality keep us humble?

          ●
          2 In what ways might we, either as individuals or as a church, be
          making some of the same mistakes as the children of Israel made?
          Why is it always so hard to see our own spiritual weak points?

    Summary: This segment of the book of Numbers focuses on the close
         of the 40 years of wandering. Grieving over the death of their sister
         Miriam, Moses and Aaron, in a state of anger, sin against the Lord.
         Later, the grumbling congregation, bitten by death-dealing snakes,
         found physical and spiritual healing by faith when they looked upon a
         bronze serpent the Lord commanded Moses to make and place before
         them. Following this humbling experience, the Lord enabled Israel to
         conquer the Amorites of Transjordan and to seize their territories.

Poured Out
and Running Over: Part 2
by JOANNE W. LAFEVER
   It looked as if our little mission school in Taiwan would close. Most of
the missionaries who had sent their children here were gone. Then God
showed us that He had other plans for our school. He transformed it into
a real mission school—a school for children whose parents wanted an
American—and a Christian—education.
   With God’s blessings the school enrollment increased. We have grown
from four classrooms to eight, from 50 students to more than 125. We are
bursting at the seams. We have remodeled the school and made major
improvements to our facility and our academic program. I’m sure that at
least some of these blessings have been the result of faithfully tithing our
increase.
   Nearly every student comes from a non-Adventist home, and our teach-
ers take seriously their commission to win souls for Jesus. Every year chil-
dren make decisions for Jesus as a result of studying at Taipei Adventist
American School and coming into contact with God’s message of love.
   Over the years many parents have told us that they wished we had a
Christian high school where their children could study when they com-
plete eighth grade. They didn’t want their children to have to travel to the
United States at such an early age just to continue their international edu-
cation. Taipei has three high schools that serve foreign students, but they
are quite secular. We wanted to see our students who had come to know
Jesus continue their education in an Adventist Christian academic envi-
ronment.
   So in 2004 we stepped out in faith and established an Adventist high
school for foreign students. Starting with just 18 students, the enrollment
has grown to more than 100. The school is providing a strong academic
program in a Christian setting, and it regularly places its students in
Adventist high schools and colleges in the United States. Not one of these
children is from an Adventist family, but they are learning about Jesus and
His love for them.
   Our name, Taipei Adventist American School, reflects our mission and
our faith. It has been exciting to see how God has opened the “windows of
heaven” and poured out blessings on our school as a result of taking Him
at His word. We know that as He has led us in the past, He will continue
to bless us if we take Him at His word. We have proved Him. He has abun-
dantly fulfilled His promises!
JOANNE W. LAFEVER is principal of Taipei Adventist American School in Taipei, Taiwan.

        LESSON            10 *November 28–December 4
      The “Madness” of the
      Prophet


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 22–24, Deut.
      1:30, 20:4, Matt. 15:14, 1 Cor. 2:14, 2 Pet. 2:14–16, Rev. 3:17.

Memory Text: “For the love of money is the root of all evil:
      which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith,
      and pierced themselves through with many sorrows” (1 Timothy
      6:10).

             he story of Balaam is well-known and often used to make jokes,

      T      such as, “Well, if God could talk through Balaam’s donkey, then
             He could talk through so-and-so.”
        In one sense, however, there’s nothing really funny about this story.
      Though it can be read on various levels, Balaam’s encounter with the
      Lord can be seen as another example of how sin, if not overcome, if
      not wrestled with through the power of God, can lead us into paths of
      destruction.
        Balaam is referred to in the New Testament three times (2 Pet. 2:15,
      16; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14), and none of the references are very flattering.
      On the contrary, he’s a prototype, a symbol, of sin.
        Peter talks about the “madness” of Balaam. Yet, it wasn’t the “mad-
      ness” of the mentally deranged; rather, it was the madness of someone
      who was so swept up into covetousness that he was ready to do what
      Balak asked, and all for money, regardless of how wrong it was.
        If someone like Balaam, a prophet, could be so “mad,” how much
      madder would we be to do something similar, especially with his
      example before us?

      A Fearful and Deluded King
         Try to put yourself in the position of Balak, king of Moab. Here was
      this massive horde that had come out of the great nation of Egypt and
      who had survived only by miracles (what else?) in the desert for four
      decades. And now they were camped “in the plains of Moab” (Num.
      22:1), not far from his kingdom.
         Even though the nation had not made any threats against them and
      wasn’t intending to invade, Balak, understandably, was nervous. After
      all, just look what they had done to King Og of Bashan and to King
      Sihon of the Amorites—whose nation already had defeated Moab (see
      Num. 21:26). Not to mention what they had done to the Canaanites
      (vss. 1–3), too. No wonder he was nervous.

Read Numbers 22:1–6. What was it about the Israelites that espe-
      cially made the king fearful?


In reality, if Israel had been a threat, what should Balak really have
      been afraid of? See Gen. 48:21, Exod. 15:1, Deut. 1:30, 20:4.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It’s kind of ironic that Balak, facing what he believed to be an insur-
      mountable foe, would seek out a prophet of the God of the very peo-
      ple he wanted cursed and defeated. Whether he realized what he was
      doing, we don’t know; but from our perspective, it’s obvious that
      Balak’s plans were doomed from the start. One only could wonder,
      too, why he didn’t get one of his own local holy men to petition the
      Moabite gods to defend them against Israel. Instead, he called upon a
      prophet of the true God. Perhaps the key to that is found in Numbers
      22:6: “ ‘Curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me.
      Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land,
      for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse
      is cursed’ ” (NKJV).

       Ask yourself how much you really seek to depend upon God and
       how much you trust in yourself, your money, your job, your tal-
       ents, whatever. How can you learn to get your eyes off these
       things and on the Lord? Why is that naturally hard to do? See
       1 Cor. 2:14.

     Balaam
        Who was this Balaam?
        “Balaam was once a good man and a prophet of God; but he had
     apostatized, and had given himself up to covetousness; yet he still pro-
     fessed to be a servant of the Most High. He was not ignorant of God’s
     work in behalf of Israel; and when the messengers announced their
     errand, he well knew that it was his duty to refuse the rewards of Balak
     and to dismiss the ambassadors. But he ventured to dally with temp-
     tation.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 439.

Read Numbers 22:7–21. On the surface, it looks as if Balaam is
     standing firm for the Lord. However, if you read carefully, what
     hints can you find of his playing with temptation?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Balaam had urged the messengers to tarry with him that night,
     declaring that he would give no decided answer till he had asked coun-
     sel of the Lord. Balaam must have realized that his curses would not
     hurt Israel, for Balaam knew, or at least had known, the Lord. He
     really didn’t need to ask the Lord; perhaps He did so hoping there
     would be another answer. Either way, by having them linger when he
     should have dismissed them right away, he opened himself up to temp-
     tation. After all, the men had come with “the fees for divination” (vs.
     7, NRSV).
        Notice what happened at the second invitation, when they promised
     him even more. God had said that “if the men come to call” he may
     go, provided he speak only what God said (vs. 20). But in the early
     morning—before the princes could say anything—Balaam saddled his
     donkey and rode off at once with ambassadors of Moab. In other
     words, despite all the pretense of faithfulness and his claims about not
     being able to be bought at any price, he was eager to get all the money
     that was offered to him.

      Read 2 Peter 2:14–16. How did Peter view the actions of
      Balaam? What warning is there for us regarding covetousness
      and temptation? Why is it so easy to rationalize away our sin to
      the point that it doesn’t seem sinful?

     Unnatural Confrontation
       Determined in his heart to get the rewards the king offered him,
     Balaam set out with the men toward Moab. Despite all Balaam’s outward
     professions of fidelity, which he even might have believed himself, the
     Lord knew what was going on in the man’s heart and responded to it.

Read Numbers 22:22–34 and answer the following questions:

      • What symbolic significance might there be to the fact that the
      dumb animal was able to see the angel of the Lord and that
      Balaam, a supposed prophet of God, couldn’t? See Zeph. 1:17,
      Matt. 15:14, Rev. 3:17.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      • Read Balaam’s first response to the donkey after it spoke to
      him. Think about what was happening. What does Balaam’s irra-
      tional response reveal about the true nature of his heart and his
      desire for wealth? After all, what would most people do were an
      animal to start conversing with them?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      • How does this story reveal God’s grace, even to Balaam, despite
      his course of action?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        A lot has been written over the centuries regarding this, one of the
     stranger stories in the Bible. Different commentators come away with
     different interpretations. One point, though, seems clear: Balaam was
     a man who had a special connection with the Lord. After all, the Lord
     still was speaking with Him in an intimate manner. And yet, even with
     this connection, Balaam was determined to do what he himself wanted.

      In what ways, even the most subtle ways, do you find yourself
      fighting against the Lord? That is, you’re determined to do
      what you want even though you know it’s not what God wants.
      How can you overcome this dangerous attitude?
                                                                        83

     “The Death of the Righteous”
       After the incident with the donkey, Balaam came to Balak. It is
     interesting to note that Balak brought Balaam to “the high places of
     Baal” (Num. 22:41). Apparently, Near Eastern pagans built their
     shrines on the tops of mountains so as to be nearer the gods whom
     they wished to influence. Balaam ordered the king to build at this
     place seven altars and offer seven bullocks and seven rams thereon.

Read the words that Balaam, controlled by God, spoke over the chil-
     dren of Israel. What powerful message, and promise, is found in
     them? What hope is offered to us all in them, as well? See Num.
     23:5–10; see also 1 Corinthians 15.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       “He saw them supported by His arm as they enter the dark valley of
     the shadow of death. And he beheld them coming forth from their
     graves, crowned with glory, honor, and immortality. He saw the
     redeemed rejoicing in the unfading glories of the earth made new.
     Gazing upon the scene, he exclaimed, ‘Who can count the dust of
     Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?’ And as he saw the
     crown of glory on every brow, the joy beaming from every counte-
     nance, and looked forward to that endless life of unalloyed happiness,
     he uttered the solemn prayer, ‘Let me die the death of the righteous,
     and let my last end be like his!’ ”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 447.

What does it mean to “die the death of the righteous”? What is the
     only way we can die such a death? Rom. 3:20–24.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      In a sense, these words of God uttered over His ancient people
      reflect the gospel promise of all of God’s people in every age, the
      promise of eternal life because of the righteousness of Jesus.
      None of us are righteous; none of us live or die in and of our-
      selves with enough righteousness to deliver us from the grave.
      Only the righteousness of Jesus can, which is credited to us by
      faith. Here, in the book of Numbers, with the story of Balaam,
      God is revealing to us the promise of salvation through Jesus.

     Star and Scepter
       Imagine the king’s surprise when Balaam began to bless Israel.
     Although angry, the king still wasn’t ready to give up. He took the
     prophet to another mountain peak where he could see only a small
     part of Israel and built another seven altars, offering again bullocks
     and rams. Balaam “went not, as at other times, to seek for enchant-
     ments” (Num. 24:1). Yet again, instead of Balak getting the curse that
     he was willing to pay so much for, Balaam—under the control of
     God—uttered another blessing over Israel. A third time Balak
     arranged for seven altars and their sacrifices on another peak, but
     Balaam knew it was useless to ask God for permission to use magic
     on Israel. Looking on Israel’s encampment from this third angle, he
     blessed the nation again (Num. 23:27–30, 24:1–10), and Balak sent
     him home in disgrace for his failure to curse Israel.

Read the parable Balaam told in Numbers 24:15–17. What was this
     a prophecy of, and how was it fulfilled? Gen. 49:10; Matt. 2:1, 2.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “Seeking clearer knowledge, [the wise men] turned to the Hebrew
     Scriptures. . . . Balaam belonged to the magicians, though at one time
     a prophet of God; by the Holy Spirit he had foretold the prosperity of
     Israel and the appearing of the Messiah. . . . The prophecy of Balaam
     had declared, ‘There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter
     shall rise out of Israel.’. . . Could this strange star have been sent as a
     harbinger of the Promised One?”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
     Ages, pp. 59, 60.
        Bible students long have seen in these words a Messianic predic-
     tion, that of the coming Redeemer, Jesus. The image of a scepter
     (power) and a star (light) both are apt symbols of Jesus. Though the
     Lord used, at the time of the prophecy itself, local symbols, which
     would have meaning to those who heard it then, the principle behind
     the prophecy—that of Christ’s power and victory—apply to the whole
     world. Jesus is the Light of the world and the rightful Owner of it, and
     no matter what humans’ plans are, in the end the whole world will see
     Him prevail. See Isa. 45:23, Rom. 14:11, Phil. 2:10.

      However much injustice in the world, we have the promise that
      God will prevail and that justice will, as well. How does that
      promise help you cope with all the injustice you see now?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Balaam,” pp. 438–452, in
         Patriarchs and Prophets; “The Beatitudes,” pp. 17–44; “The
         Spirituality of the Law,” pp. 45–58, in Thoughts From the Mount of
         Blessing.

           “He who will abuse animals because he has them in his power is
         both a coward and a tyrant. A disposition to cause pain, whether to our
1
         fellow men or to the brute creation, is satanic. Many do not realize that
         their cruelty will ever be known, because the poor dumb animals can-
         not reveal it. But could the eyes of these men be opened, as were those
         of Balaam, they would see an angel of God standing as a witness, to
         testify against them in the courts above. A record goes up to heaven,
         and a day is coming when judgment will be pronounced against those
2
         who abuse God’s creatures.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
         Prophets, p. 443.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What are some other spiritual lessons we can take away from
          the story of Balaam? What does it teach, for instance, about
          God’s sovereignty, about human free will and God’s providence,
          or about human sinfulness?
3

          _____________________________________________________
          ●
          2 Dwell more on this idea of the “death of the righteous.” If you
          were to die today, would it be a “death of the righteous”? Justify
          your answer.

          _____________________________________________________
          ●3 Money is such an incredibly corrupting influence in all areas
          of life, including our religious life. How can we, as Christians,
          protect ourselves, our faith, and our church from the potentially
          corrupting influence of money?

          _____________________________________________________
          ●4 Read Jude 11 and Revelation 2:14, which, aside from the
          verses we already looked at in 2 Peter, are the only other New
          Testament references to Balaam. What can we learn from them
          that can help us better understand where Balaam went astray?

          _____________________________________________________
    Summary: The account of Balaam’s attempt to curse Israel in return
         for riches and honor brings out into the open his inordinate greed and
         covetousness. The tenth commandment warns us away from this sin-
         ful human trait. None of us is immune to this, or to any other sin,
         which if not overcome can lead to our final ruin. How important it is
         that we learn from Balaam’s mistakes.

Christmas Gift for Jesus
by SOLANGE DELAI ARAÚJO
   The church I attend in Brazil is just four years old, but the members are
active missionaries for God, and many have been added to God’s family as a
result.
   Brother Carlos Ari has been an active church member and lay leader for 15
years. During these years, he has shared God’s love with many people. Doing
so filled him with great joy. Many of those who had asked for baptism had
been led to Christ by Brother Ari, but Maria, his wife, had not yet committed
her life to Christ.
   Sometimes Maria attended church with her husband and children. And she
even participated in some church activities. She especially enjoyed helping
out in our community to relieve the suffering of the poor. She taught her chil-
dren to walk in the ways of the Lord, but she had never given her life to
Christ. Carlos couldn’t understand what was holding his wife back from
making such an important decision.
   Once when the pastor visited Carlos and Maria he invited Maria to give her
life completely to Jesus and seal her commitment with baptism. But her
response disappointed him. “The more you speak of baptism, the longer it
will take to become a reality,” she said. The pastor saw the sad look on
Carlos’s face. Later he spoke with Carlos alone and encouraged him to con-
tinue praying for his wife. He assured the pastor that he was not discouraged
and would continue to seek souls for the kingdom of heaven. Carlos contin-
ued to pray for his wife and share God’s love whenever he could. But he saw
no change in her life.
   Christmas arrived, and the church planned a special worship service, titled
“Gifts for Jesus.” The service included a baptism, and some of the people to
be baptized were people Carlos had helped prepare for this moment. Maria
attended with her husband, and her presence brought obvious joy to his heart.
   Following the pastor’s message we witnessed a baptism. The pastor intro-
duced each person as a Christmas gift to Jesus. Then the last candidate
stepped into the pool. It was Maria. With tears streaming down his face,
Carlos and his children walked to the front of the church so he could witness
this special moment—a special gift to God and to the family. They had
prayed for this moment and didn’t want to miss it!
   At last Carlos can say, “As for me and my [entire] household, we will serve
the Lord” (Josh. 24:15, NIV).
   Your mission offerings are gifts to God every day. They make it possible to
lead thousands to the feet of Jesus, gifts to the Savior.

      Immorality on the
      Border


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 25, 31, Deut.
      21:10–14, 1 Cor. 10:1–14, Rev. 2:14.

Memory Text: “Neither let us commit fornication, as some of
      them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand”
      (1 Corinthians 10:8).

              ere again we see the same theme running through the book of

      H       Numbers: God’s people, led so clearly and powerfully by Him,
              still making wrong choices, still showing a lack of faith, still
      falling into the most flagrant disobedience. All God wanted to do,
      from the start, was bring them into the Promised Land; and time and
      again, all they were doing, by their choices, was making it so much
      more difficult for that to happen.
        No question about it: God’s overriding providence succeeded then,
      and will succeed. Just as He brought His ancient covenant people into
      the Promised Land, He will do the same in the end time for us. How
      much better, though, if we would cooperate with Him rather than work
      against His purposes.
        This week we’ll look at one of the greatest breaches of faith in all
      of Old Testament history, the apostasy at Shittim. And though it hap-
      pened thousands of years ago in a culture and context radically differ-
      ent from ours today, the spiritual parallels are there, and they should
      shout a loud warning to God’s church, also on the borders of the
      Promised Land.

     Seduction
       Numbers 25:1 reads: “While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men
     began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women” (NIV).
     Just a clear-cut statement of fact, nothing more.
       The text says that “Israel was staying” in Shittim. That is, they
     weren’t going anywhere. They were at rest. At ease, really, because
     they just had finished a number of successful conquests: they had
     beaten the Canaanites (Num. 21:1–3), the Amorites (vss. 21–31), and
     the folk under the rule of King Og of Bashan (vss. 33–35). And now
     they were on the borders of the Promised Land, just across the Jordan
     River.
       In other words, after numerous mistakes and setbacks, things were
     going quite well. They were in no immediate danger from warring
     armies, because they readily had dispatched all of these military
     threats. Hence, they were able to take it easy.

Read Numbers 25:1–3. What were the steps involved here in this
     apostasy? How did something so terrible happen?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Sex, food, idolatry—it was all there on the shores of the Jordan.
     According to the order seen in the texts, they first had sexual relations
     with the women, which clearly broke down barriers. And then it was
     at the invitation of these women that the men sacrificed to their pagan
     gods and then eventually bowed down and worshiped them.
        Again, from our perspective, it’s hard to understand how something
     like this could happen. They should have known better, right? At the
     same time, here they were, mingling with these people, probably not
     much at first, but then, over time, more and more. Slowly but surely
     their guard was let down; and before they knew it, they were ensnared
     by lust and passion. Once they had fallen into that trap, anything was
     possible.
        We fool ourselves when we think we are less vulnerable to the
     deceptions of sin of any kind.

      Read 1 Corinthians 10:1–14. How can we apply the lessons there
      to ourselves, today, in whatever situation we are in? What simi-
      lar temptations do we face in our own contexts? What promise
      can we take from these words and make our own?

     Behind the Scenes
Read Revelation 2:14 and Numbers 31:16. What insight do they give
     us into what was going on here with Israel at Shittim? How does
     this help us understand how they fell?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Unable to succeed one way, their enemies (the Moabites and the
     Midianites) now tried another, and it worked so much better. The prin-
     ciple should be clear: As long as we are acting in faith and obedience,
     a lot of doors to sin, deception, and ruin are closed. Once, however,
     we move away from doing what we should, anything can happen. How
     crucial, then, that we seek to stay on the path of obedience.
        “At Balaam’s suggestion, a grand festival in honor of their gods was
     appointed by the king of Moab, and it was secretly arranged that
     Balaam should induce the Israelites to attend. He was regarded by them
     as a prophet of God, and hence had little difficulty in accomplishing
     his purpose. Great numbers of the people joined him in witnessing the
     festivities. They ventured upon the forbidden ground, and were entan-
     gled in the snare of Satan. Beguiled with music and dancing, and
     allured by the beauty of heathen vestals, they cast off their fealty to
     Jehovah. As they united in mirth and feasting, indulgence in wine
     beclouded their senses and broke down the barriers of self-control.
     Passion had full sway; and having defiled their consciences by lewd-
     ness, they were persuaded to bow down to idols. They offered sacrifice
     upon heathen altars and participated in the most degrading rites.
         “It was not long before the poison had spread, like a deadly infec-
     tion, through the camp of Israel. Those who would have conquered
     their enemies in battle were overcome by the wiles of heathen women.
     The people seemed to be infatuated. The rulers and the leading men
     were among the first to transgress, and so many of the people were
     guilty that the apostasy became national. ‘Israel joined himself unto
     Baalpeor [a Moabite god worshipped at Mount Peor].’ When Moses
     was aroused to perceive the evil, the plots of their enemies had been
     so successful that not only were the Israelites participating in the
     licentious worship at Mount Peor, but the heathen rites were coming
     to be observed in the camp of Israel.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
     and Prophets, pp. 454, 455.

      Time and time again we see the same principle at play: God
      doing so much for His people, God promising so much to His
      people, and they—in response—destroying themselves. What
      about you? What has God promised you, and how are you
      responding to those promises?

      Sin and Punishment
         The fact that these men fell into a trap didn’t, obviously, excuse
      their sin. If they had obeyed the Lord to begin with, if they had kept
      His commandments, if they had done what they knew was right and
      not slowly opened themselves up to temptation, this dreadful apostasy
      and suffering never would have occurred. No doubt, at first, they had
      no intention of going as far as they did. After all, they were just going
      to a party, that’s all. And because Balaam, a prophet of their own God,
      had invited them, what could be wrong with that? How quickly,
      though, things got out of hand.

What other examples in the Bible can you find of people opening the
      door to sin that eventually led to horrific consequences, conse-
      quences that they probably never imagined would come?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        No question, all through the Bible we see this same thing happen-
      ing, again and again. From Eve in Eden to Judas in Jerusalem, those
      who should have known better, those who had been warned, those who
      had great light, nevertheless chose to ignore that light and—no doubt
      justifying and rationalizing their actions—fell into sins that brought
      devastating consequences. Who of us, perhaps, hasn’t experienced
      this same thing in their own lives? God calls us to obey Him, not
      because He’s a demanding tyrant but because He loves His children
      and knows what’s best for us.

Read Numbers 25:4, 5. Why such a strong reaction? See also vss. 8, 9.
      What lesson can we take away from this for ourselves?

      ____________________________________________________________________
        Think how painful it must have been for Israelites to have to kill
      other Israelites. Indeed, it seems as though each tribe may have had the
      responsibility of executing those of their own who were involved in
      this apostasy. Thus, some might have had to execute members of their
      immediate family! And to do it in broad daylight (literally “in front of
      the sun”). It must have been a terrible experience for the whole camp.

       What do you do with someone close to you who is partaking of
       a sinful practice that can have a harmful impact on you and oth-
       ers? What is your responsibility and duty in such a situation? To
       whom can you turn for help in knowing how to respond?

                                                                           91

     Open Sin
       It’s hard to imagine the chaos, confusion, and pain that must have
     been going on among the Israelites at this time. We get an inkling of
     the pain, at least, in Numbers 25:6, which said that the people “were
     weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” (NIV). Weeping, no
     doubt, for the apostasy, for the suffering, and for their dead kinsmen.
     Also, with a plague ravaging the camp, they might have been weeping
     for themselves and their family, as well, fearful that they might be
     next. The fact that they were at the tent of meeting means that they
     were imploring the Lord to end the devastation.

Read Numbers 25:6–18. How do we understand what was going on
     here? What lessons can we take away from this story?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Though the text doesn’t come out and explicitly say it, one could
     read into the text that the Israelite man, Zimri, was having a sexual
     relationship with the woman when Phinehas came into the tent and
     thrust his javelin through them both. However harsh all this might
     seem, think about the circumstances. The whole camp is weeping and
     pleading with the Lord because of what was happening, and this
     man—so audacious and open in his sin—brings this Midianite woman
     into the camp before all of them and then takes her into the tent and
     has sexual relations with her. All the while a plague is ravaging the
     camp! What made it even worse was that Zimri came from a house of
     princes; that is, he was part of royal stock and thus should have known
     better. He must have been so deceived, so consumed with lust, that the
     sight of the camp weeping before the tabernacle didn’t slow him down
     at all.
        All through the Bible, we see examples of how sin clouds the rea-
     soning powers and leads people to do some of the most unthinkable
     and irrational things. Think of Cain, of David with Bathsheba, of
     Judas betraying Jesus. No wonder the Bible, time and again, warns us
     against sin. It’s not that God can’t forgive our sin; it’s that the sin can
     so warp us that we can get to the point that we don’t even see it as sin
     any longer.

      In your own walk with the Lord, how have you experienced the
      reality of how the practice of sin hardens you to just how bad it
      really is? What can you do to break out of this deadly unspiri-
      tual trap?

     Destruction of the Midianites
        After the terrible devastation at Shittim, the Lord commanded Israel to
     attack the Midianites, the ones who had—through their deceptions—
     brought such suffering to His people. Justice was going to be done. This
     particular branch of the Midianites had given themselves completely
     over to idolatry and all its attendant evils. Like the Amorites, this clan of
     Midian had “filled up the cup of their iniquity.”—Ellen G. White, Review
     and Herald, May 2, 1893. And the Lord decreed their destruction.

Read Numbers 31, the story of the destruction of the Midianites.
     What are some of the hard things in this account that make it dif-
     ficult for us to understand today?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Killing all the people, even the children, is hard enough for us to
     understand. We just have to trust in the revelation we have of God as
     revealed to us through Jesus Christ and accept that there are things we
     don’t understand from our perspective, things not revealed to us.
        Many find Numbers 31:13–18 particularly disturbing, and under-
     standably so. But we should keep a few things in mind. Many of these
     Midianite women were the ones directly involved in the deception that
     led to thousands upon thousands of deaths; hence, they were reaping
     the punishment for their sins. But what about the young girls, the vir-
     gins, who probably had done nothing?
        Suppose the Lord said to just leave them be? These helpless young
     women would be left alone, with all their parents dead, their whole
     social structure destroyed. What could happen to them in the harsh and
     dangerous world at that time? This way, by being taken into the Israelite
     camp, these women not only would be protected from whatever dangers
     they would have faced had they been left alone; they also would be
     treated well by the Israelites. After all, Israelite law demanded that.

      Read Deuteronomy 21:10–14. How does this help us better
      understand what was going on with those women who were
      taken as prisoners by the Israelites? In what ways does this help
      us better understand Numbers 31?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Apostasy at the Jordan,”
          pp. 453–461, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

             “It was when the Israelites were in a condition of outward ease and
          security that they were led into sin. . . . They neglected prayer and cher-
          ished a spirit of self-confidence. . . . A long preparatory process,
          unknown to the world, goes on in the heart before the Christian commits
          open sin. The mind does not come down at once from purity and holi-
1
          ness to depravity, corruption, and crime. It takes time to degrade those
          formed in the image of God to the brutal or the satanic. By beholding
          we become changed. By the indulgence of impure thoughts man can so
          educate his mind that sin which he once loathed will become pleasant
          to him.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 459.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●1 One of the greatest gifts God has given to human beings is the
           gift of sexuality. It’s also been one of the most abused, one that
           Satan uses again and again, and with great success, to ensnare and
           ruin those who love God and want to serve Him. How can we help
           each other in this area? What choices can we make regarding
           dress, language, decorum, what we watch in the media, and behav-
3
           ior in general that can remove stumbling blocks and temptation in
           regard to a sin that has led to so much suffering among us?
           ____________________________________________________
           ●
           2 Think of the devastation that this sin caused in the camp.
           Think of the suffering of the people as a whole. What should this
           tell us about how, as a church community, we have a responsibil-
           ity to deal with sin among us?
           ____________________________________________________
           ●3 The Israelites didn’t fall into this sin overnight. It was a step-
           by-step process. What about us as a church today? Are we letting
           down our guard regarding things that could, ever so slightly,
           allow us to become hardened to what will lead us into Satan’s
           traps? What role does the issue of standards play in this impor-
           tant area? How can standards help protect us against this slow
           and steady move toward apostasy and ruin? Or can they at all?
           Or, if they can help us, how should they be applied?
           ____________________________________________________
    Summary: Israel’s moral collapse on the borders of Canaan may serve as
          an example of one method Satan will use to cause God’s people to apos-
          tatize in these end times. “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into tempta-
          tion: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak” (Matt. 26:41).

Trouble in the Village
by BARNABAS SIRCAR
  I am a teenager living in the extreme southern part of Bangladesh. Six
years ago an Adventist pastor came to our village. He visited every home,
sharing God’s love with those who would listen. Because many of the chil-
dren in the village attended a Protestant school outside the village, some
people were willing to hear about Jesus. Two years later 20 people were
ready for baptism. Among them were my parents, my elder sister, and I.
  But not everyone in the village was happy that we had become
Adventists. The Protestant church leaders accused the Adventists of steal-
ing their members. They united with the non-Christians to force the pas-
tor to leave the area and make us return to our former religion. We faced
many problems at that time. But even when we were forbidden to use the
village well and had to dig our own well, we clung to our newfound faith.
  The villagers then went to the police and accused us Adventists of
destroying their idols, which lay broken into pieces under the tree where
they had once stood. The land on which this tree stood belonged to my
family, and we were targeted by the accusations. We couldn’t prove that we
were innocent, so we turned to God. We fasted and prayed that God would
intercede for us. If we lost the case, we could be fined a large sum of
money or be thrown into prison.
  The police listened to both sides of the case. After we presented our
side, we continued to pray that God would reveal the real troublemakers.
Suddenly chaos broke out among the non-Christians in the crowd. People
hurled accusations at one another. “You broke the idol and blamed the
Adventists!” one shouted. “No, you broke the idol!” another yelled.
Eventually the truth came out that the non-Christians had broken their own
idol and blamed the Adventists.
                             Finally peace came to the village. The
                           Protestant church leaders in the village still try
                           to drive us out of the village, but we pray that
                           God will soften their hearts so they can hear
                           the message of hope and peace in Jesus.
                             Your mission offerings help send lay evan-
                           gelists into villages such as ours, to teach the
                           people and lead them to Jesus. Then they help
                           to build simple chapels in which to worship.
                           Thank you.

        LESSON            12 *December 12–18
      The Second Generation:
      Admonitions


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 26–32, Romans 5.

Memory Text: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord:
      And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
      with all thy soul, and with all thy might” (Deuteronomy 6:4, 5).

             rue to His Word that the rebellious generation who had refused

      T      to enter the Promised Land would not enter it, the Lord now
             brought a new generation to the borders of that same land.
      There He directed Moses and the high priest, Eleazar, to number the
      congregation of males from 20 years and upward, “all that are able to
      go to war” (Num. 26:2). Surprisingly, the total in this second count
      amounted to 601,730 (vs. 51), nearly the same as that in the first
      count, 603,550, 40 years before (Num. 2:32). In spite of the divine
      judgment on the nation, in which the first generation (except for
      Joshua and Caleb) perished, God had multiplied them abundantly, and
      the armies of Israel mustered in the plains of Moab were for all prac-
      tical purposes as large as those of the first generation.
         Many questions, however, remained: Was this new generation, hav-
      ing lived with the results of their parents’ bad mistakes, ready to learn
      from those mistakes and obey the Lord? How ready were they to take
      up the mantle now given to them? What lessons were they going to
      have to learn, and what can we learn from them, as well?

     Land Division
        After the debacle at Shittim, a census was taken of the males 20
     years of age and older (Num. 26:1–4). With just a few notable excep-
     tions (see vss. 64, 65), the older generation had died off, and a new
     one had appeared.

What was one of the reasons that the census was taken? Why would
     this be important? Num. 26:52–56.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Once the second generation had conquered the land, it needed to be
     divided fairly; otherwise, this could have become a source of fighting
     and confusion. Fortunately, Moses was still living and could direct in
     this important matter. As the text states, those tribes with a lot of
     members were given the most land; those with fewer, less. What could
     be fairer than that?

Read Numbers 27:1–11. What important principles do we see being
     made manifest here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        A key element here is the sanctity of the family, especially in regard
     to property and the rights of inheritance. It’s clear that the idea was to
     keep the property as close as possible within the family. The land, after
     all, was an “inheritance,” and so it belonged in the family.
        As we see, too, this was not a one-time deal. Because these women
     had the faith and courage to approach Moses over an issue of basic
     fairness, the Lord established a “statute of judgment” (Num. 27:11)
     that would endure for future generations and would protect women
     who might have found themselves in similar circumstances.

      It’s always so easy to let things like possessions dominate us so
      that we forget even the most basic Christian principles. How can
      we protect ourselves from allowing our desire for things to ruin
      our relationship with God and with others?

     Successor
       After so many years in the wilderness, the children of Israel were
     soon to make their crossing into the Promised Land. A new generation
     had arisen that was soon to inherit the land first promised to them
     when still in the loins of Abraham many centuries earlier (Gen. 17:8).
     Thus, despite the setbacks, the rebellions, the murmuring, the lack of
     faith in His people, God was going to fulfill His word. He was just
     going to do it with another generation, that’s all.

Read Numbers 27:12–23 and answer the following questions:

      • In Numbers 27:12 the Lord talks about the land that He has
      “given” (in the past tense) to the children of Israel, even though
      they were not there yet. What does that tell us about God’s prom-
      ises?

     ____________________________________________________________________

      • After the Lord told Moses again that he could not cross into this
      land because of his sin, how does Moses respond? That is, what is
      Moses’ main concern? What does that tell us about the kind of
      man he was?

      • Why was it important that Joshua be given his charge before all
      the congregation?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Moses was soon to die, his work being done. The charge was now
     given to Joshua, Moses’ appointed successor. How interesting that it
     wasn’t one of Moses’ sons but, instead, someone who had proved his
     own worth. God, not Moses or the congregation, chose Joshua.
       Also, the texts make it clear that, as with Moses, Joshua was to lead
     only through the guidance of God; that is, besides the written laws and
     commandments, he also was to seek the Lord’s will through the “judg-
     ment of [the] Urim before the Lord” (vs. 21).

      How often do you seek the Lord in prayer regarding important
      decisions you need to make? Upon what basis do you make your
      decisions, if not through seeking God’s will?

     Sacrificial System Reaffirmed
        When the Lord spoke audibly the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20)
     from Mount Sinai and commanded the building of the tabernacle
     (Exodus 25), the second generation would have been children. Now
     God chooses to reaffirm, in summary form, the sacrificial system to
     the adult second generation.
        Numbers 28:1–8 describes the “daily” or “continual” offering of a
     lamb in the morning and one in the evening. It was arranged in such
     a manner that this sacrifice always was burning (Lev. 6:9, 13). This
     “daily” or “continual” was the sanctuary’s centerpiece. It took priority
     over all other sacrifices and was central to Israel’s worship. This sac-
     rifice represented the constant availability of God’s forgiveness and
     acceptance through the Redeemer prefigured in the sacrifice.

Read Romans 5. What does that tell us about the fullness and com-
     pleteness of Christ’s sacrifice for us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       On the Sabbath day (apart from the “daily”), a special sacrifice was
     made. It consisted of two lambs, morning and evening (Num. 28:9,
     10). Then, Numbers 28:11–15 details the sacrifices for the new moon,
     which then was followed by the festivals: Passover, Pentecost (Feast of
     Weeks), the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast
     of Tabernacles (Numbers 28, 29).
       “Some wonder why God desired so many sacrifices and appointed
     the offering of so many bleeding victims in the Jewish economy.
       “Every dying victim was a type of Christ, which lesson was
     impressed on mind and heart in the most solemn, sacred ceremony,
     and explained definitely by the priests. Sacrifices were explicitly
     planned by God Himself to teach this great and momentous truth, that
     through the blood of Christ alone there is forgiveness of sins.”—Ellen G.
     White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 107.

      Why is it so important to trust only in Christ’s merits and righ-
      teousness, as opposed to anything in ourselves, as the only means
      of salvation? What happens if we start looking to ourselves, as
      if somehow we could be good enough to deserve or earn our sal-
      vation?

      Keeping Your Word
Read Numbers 30 regarding vows and oaths. What important prin-
      ciple can we take away from this chapter for ourselves today?
      What does this tell us about the importance of our words? What
      warnings should we take away from here too?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It’s one thing to flat-out lie; that’s obviously sinful and wrong. But
      that’s not what’s being talked about here. How often have we made a
      solemn promise, or a vow in the Lord’s name, that we absolutely
      intended to keep at the time, only to eventually break it for one reason
      or another?
         In this immediate context, we’re dealing with vows made “unto the
      Lord,” but in reality, when we—especially as professing Christians—say
      that we are going to do something, we should follow through on it. That
      we intended to do it at the time we said it will make little difference to
      the one to whom we make the promises. Maybe the individual will
      believe us, maybe not. The point is, as professed Christians, what kind
      of representative of Christ are we if we are going around making prom-
      ises or vows that—for whatever reason—we end up not keeping? What
      good is our religion if we don’t keep our word? That’s why it is crucial
      that we be very careful in what we promise or make vows about,
      because we might find ourselves in the embarrassing position of not
      being able to follow through, no matter how good our intentions.
         “The obligation to which one’s word is pledged—if it do[es] not
      bind him to perform a wrong act—should be held sacred.”—Ellen G.
      White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 506. In Israelite culture, failure to
      keep one’s promise, sworn in the name of God, was regarded as a sin
      of omission. In a real sense, failure to fulfill a vow is taking His name
      in vain, especially if we are Christians who, ideally, do all things in the
      name of Christ.

       How many times have you made vows and promises to others, to
       God, or to yourself that you have broken? What can you learn
       from these experiences? What promises can you claim that will
       help prevent this from happening continually?

     On the Borders
       After all this time, a new generation has arisen, one more than ready
     to leave the wilderness and finally have a home to call their own.
     Some were, indeed, more than ready to settle down.

Read Numbers 32:1–5. What is going on here? Why would they make
     this request?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In Numbers 32:6–15, Moses gives his response. He’s not happy, and
     he views their actions as sinful. He compares it to what happened the
     last time they were on the borders and ready to cross over. Except that
     this time, their reasons were different. The first time they were simply
     scared of the people in the land and didn’t trust the Lord enough to go
     over. This situation wasn’t like that one. They weren’t afraid to go
     over; instead they liked it where they were and wanted to remain there.

How did the leaders of Reuben and Gad respond, and how did Moses
     respond in return? Num. 32:16–42.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The response of the Reubenites and Gadites showed that they were
     willing to do their part for the rest of their countrymen. That is, how-
     ever much they wanted the land that they already possessed, they
     weren’t going to be selfish about it. However much they were seduced
     by what they possessed, they were going to make sure the rest of the
     Israelites got their possessions as well before they settled down to
     enjoy their own.
        Seeing their willingness, Moses, though warning them that “your
     sin will find you out [vs. 23],” nevertheless took them at their word
     and agreed on the stated conditions.

      Think about your own relationship to the church body as a
      whole. How much are you seeking to give to the church, in con-
      trast to how much you take from it? What does your answer tell
      you about yourself? At the same time, might there not be times
      that, because of circumstances, you need to take more than you
      can give?

                                                                        101

    Further Study: Study the following texts regarding specific points
          Moses chose to remind the second generation of Israelites about. His
          remarks are based on the principle: “We have nothing to fear for the
          future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His
          teaching in our past history.”—Ellen G. White, Life Sketches, p. 196.

             • Shittim plague in which 24,000 died (Num. 25:9, 26:1)
             • Korah, Dathan, and Abiram’s rebellion (Num. 26:9–11)
             • Er and Onan, sons of Judah (vs. 19)
             • Nadab and Abihu, priestly sons of Aaron (vs. 61)
             • The first generation died in the wilderness, except Caleb and
               Joshua (vss. 63–65)

             Most of these events listed by Moses were events the second gener-
          ation experienced. Why allude to these tragedies in Hebrew history?
          The apostle Paul explains: “Now all these things happened unto them
          for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
          the ends of the world are come” (1 Cor. 10:11).

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 How can one generation pass to the next generation its values,
           beliefs, and zeal? Or can it? Or look at it this way: Should one
           generation expect the next one to have the same kind of experi-
           ences and faith that it had? Discuss.

            ____________________________________________________
           ____________________________________________________
           ●2 Dwell more on the question of what our role is in the church.
           First, what is the role of the church as a whole? How do we fit in
           with that role? Should we always be in a position of giving? When
           is it appropriate to take?
           ____________________________________________________
           ____________________________________________________
           ●3 As we have studied the children of Israel on the move in the
           wilderness, what mistakes have they made that we are in danger
           of making, as well? What main lessons can we learn from what
           they have done? More important, what can we do to ensure that
           we don’t fall into the same traps? Or if we already have, how can
           we get out of them?
           ____________________________________________________
           ____________________________________________________
    Summary: While Moses still lived, it was fitting that God instructed
          him to give final instructions to the second generation, reaffirm the
          faith, and also to appoint Joshua as the nation’s new leader under God.

Divine Appointment
by BARNABAS HOPE
   As a worker for God in a country that is not friendly to evangelism, I
pray that He will go before me and prepare the hearts of people to receive
His word. And He does.
   While walking down the street one day, I passed a small key shop. Two
men stood inside talking. One held an old book. They must be reading the
Koran, I thought as I passed. I finished my errand and turned toward
home. I decided to have a key made so I could talk to those men.
   “What are you doing in this country?” the key maker asked as he
worked. I told him that I was associated with a travel agency in town. The
man still held the old book in his hand. It had been marked with several
colors of ink. I knew that people didn’t normally write in the Koran. Then
I realized that it was a Bible.
   I paid him for the key and prepared to leave. As I walked by the man’s
Bible, I laid my hand on it and said, “This is a great book. You would do
well to keep reading it.”
   “That’s my Bible,” he said, smiling slightly. “I bought it many years
ago.” Then he asked what faith I followed. I told him I was a Seventh-day
Adventist believer.
   “Oh,” he said, “I know about them. I’ve read about Adventists on the
Internet. Do Seventh-day Adventists have any books I can get?” I told him
we did, and he asked me to bring him one.
   Just the morning before this unexpected meeting, my family had read
the story of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch for worship. We talked about
the lesson this story held that we never know when we will meet someone
whom the Holy Spirit has already prepared, and that we must be prepared
to teach them when God places them in our path.
   As I walked home from the key shop, I thought about how Phillip came
across the eunuch sitting and reading the Bible and ministered to him. I
pondered how I had never seen anyone in this country reading the Bible.
Then today I met this man in the key shop who was reading a Bible—and
sharing the Bible with another man.
   I pray daily that the Lord will lead us to people who want to know what
we know, for our environment is not friendly to evangelism.
   Only a handful of Adventist believers live in the country I serve in. Pray
for them, and continue giving to the mission offerings, which support mis-
sionaries around the world.

      Cities of Refuge




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Numbers 33–36, Josh.
      20:1–7, Ephesians 2.

Memory Text: “We . . . who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
      the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the
      soul, both sure and stedfast” (Hebrews 6:18, 19).

              hough God was faithful in doing all that He had promised, the

      T       nation itself, at least that first generation, proved unfaithful
              and—instead of inheriting the land offered it—died in a harsh
      wilderness on the wrong side of the Jordan River, the side they were
      to have fled from and not to have died in. What a tragedy, especially
      because it didn’t need to happen. All that they had been given, all that
      God had done for them, and yet, still they refused to trust, refused to
      act in faith even though they had witnessed dramatic manifestations of
      God’s power in ways that most of us never have seen and, at least in
      this life, probably never will.
        But the Lord was not through. No way. The theme of the Bible,
      again and again, is that God will fulfill His promises. The Lord will
      have His redeemed people in a new heaven and new earth. That is
      beyond question. The only question for us is, Will we be there, or will
      we be like the first generation, who despite all that was done for them,
      refused to enter into the promises given them?
        This week, our last week in Numbers, we’ll look at some of the final
      preparations as the children of Israel get ready to claim their promised
      inheritance.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, December 26.

     History Lesson
Read Numbers 33. Why do you think the Lord had Moses write down
     their “starting points, stage by stage”? What purpose could that
     serve?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        It’s really an incredible history, if you think about it. An entire
     nation flees its captors after centuries of oppression and survives for
     four decades wandering in the hostile environment of the Sinai wilder-
     ness. Only by the grace, power, and miracles of God could this have
     happened. Notice, too, how the text in Numbers 33:2 stressed that they
     moved place to place “by the commandment of the Lord.” The Lord
     wanted them, and future generations, never to forget that the whole
     story of the Hebrew people on the move in the wilderness was, really,
     the story about God and His dealings with sinful human beings in an
     effort to save them and to bring them into the Promised Land.
        However powerful the story of their wanderings, today there are bib-
     lical scholars who, while not denying the reality of a group of ex-slaves
     leaving Egypt, nevertheless try to attribute it to purely natural circum-
     stances. That is, they were doing exactly what the Lord didn’t want
     done, and that is to forget that God was central to all that had happened.

Read Numbers 33:50–56. Putting aside the immediate historical con-
     text (and the inevitable difficult issues it raises for us today), what
     important spiritual principle is found in these texts? From what
     you know of the history of ancient Israel after they had settled the
     land, why was this commandment about dealing with these peo-
     ples so important?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Compromise with the world has been and continues to be “barbs in
     your eyes and thorns in your sides” (vs. 55, NRSV) for the Lord’s peo-
     ple. Unless we protect ourselves from the bad influences in the world
     and from the culture surrounding us, we are always in danger of allow-
     ing these things to corrupt our faith and lead us astray.

      How can we protect ourselves from the negative influences that are
      always around us? What personal choices must you, and you
      alone, make for yourself to help limit the negative impact of these
      influences on you?
                                                                          105

      Cities of the Levites
        It will be remembered that, because of the Levites’ loyalty at Sinai,
      they were to be rewarded. God was to be their portion. Nevertheless,
      the Lord made specific provisions for them and how they were to live
      among the people they were to serve.

What provision was made for the Levites? What does this teach us
      about how the Levites were to live? Num. 35:1–8.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Notice, too, how the land was to be given to them from all the tribes.
      Those who had been given a lot of land were to give up more than those
      who had been given less. Hence, fairness in the land allocation is again
      seen. And yet, all the tribes were to give of “the inheritance of their pos-
      session” (vs. 2). All were to take part in making sure that the Levites were
      provided for. Thus, the Lord clearly wanted them to know their obliga-
      tions. In a sense, the principle of tithing works the same way. Those who
      have a lot will, by default, tithe more than those who have less.
         At the same time, too, the fact that they were to be provided for by
      the other tribes certainly must have been a constant reminder to the
      Levites of their responsibility to do their work faithfully in behalf of
      the people.
         The Levites, then, were to be scattered among all the tribes of Israel;
      that is, they weren’t gathered in one specific area. They were to live
      among the people, perhaps as a reminder of the faithfulness of their
      fathers during the worship of the golden calf. Hence, ideally, they in
      their sacred roles could be a constant witness to the people of what
      faithfulness and holiness should be about. Living among them, being
      part of their communities, sharing in their struggles, sorrows, and
      joys, the Levites—had they been faithful to their task—could have
      been a blessing to the nation. They were not to be some exclusive,
      elite, arrogant class that lived apart from the community in which they
      served. They were to serve, not be served. What an example of what
      true ministry is all about.

       Read Ephesians 2. What does this tell us about what it means to
       be part of a community of believers? How can we best fit into
       our community and fulfill whatever roles we are called to?

     Cities of Refuge
Read Numbers 35:6, 9–12. What is being established here, and why?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        At this time in ancient Israel, no system of justice operated. If a man
     accidentally or on purpose killed a man, the victim’s nearest of kin
     became his “avenger of blood” (Deut. 19:12) to execute justice. To
     prevent a miscarriage of justice, a system of six Levitical cities (three
     on each side of the Jordan) were appointed to which the murderer
     could flee for safety (Josh. 20:1–7).
        Numbers 35:12, though, brings out an important point. Fleeing to the
     city automatically didn’t guarantee permanent asylum. In some cases it
     would be a temporary refuge “until he stands before the congregation
     in judgment” (NKJV). That is, until the facts of the case could be estab-
     lished. These cities did not provide some kind of permanent diplomatic
     immunity, in which today a diplomat can commit a crime in a host
     country and not be held accountable. In this case, these cities were set
     up in order to prevent what could be a miscarriage of justice.

Read Numbers 35:9–21. How do we understand this form of justice
     in light of the gospel?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Some people don’t understand how something like this could be
     reconciled with Bible texts about forgiveness or turning the other
     cheek. But what we are dealing with here is a criminal code. The
     gospel of forgiveness and grace, as taught by Christ, doesn’t mean that
     crime, especially something as heinous as murder, goes unpunished
     by society. That a killer might even repent before God is, really, a dif-
     ferent matter. What society can function if crime is not punished?
     What we see here is God’s way of making sure that one of the worst
     crimes, that of murder, is dealt with in a fair and just manner.

      Suppose you know someone whose family member has been
      murdered, and the accused, unquestionably guilty, is convicted.
      The family, who are Christians, can have a say in the sentence,
      either death or life in prison. What would you advise them, and
      why? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

                                                                          107

       ____________________________________________________________________

       ____________________________________________________________________

      • All through the book of Numbers we have seen example after
        example of God’s supernatural intervention, especially in cases of
        apostasy, sin, and rebellion. That being the case, why do you think
        the Lord set up this system of justice, in which humans were
        responsible for determining guilt and innocence? Why didn’t He
        just supernaturally administer justice, as He did in other cases?

       ____________________________________________________________________

       ____________________________________________________________________

      • Why do you think a murderer couldn’t be put to death on the

      the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my sav-
      iour; thou savest me from violence” (2 Sam. 22:3).

How does 2 Samuel 22:3 reflect, at least somewhat, what the cities of
      refuge provided?


In what ways do we find the same kind of refuge and protection in
      Christ that those who fled to the cities of refuge found? See John
      8:10, 11; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Heb. 6:18.

         “The cities of refuge appointed for God’s ancient people were a
      symbol of the refuge provided in Christ. The same merciful Saviour
      who appointed those temporal cities of refuge has by the shedding of
      His own blood provided for the transgressors of God’s law a sure
      retreat, into which they may flee for safety from the second death. No
      power can take out of His hands the souls that go to Him for pardon.
      ‘There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
      Jesus.’ ‘Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
      that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
      maketh intercession for us;’ that ‘we might have a strong consolation,
      who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.’
      Romans 8:1, 34; Hebrews 6:18.
         “He who fled to the city of refuge could make no delay. Family and
      employment were left behind. There was no time to say farewell to
      loved ones. His life was at stake, and every other interest must be sac-
      rificed to the one purpose—to reach the place of safety. Weariness
      was forgotten, difficulties were unheeded. The fugitive dared not for
      one moment slacken his pace until he was within the wall of the
      city.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 516, 517.
         At the same time, the parallel is not exact, because our understand-
      ing of the Cross is that even those who have committed premeditated
      sin, even murder, can be forgiven by the Lord.

       Do you feel that you are not good enough to be saved? Do you feel
       that your sins are too great for you to be accepted by God? Do
       you feel that you are unworthy of forgiveness? If so, then why is
       it important to forget about how you feel and claim the promises
       of forgiveness, salvation, and acceptance offered to you by Jesus?
                                                                         109

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “The Division of Canaan,”
      pp. 510–520, in Patriarchs and Prophets.
         “The sinner is exposed to eternal death, until he finds a hiding place
      in Christ; and as loitering and carelessness might rob the fugitive of
      his only chance for life, so delays and indifference may prove the ruin
      of the soul. Satan, the great adversary, is on the track of every trans-
      gressor of God’s holy law, and he who is not sensible of his danger,
      and does not earnestly seek shelter in the eternal refuge, will fall a
      prey to the destroyer.
         “The prisoner who at any time went outside the city of refuge was
      abandoned to the avenger of blood. Thus the people were taught to
      adhere to the methods which infinite wisdom appointed for their secu-
      rity. Even so, it is not enough that the sinner believe in Christ for the
      pardon of sin; he must, by faith and obedience, abide in Him.”—Ellen G.
      White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 517.
Discussion Questions:
       ●1 In class, discuss your answer to Tuesday’s question regarding
       the death penalty. What would you tell the family, and why? Also,
       is it right and fair to apply what was done in ancient Israel to our
       system of justice today? Discuss.
       ●
       2 Why is it so important to remember how the Lord has led us
       in the past, either as individuals or as a church? What dangers
       arise if we forget the past? At the same time, why is it important
       not to dwell too much on what already has been done and cannot
       be changed? How can we strike the right balance here?
       ●
       3 If someone were to ask you, “What does it mean to take refuge
       in Christ?” what would you answer? How do we “take refuge” in
       the Lord? What does that mean? How should it change our lives?
       ●
       4 How do we administer church discipline today? How do we
       deal with wayward members whose actions are a reproach to the
       Lord? Yet, at the same time, how do we deal with them in a way
       that does not make us appear judgmental? Or can we?
Summary: The children of Israel, on the borders of the Promised
      Land, are given a quick summary of how God has led them all those
      years. Just before they enter, the Lord establishes the cites of refuge,
      places of asylum that, in a unique way, represent the refuge that we, as
      sinners, can find in Christ.

The Offering
by MOUSSAH NUHU-DAMARU
   It was a tough time in Nigeria. I worked for the government, and my
wife was a teacher, but we hadn’t been paid in weeks. And my wife was
expecting. We weren’t sure how we would manage.
   I still hadn’t been paid when my wife went into labor. I had no money
to pay the hospital, the doctors in the government hospitals were on strike,
and the mission hospital was too far away. Our only option was an expen-
sive private hospital.
   We hired a taxi to take us to the private hospital, but on the way my wife
started delivering the baby. The driver found a small clinic where she was
able to deliver the baby. We rejoiced in our newborn son and thanked God
for saving us a lot of money!
   Two days later teachers were told to report in person to be paid their
back wages. I couldn’t go for my wife; she had to go herself and take our
new son with her. And after waiting all day to be paid, she was told to
return the next day!
   On Sabbath morning I prepared for church. I wanted to give a thank
offering for our new son, but I still hadn’t been paid, and I had only eight
naira (about six cents)! As an elder I felt a responsibility to be a good
example, and that included faithfulness in tithes and offerings. How could
I give just eight naira to God? Finally I gave my mother five naira and my
three older children one naira each. I went to church with nothing.
   During Sabbath School my son said that a man wanted to see me. I went
outside to see what he wanted. I recognized the man and greeted him. He
wasn’t a church member and I wondered how he knew where to find me.
“Can we go somewhere and talk?” he asked.
   I walked him to my house, which was nearby, and we sat down. Then he
pulled out a roll of bills and peeled off 8,000 naira ($60)! Imagine my sur-
prise! I had forgotten that this man had owed me money. I thanked the man
and hurried back to church.
   I returned tithe on the money the man had given me and took a fitting
offering for the thank offering. Later I told my wife what had happened.
   The next day she was finally able to get her long-overdue pay. God is
faithful!
   Things became easier for us after that, but I’ll never forget how God
provided an offering just at the right time. Giving an offering for mission
is always a blessing.

2010    Bible Study Guide for the First Quarter

          Next quarter’s Bible study guide will explore how the Holy Spirit
       works in the lives of those who have surrendered their hearts to Christ.
       The guide will look at the fruit the Holy Spirit creates in us and how
       that defines the type of person we are to become in Jesus. “The Fruit
       of the Spirit,” by Richard O’Ffill, will help you realize how you can
       allow the Holy Spirit to make you a new creation in Christ. The key to
       this process is a willingness to die to self and to live for God and oth-
       ers. This fruit in our lives is the result of salvation, not the means.
       Jesus is always the means, which we claim by faith.

Lesson 1—“By Their Fruit . . .”
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: “Every Tree Is Known by Its Own Fruit” (Luke 6:44)
       MONDAY: “Without Me You Can Do Nothing” (John 15:1–5)
       TUESDAY: “By This My Father Is Glorified” (John 15:8)
       WEDNESDAY: “That It May Bear More Fruit” (John 15:2)
       THURSDAY: “And If It Bears Fruit, Well. But If Not . . .” (Luke 13:9)

       Memory Text—Matthew                    7:20

       Sabbath Gem: If we abide in the Lord and allow Him to abide
       in us through His Spirit, we will be changed, even radically.

Lesson 2—The Fruit of the Spirit Is Love
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Love Is Multi-Dimensional (Deut. 6:5, Matt. 22:39)
       MONDAY: What Love Does (1 Cor. 13:4–7)
       TUESDAY: What Love Doesn’t Do (1 Cor. 13:4–7)
       WEDNESDAY: The Test of Love (Matt. 5:43–48)
       THURSDAY: Love in Action (Luke 10:25–37)

       Memory Text—1               Corinthians 13:13

       Sabbath Gem:         True Godlike love is something altogether dif-
       ferent from what we as humans often label or consider as love. Yet,
       God’s love impacts our entire existence, our way of life, and how we
       relate to others. Love is so central to God’s character that it should
       be central to ours, as well.
