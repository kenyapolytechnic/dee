The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult Bible
Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The preparation of the
guides is under the general direction of a worldwide Sabbath School Manuscript Evaluation
Committee, whose members serve as consulting editors. The published guide reflects the
input of the committee and thus does not solely or necessarily represent the intent of the
author(s).



                                                                                        1
 A Hope Big With
     Of all the people immortalized over millennia upon the pages of his-
   tory, Jesus of Nazareth had the shortest period of public labor. Only
   three and a half years.
     But what a three and a half years they were!
     Socrates taught for 40, Plato for 50, Aristotle for 40, Jesus for not
   even 4. Yet the impact of Christ’s short ministry infinitely exceeds that
   of the combined 130 years of those three Greek giants.
     Someone once wrote that “the grandest paintings of Raphael,
   Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci are but a reflection of Jesus, the
   Light of the world. Haydn, Handel, Bach, and Mendelssohn gave to
   the world their best melodies in the symphonies and oratorios they
                              wrote to glorify Jesus Christ. Art, culture,
Christ’s appeal . . . music, philosophy—all have been enriched by
is universal,                 His teachings. But Christ offers far more than
                              philosophy, art, and music. These cannot save.
transcending all              Jesus offers light and life and salvation to sin-
political, ethnic,            ful men.”
and cultural                    That statement, however eloquent, falls
                              short of doing justice to the richness of Jesus,
borders.                      for that quote is in the context of the West
                              only; Christ’s appeal, in contrast, is universal,
   transcending all political, ethnic, and cultural borders.
     “You should search the Bible,” Ellen G. White writes, “for it tells
   you of Jesus. As you read the Bible, you will see the matchless charms
   of Jesus. You will fall in love with the Man of Calvary, and at every step
   you can say to the world, ‘His ways are ways of pleasantness, and all
   His paths are peace.’ You are to represent Christ to the world. You may
   show to the world that you have a hope big with immortality”—Life
   Sketches, p. 293.
     With Jesus at its center, Christianity is also a historical religion,
   meaning that it revolves around a person whose life and work are
   amenable to historical study and analysis. Yet, at the same time, we
   2
Immortality
 cannot circumscribe Jesus Christ within the confines of history. For
 the reality of His person is suprahistorical (above history)—there’s a
 point beyond which historical analysis cannot probe. History cannot
 take us into the mysteries of salvation, or into the wonders of what
 Christ’s death offers the world. For all that history offers, it cannot
 begin to fathom what Ellen G. White called “a hope big with immor-
 tality.”
   This quarter centers on Jesus, on who He was, on what He taught,
 on what He did—and on what He is doing now. That last clause, “on
 what He is doing now,” makes all the difference in the world. It is
 what might be called “the mystery of the present tense,” a crucial ele-
 ment that distinguishes Jesus from every other historical figure, for
 what other historical figure, no matter how great, is doing anything
 for us now?
   Who was this amazing Jesus? What was He like? What did He do
 while here? What is He, indeed, doing for us now? And finally, why
 should He be a concern for people in the twenty-first century?
   The answers, as we will see, are far from academic. On the contrary,
 they affect the destiny of every human being.

 study guide, is an associate editor of the Adventist Review, the interna-
 tional magazine of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He is married to
 Celia (nee Wilson), and they have two adult children, Dwayne and
 Kimberly.

      Who Was Jesus?




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 16:13–16, John 20:
      26–28, 1 Cor. 1:18–27, 15:3–7.

Memory Text: “When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea
      Philippi, he asked his disciples, ‘Who do people say the Son of
      Man is?’ ” (Matthew 16:13, NIV).

             rom the earliest days of His ministry, there was discussion and

      F      debate about Jesus. How interesting that those discussions con-
             tinue, even today. They began with the people of His own times
      and from His own town. “ ‘Where did this man get this wisdom and
      these miraculous powers?’ they asked. ‘Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?
      Isn’t his mother’s name Mary . . .?’ ” (Matt. 13:54, 55, NIV).
         It is what might be called the scandal of the particular: The
      Messiah had to come from somewhere, all right, but not from a place
      so familiar to us, and certainly not from a family that is just like the
      rest of ours! In one form or another, the same fundamental concerns
      expressed by these local townspeople concerning His identity have
      framed the debate about Jesus across the centuries, heightening the
      mystique around Him.
         Who, indeed, was Jesus? Why was He confused with other promi-
      nent Jewish characters? What were the challenges to Jesus’ integrity
      and identity in the centuries following the New Testament era? How
      convinced were the Bible writers of His identity, and why? These are
      some of the questions that our first week’s lesson will examine.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, April 5.

                  S UNDAY March 30

      Not the Baptist (Matt. 16:14)
        The question raised by Jesus’ own townsfolk (Matt. 13:54, 55) came
      up repeatedly during His public ministry, and in a variety of ways, as
      people in the different areas of Palestine encountered Him. Thus, as
      He went through the region of Caesarea Philippi with His disciples,
      some six months or so before the final showdown of His life, He felt
      the need to draw them out on the critical question of the day: “Who do
      people say the Son of Man is?” (Matt. 16:13, NIV).

Read the disciples’ response in Matthew 16:14. What does this say
      about their familiarity with the theological questions of the day?
      Why do you think Jesus wanted to bring up this issue at this spe-
      cific time?

      His ministry in their own setting. How was it possible for some to
      think that Jesus could be John the Baptist when the two were contem-
      poraries? And what aspects of Jesus’ ministry may have resembled
      that of the Baptist?

For possible answers, consider the following passages:
      Matt. 3:1–3; 4:12, 13, 17; 14:1, 2; Mark 1:1–5.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Today, of course, we hardly can understand how it was possible to
      confuse Jesus with John the Baptist. But given the absence of mass
      communication in the first century and the abundance of secondhand
      information and rumor, confusion came easily. After all, the ministries
      of John and Jesus were not without parallels, as the passages above
      show. But those who had actually encountered John should have been
      left with no uncertainty (Matt. 3:11, 12; Mark 1:6–8).

       It is easy to look back at the mistakes of others and wonder how
       they could have done what they did. What lessons can we learn
       from watching these mistakes that can help protect us from
       making the same kinds of mistakes?

                                                                           7

     Not Elijah or Jeremiah or Some
     Other Prophet
       Read again Matthew 16:14. That people should mistake Jesus for
     John is one thing. But for Elijah? Or Jeremiah? Or some other Old
     Testament prophet? Where did such ideas come from?
       Elijah was the fearless prophet of Mount Carmel fame, the fire-
     brand who had the temerity to confront Israel’s recalcitrant king and
     demonic wife. He was the one who held forth alone against the com-
     bined religious establishment in Ahab’s corrupt regime (see 1 Kings
     18).
       Jeremiah (“the weeping prophet”), coming upon the scene at a time
     of intense national ferment and crisis, conveyed a message to his com-
     patriots that could not have been more unwelcome to the national
     mood—and he paid for it, too (Jer. 20:1, 2, 7, 8).
       As for the rest of God’s faithful prophets in the Old Testament, Jesus
     in His scathing woes upon the scribes and Pharisees left Israel’s treat-
     ment of these godly stalwarts for the last, as if to suggest that it was
     the central point He wished to make: “ ‘So you testify against your-
     selves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the
     prophets’ ” (Matt. 23:31, NIV).

What significance do you see in the fact that Jesus’ contemporaries
     identified Him with these particular personalities?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       To have been mistaken for any of the characters included in Peter’s
     response in Matthew 16:14 was clearly a high compliment. These were
     spiritual giants whose sterling character held deep resonance in Jewish
     society. But however flattering, such comparisons (as we have come to
     know) fell utterly short of truth. If Jeremiah had said, for instance, that
     he was the light of the world, history would have considered him
     demented. And however spectacular the victory on Carmel, had Jesus
     quailed in the face of threat, as did the ancient hero of Carmel, we now
     would not be falling at His feet in reverence. The confusion of Jesus
     with these ancient stalwarts, however gratifying and intriguing, falls
     completely short of the reality portrayed in the Gospels.

      What is the main difference between Jesus and all these other
      prophets, and why is that difference so important to us? (See
      John 1:1–5, 17:5, Heb. 1:1–3.)

The Fascination Continues: Part 1
   The New Testament does not speculate about Jesus. It simply pre-
sents Him as the divine Son of God. Nor does it answer the numerous
concerns about Jesus’ being and person that would occupy succeeding
generations. Yet, in all the discussions and arguments, there was a
rock-bottom acceptance of the centrality of Scripture and the basic
identity of Jesus Christ.
   But the so-called Age of Enlightenment (of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries) would change all that. No longer would
Scripture constitute the foundation of discourse about Jesus. Instead,
new methods and criteria being applied to the study of other ancient
documents also would be applied to the Bible. With everything now
subject to rational analysis and criticism, supernaturalism, a founda-
tional presupposition of biblical faith, was rejected. The traditional
biblical view of a human race steeped in sin and needing divine res-
cue was replaced by humanism, an optimistic belief in human capac-
ity and progress.
   The change of outlook was so radical and far-reaching that many
thought they were witnessing the end of Christianity. Religion was
considered obsolete, and reason, once the handmaid of theology,
became its acknowledged mistress. The result was that the focus now
shifted from the Jesus described in the Gospels, the Jesus of our sal-
vation, to the historical Jesus, supposedly the real Jesus as He actually
existed without the theological baggage superimposed by the Gospels
and later Christian piety. In other words, this Jesus, whoever He was,
surely was not the Savior of the world.

 As you reflect on these developments, consider the following: (1)
 The Gospel writers were very confident in the truth of what
 they had written (see Luke 1:1–4). What does Luke say about
 what he is writing? Why can we trust it? (2) One of those eye-
 witnesses that Luke speaks about was Peter, who himself had to
 confront doubters and skeptics (see 2 Pet. 1:16–21). Though
 Peter is speaking here about issues wider than the single one
 about Jesus’ identity, how might we use his approach to secure
 ourselves against the Enlightenment onslaught we are dis-
 cussing here? (3) Paul also needed to address the issue of Jesus
 head-on. How did he argue the case? (See 1 Cor. 1:18–27,
15:3–7.)




                                                                       9

      The Fascination Continues: Part 2
         The so-called historical Jesus movement was founded on the belief
      that we still can find in the Gospels sufficient data to reconstruct the
      portrait of Jesus as a historical figure, notwithstanding the theological
      tampering by the early church (as alleged by Enlightenment thinking).
      The new approach to studying Jesus was seen by its advocates as sci-
      entific, and thus in keeping with the mood of the times.
         The trend held sway until the twentieth century, when new studies
      helped undermine this whole movement, showing how this historical
      Jesus idea was utterly unscientific and subjective. Studies exposed the
      entire rationalistic enterprise as a miserable failure.
         The history of Jesus studies are long, winding, and complicated;
      and they need not detain us further, except to mention the so-called
      Jesus Seminar, a contemporary group of radical scholars determined
      to succeed where other historical quests before them failed. Their goal
      is to “ ‘rescue Jesus from the spin doctors’ who wrote the Gospels.”
      —Roy Hoover, in Kenneth L. Woodward, “The Death of Jesus,”
      Newsweek, April 4, 1994, p. 39.
         Few today take the Jesus Seminar people seriously. (After all, how
      seriously can you take people who argued that instead of being resur-
      rected, Jesus, after His death, was eaten by dogs?) Today, the prevail-
      ing Christian position insists that Christianity stands on a firm, his-
      torical foundation. Notwithstanding two millennia of criticism and
      controversy, Jesus remains the undisputed Master of the centuries.

In one of his most penetrating rejoinders to the intellectual sophisti-
      cates of his day, Paul zeroed in on the essence of the Christian
      proclamation: “For the message of the cross is foolishness to those
      who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of
      God” (1 Cor. 1:18, NIV). Why is the message of the Cross so impor-
      tant for us today, as well?


       Read also 1 Corinthians 1:18–27. What message is there for us
       in those verses? What are some of the things we believe that just
       cannot be explained by the “wisdom of the world” (vs. 20, NIV)?
       In what ways has “God made foolish the wisdom of the world”
       (vs. 20, NIV)?

      Messiah, Son of God                      (John 17:3)

        Who Jesus was is not simply a theological proposition to be proved
      or disproved. No, we are dealing here with the faith of untold numbers
      over the centuries. If Jesus is not what they have believed Him to be,
      then they have all been clinging to falsehood and fables and are all
      lost. If Jesus was simply a man who lived two thousand years ago in
      Palestine, then the Christian church has been involved in the most rep-
      rehensible hoax in the history of the world.

How do the following texts get at the heart of the issue?

      Matt. 1:22, 23
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 11:2–6
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 22:41–45

      ____________________________________________________________________

      John 20:26–28
      ____________________________________________________________________

         The reaction of the disciples as they witnessed the miracle of the
      calming of the storm (Matt. 8:23–27) should be ours, as well: “ ‘What
      kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!’ ” (vs.
      27, NIV). The night of His arrest, the high priest put a direct question
      to Jesus and charged Him to answer under oath: “ ‘Tell us if you are
      the Christ, the Son of God.’ ‘Yes, it is as you say,’ Jesus replied” (Matt.
      26:63, 64, NIV). And in Pilate’s judgment hall, the governor had his
      own query: “ ‘Are you the king of the Jews?’ ” Jesus’ response was the
      same: “ ‘Yes, it is as you say’ ” (Matt. 27:11, NIV).
         By any measure, these were two extraordinary responses. If Jesus,
      only the son (as was believed) of a humble carpenter from Nazareth,
      could have the boldness to answer yes to Pilate’s question about king-
      ship, He obviously was thinking of realities that transcend this world.
      And that is what we saw in His response in the high priest’s palace:
      “ ‘In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of
      the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven’ ” (Matt. 26:64,
      NIV).

       Thus, the Gospels (and the rest of the New Testament) make it
       clear: In Jesus we have in human flesh the Son of the Living
       God, the One entitled to extend the exceptional invitation,
       “ ‘Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will
       give you rest’ ” (Matt. 11:28, NIV).

                                                                             11

    Further Study: On the issue of Jesus’ identity, read Ellen G. White,
          “Is Not This the Carpenter’s Son?” pp. 236–243, in The Desire of Ages.

             “Who is this Jesus? they questioned. He who had claimed for
          Himself the glory of the Messiah was the son of a carpenter, and had
          worked at His trade with His father Joseph. They had seen Him toiling
          up and down the hills, they were acquainted with His brothers and sis-
          ters. . . . They had seen Him develop from childhood to youth, and from
          youth to manhood. Although His life had been spotless, they would not
          believe that He was the Promised One.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
          of Ages, p. 237. “They would not admit that He who had sprung from
1         poverty and lowliness was other than a common man.”—Page 239.
             “A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said
          would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic . . .
          or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice.
          Either this man was, and is, the Son of God; or else a madman or
          something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him
2         and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord
          and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His
          being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did
          not intend 10.”—C. S. Lewis, “The Shocking Alternative,” p. 56, in
          Mere Christianity (New York: McMillan-Collier, 1960).


    Discussion Questions:
3          ●
           1 What makes it easier for us, we who live two thousand years
           after Jesus, to accept Him as the Messiah, than it was for those
           who lived at the same time as Jesus to accept Him? What makes
           it more difficult?

           ●2 Skepticism about Jesus is likely to continue as long as time
           shall last. What, for you, is the single most convincing evidence of
           the validity of Jesus and His saving grace? How could you share
           this evidence with others in a way that could help convince them
           as well?

           ●
           3 We looked this week at how the scientific rationalism of the
           Enlightenment had been used as a weapon against faith. What
           are some other types of “isms,” or philosophies or ideologies,
           prevalent in your own culture that work against faith, as well?
           Most important, how can you meet these challenges?

           ●
           4 As a class, go back over 1 Corinthians 1:18–27. What message
           is Paul giving that is important for all of us to remember?

Miriam’s Stubborn Faith
   Miriam (not her real name) is a teenager living in a polygamous family
in Ibajiland, Nigeria. Because of her family’s religion, she knew little about
Christianity until some Global Mission pioneers came to conduct concen-
trated outreach. The pioneers hired Miriam’s aunt to cook for them, and
Miriam went along to help.
   Miriam overhead the pioneers tell stories of Jesus that stirred her heart.
She left the cooking pots and listened to the pioneers teach about Jesus. In
time she gave her heart to Christ and asked to be baptized.
   Word of Miriam’s decision spread to her family, and fellow villagers tried
to prevent her from being baptized. But they failed.
   Her baptism triggered hostility, and Miriam was forced to leave her
father’s home. She found refuge with an Adventist teacher in her village,
but militant religious leaders tried to kidnap her and force her to renounce
her new faith, even if that meant killing her.
   The pastor managed to help Miriam escape to safety, but angry religious
leaders turned on the Adventist community, threatening to burn the church
down.
   In order to prevent a religious crisis in the region, the local king called a
meeting of the two religious groups involved. The family’s religious lead-
ers insisted that the only peaceful solution was for the Adventists to pro-
duce Miriam. The king finally agreed and ordered the Adventists to return
Miriam to her family.
   Reluctantly the pastor sent word for Miriam to return home. She was
taken to the king’s palace, where she exhibited great boldness for a young
girl. She told those present that she was not interested in returning to her
parents’ religion, but wanted to continue to follow Christ.
   Some members of Miriam’s family, seeing her strong conviction, were
willing to allow her to follow Christianity, but the religious leaders
demanded that she return to her father’s faith and have no contact with
Adventists. The pastor told the council that if Miriam wished to worship
with the church members at any time, she would be welcome and the
church would never send her away.
   Miriam returned home with her father, who tried to force her to worship
with them. But Miriam is determined to remain true to Christ and finds
ways to share her faith with others. She must remain under her father’s con-
trol until she finishes high school, but then she will worship as she wishes.
Her brothers have seen Miriam’s faith, and though they cannot openly say
it, they too wish to leave their father’s religion and follow Jesus.
   Pray for Miriam, and give your mission offerings so that those who are
searching for the truth may find it, no matter where they live.

      The Mystery of His Deity




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 9:6; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 16:
      13–17; John 1:1, 14, 18; 8:58; 17:5; 20:28; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 13:14.

Memory Text: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
      was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the
      beginning. Through him all things were made; without him noth-
      ing was made that has been made” (John 1:1–3, NIV).

             eaving the historical overview, we come to the Scriptures them-

      L      selves. We want to see what they tell us about Jesus, whose life
             has commanded so much attention through the centuries. As we
      do so, we ought to keep in mind the crucial exchange between Jesus
      and His disciples at Caesarea Philippi. Upon hearing Peter’s confes-
      sion of Him as the Messiah, the Son of God, Jesus reminded him that
      this insight did not spring from human investigation but was disclosed
      “ ‘by my Father in heaven’ ” (Matt. 16:17, NIV). (See Matt. 16:13–17,
      also Matt. 11:25–27.) “Flesh and blood” (Matt. 16:17, KJV), our own
      unaided, human wisdom, is inadequate in the presence of the supreme
      mystery of the ages.
         To believe in Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God is to affirm,
      indirectly, that He did not have His origin in Mary’s womb. It is to
      affirm His essential differentness from the rest of humanity, however
      much He may be like us in other ways. In short, it is to believe that He
      existed before His time on earth; that, quite simply, He preexisted. He
      was “the image of the invisible God,” by whom “all things were cre-
      ated”(Col. 1:15, 16, NIV). “He is before all things, and in him all
      things hold together” (vs. 17, NIV).

      His Preexistence—What It Means
      to Us
Why should we be concerned about Christ’s preexistence? What has it
      to do with salvation? What hint(s) toward an answer do you find
      in Hebrews 1:1–4 and Colossians 1:15–20?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        For all of us, our existence began when we were born (or, as some
      argue, it began when we were conceived). Christ was different. He did
      not come into existence in Mary’s womb. He was before that, eternally
      so. That is what we mean by His preexistence. He was there before all
      time.

How do the following texts give us hints about Christ’s preexistence?

      Isa. 9:6
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Mic. 5:2 (compare Matt. 2:1–6)
      ____________________________________________________________________

        The word mosa’ah (KJV: “goings forth”; RSV: “origin”) in Micah
      5:2 is not easy to translate. But the other part of the verse clearly refers
      not only to the preexistence of the coming Ruler but also to His eter-
      nal preexistence “from everlasting.” (See The SDA Bible Commentary,
      vol. 4, p. 1025.)
        Isaiah 9:6 teaches the eternal preexistence of this special Person
      who was to come into the world. It is an extraordinary claim that this
      One would be called, among other titles, “Mighty God, Everlasting
      Father.” It is all the more significant when we remember that the
      prophecy was addressed to an audience decidedly monotheistic; and
      the fact that Isaiah could refer to this Son as “Mighty God, Everlasting
      Father” was nothing short of astonishing, nothing short of a divine
      revelation breaking through the prophet’s own accustomed way of
      thinking. The Son is the Father, “the Everlasting Father”? Talk about
      having to live by faith!

       What other aspects of our beliefs, contrary to accepted norms,
       customs, and ways of thinking, do we have to take on raw, naked
       faith and nothing else? Is there something wrong with having to
       do that?



                                                                              15
                M ONDAY April 7

     The Witness of the New Testament
        Other evidence exists, now in the New Testament, that reveals the
     preexistence of Jesus. Perhaps some of the most interesting ones come
     from the mouth of Jesus Himself, as He says things that imply that He,
     Himself, was aware of His own preexistence.
        We find both direct and indirect indications that Jesus was, indeed,
     conscious of His own history. As a possible example of an indirect
     allusion to His preexistence, He said in Luke 19:10 that “ ‘the Son of
     Man came to seek and save what was lost’ ” (NIV). For example, if
     someone says, “I came to London to work at the House of Commons,”
     the person implies that she was somewhere else before. The person
     who has been living in London all along does not use that expression.
     An explicit statement from Jesus came in the words of His great
     Passion Week prayer when He asked His Father to glorify Him “ ‘with
     the glory I had with you before the world began’ ” (John 17:5, NIV).

How do the following passages reveal not only the preexistence of
     Christ but His own awareness of that preexistence?

     John 3:13
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 8:23
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 8:58, 59
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 17:8, 24
     ____________________________________________________________________

        “ ‘Before Abraham was, I am’ ” (John 8:58). The “I AM” expression
     in this text and elsewhere suggests the idea of everlastingness, of eter-
     nal preexistence. Jesus’ audience, understanding this point very well,
     took up stones to kill Him for what they saw as outrageous blasphemy
     (vs. 59).
        “In speaking of His pre-existence, Christ carries the mind back
     through dateless ages. He assures us that there never was a time when
     He was not in close fellowship with the eternal God. He to whose
     voice the Jews were then listening had been with God as one brought
     up with Him.”—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, Aug. 29, 1900.

      How does Ellen G. White’s quote above, along with the texts we
      have just looked at, help us to better understand the incredible
      sacrifice made in our behalf at the Cross?

      Apparent Contradictions
         Notwithstanding the clearest statements about Jesus’ deity and equal-
      ity with God the Father, we still encounter passages that call for expla-
      nation. One example occurs in what is undoubtedly the most beloved
      and well-known text in all the Bible, John 3:16: “ ‘For God so loved
      the world, that he gave his only begotten son.’ ” The problem is, How
      can the text say Jesus was “begotten” if He was eternal? Did someone
      beget Him, just like the rest of us?
         The expression “only begotten” is one word in the Greek language:
      monogenes, occurring nine times in the New Testament, with five of
      those references applying to Jesus and all five in the writings of John
      (John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). It is significant that all five ref-
      erences occur in the writings of the very author who from the start of
      his Gospel seeks to establish the deity of Jesus Christ. Indeed, he com-
      mences precisely on that point: “In the beginning was the Word and
      the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1). It would
      have been incredible that this Jewish writer would have attributed the
      title of Deity to someone he considered a created being.

In each of the following passages, the word monogenes refers to someone
      other than Jesus. If you are unfamiliar with the Greek, guess from
      the translation where the word falls. What do you think it means?

      Luke 7:11–15
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Luke 8:41, 42
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Luke 9:38
      ____________________________________________________________________

         The boy from Nain who had died is described as an “only son” (“the
      only son of his mother”). No emphasis here on the idea of begetting.
      Rather, the focus is on singleness, onlyness, uniqueness. The same is
      true in regard to Jairus’s daughter—she was his “only . . . daughter,”
      his monogenes, the only one of a kind, his only child; in this sense she
      was unique. That is also the point of Luke 9:38.

       The weight of scholarly opinion favors the view that monogenes,
       linguistically, does not place emphasis on begetting or begotten,
       but rather on the oneness of a kind, on the idea of uniqueness.
       How does this idea, too, help us better understand the great sac-
       rifice made for us at the Cross?

     The Deity of Christ
        The writers of the New Testament make it clear that Jesus deserves
     the divine title of God. This fact takes on added significance when one
     remembers that with the exception of Luke, all those writers were
     Jews, strongly monotheistic, and not predisposed to using the Divine
     titles carelessly. One must understand, therefore, that their testimony
     to Jesus’ deity sprang from the deepest, Holy Spirit-inspired convic-
     tion.

How do the following passages make the case for Jesus’ deity?

     Matt. 3:3
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 1:1
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 1:18
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 20:28
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Matthew 3:3 harks back to Isaiah 40:3, where Isaiah uses the word
     Yahweh, the most sacred name for God in the Old Testament. The con-
     struction of the John 1:1 passage in the original language leaves no
     doubt about what John was saying. Some 65 years after His death,
     Jesus is being expressly called God by one who had been in close
     association with Him. In regard to John 1:18, the Greek expression
     used in the passage calls Jesus, in effect, “the unique God.”
        Then how about John 20:28? Was this simply an exclamation, an
     expression of surprise on Thomas’s part, the same way people today
     would use the name of God to express astonishment or shock? To
     come to that conclusion would be to read a modern practice back into
     the New Testament. In the first place, the Jews, careful as they were
     to stay clear of blasphemy, did not have the expression in their vocabu-
     lary. Furthermore, the very construction of the passage militates
     against such an interpretation. The passage says, “Thomas said to
     him” (NIV). Thomas, in other words, was addressing Jesus; it was an
     expression of faith, not an exclamation of surprise. And the fact that
     Jesus did not rebuke him shows that He was satisfied with Thomas’s
     confession.

      Jesus as God is the same Jesus who offered Himself as a sacri-
      fice for our sins. How much more should the Cross mean to us,
      knowing that it was God—God!—hanging there for our sins.

     And There’s More
        The New Testament is full of evidence for Jesus’ deity, but space
     prohibits more detailed elaboration here. We might have dealt with,
     for example, such attributes as eternity and creatorship applied to
     Jesus; His claim to forgive sins; His claim to be the final Judge of the
     last day. In addition, we find the name of Jesus associated with that
     of the Father on a footing of equality, as in the baptismal formula
     (Matt. 28:19). Also, in John 14:9, Jesus uses words that would consti-
     tute obvious blasphemy on the lips of any other human being:
     “ ‘Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father’ ” (NIV).

Take a look at the following passages. What do they teach about
     Christ’s divinity?

     1 Cor. 1:3
     ____________________________________________________________________

     2 Cor. 13:14
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rev. 20:6
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rev. 22:3
     ____________________________________________________________________

        The above passages put Christ on an equal footing with the One
     whom we have come to call “God the Father.” And this all measures
     up with Jesus’ own declarations when He walked the dusty streets of
     Palestine. In John 10:30, for example, He declared, “ ‘I and the Father
     are one’ ” (NIV). The neuter form of the Greek used here for “one”
     implies a union as close as our minds can conceive. Jesus and the
     Father are of one substance, one nature, yet not one and the same
     Person (in which case He would have used the masculine gender). If
     you have trouble plumbing the depths of all this, you have lots of com-
     pany. The deeper you probe the subject, the more keenly you under-
     stand the depths of your ignorance.
        But imagine a situation in which the Being we have come to know
     as God the Father came to die for us, and the One we have come to
     know as Jesus stayed back in heaven (we are speaking in human terms
     to make a point). Nothing would have changed, except that we would
     have been calling Each by the name we now use for the Other. That is
     what equality in the Deity means.

      Review the life of Jesus, keeping in mind the points we have
      touched on this week. What does all this tell us about the charac-
      ter of God? Why should we, knowing what we know about God, be
      so full of hope and joy and trust, even in difficult circumstances?

                                                                         19

           It is instructive to see how deftly Matthew and Luke deal with the
         genealogy of Jesus (Matt 1:16, 18; Luke 3:23; compare 1:26–35).
         These Bible writers could not have been more careful on this point.
         What we find is a complete absence of any confusion on this funda-
         mental point, with John’s Gospel providing perhaps the strongest
         affirmation of Jesus’ deity anywhere in Scripture (John 1:1–3, 14). It
1
         shows how critical is the concept of the virgin birth for the whole
         scheme of salvation. The virgin birth, on which rests the affirmation
         of Christ’s preexistence and deity, stands rock solid in the Gospels.
           “Another dangerous error is the doctrine that denies the deity of
         Christ, claiming that He had no existence before His advent to this
         world. This theory is received with favor by a large class who profess
2
         to believe the Bible; yet it directly contradicts the plainest statements
         of our Saviour concerning His relationship with the Father, His divine
         character, and His pre-existence. It cannot be entertained without the
         most unwarranted wresting of the Scriptures. It not only lowers man’s
         conceptions of the work of redemption, but undermines faith in the
         Bible as a revelation from God. While this renders it the more dan-
         gerous, it makes it also harder to meet. If men reject the testimony of
         the inspired Scriptures concerning the deity of Christ, it is in vain to
3
         argue the point with them; for no argument, however conclusive,
         could convince them. . . . None who hold this error can have a true
         conception of the character or the mission of Christ, or of the great
         plan of God for man’s redemption.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
         Controversy, p. 524.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Look at Ellen G. White’s quote above. Why is it so important
          that we adhere to the doctrine of Christ’s deity and equality with
          the Father? What would the plan of salvation lose were we to
          abandon this teaching?

          ●2 How important is the incident of Matthew 9:1–8? How delib-
          erate was Jesus about bringing the issue of His deity to a head?
          What lessons was He trying to teach? What connection was He
          making between our physical and our spiritual malady?

          ●3 Dwell on the implications of the deity of Christ, in light of the
          Cross. Be prepared to bring your thoughts on this topic to class
          on Sabbath.

Walking in Faith
   José did not attend church, but he loved reading the Bible on his own.
He just wished that his wife would study with him. He found new truths
that excited him—and some things that baffled him.
   One day José met an Adventist pastor who invited him to visit the
Adventist church. José went, and there he found answers to many ques-
tions. He learned about the Sabbath and decided to ask his boss for
Sabbaths off. He prayed for courage and went to see him. To his delight,
José’s boss agreed to give him Sabbaths off.
   Then one day as José sat on the platform at church, he saw his boss enter
the sanctuary and stand in the back. When the service ended, José went to
greet him. His boss said, “A customer is waiting to see you at the office.
You must come to the office—now.”
   “But today is my Sabbath,” José said. “I don’t go to the office today.”
With that his boss turned angrily and walked away. Realizing that perhaps
he had not explained the Sabbath clearly, José wrote a letter explaining
why he would not work on Saturdays. On Monday he gave the letter to his
boss, even though he might lose his job.
   His wife learned of the letter and worried that his religion would leave
the family destitute. But José assured her that God would provide. José’s
company gave him Sabbaths off. Because of his steadfast faith, José’s wife
began attending church.
   The couple started a small group in their home, which quickly grew.
They needed a larger place to worship. One day José saw some property
that would make an ideal location for a church. The little group prayed that
God would help them buy the land, and God answered their prayer. They
began saving to build a church.
   When a hurricane ravaged their area, the group wondered what would
happen to their dream for a church. Then they learned that Maranatha
International was coming to rebuild churches and schools in Honduras.
The little group applied for help, and Maranatha built their church.
   The new church holds 150 people, and the believers are working to fill
it. José goes door-to-door introducing people to Christ and holds four
evangelistic series a year. The congregation now has more than 60 mem-
bers, most of whom are new believers.
   The church members are forming more small groups to help train new
believers to lead others to Christ. Following Christ’s methods, this group
has made a big impact on their community in Honduras. Our mission
offerings support lay evangelism in many forms. Thank you for your part
in telling the world about God’s love.

      The Reality of His
      Humanity


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 4:4; 1 Tim. 2:5; 3:16;
      Heb. 4:15, 16; 1 John 4:1–3.

Memory Text: “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling
      among us” (John 1:14, NIV).

          n the New Testament, without any rationalistic explanations what-

      I   soever, Jesus Christ is presented as both human and Divine. After
          beginning his Gospel with the Word who is God (John 1:1), John
      makes the extraordinary declaration that this same Word, this same
      God, “became flesh and made his dwelling among us” (vs. 14, NIV).
      And perhaps anticipating future concerns about moral contamina-
      tion, the New Testament maintains the sinless life of Jesus with
      unequivocal consistency (Heb. 7:26, 1 Pet. 2:22). Moreover, the writ-
      ers of the New Testament matter-of-factly regard Jesus as a proper
      object of worship and veneration (Acts 7:59, Rom. 9:5, Heb. 1:6).
      These earliest Christians were not detained by the philosophical
      problems inherent in the concept of the God-man or by the difficul-
      ties it would pose for later thinkers. “The humanity of the Son of God
      is everything to us. . . . When we approach this subject, we would do
      well to heed the words spoken by Christ to Moses at the burning
      bush, ‘Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou
      standest is holy ground’ (Exod. 3:5). We should come to this study
      with the humility of a learner.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages,
      book 1, p. 244.

     In the Presence of Mystery                          (1 Tim. 3:16)

        Last week’s lesson spoke about the mystery of Christ’s deity. But as
     we contemplate His humanity, we stand also in the presence of a pro-
     found mystery. As Paul expressed it: “Beyond all question, the mys-
     tery of godliness is great: He [Jesus] appeared in a body, was vindi-
     cated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the
     nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory” (1 Tim.
     3:16, NIV).
        One scholar makes the point that the claim that the founder of
     Christianity was Divine was not a big shock in the Roman world; after
     all, their emperors routinely claimed divinity. But the claim that “the
     Christian God was concerned about humanity; concerned enough to
     suffer in its behalf. This was unheard of.”—Huston Smith, The
     Illustrated World’s Religions (New York: HarperCollins, 1986), p. 219.
     But however strange to the Greco-Roman world, that, precisely, was
     the testimony of the New Testament.

What do the following passages teach about this amazing condescen-
     sion?

     Matt. 1:18–24

     Phil. 2:5–11
     ____________________________________________________________________

       It is fascinating to watch the unstudied precision with which the
     New Testament writers approach the issue of Christ’s humanity.
     Matter-of-fact and straightforward, they simply tell the story, with no
     knowledge (perhaps) of the firestorm that would follow in succeeding
     centuries. But it is precisely the absence of any posturing that helps
     give credibility to the documents that we have. It is not as if the earli-
     est disciples faced no controversy in regard to the nature and identity
     of Jesus; they did, as we see in the New Testament itself. But their
     arguments in regard to Jesus’ person clearly were not designed to
     counter the position of rationalistic or scientific opponents, which
     gives an unspoiled freshness to their witness. It was as though they
     argued their case out of surprise that anyone would dare to doubt the
     uncommon mystery that had affected them so dramatically, both cor-
     porately and personally.
                                                                           23

     Then There Was Conflict
        As Christianity spread through the Greco-Roman world and moved
     into the second generation, people began to reflect on its basic mes-
     sage about Jesus’ person, and to raise questions: How could Divinity
     and humanity cohabit the same body? How could Deity become mor-
     tal? What is Jesus’ relationship to the Father? And so forth . . .
        Beginning in the first century, two conflicting emphases emerged. One
     would stress Christ’s humanity at the expense of His divinity; the other
     would do just the opposite. Among those denying Christ’s deity were the
     Ebionites, early Jewish Christians who taught that Jesus became the Son
     of God only at His baptism, at which time He became united with the
     eternal Christ, a nondivine being who could not save humanity but came,
     instead, to call humanity to obedience. The Arians later would take up the
     struggle against Christ’s divinity, beginning around the late third century,
     a position strongly condemned by the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325.
        The heavyweights on the other side of the spectrum were the
     Gnostics, who taught that spirit was good and matter evil, particularly
     the matter that forms our body. Therefore, the human body could not
     serve as a vehicle for the revelation of the Supreme Being.

Study 1 John 4:1–3. In what way does John’s concern relate to the
     Gnostic emphasis just described?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The controversy over who Jesus was raged for five solid centuries,
     from the second century all the way down to the sixth. At first it was
     over His deity. Was He God? And if so, how was He related to God
     the Father? The questions then shifted to His humanity, and to how
     Divinity and humanity were combined in a single person. There were
     statements and counterstatements, pronouncements and counter-
     pronouncements, accusations and condemnations and excommunica-
     tions, with one “ism” after another claiming the day. Incredibly, amid
     all the turmoil and controversy, biblical orthodoxy in respect to Jesus’
     essential nature and person ultimately prevailed. (See the quotation
     from the Creed of Chalcedon in Friday’s lesson.)

      What are some of the questions in the church today about the
      human nature of Christ? Why must we be careful not to let
      these questions divide us, as they often did the early church?

      He Took Our Nature (Gal. 4:4)
         Many of His contemporaries considered Jesus an unusual person,
      yet they each knew Him to be a human being, a man. When the
      Samaritan woman rushed to her village to spread the word about the
      unusual Jew she just had met at the well, her announcement was
      straightforward: “ ‘Come, see a man’ ” (John 4:29, NIV). Hers was the
      universal testimony of Jesus’ contemporaries. Even after He had
      calmed the storm, the exclamation of those closest to Him was,
      “ ‘What kind of man is this?’ ” (Matt. 8:27, NIV).

How do the following texts help support the fact that Jesus was a gen-
      uine human being of flesh and blood?

      Matt. 8:24

      ____________________________________________________________________

      John 11:33–35
      ____________________________________________________________________

          While on earth, Jesus voluntarily surrendered the independent exer-
      cise of the Divine attributes. He surrendered; He did not relinquish.
      The attributes remained in Him. He could have used them at any time
      for His own advantage, but He did not. The temptation to call on these
      attributes to extricate Himself from difficulty (in ways not open to us)
      was a major ingredient of His daily trials.
         It is helpful to keep in mind that the Scriptures are not definitive on
      every point that stirs our interest. They make no overt attempt, for
      example, to spell out precisely how the human and Divine compo-
      nents of Jesus’ nature are related. But they make it clear that Christ
      was one unified person. They do not discuss the technicalities of this
      union, limiting themselves, rather, to the clear confession that such a
      union did occur, that the Son made of a woman was, indeed, the Son
      of God (Gal. 4:4). “Christ did not make-believe take human nature;
      He did verily take it. He did in reality possess human nature.”—Ellen
      G. White, Lift Him Up, p. 74.

       Why is Christ’s humanity so important to us? What does it mean
       to us to know that Jesus became a human being? How does it
       encourage you to know that Jesus shared our human limitations?


                                                                            25

      To Feel Our Pain                  (Heb. 4:15, 16)

         Why did God need to come into the world in human flesh? The
      question is important. But we should wean ourselves away from
      purely rational answers to it. It is not as if we need to come up with an
      answer that makes sense to us. There is no independent research we
      can do in philosophy, science, sociology, or whatever, that would lead
      us to an answer. Nor should we concoct our own answer. The safest
      way is to listen carefully to what the Bible itself reveals on this point.
      And in the book of Hebrews, we find some of the clearest, most inten-
      tional statements on the issue. Nor is it without significance that
      Hebrews also happens to be the book focusing most directly on Jesus’
      present high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.

Each of the following passages highlights one particular aspect of Jesus’
      coming in human flesh, then proceeds to answer the implied ques-
      tion: Why did He do that? And in each case a reason for that par-
      ticular aspect of His humiliation is given. What are those reasons?

      Heb. 2:9

      Heb. 4:14–16
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Heb. 5:8, 9
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Notice that in each case, the focus is on Jesus; and in each case, the
      benefit is for us. These inspired reasons for Jesus’ humanity and suffer-
      ing should be taken with utter seriousness. They should bring us
      immense joy to know that Jesus meets us in our need; His arms are open
      wide for us; He knows our plight because He has been here; He has felt
      our pain. Can we imagine a more merciful Savior, a more understand-
      ing and compassionate High Priest? Immense joy and profound grati-
      tude wells up in the souls of those who know that He suffered all for us.
      Thus encouraged, we “approach the throne of grace with confidence”
      (Heb. 4:16, NIV), giving ourselves to Him in complete abandon.

       What trials are you encountering at the moment? How does it
       help you to know that Jesus feels and understands your pain?

     An Eternal Solidarity                     (1 Tim. 2:5)

        When we imagine the huge difference between God and ourselves,
     it is astounding to think that God would reach out to us by conde-
     scending to take on human flesh. But after He was done, most of us
     would have been content for Him to abandon His affinity with us and
     return fully to what He was before. However—and this absolutely
     astounds us—we learn that Jesus will forever remain in solidarity with
     us by retaining our nature!

Consider the implications of the following passages in regard to
     Jesus’ eternal solidarity with us:

     Luke 24:36–43

        “By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than
     recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan’s purpose to
     bring about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ
     we become more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In
     taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie
     that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is linked with
     us. ‘God so loved the world . . .’ He gave Him not only to bear our sins,
     and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure
     us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten
     Son to become one of the human family, forever to retain His human
     nature. . . . God has adopted human nature in the person of His Son,
     and has carried the same into the highest heaven. It is the ‘Son of man’
     who shares the throne of the universe.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
     of Ages, p. 25. “Christ ascended to heaven, bearing a sanctified, holy
     humanity. He took this humanity with Him into the heavenly courts,
     and through the eternal ages He will bear it, as the One who has
     redeemed every human being in the city of God.”—Ellen G. White,
     The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1054.

      A friend of yours, hearing about Jesus’ eternal solidarity with
      us, says, “That is going too far. It is too much!” What would you
      say to that person? And how do you feel about the fact He will
      be like us for eternity? However incredible a concept, what does
      it tell us about God’s love for humanity?

                                                                          27

    Further Study: In the centuries-old controversy over the person of
         Jesus, the Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) marked a significant mile-
         post. Essentially, it agreed and proclaimed that Jesus Christ is fully
         God and fully man: “. . . we all with one voice teach that . . . our Lord
         Jesus Christ is one and the same God, the Same perfect in Godhead,
         the Same perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man, . . . [one] with
         the Father as to his Godhead, and . . . [one] with us as to his manhood;
         in all things like unto us, sin only excepted.”—Cited in Justo L.
         Gonzalez, A History of Christian Thought, vol. 1 (Nashville:
         Abingdon Press, 1970), p. 390. For an assessment of the implications
1        of the Chalcedon statement from an Adventist perspective, see Roy
         Adams, The Nature of Christ (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald®
         Publishing Association, 1994), pp. 57–72.
            “In contemplating the incarnation of Christ in humanity, we stand
         baffled before an unfathomable mystery. . . . The more we reflect upon
         it, the more amazing does it appear. How wide is the contrast between
2        the divinity of Christ and the helpless infant in Bethlehem’s manger!
         How can we span the distance between the mighty God and a helpless
         child? And yet the Creator of worlds, He in whom was the fullness of
         the Godhead bodily, was manifest in the helpless babe in the manger.
         Far higher than any of the angels, equal with the Father in dignity and
         glory, and yet wearing the garb of humanity! Divinity and humanity
         were mysteriously combined, and man and God became one. It is in
         this union that we find the hope of our fallen race.”—Ellen G. White,
3        Signs of the Times, July 30, 1896.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 What for you are the big issues surrounding Christ’s human-
          ity? Why are they important for you? At the same time, why must
          we be careful not to be too harsh or dogmatic about the finer
          points of Christ’s humanity?

          ●
          2 Ellen G. White says that Christ’s humanity is everything to us
          (see Selected Messages, vol. 1, p. 244). What did she mean? In
          what practical ways does the idea of Christ’s humanity affect you
          in your Christian walk?

          ●
          3 How might we use what we have studied in this week’s lesson
          in our personal witness? How does the reality of Christ’s human-
          ity touch people where they live today?

The Woman Who Didn’t Like
God
by HEIDEMARIE KLINGEBERG
   On a snowy March day in Germany, a woman who had not liked God was
baptized into the Adventist Church.
   “I thought Christians were weak people who could not manage their lives
by themselves,” Ute testified. “Then I met my neighbor Frank. He manages
his life and a demanding job quite well. One day he invited my children to join
Pathfinders at his church. ‘They will learn a lot of useful things, and it will be
good for them,’ ” Frank said.
   “Why not? I thought. My youngest daughter joined Pathfinders and really
enjoyed it.
   “Frank invited me to attend a Pathfinders reception in the church. I wasn’t
so sure I wanted to meet these strange people, but I decided to go in spite of
my concerns.
   “I entered the church with mixed feelings and looked around the sanctuary.
It was so simple, not as I had expected. And the pastor seemed normal and
friendly.
   “I liked the people I met that day. They were not weird at all. I started attend-
ing church and had to admit that I really enjoyed it. The warmth and love the
people showed me made me feel accepted and loved. Each week I took part
with greater enthusiasm and commitment in the worship at the Adventist
Church. I was growing spiritually.
   “I began reading the Bible for myself, starting with the Old Testament. But
that was too hard. I went on the Internet and searched for something in
German to help me understand the Bible better. There I discovered the Voice
of Hope Bible correspondence course. I enrolled, and I began completing the
Bible study guides with growing enthusiasm. Studying the Bible became
almost an addiction! My coach encouraged me when I got stuck and answered
my frequent questions.
   “I have learned so much from the Bible studies, and my life has changed a
great deal. I have discovered that the Bible gives me what I call operating
instructions for my daily life, and from studying God’s ‘manual,’ I get great
joy. I have discovered that I have a loving heavenly Father who will help me
through life’s bumps.
   “I sealed my commitment to God through baptism and started a new life.
My sorrows are not all gone, but Jesus goes with me into battle and has prom-
ised never to leave me. I have seen Him work out several problems already.
   “The future may not be easy, but I am confident in spite of problems, for
Jesus and my new brothers and sisters in Christ are beside me.”

      The Wisdom of His
      Teachings


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matthew 5–7, 20:25–28,
      John 4:22–24, 8:1–11.

Memory Text: “The people were amazed at his teaching, because
      he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of
      the law” (Mark 1:22, NIV).

           esus could have flashed bright beams of light on the darkest mys-

      J    teries of science, but He would not spare a moment from teaching
           the knowledge of the science of salvation. His time, His knowl-
      edge, His faculties, His life itself, were appreciated only as the means
      of working out the salvation of the souls of men.”—Ellen G. White,
      Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 1, p. 245.
         There is a danger that in talking about the wisdom of His teachings
      (as in the title of this week’s lesson), we may not distinguish enough
      between Jesus and other (so-called) wise teachers across the centuries.
      Jesus’ teachings were not simply wise. They contained, in addition, a
      qualitative element that essentially distinguished them from every-
      thing that preceded or has since followed. There was about them a cer-
      tain finality, a conclusiveness not found elsewhere. In other words,
      this was God talking in human flesh. However much the people did
      not know about the true identity of Christ, they still could tell there
      was something unique about Him and what He said. “The crowds
      were amazed at his teaching, because he taught as one who had
      authority” (Matt. 7:28, 29, NIV).
         This week we will look at just what some of those teachings were.

     The Greatest Sermon                     (Matthew 5–7)

        Year after year hundreds of thousands of sermons make their way
     into the realm of oblivion. Some are remembered for a while, then for-
     gotten. What would it take to have a particular sermon not only
     remembered and quoted for two thousand years but even identified by
     the place of its delivery? Such is the Sermon on the Mount.
        During the First World War, the Society of Friends printed The
     Sermon on the Mount as a separate pamphlet, without commentary,
     for distribution among the allied forces. But both the British and
     French governments forbade its distribution among their troops. After
     all, a sermon telling people to love their enemies was not exactly what
     you wanted men on the front lines in a war to be reading!

Read through the Beatitudes (Matt. 5:3–12). Which aspects do you
     find most meaningful for the experiences you are going through
     right now?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In the Beatitudes some elements merely describe the condition in
     which we may find ourselves. The person who “mourns,” for instance,
     does not seek that state. But meekness (or better, humility) we should
     seek; as the prophet says, “Seek righteousness, seek humility [meek-
     ness]” (Zeph. 2:3, NIV). Hungering and thirsting after righteousness is
     not a state natural to us humans, nor can we manufacture it. But we
     are admonished to seek after it.

Give a brief summary of the following teachings that appear (among
     others) in the rest of the sermon:

       1. Our influence in society (Matt. 5:13–16)
       2. The law of God (Matt. 5:17–20)
       3. Heart religion (Matt. 5:21–30)
       4. Divorce (Matt. 5:31, 32)
       5. Retaliation (Matt. 5:38–42)
       6. Love for enemies (Matt. 5:43–48)
       7. Prayer (Matt. 6:5–15)

      As you reflect on the Beatitudes and the rest of the sermon,
      which aspects do you find most pointed? Which most keenly
      cuts across your accustomed ways, your own cultural norms?
      What changes do you need to make in order to be more in har-
      mony with these words from God?

                                                                         31

     What He Taught About God
       Into a world dark with misunderstanding about the person and char-
     acter of God, Jesus came to set things straight, by His life and by His
     word. Coming from the very essence of God, He brought a revelation
     of God that could not be improved upon. In the past, the prophets had
     spoken about God; but now, “in these last days,” God was speaking
     “by his Son . . . through whom he made the universe” (Heb. 1:1, 2,
     NIV). Through Jesus, in other words, we have the ultimate disclosure
     of the Supreme Being.

What is Jesus saying about God in following passages?

     Matt. 5:8, 9
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Matt. 18:5, 6, 10; 19:13, 14
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 4:22–24
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 10:27–30
     ____________________________________________________________________

        A critical test of the decency of any society, ancient or modern, is
     the value it places upon the most vulnerable of its members, and there
     is none more vulnerable than children. Jesus’ regard for these tender
     ones must have come as a breath of fresh air to those poor mothers two
     thousand years ago when He vigorously defended their children’s
     right of access to Him, when He made time in His hectic calendar for
     these tiny tots, time to touch them and to bless them.
        God is like that, Jesus’ action said. He cares for the children and, by
     extension, for all who are vulnerable and exploited. He is the God of
     the underdog. As He sat there with these little ones looking into His face,
     Jesus must have thought of what we call “the Slaughter of the Innocents”
     by Herod on account of Him (Matt. 2:16–18), and the bloody edict of
     an ancient pharaoh against all Jewish male infants (Exod. 1:15, 16).
     Jesus came to model a God who was the complete antithesis of these
     murderous psychopaths.

      From what you have read above, what picture of God does Jesus
      present? How have you experienced these aspects of God’s char-
      acter yourself? Even more important, how well do you reflect
      those aspects of His character in your own life?

      What He Taught About Forgiveness
      (Matt. 6:12–14)

         Of all the words that we might associate with Jesus, forgiveness has to
      be right there among the top. Jesus and forgiveness go together. Amid the
      excruciating agony of the cross, and as soldiers and people derided and
      abused Him, the heartrending words stumbled out through quivering
      lips: “ ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing’ ”
      (Luke 23:34, NIV). And in the Sermon on the Mount He went so far as
      to say that if we do not forgive those who offend us, then we should not
      expect God to forgive our offenses against Him (Matt. 6:12, 14, 15).

What is Jesus teaching about forgiveness in each of the following pas-
      sages? Mark 2:5–12; Luke 7:36–50; 17:3, 4; John 8:1–11.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

The wonderful statements about forgiveness notwithstanding, what cau-
      tionary, balancing factors do we find in the following passages?
      (Matt. 12:31, 32; 18:6; Mark 14:21).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      In Mark 14:21, Jesus uttered a woe upon the “man who betrays the
      Son of Man.” But suppose that man were to confess and repent? In this
      connection, contrast the actions of Judas and Peter following their sep-
      arate betrayals of Jesus. After witnessing Jesus’ condemnation by
      those who had arrested Him, Judas, “seized with remorse,” returned
      the betrayal money to the authorities, and his words seemed most
      appropriate: “I have sinned, for I have betrayed innocent blood” (Matt.
      27:3, 4, NIV). In contrast to Judas’s public display of regret, Peter’s
      tears of penitence were shed in silence; nor did he return to Caiaphas’s
      judgment hall to make amends for his shameful betrayal. Yet, the one
      was condemned, the other forgiven. What was the crucial difference?

       How are we to understand forgiveness in a practical sense? For
       instance, a woman can forgive a husband who beats her, but
       does forgiveness mean leaving oneself vulnerable to more
       abuse? How can we forgive while at the same time be wise and
       prudent enough to protect ourselves and others from those who
       have violated our trust?
                                                                            33

      What He Taught About Humility
      (Matt. 20:25–28)

         In a 1995 survey, some athletes were asked the following question:
      If there was a drug you could take that would guarantee you’d receive
      a gold medal at the Olympics but that would kill you in five years,
      would you take it? More than 50 percent said Yes. It is a commentary
      on the lure of fame and power on contemporary society. To be “in
      front of the camera,” to hold millions drooling in the palm of our hand,
      that is the rage of the twenty-first century.
         And that same general spirit can invade the church, if we do not
      remain constantly on guard. The lust for power over others (the drive
      to be in control, the hunger for the first place) has not diminished with
      the passing of the years.

Study the following passages in the context of this insatiable struggle
      for the top:

      Matt. 18:1–6
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 20:25–28
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 23:1, 5–12
      ____________________________________________________________________

      1 Pet. 5:1–4
      ____________________________________________________________________

         The harsh events of history sometimes have sent proud dictators
      scrambling penniless among refugees or cowering in solitary confine-
      ment, taking orders from third-class prison wardens. There even have
      been times when a monarch temporarily gives up the throne to make
      common lot with the marginalized members of society. But all these
      cases put together, voluntary or coerced, pale in comparison with the
      magnitude of the condescension we see in Christ. He was “in very
      nature God,” Paul says; that is the God of the universe we are talking
      about here! “But [He] made himself nothing, taking the very nature of
      a servant, being made in human likeness.” Descending further yet, “he
      humbled himself and became obedient to death—even death on a
      cross!” (Phil. 2:5–8, NIV).

       In light of the Cross, in light of the amazing condescension of
       the Son of God, why should all forms of self-exaltation be
       brought to shame? How can we protect ourselves from this sub-
       tle yet very dangerous form of self-deception?

      What He Taught About Grace—and
      Faith
         “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not
      from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works” (Eph. 2:8, 9, NIV).
      The words are from the apostle Paul as he reflected on the Christian mes-
      sage of salvation, which he expressed differently than Jesus did. In fact,
      one might be tempted to ask whether Jesus believed in righteousness by
      faith. But to ask that question is to grossly misunderstand both Paul and
      Jesus. Jesus’ approach to teaching about grace seemed at times to go in
      a different direction; one reason, incidentally, that we should not be too
      legalistic with one another over the exact formulas we each use to
      describe God’s marvelous act of grace in Jesus, and our response to it.
         Jesus came as the epitome of grace. He was grace personified. To
      encounter Him was to encounter grace. “We have seen his glory,” John
      wrote, “the glory of the One and Only, . . . full of grace and truth”
      (John 1:14, NIV).

In the following passages, what is Jesus teaching about grace and faith?

      Matt. 14:28–31
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Matt. 20:1–15
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Luke 15:11–31
      ____________________________________________________________________

      John 8:1–11
      ____________________________________________________________________

        From these passages, we learn something of the many ways Jesus
      taught about grace, through His parables and through the object les-
      sons of His own life. How could Peter ever forget his utter helpless-
      ness in the face of the deadly elements that surrounded him that night
      on the lake? His only recourse was to cry out to a Power beyond him-
      self. And instantly the response was there! No delay. No need for
      penance. No complicated formula or requirement. Just three words,
      coming naturally from his extreme desperation: “Lord, save me!”
      (Matt. 14:30, NIV). And immediately the hand of Jesus was on him.
      That is grace.

       Of the various accounts listed above, which one speaks to you
       most powerfully of God’s grace? Having received such grace
       yourself, how can you be more willing to give it to others just as
       undeserving as yourself?
                                                                            35

    Further Study: According to historian Huston Smith, Jesus’ teach-
         ings “may be the most repeated in history. ‘Love your neighbor as
         yourself. What you would like people to do to you, do to them. Come
         unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
         rest. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.’ Most
         of the time, though, he told stories: of buried treasure, of sowers who
         went out to sow, of pearl merchants, of a good Samaritan. People who
         heard these stories were moved to exclaim, ‘This man speaks with
         authority. Never spoke man thus!’ . . . The most impressive thing
         about the teachings of Jesus is not that he taught them but that he
         appears to have lived them. From the accounts that we have, his entire
1        life was one of humility, self-giving, and love that sought not its own.
         The supreme evidence of his humility is that it is impossible to dis-
         cover precisely what Jesus thought of himself. He wasn’t concerned
         with that. He was concerned with what people thought of God. . . . We
         have seen that he ignored the barriers that mores erected between peo-
         ple. He loved children. He hated injustice, and perhaps hated
2        hypocrisy even more because it hid people from themselves.”—The
         Illustrated World’s Religions, (New York: HarperCollins, 1986) pp. 212,
         213.

          ery, cloning, abortion, etc.). What conclusions should we draw
3
          from these omissions? What conclusions should we not draw?

          ●
          2 What role might Jesus’ teaching on forgiveness play in issues
          of international conflict today? How can Christians bring that
          teaching to bear upon the resolution of issues in their homes,
          churches, and communities? When is forgiveness not the answer
          to the particular problems faced by nations and individuals, or is
          it always the answer?

          ●3 Notwithstanding its universal appeal, the Sermon on the
          Mount often is ignored when we confront the real problems of
          life. Why do you think this is so? And how is it in your own life?
          In what ways could you consciously try to apply these principles
          in your own walk with the Lord?

The Sidetracked Shuttle
by HOMER TRECARTIN
   Pastor Dave Weigley boarded the airport shuttle and sat down, eager to
relax a little before his meetings. He thought of the evangelistic meetings
he had held in this Florida city a year earlier and wondered how the new
members were doing. And what about the people who had come to the
meetings but did not make a decision to follow Jesus?
   His thoughts were interrupted by a woman’s voice. “Please, just drop me
off on your way to the hotel.” Grudgingly the driver agreed to take the
woman to her home.
   The shuttle bus wound through traffic and stopped in front of a familiar-
looking block of apartments. Pastor Weigley jumped up to help the woman
with her bag. “Do you live here?” he asked.
   “Yes,” the woman said. Excited, Pastor Weigley asked if a certain woman
still lived there. The woman eyed him and slowly answered, “Yes, she still
lives there.”
   The shuttle door closed, and Pastor Weigley sat down. This has to be
more than coincidence, he thought. What does God want me to do?
   The woman he asked about had attended the meetings he had held, but
in spite of many visits and prayers, she had not given her heart to Christ.
Now God had led him back to her apartment complex. Weigley promised
God that he would visit the woman before leaving town.
   A few days later Weigley returned to the apartment where the woman
lived. As he climbed the stairs he thought, How do I greet someone whose
name I don’t remember? He knocked on the door, but heard nothing from
inside. As he turned to leave, the door opened and the woman exclaimed,
“Well, Pastor Weigley. Please come in.”
   He entered and found the woman had company—a friend and another
pastor who Weigley recognized. The women were as surprised as he was.
Pastor Weigley told the others about his experience on the shuttle bus. The
other pastor explained that he had come to apologize for an incident that
had happened years earlier.
   The two pastors prayed and invited the women to give their hearts to
Jesus. With tears in her eyes, the woman who had attended the meetings
knelt and surrendered to Christ. This woman has since been baptized, in
part because two pastors had followed the Holy Spirit’s leading and found
a wanderer ready to come home.
   Our mission offerings support outreach—both organized evangelism and
personal witness. Thank you for sharing God’s love through your offerings.

      The Wonder of His
      Works


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:23–25; 8:25–27;
      11:2–6; 12:22, 23; Acts 3:19–21.

Memory Text: “When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on
      them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without
      a shepherd” (Matthew 9:36, NIV).

             ven the most cursory reading of the life of Jesus as presented in

      E      the Gospels reveals an interesting fact: With the exception of
             the amazing events surrounding His birth, very little of Jesus’
      childhood and early years are recounted. This gap has led to all sorts
      of speculation through the centuries about what Christ had done dur-
      ing all those lost years. Nothing, though, comes close to what Ellen G.
      White wrote in The Desire of Ages (“As a Child”).
        Instead, the Bible focuses on His adult life, specifically the three
      and a half years of His ministry. What a three and a half years they
      were!
        The world has experienced nothing like it. His works, always for
      others, and completely without capriciousness, are presented as evi-
      dence of a new day dawning, the birth of the kingdom of God. The
      moment the Sermon on the Mount ended, the scene changed abruptly,
      with Jesus immediately plunging Himself into the needs of the people
      (see Matthew 8, 9). For Jesus it was not just words. He had the works
      to more than back up the words.
        The kingdom of God had arrived, and Jesus was there to inaugurate it.

     What Kind of Man Is This?                           (Matt. 8:25–27)

Read Matthew 8:1–4. What do you find significant about these verses
     in regard to the reasons for Jesus’ coming into the world?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The way Matthew tells it, the healing of the leper takes place as
     soon as Jesus comes down from the mountain. Fresh from delivering
     the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus runs smack into the furrow of human
     need in the valley. And the first challenge He confronts is leprosy, a
     symbol of our sinful human plight. Jesus touches the leper (what to
     make of that?), and the leprosy is gone! Such is the power of our Lord.
        In what follows in the rest of Matthew 8 and in chapter 9, Matthew
     would depict Jesus as having power over nature: He calms the storm
     (Matt. 8:23–27); power over demons: He frees the demoniacs (vss.
     28–33); power “over sickness, disease, and infirmity”: He heals the
     paralytic and the woman with a hemorrhage (vss. 1–9, 20–22); and
     power over death: He brings Jairus’s daughter back to life (vss. 18, 19,
     23–26). Making it personal, Jesus has power over the storms of our
     lives, over the demons in our lives, and over the disorders (of whatever
     description) that plague us.

What lessons can we learn from Matthew 8:23–27?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In certain ancient mythologies, water was regarded as a foe that God
     overcomes. “To Israel, the raging, unruly waters symbolized the pow-
     ers which are opposed to God’s sovereignty.”—The Interpreter’s
     Dictionary of the Bible (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1962), vol. R–Z,
     p. 809. The reaction of Jesus’ disciples should be ours, as well: “What
     kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!” (Matt.
     8:27, NIV). In a way, their exclamation recalls a statement in the first
     chapter of Isaiah, where God calls heaven and earth to witness the
     rebellious determination of His people. “The ox knows his master, the
     donkey his owner’s manger, but Israel does not know, my people do
     not understand” (Isa. 1:3, NIV). Of all creation, His people are the
     only ones disloyal. So here we may well ask whether we are the only
     entities of nature to stand in resistance to Jesus. The winds and the
     waves obey Him. What about us?

                                                                         39

      The Sheer Marvel of It
        It is not often that one pays attention to the paragraph headings in
      those modern versions of the Bible that have them. But one in Matthew
      9 in the New International Version comes close to a comprehensive
      description of the wonder of Jesus’ works of healing, mercy, and power.
      “A Dead Girl and a Sick Woman,” it says. The words depict the chal-
      lenge constantly confronting the Savior during His time with us; not
      the kind of challenge one could bluff one’s way through. Yet, Jesus con-
      fronted it all. That day, the dead girl came back to life, and the bleed-
      ing woman, after 12 years of misery, got a brand-new start.

Reflect on the following passages (or at least on as many as you are
      able). Do not write anything. Just simply be amazed by the sheer
      marvel of it all, at the wonderful Savior we have. (Matt. 9:27–34;
      12:22, 23; 14:25–31, 34–36; 15:29–31; 20:29–34; Mark 2:1–12;
      Luke 6:19).

         To grasp the full power of these passages, one must take them
      slowly, trying to recapture their original setting. In Matthew 12:22, 23,
      for instance, the man brought to Jesus is both blind and mute. Close
      your eyes and put a finger over your lips for a while, and try to imag-
      ine the condition of that unfortunate soul. In that state you do not
      know what is around you, and you cannot ask. But the man meets
      Jesus and leaves His holy presence with eyes wide open and with his
      tongue unsealed in praise!
         Then how about Matthew 15:30, 31: “Great crowds came to him,
      bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and
      laid them at his feet; and he healed them. The people were amazed when
      they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking
      and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel” (NIV).
         It even got better. Matthew 14:34–36 and Luke 6:19 tell us that peo-
      ple pressed forward to touch the Savior “because power was coming
      from him and healing them all” (Luke 6:19, NIV).

       Jesus promised that His followers will do greater things than He
       did. What does that mean? Why are we not seeing such marvels
       of healing and restoration today? Or, in some places, are we see-
       ing it? How does the church’s healing ministry today compare
       with the example that Jesus set? How can you as an individual
       in modern times help continue Jesus’ healing ministry?

     The Motive Behind It                       (Matt. 4:23–25)

        Back in the 1980s, undercover investigators conducted a sting opera-
     tion on certain American televangelists. Noticing that these preachers
     would invite people to send in their personal prayer requests to the broad-
     cast, with urgent appeals that they enclose a gift “to keep the program on
     the air,” the investigators wanted to know what happened to those dona-
     tions and prayer requests. What they discovered shocked them. Staffers
     for the televangelists would go to the post office, collect the letters sent
     in by listeners, open them on the spot, fish out the donations, then dump
     the prayer requests right there in the post office trash bins.
        In the key passage above, we read of Jesus traversing the entire area
     of Galilee, with huge crowds following Him from all across the
     region. And when Matthew returns to that same theme in chapter 9, he
     adds a critical dimension that forever distinguishes the motives of
     Jesus from that of these charlatans of the airwaves.

Read Matthew 9:35, 36. How does it describe the motive that pro-
     pelled Jesus’ ministry?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The word compassion comes from a Greek word (splagchnon) that
     refers to “the inward parts,” “the bowels,” considered the seat of the
     emotions in the ancient world. Compassion goes beyond sympathy
     (which merely can be intellectual). Compassion comes from the
     inside, from the heart and even the very gut.
       That is what Jesus had. For Him, grabbing people’s money and
     dumping their heartrending prayer requests into post office garbage
     bins would have been inconceivable. Again and again in the Gospels,
     the quality of compassion describes His attitude toward the people. A
     leper begs Him: “ ‘If you are willing, you can make me clean.’ ” Jesus,
     “filled with compassion,” reaches out to him: “ ‘I am willing. . . . Be
     clean!’ ” (Mark 1:40, 41, NIV; cf. Matt. 20:29–34, Mark 10:46–52).

      If you can imagine someone doing all this with never a thought of
      personal gain, never a thought that what he is doing will be picked
      up by the press, or at least will look good on a résumé—with
      absolutely no thought of personal gain whatsoever—then you are
      thinking about Jesus. The single force that moved Him was love,
      love from the belly, love from the gut. The Gospels call it compas-
      sion. To what extent does compassion like this undergird your
      feelings and actions toward others?

                                                                             41

      Sign of a New Day                  (Matt. 11:2–6)

         From his prison cell, John the Baptist sent an urgent message to
      Jesus: “ ‘Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect some-
      one else?’ ” (Matt. 11:3, NIV). For the reader of the Gospels, it is a
      surprising and unexpected question. Was this not the same John who
      so confidently announced the Messiahship of Jesus at the Jordan
      (John 1:29–36)? And why would he raise the question precisely after he
      had “heard in prison what Christ was doing” (Matt. 11:2, NIV)? What
      is important for our study here, however, is Jesus’ response: “Go back
      and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the
      lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are
      raised, and the good news is preached to the poor” (vss. 4, 5, NIV).
         Jesus’ coded message to John was that His ministry was the sign of
      a new day dawning; the Messiah had, indeed, arrived. Surely in the
      back of Jesus’ mind as He spoke were the glorious Messianic proph-
      ecies in the book of Isaiah, among others.

Read Isaiah 29:18, 19; 35:5, 6; 61:1–3. How do these passages relate
      to Jesus’ ministry? Why do you think John and others were so
      slow to catch on?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The idea of Jesus’ ministry as a fulfillment of prophecy and the
      dawning of the Messianic age comes through clearly in Matthew’s
      own interpretation of events, in the way he anchors Jesus’ activities in
      the broader, Messianic context: “This was to fulfill what was spoken
      through the prophet Isaiah: ‘He took up our infirmities and carried our
      diseases’ ” (Matt. 8:17, NIV; citing Isa. 53:4). We see this same idea
      playing out in Matthew’s summary description of Jesus’ overall min-
      istry: “Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their
      synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing
      every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had compas-
      sion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep
      without a shepherd” (Matt. 9:35, 36, NIV; see also Matt. 4:23–25).

       Looking back, we marvel at how John and others could have been
       so slow to see who Jesus was. Of course, hindsight is always very
       clear.What about us today? How might we be just as blind to what
       should be obvious truths? More important, how can we change?

     Sign of the Final Restoration (Acts 3:19–21)
        The marvelous healing of the demon-possessed man who was blind
     and mute, rather than bringing shouts of Hallelujahs from the
     Pharisees, brought instead a charge: “ ‘It is only by Beelzebub, the
     prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons’ ” (Matt. 12:24,
     NIV). Thus was Jesus prompted to give an instructive explanation of
     the meaning of what was happening: “ ‘But if I drive out demons by
     the Spirit of God,’ ” He said, dismissing the Pharisees’ inference,
     “ ‘then the kingdom of God has come upon you’ ” (vs. 28).
        The statement is important, since in the teaching of the Gospels, the
     kingdom of God is not only a present reality (as evident most directly
     in the above statement) but also a future reality (see Matt. 26:29,
      Luke 23:42, John 18:36).
        What this means is that the works of Christ also look forward to the
     final restoration. When Jesus applied the pivotal prophecy of Isaiah to
     Himself during the reading of the scrolls in the synagogue at Nazareth
     (Luke 4:18, 19), He was proclaiming much more than would happen
     within the brief three and a half years of His own earthly ministry.
     “The year of the Lord’s favor,” harking back as it does to the ancient
     Jubilee, was an announcement of the inauguration of the kingdom of
     God, beginning with the coming of the Messiah, and reaching all the
     way down to the final consummation, when all prisoners will have
     been set free, all sight restored, all oppression removed, and when joy
     will pervade the entire cosmos.

What do the following passages teach about the relationship between
     Jesus’ ministry and the final restoration? (Mark 5:35–42, Luke
     7:11–15, John 11:38–44, Acts 3:19–21).

        The most powerful sign of the reign of sin is death. And the restora-
     tion of life by Jesus during His ministry pointed forward to that final
     day when death will be no more. “ ‘I am the Living One,’ ” says the
     resurrected Christ in John’s apocalyptic vision, “ ‘I was dead, and
     behold I am alive for ever . . . ! And I hold the keys of death and
     Hades’ ” (Rev. 1:18, NIV). Those whom Jesus restored to life during
     His ministry all succumbed to death again. But Jesus looked beyond
     that, to the final restoration, when “the trumpet will sound, [and] the
     dead will be raised imperishable” (1 Cor. 15:52, NIV).

      How crucial is the hope of the resurrection? What do we have
      without it? What reasons do you have for trusting in God’s
      promise to one day destroy, forever, death?

    Further Study: Examine the following statement. How does it
         relate to the overall lesson for this week? Do you see areas of tension?
         Or does it make the same general point in a different way? Here it is:
         “The Gospels are filled with accounts of Jesus’ miracles, but it would
         be a mistake to place our emphasis there. For one thing, Jesus did not
         himself emphasize them; almost all of them were performed quietly,
         apart from the crowd, and as demonstrations of the power of faith. We
1
         get a better perspective on Jesus’ activities if we place the emphasis
         where one of his disciples did. Once, in addressing a group, Peter
         found it necessary to epitomize Jesus’ life, and said, ‘He went about
         doing good.’ Moving easily and without affectation among ordinary
         people and social misfits, healing them, counseling them, Jesus went
         about doing good. He did so with such single-minded effectiveness,
2
         that those who were with him constantly found their estimate of him
         modulating to a new key. They found themselves thinking that if divine
         goodness were to manifest itself in human form, this is how it would
         behave.”—Huston Smith, The Illustrated World’s Religions, p. 210.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Ellen G. White said that “the great work of the gospel is not to
          close with less manifestation of the power of God than marked its
3         opening.” She spoke of a vigorous, worldwide thrust as the end
          approaches, and said that “miracles will be wrought, the sick will
          be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers” ( The
          Great Controversy, pp. 611, 612). How do you see this prophecy
          coming to pass? How do you visualize your own participation in
          it? What role does your local church have in all this? What things
          can we do to prepare for this time?

          ●2 Suppose someone appeared who did many amazing miracles,
          as did Jesus, miracles that testified to what was clearly super-
          natural. How could, should, you respond?

          ern miracles, and discuss your answers and the reasons for them.

Thrown Into the River: Part 1
by SUNIL BIKAS TRIPURA
  I am from the hills of Bangladesh. From my childhood I was devoted to
several gods. I attended festivals, offered gifts to the gods to whom I
prayed, and went on pilgrimages, all to receive the blessings of the gods.
  On one religious pilgrimage I was dismayed to find the priests asking
pilgrims for money to forgive their sins. I could not believe it when I heard
them say that the more a poor pilgrim gave, the more surely their sins
would be forgiven. Can I buy forgiveness with money? I wondered. If so,
then the rich can be forgiven. But what about the poor?
  I climbed the mountain to the holy place, but when I reached the top, I
found drunken priests and pilgrims. Some declared themselves gods in
their own right and asked other pilgrims for money to be forgiven.
  I knew that these priests and pilgrims were violating the holy writings—
and on temple grounds! I thought about it and realized that one god I wor-
shiped had committed at least three of the five forbidden sins. How could
a human be expected to stay pure if a god cannot? I wondered who could
save me if not these gods.
  I began to question my faith. Is my god the true god? Or is there another
God, more powerful, more perfect, One who can overcome sin and take us
to heaven? As I pondered these questions, I determined to start searching
for the answers.
  One day I met a man who said he is a Christian, a Seventh-day Adventist
Christian. When I asked him about sin and forgiveness, he told me that
everyone is a sinner, and that Jesus is the only Savior. Only Jesus lived a
perfect life, and only Jesus can save us from sin.
  I asked the man for a Bible and started reading it. I compared Jesus with
my god and discovered that Jesus truly is the only righteous being, the true
Savior. I surrendered my life to Jesus, trusting Him to save me.
  But my aunt and uncle, who were my guardians, were angry that I had
forsaken their gods. They forbade me to touch the food or to drink from
their cups, saying it would make them unfit for use. But even worse per-
secution was to follow.

      (John 7:46, NIV).

             ome of Jesus’ sayings present a whole host of values radically at

      S      odds with what often is viewed as normal. We are, He says, to
             turn the other cheek; that is, we are not to resist evil. Of course,
      almost everyone assumes that evil should be resisted, often by every
      means possible. And to love those who are our enemies? Are enemies
      not to be hated? It is friends and families we are to love, right? Not
      according to Jesus.
         It gets even more confusing. According to Jesus, it is the outcasts,
      the harlots, and others like them who will enter the kingdom of God
      before so many of the so-called righteous. How can that be?
         Jesus says that the blessed ones are the ones who weep, who are
      merciful, who are pure in heart. We thought the blessed ones were the
      rich, the powerful, those who have good looks and plenty of friends,
      right?
         Yet, even those sayings were not the most challenging to come from
      the lips of Jesus. This lesson examines a few of Jesus’ pronounce-
      ments that fall into the category of sayings, since they are not teach-
      ings in the strict sense of the term.
         What did Jesus mean by these sayings? And how are we expected
      to apply them to our lives today?

     About Marriage and Abstinence
Some of Jesus’ hardest sayings deal with the question of marriage
     and divorce. Read the following passage. What things are clear?
     What things are not so easy to understand? Even with what is not
     clear, what is the essential message that Jesus is giving here?

     Matt. 19:3–12
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        There is much to chew on in the Pharisees’ question. Note, for
     example, the male-oriented nature of the question, “ ‘Is it lawful for a
     man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?’ ”(vs. 3, NIV). Of
     course, the answer is no, and Jesus makes that clear (vss. 4–6). But the
     questioners’ real motive emerges as we come to verse 7: “ ‘Why then
     . . . did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of
     divorce and send her away?’ ” Going beyond Moses, Jesus tightens the
     terms for a marital split, coming down hard on those men with a yen
     for ditching wives. On one condition only, He says, marital infidelity.
     Any other grounds would constitute adultery (vss. 8, 9). Shocked, the
     disciples jump into the discussion: “ ‘It is better not to marry’ ” (vs.
     10, NIV), they state.
        Their response provides the impetus for one of the most difficult
     statements to come from the lips of Jesus.

Read again Matthew 19:11, 12. Who are those that cannot accept
     Jesus’ tough line?

       Does Jesus mean to exempt them? Who are included in “ ‘only those
     to whom it has been given’ ” (vs. 11, NIV)? Are these a special group
     of morally (sexually) gifted people? What are we to make of Jesus’
     eunuch reference? How are the three categories of eunuch to be
     explained, and how do they apply to us? Jesus’ most puzzling line
     comes at the end: “ ‘The one who can accept this should accept it’ ”
     (vs. 12, NIV). Is this a Divine concession for people too weak to com-
     ply with the high standard He outlined? And if a concession, does it
     apply to the whole discourse about divorce?

      As is sometimes the case, there are things in the Bible that are
      hard to understand (2 Pet. 3:16). Why is it so important not to
      get hung up on those things, but rather to focus on and live out
      what we do understand?



                                                                         47

     About Forgiveness                   (Matt. 18:21, 22)

        Jesus, we saw in an earlier lesson, is the embodiment of forgiveness.
     We return to the subject in this lesson, however, to grapple with the
     issue as to whether Jesus’ statements about forgiveness (in the above
     passage, for example) are as simple as we sometimes make them out
     to be.

Reflect on Matthew 18:21, 22. What kind of offenses does Jesus
     have in mind here? How do we apply Jesus’ words in cases of
     repeated sexual or physical abuse, such as within the home? Did
     Jesus have very egregious offenses in mind, such as when someone
     kills a pregnant woman, opens up her womb, and steals her unborn
     baby (as happened in Melvern, Kansas, in December 2004)?
     Could it be that Jesus, speaking to ordinary people about ordi-
     nary offenses, mistakes, and hurts that we experience in our nor-
     mal interaction with one another, gives a command that does not
     envision the more complex and sinister cases of human criminal-
     ity? What do you think?

        Known in the media as Girl X, she came to a Chicago court in a
     wheelchair. Raising her head and making eye movements to commu-
     nicate, the 13-year-old testified “about the attack in 1997 that left her
     severely disabled. She was the third witness in the trial of Patrick
     Sykes, 29, who is accused of raping her, beating her and pouring roach
     killer down her throat in the attack.”—Mike Robinson, Associated
     Press, Washington Post, March 24, 2001, p. A22.
        Is Jesus asking the victims of heinous acts to forgive not only the
     first occurrence but also the seventh? And is He saying that God will
     never forgive those who find themselves unable to absolve the demons
     in human flesh that commit them? The point here is not that we
     should not forgive. Rather, it is whether we may press the gracious
     counsel of the Lord too far when we apply it to the kind of ghastly,
     mind-numbing atrocities listed above.

      As you think about the questions above, do not forget Jesus’
      words on the cross: “ ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know
      what they are doing’ ” (Luke 23:34, NIV). If Jesus is asking God
      to forgive those who crucified Him (Who did this include? The
      Roman soldiers? Caiphas? Pilate? Herod? The chief priests and
      scribes?), should we not forgive everything? Bring your thoughts
      to class on Sabbath.

     About Wealth and Giving (Luke 12:32–34)
       To the rich young ruler who came to Him, Jesus said, “ ‘Sell every-
     thing you have and give to the poor’ ” (Luke 18:22, NIV). Our expla-
     nation of this radical command usually has been that Jesus’ stipulation
     was specific to this young man, based on a prophetic insight into the
     ruler’s need. Here Jesus put His finger on the one big obstacle
     between the ruler and salvation: money. But does He not give that
     same directive to everyone?
       In Luke 12:33 Jesus seems to apply to everyone with means the
     same injunction He gave the rich young ruler: “Sell your possessions
     and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear
     out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted” (NIV).

How should we understand this saying? Was Jesus advocating a redis-
     tribution of wealth for all Christians in all times and places? What
     practical problems would arise if we literally carried out His injunc-
     tion? Take any given community, in which all Christians have sold
     all their property and given the proceeds to the poor, what now is
     the economic status of those Christians? How do they support
     themselves and their own families? And how do they now get the
     means to carry forward the rest of Jesus’ mission—to take the
     gospel to new frontiers, for example?

        Three considerations may be helpful here. One is to note what actu-
     ally happened during the course of Jesus’ own ministry: His little
     group seemed to have had funds on hand—Judas kept them (John
     12:6, 13:29). A second is to take a careful look at what happened in
     the early church, among those Christians closest to the life setting of
     Jesus’ statement. (In Acts 4:32–37 we witness what appeared to be an
     orderly, voluntary process as they sought to follow Jesus’ injunction.)
     A third consideration is to examine what happened in the early church
     beyond the book of Acts (in the letters of Paul, John, Peter, etc., we see
     no wholesale selling of property).

      When you take all these things, as well as the whole Bible (which
      does not condemn wealth, per se), into consideration, what do
      you think was Christ’s point? How does Luke 12:34 catch the
      essence of His message?

     About Perfection                 (Matt. 5:48)

       For many people, one of Jesus’ most puzzling statements comes in
     the middle of the Sermon on the Mount: “ ‘Be perfect, therefore, as
     your heavenly Father is perfect’ ” (Matt. 5:48, NIV). Across the cen-
     turies, conscientious Christians have struggled to reach the standard to
     which they thought Jesus Christ was pointing, a state of complete vic-
     tory over the world, the flesh, and the devil. Some have flagellated and
     beaten themselves; some have gone on pilgrimages; others have
     sought it through stringent keeping of the law. The goal is altogether
     worthy in every case. But is that what Jesus was calling for in
     Matthew 5?

Compare the following pairs of scriptures. Notice how they inform
     and balance each other:

     Matt. 10:34–39 and Luke 14:26, 27
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Matt. 7:7–11 and Luke 11:9–13
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Matt. 5:48 and Luke 6:32–36
     ____________________________________________________________________

        The seemingly harsh language of Jesus in Luke 14 is mollified by
     its parallel in Matthew 10, which gives us, we think, a better grasp of
     what Jesus was trying to say. And whereas the Matthew 7 passage on
     prayer has Jesus promising us, upon the asking of “good gifts” (vs. 11,
     RSV; “good things,” KJV; which can inadvertently focus the mind on
     the material), Luke has Jesus pledging, instead, “the Holy Spirit”
     (Luke 11:13, NIV)—a considerable shift in perspective.
        The same kind of synthesis takes place in respect to the final pair of
     texts. Where Matthew has Jesus saying, “ ‘Be ye therefore perfect,’ ”
     (Matt. 5:48), Luke reports His words as, “ ‘Be ye therefore merciful’ ”
     (Luke 6:36), which, according to both contexts, comes closer to what
     Jesus meant. In Luke the context speaks about loving our enemies,
     and lending without expecting anything back. Doing things like that,
     Jesus says, makes us “ ‘sons of the Most High, because he is kind to
     the ungrateful and wicked’ ” (vs. 35, NIV). Then follows immediately
     the statement, “ ‘Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful’ ” (vs. 36,
     NIV). In Matthew the situation is identical, the verse on being perfect
     preceded by talk of love to enemies, prayer for those who mistreat us,
     and about God sending rain equally on the righteous and the wicked.
     Jesus thus wanted to encourage us to be just like our heavenly Father,
     who is kind to all and shows no partiality. That is what perfect in this
     context means. It is a high order, to be sure, but what higher ideal can
     a Christian strive for?

     About Family               (John 19:25–27)

       A young woman joined David Koresh’s ill-fated group back in the
     1990s and was at the group’s Waco, Texas, compound when her
     mother passed away in Canada. As she prepared to leave for the
     funeral, the charismatic guru intercepted her plans. No need, he said,
     to expend time and funds for such mundane purposes; there are more
     important things to do on the compound. She never went.

Read the following sayings of Jesus: Matt. 10:34–37, 12:46–50, Luke
     9:59–62, 12:49–53, 14:26. How would you answer the charge that
     they tend to give aid and comfort to charismatics like Koresh (and
     others) who denigrate natural family ties and loyalties?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “This reconfiguration of family values—driving a wedge between
     earthly and heavenly, . . . becomes a major theme in Luke’s gospel.
      . . . In addition to statements embracing all who keep God’s word as
     true kinfolk (8:19–21; 11:27, 28), . . . Luke’s Jesus lays down the
     shocking mandate to ‘hate father and mother’—even to the point of
     leaving a dead father to bury himself!—as a condition for discipleship
     (9:57–62; 14:25).”—F. Scott Spencer, What Did Jesus Do? (Harrisburg,
     Pa.: Trinity Press International, 2003), p. 35.
        Jesus’ statements sound harsh to the modern ear, to be sure. But are
     they really so, when you understand what they mean? In the case of
     letting “the dead bury their own dead” (Luke 9:60, NIV) for example,
     had the father of the potential disciple actually died? Or was that per-
     son saying, in effect, “I will follow you after my father dies, and I have
     secured all the property”? And how should we understand Jesus’ state-
     ment in Luke 14:26 that no one can be His disciple who “ ‘does not
     hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sis-
     ters—yes, even his own life’ ” (NIV)? As pointed out in yesterday’s
     lesson, the Matthew parallel throws light on Jesus’ meaning here, by
     Jesus talking in the Matthew text about those who love father and
     mother and wife, etc., more than Him (see Matt. 10:37). “In the Bible,
     ‘to hate,’ often should be understood simply as . . . ‘to love less.’ ”—
     The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 811. The idea Jesus was trying
     to get across was the importance of putting God first.

      Oftentimes our familial bonds are the strongest earthly bonds
      that we know, and rightly so. Why, though, must God always
      come first, even before family, if need be?

                                                                           51

    Further Study: No question, some of Jesus’ sayings are hard to
         understand, especially if taken in isolation. When, however, we view
         them in context, particularly with other corrective statements that bal-
         ance them out, many of them become much easier to understand. Even
         then it becomes clear that following Jesus cannot be a halfway thing.
1
         Either we give ourselves to Him completely, regardless of the cost, or
         we do not give ourselves to Him at all.

            “Celibacy is not the ordinary, normal state, and it is a deception of
         the devil that, of itself, it can lead to a superior state of holiness than
         would otherwise be possible. Among the Jews celibacy was frowned
2
         upon or pitied, and it was practiced only by extreme ascetic groups
         such as the Essenes. . . . The Scripture record states specifically that
         Peter was married, and probably the other disciples were as well. . . .
         Jesus never recommended celibacy, either for Christians as a whole or
         for Christian leaders. It is not natural, and does not contribute to the
         development of a symmetrical character in the way that normal mar-
         ried life can.
            “The words of our Lord [in Matt. 19:12], if understood literally,
3
         would run counter to the whole tenor of Scripture. The idea of bodily
         mutilation is abhorrent. It seems proper to see this statement as anal-
         ogous to Christ’s declaration in Matthew 5:30” (about cutting off an
         offending limb).—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 455, 456.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 The above statement on celibacy seems to have a particular
          religious culture in mind. But in what ways might it, uninten-
          tionally, bring discouragement to ordinary Christians who are
          single or widowed, or who for other reasons find it appropriate
          to be celibate? In what ways can we affirm people who have
          made that choice?

          2 Bring your answers to Monday’s final question to class, and
          discuss the question of whether forgiveness does or should have
          limits.

          ●
          3 It is one thing to spout scriptures about how God has to come
          first, even before family; it is another, of course, to actually exer-
          cise the faith to do that. In most churches around the world, there
          probably will be people who have been alienated greatly by their
          families because of their faith. What about your own church? Is
          there anyone there who has lost family because of their adher-
          ence to Jesus? If so, how can you, as a church family, help make
          up the difference?

Thrown Into the River: Part 2
by SUNIL BIKAS TRIPURA
   As a teen I gave up my belief in many gods and became a Christian,
mostly by reading the Bible. But my decision angered many people. Friends
forsook me, and the girl I hoped to marry left me to marry another. And
when my grandfather died, the villagers refused to let me attend his funeral
ceremony. Instead they grabbed me and threw me into the nearby river.
   I had no Christian friends, no one to comfort or encourage me. I cried to
Jesus, “Are You the true God? If so, where are You? I am persecuted. Have
You no power to help me?” But I felt no answer to my prayer, so I stopped
reading the Bible. I looked elsewhere for a god I could believe in, but other
religions seemed full of confusion. Desperate, I picked up the Bible again
and opened it at random. It opened to the book of Job. There I found
courage.
   I again met the man who had given me the Bible. I told him of my prob-
lem, and he encouraged me to be faithful. With his help I recommitted my
life to God.
   I wanted to continue my studies at the Adventist college in Bangladesh,
but without my family’s support it seemed impossible. I searched for work,
but the only job I could find was at a cigarette factory. I had only 500 taka
(about U.S. $8). It would not pay for even a week of school. Once more, dis-
couragement set in.
   I stopped at the church’s headquarters and received encouragement not to
give up on my dream to study. Encouraged, I asked God for 1,000 taka (U.S.
$16) from my family, those who had turned from me when I became a
Christian. That would be enough to at least enroll in school. I told my uncles
about my need, and they gave me almost 3,000 taka, more than I had asked
God for.
   I enrolled in the school and supported myself by selling books. I want to
become a pastor and work among my tribal people, only a few of whom are
Christians. I have begun working among my people, and I see them listen-
ing and accepting God’s message of love. So far 35 people attend the little
Sabbath School in my village and some nearby villages. They have no
church in which to worship, so my goal is to provide a simple house of wor-
ship for them.
   God has called me to this task, and I will not turn back. I have seen how
God has led me in the past, so I have confidence He will provide for me as
I follow His leading. Your mission offerings help me in my work of leading
people who have never heard the name of Jesus to the foot of the cross.

      The Puzzle of His
      Conduct


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:12, 13; 8:28–32;
      11:18, 19; 21:12, 13; Luke 2:41–51; 5:32; 1 Cor. 1:26–28.

Memory Text: “The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and
      they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collec-
      tors and “sinners” ’ ” (Matthew 11:19, NIV).

             ast week’s lesson focused on sayings of Jesus that leave con-

      L      temporary people scratching their heads. This week’s lesson
             probes similar issues, but in respect to His conduct.
         One of our problems with Jesus is our perennial temptation to re-
      create Him in our own image. The revolutionary makes Him out to be
      one of them; social conservatives believe they have Him in their cor-
      ner. To an extent, that is unavoidable. After all, our own culture and
      situation form the matrix through which we both consciously and even
      unconsciously view reality. But to be conscious of this fact offers
      some hope that we can begin, at least in some limited way, to tran-
      scend it, and attempt as objective an approach as we can to the Jesus
      we find in the Gospels.
         Once we do that, we discover that it is not easy to pigeon-hole Him,
      not easy to place Him in a tidy little package with the word solved on
      top. Instead, we find ourselves genuinely puzzled by aspects of His
      conduct, wondering, Does He expect us to do that, and in the same
      way?
         This week we will look at some of the more puzzling actions of
      Jesus in order to learn what we can apply and, perhaps, not apply to
      our own lives.

     Neglecting Parents?
       As stated earlier, the Gospels are almost totally silent on the first 30
     years or so of Jesus’ life. Though not much is given, there is one
     account of this time frame that gives us pause.

Read Luke 2:41–51. At first sight, what impression does the passage
     leave about Jesus’ regard for His parents? On the other hand,
     what else might have been going on here? What hint could be
     found in verse 47?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The incident, on the face of it, gives the impression of an irrespon-
     sible lad, utterly uncaring about the pain and anxiety of his parents.
     What parents would not be terribly angry at such apparently callous
     disregard for their convenience and the rules of their home?
        This is one of those events that show the limits of using Jesus’ con-
     duct as a model in every case. What is happening here, it would seem,
     is that Jesus’ Messiahship has already begun to shine through at the
     tender age of 12. He is becoming conscious of an allegiance to a
     Power infinitely higher than His parents, however much He respected
     them. The brevity of Luke’s account leaves a dozen questions unan-
     swered, such as Who fed and housed the lad those three days? Did the
     priests have any concern to find His parents?

Read Jesus’ response to His parents. What was He telling them, at
     least indirectly?

       “But,” Luke reports, “they did not understand what he was saying to
     them” (Luke 2:50, NIV). Jesus would return home with them and, as a
     child, be subject to them (vs. 51); but He had taken pains to establish
     the position of a higher loyalty. Nor is there any indication that He
     ever apologized for the terrible inconvenience He had caused His anx-
     ious parents.

      Jesus’ entire life was guided by the supremacy of God and God’s
      kingdom, even at the cost of being misunderstood. In what ways
      might your loyalty to God be misunderstood by others? If this
      has ever happened to you, what did you learn that could, per-
      haps, help someone else going through a similar experience?

     Displaying Anger?
       When Jesus descended the Mount of Transfiguration, a man emerged
     from a crowd at the base with a request that Jesus heal His son. He had
     taken the boy to the disciples, the man explained, but they had been
     unable to cure him. Jesus’ response, as it comes through in translation,
     gives the impression of being peeved by the request. “ ‘O unbelieving
     and perverse generation,’ ” He replied, “ ‘. . . how long shall I put up
     with you? Bring the boy here to me’ ” (Matt. 17:17, NIV). At the very
     least, such words seem uncharacteristic of the One we have come to
     know as the “gentle Jesus, meek and mild.” How might we explain
     Jesus’ tone here? It is a difficult call. The Gospels mention other occa-
     sions when Jesus certainly appeared angry, as well.

How do you understand the following passages? (Matt. 21:12, 13;
     Mark 3:1–5).

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Many Christians consider that the way for us to proceed with
     choices in our complex, contemporary world is to ask, What would
     Jesus do? It sounds simple enough, until one asks the logical prelimi-
     nary question, What did Jesus do? Here we discover that the answers
     are not always as simple as we may think. What, for example, are the
     implications of the above passages for our own conduct today?
        “Presuming that what Jesus would do today has some correlation with
     what he actually did then—in first-century Roman Palestine . . . —how
     in the world might a contemporary Christian go about replicating and
     applying these bizarre incidents of tree-cursing and temple-disrupting?
     If our favorite grocery store happens not to stock a particular fruit we are
     craving—because it’s out of season!—do we proceed, with Jesus’ bless-
     ing, to curse the fruit bin, the produce manager, and everything else in
     sight? And if the preacher goes on too much about money one Sunday or
     if we are just generally miffed at various church personnel and programs,
     do we bust in during a worship service and start upending pews, pulpits,
     altars—anything not nailed down—and bouncing ushers from the prem-
     ises?”—F. Scott Spencer, What Did Jesus Do? p. ix.

      What principles should we bring to bear upon such questions?
      Where does spiritual common sense come in? Jesus came as the
      Messiah, the Savior of humanity. How do we distinguish what
      He did strictly in that role from that which He intends for us to
      follow?

     Destroying Personal Property?
       An underlying concern of this week’s lesson centers on the way we
     use Jesus as our model. How straightforward is the goal of “following
     His example”? And what we are noticing is that it is a matter that calls
     for the most careful thought and discrimination. There are certainly
     cases—the majority, in fact—sin which we detect a clear, ethical
     example to follow; in others the principle is not very clear. Two cases:

Read Matthew 8:28–32 (compare Mark 5:1–20, Luke 8:26–39) and
     Matthew 21:18, 19 (compare Mark 11:12–14, 20, 21). Why do you
     think Jesus allowed the demons to enter the herd of swine? Would
     He have done the same thing if the animals had been sheep? Where
     is the sympathy in Jesus’ action here? Was there a concern on His
     part that, regardless of His own dietary strictures, the herd, never-
     theless, represented the livelihood of one or more families in the
     town? How would the idea of compensation fit into this picture?

        “If these swine were owned by Gentiles, we should be left without
     a real explanation for their destruction. To say that the devils were
     ordered merely to leave the men, and that their entering the swine was
     their own act, contradicts their request to Jesus and the plain state-
     ments of Mark and of Luke that Jesus gave them permission.”—R. C.
     H. Lenski, The Interpretation of St. Matthew’s Gospel (Minneapolis,
     Minn.: Augsburg Publishing House, 1943), p. 353. Another Bible
     scholar sees in Jesus’ action “a powerful protest.” “The name ‘Legion’
     and the pig mascot,” he says, “both signify Roman military occupa-
     tion.” Thus Jesus’ intention was to “protest against oppressive Roman
     possession of Israel.”—F. Scott Spencer, What Did Jesus Do? p. 101.

      Ellen G. White says that “it was in mercy to the owners of the
      swine that this loss had been permitted to come upon them.
      They were absorbed in earthly things, and cared not for the
      great interests of spiritual life. Jesus desired to break the spell
      of selfish indifference, that they might accept His grace.”—The
      Desire of Ages, p. 338. While these comments might help us to
      understand certain calamities that come upon us personally,
      how do you see it setting any precedence in regard to our own
      action? Or is this one of those actions pertaining to Jesus’ role
      as Messiah-Prophet, and not intended as an example for us to
      follow, as such? How would you make the case that the same is
      true in regard to the cursing of the fig tree (which probably had
      a personal owner)?




                                                                         59

     Neglecting the Persecuted?
       In His most dramatic depiction of the last judgment, Jesus tells about
     when He will divide the nations gathered before Him into two groups,
     the sheep and the goats. To the sheep He says, among other things, “ ‘I
     was in prison and you came to visit me’ ” (Matt. 25:36, NIV).

Read the following texts in the light of Jesus’ judgment pronounce-
     ment. Give your immediate impression on how you think the text
     relates to His prison reference in the judgment.

     Matt. 4:12, 13

     Matt. 11:2, 3

     Matt. 14:1–13

        How is Jesus’ conduct during the imprisonment of John to be
     explained? Upon first hearing of John’s incarceration, He returns to
     Galilee (Matt. 4:12). And all the evidence suggests that John did not
     receive a visit from his illustrious contemporary while in the dungeon,
     a clear implication of Matthew 11:2, 3. According to the passage, John
     dispatches his disciples to Jesus with a question; that being, appar-
     ently, the only means of contact available to him. Following the visit
     of John’s people, Jesus launches into high praise for the embattled
     prophet but does not visit him.
        One of the most persistent questions we face as human beings cen-
     ters around the issue of suffering: Where is God when we hurt? In the
     experience of John, we have a partial answer, in terms of Jesus’ con-
     duct. Though He was God in human flesh, with power to act, Jesus
     does not intervene to rescue the one who had helped prepare the
     ground for His own ministry. And following John’s murder, all we get
     from Jesus (who, we suspect, felt it keenly) is silence. Nor is it likely
     that He or His disciples attended John’s funeral.

How would you explain Jesus’ conduct during this dark time for
     John? What were the probable extenuating circumstances that
     might have played a role in His decision? (See The SDA Bible Com-
     mentary, vol. 5, p. 316, which suggests that the authorities were
     attempting to silence both John and Jesus.)

      And how can His behavior during the entire episode with the
      Baptist help us understand the silence of God in our own times
      of trouble?

     Hanging Out With Undesirables
       Most of us have a doctored image of Jesus. And however often we
     hear that He associated with those whom His own society considered
     unacceptable, our imagination either holds back from going all the
     way or goes too far. Often, rather than quietly coming to grips with
     what that aspect of Jesus’ life should mean for us today on a personal
     basis, we use His behavior to beat one another on the head, for being
     too exclusive, too conservative, in regard to the more seedy elements
     of society. One suspects, however, that a careful examination of Jesus’
     relations with the undesirables of His day would leave most (if not all)
     of us feeling at least a tad uncomfortable.

Examine the following passages. What message can we take from
     them? Matt. 9:10–13; 11:18, 19; Luke 5:32; 1 Cor. 1:26–28.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       If we apply these passages to our times, our imagination should see
     Jesus sitting down with people of questionable morals in settings of
     deepest fellowship (as was mealtime in the ancient world). Eating and
     drinking are taking place; loud and raucous music is heard; practicing
     prostitutes lurk in the shadows. That is the setting, and that is precisely
     where Jesus went.
       Interestingly, it is from Jesus Himself that we learn about the most
     pejorative labels His enemies promulgated about Him: that He was “a
     glutton and a drunkard” (Matt. 11:19, Luke 7:34, NIV). “These slurs
     would never work against a John the Baptist or a Gandhi, but for one
     who spends as much time as Jesus does frequenting and talking about
     dinner parties and banquets, they make a point, even if exagger-
     ated.”—F. Scott Spencer, What Did Jesus Do? p. 90. However exag-
     gerated, it was nothing short of extraordinary for the Savior of the
     world to be charged with inebriation and overeating.

      What can we learn from these texts that we can apply to our
      own lives? What should we not apply? As you answer, think
      about what purpose Jesus had for being with these people. How
      does that answer help us understand what practical principles
      we can take away?

    Further Study: “Jesus saw in every soul one to whom must be
         given the call to His kingdom. He reached the hearts of the people by
         going among them as one who desired their good. He sought them in
         the public streets, in private houses, on the boats, in the synagogue, by
         the shores of the lake, and at the marriage feast. He met them at their
         daily vocations, and manifested an interest in their secular affairs. He
         carried His instruction into the household, bringing families in their
         own homes under the influence of His divine presence. His strong per-
         sonal sympathy helped to win hearts.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
1        Ages, p. 151.
           “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the peo-
         ple. The Saviour mingled with [people] as one who desired their good.
         He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won
         their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’ ”—Ellen G. White,
         The Ministry of Healing, p. 143.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What is righteous anger? When is it legitimate, and when is it
          not? Take your thoughts to class for discussion.

          ●
          2 How is Jesus’ relationship with the undesirables of society a
          guide for us? Under what conditions might our association with
          sinners become a peril to our own souls? In all His social con-
3         tacts, Jesus seemed to be in charge. What should that say to us in
          our own attempts to penetrate the more questionable areas of
          society?

          ●3 To what extent is Jesus’ conduct a model for us today? To what
          extent is it not? What are other examples of His conduct here
          that might be problematic for us to follow?

          ●
          4 Think more about this idea of being misunderstood by others
          as we seek to follow God’s will. Though we see examples of this,
          such as in Jesus’ early life, why must we be careful? That is, some
          people have done some very damaging things to themselves and
          to others, all because they believed that God told them 10. How
          do we know for sure that God is calling us to do certain things
          that might cause us to be misunderstood? Why should we be
          open to the counsel of others before we do things that we are con-
          vinced that God told us to do? At the same time, how can we be
          careful not to impede someone who is being led by God in ways
          that might seem strange to us?

Daniel’s New Song
by DANIEL NEWMANN
   I was born in Brazil, but my parents took me to America when I was still
a baby. I was a good kid, but in junior high things changed. I got interested
in punk rock music, and it changed my life. I wore punk-style clothes and
hung out with punk friends. I started drinking and smoking marijuana with
them, and soon I was part of their culture.
   When my mom realized what I was involved in, she freaked out. She
had sent me to a good school so I would make good friends, and suddenly
I was going the wrong way. Although my mom had some weird religious
ideas, she started telling me how much God loves me and how Jesus died
for me. Because of her prayers and encouragement I stopped smoking and
drinking.
   But I still loved punk music, and it drew me into a culture that spelled
trouble. Mom tried to show me the dangers hidden in the lyrics of my
music, but I would not listen.
   My punk friends never made fun of me when I refused to join them in
drinking or smoking. However, in time I realized that there was no future
in the gang, and I began to pull away. But when the gang realized that I
wanted to leave, they told me that if I left they would kill me. I was afraid,
for they had killed another boy who had betrayed the gang.
   I told my parents that my life was in danger. My mom understood and
suggested that I go to Brazil. I had spent summers there, so I agreed. She
found a Christian school on the Internet and enrolled me.
   I arrived at school—an Adventist boarding school—and liked it imme-
diately. Everyone was friendly. And the music I heard there touched my
heart. One Sabbath as the choir sang, I felt God speaking to me through
the music. I knew that I was where God wanted me to be. I could relate to
the speaker, who told how God had rescued him from a terrible life. By
                              the end of the service I knew that I wanted to
                              be a Christian. I began studying the Bible,
                              and I shared with my mother what I was
                              learning.
                                Mom had enrolled me in this school to save
                              my life, but God used this school to save my
                              soul. I want my mom to believe in God the
                              way I am learning to believe. I once loved
                              punk music, but God has given me a new
                              song, a song I love to sing.

          LESSON           8       *May 17–23



      The Intensity of His Walk




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:4, Luke 2:40,
      6:12, John 4:34, John 17, 1 John 2:6.

Memory Text: “Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus
      did” (1 John 2:6, NIV).

              dventists are a peace-loving people. We feel elated when the

      A       church or its members get positive press, when everybody
              thinks we are good. But how might we react if we woke up one
      day to find huge headlines in the media branding us as losers, dis-
      rupters, or insurrectionists? Would our sense of assurance and confi-
      dence in God be strong enough to sustain us? We admire Jesus after the
      fact; but do we have any idea what it meant for Him to be vilified and
      demonized by the highest civic and ecclesiastical powers of His day?
         In the end we see Him manhandled by Roman soldiers: “They put
      a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set
      it on him. And they began to call out to him, ‘Hail, king of the Jews!’
      Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on
      him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. . . . Then they
      led him out to crucify him” (Mark 15:17–20, NIV).
         What prepares a person to endure such physical and psychological
      abuse without cracking? How does a person remain steadfast and
      calm when the whole world turns against them—with not a shred of
      visible human support in sight? For Jesus, the answer lay in His com-
      munion with God, in the intensity of His walk with Him—which
      forms the subject of this week’s lesson.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, May 24.

     The Early Years               (Luke 2:40)

        As we have stressed already, we know very little about Christ’s early
     years. We hear about His birth and very early years, including the visit
     to the temple at age 12 (see Luke 2). But that is all, until His baptism
     by John at the start of His public ministry, when He was “about thirty”
     (NIV; see Luke 3:21–23).
        Nevertheless, it is possible to look at His life, as we know it, and
     draw certain reasonable conclusions in respect to the spiritual founda-
     tion that gave it support. If we assume from our own experience that
     the stability and strength we see in Jesus during His public ministry
     did not materialize overnight nor arise from shallowness and superfi-
     ciality, then we are bound to conclude, again from our own experi-
     ence, that they sprang from an intense walk with God.

Read again the story of Jesus at the temple (Luke 2:39–52). What
     things are found there that help us understand the spiritual foun-
     dation upon which the young Jesus grew? Also, what role did His
     parents play in His growth?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Incredibly, these passages (apart from the birth narratives) are all
     we have on the first 30 years of Jesus’ life. Furthermore, biblical
     scholars estimate that the vast majority of the Gospel materials center
     on the final week of Jesus’ life, making them (as has often been said)
     “Passion narratives,” not biographies, as such. They were produced,
     evidently, for the well-defined purpose of shining the spotlight on the
     two critical events of the Christian faith: the mystery of Jesus’ birth
     (the Incarnation) and the significance of His death and resurrection.
     Between these two events we see His unselfish life of service and sac-
     rifice. And we correctly may assume that the focus and dedication we
     see in His public ministry represent the flowering of a relationship
     with God that was consistent, deeply personal, and intense.

      What principles can we take from this story that we, in our own
      context, can apply to ourselves and our own spiritual life?




                                                                         65

      At the Start of His Ministry                          (Matt. 4:4)

        Following His baptism, Jesus goes out into the Judean desert for 40
      days to pray, to reflect upon His mission. Perhaps none of us studying
      this lesson has had any personal knowledge of what that means. Here
      we come face-to-face with an intensity we can hardly grasp, a spiritual
      concentration much beyond our usual experience, a pursuit of intimate
      closeness with God that leaves our mouths wide open.
        But the explicit reason for this wilderness foray was for testing
      (Matt. 4:1; cf. Luke 4:2), and the tempter was on hand to take advan-
      tage of the opportunity. Using the Savior’s extreme hunger as his tool,
      he desperately tried to drive a wedge between Jesus and His Father, to
      wrench Jesus’ firm grasp on God, to break the intensity of His walk
      with Him, to intrude upon the intimate closeness.

How does Jesus’ response, as revealed in the following texts, show the
      intensity of His walk with God? What can we learn from this that
      we can apply to ourselves? (Matt. 4:3–10, Luke 4:3–12).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         To understand what is going on here, we need to keep in mind
      Jesus’ unique status in the whole scheme of salvation. He was the
      spotless Son of God. Coming into the world in human nature, He had
      to live completely above the sinful sphere, not just for a day, but for
      His entire time with us. He was to struggle as we do, to be tempted as
      we are, yet He had to remain immaculate. We might compare it to
      going through 33 years with your computer, writing articles, doing
      homework, answering letters, and never making a single mistake,
      never needing to use the delete key or the undo feature; or to going
      through a course in algebra or physics, and getting every problem
      right; or to playing the piano for 33 years without ever hitting a wrong
      note.
         That was Jesus’ lot. He came, not just to set an example in selfless
      living, but to die as the sinless One, and thereby bring salvation to the
      planet. Hence His total concentration, the utter intensity of His walk
      with God; nothing could be taken for granted, nothing left to chance.
      A single misstep, and the game was over.

       Imagine what it must have been to have never sinned, not even
       in thought, during His whole life. That is what righteousness is
       all about. Dwell on what you owe to Jesus, who offers you what
       you could never attain yourself.

     In His Life of Prayer                  (Luke 6:12)

        Jesus lived for prayer. His public ministry began with an extended
     period of special prayer and communion (as we saw yesterday), and
     the record indicates that He returned from the experience super-
     charged with living power (see Luke 4:14). It would have been un-
     natural for Him to go a single moment without lifting up His soul to
     God, without experiencing that living connection between Himself
     and Heaven. And what we find is that although His was a life of con-
     tinuous communion with His Father, before every major event or
     development He took time for special supplication.

How do the following passages demonstrate Jesus’ reliance upon God
     for guidance, direction, and strength during moments of high
     importance, stress, or danger? In each case, note the special event
     in question:

     Matt. 14:23 (compare vss. 24–33)
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Luke 6:12 (compare vss. 13–16)
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 17 (compare 18:1–3)
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Mark 1:35 seems to be describing not just one instance, but rather
     a pattern, when it speaks about Jesus rising “a long while before day-
     light” (NKJV) and going out to “a solitary place” (NKJV) for prayer.
     He began each day with God. But times of special need increased the
     tempo. Luke 6:12 informs us that Jesus spent the entire night in prayer
     on a mountainside immediately preceding the selection of the Twelve
     Apostles, apparently from among a larger group of followers (see
     Luke 6:13). Before His jaw-dropping walk on the lake, He had taken
     time out for a period of intense communication with His Father. And
     during the Passion Week, as He faced the Cross, Jesus offered an
     intense supplicatory prayer for His immediate disciples and for His
     people to the end of time.

      Take another look at Jesus’ great prayer in John 17. What ele-
      ments of a deeply personal walk with God do you find there?
      What events drive you to your knees? What has been your expe-
      rience with the power of prayer to sustain you? How might you
      improve your prayer life?

      Intensity for Mission                    (John 4:34)

         For American poet Robert Frost in “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy
      Evening,” the woods were “lovely, dark and deep/ But I have promises
      to keep/ And miles to go before I sleep.”
         Jesus lived with the constant awareness of the darkness in the “woods”
      around Him, always deep, but never lovely. Like the poet, He con-
      stantly was aware of having miles to go before He slept, so much to
      do in so little time. “I must work the works of Him who sent Me while
      it is day,” He said, “the night is coming when no one can work” (John
      9:4, NKJV). We see this mission intensity in His encounter with the
      woman of Samaria. Suddenly, in the presence of this needy soul, He for-
      gets all hunger and all thirst, totally consumed with the mission at hand.
         Meanwhile, the woman, entering into the excitement of the
      encounter, abandons her water jar and rushes to the village to spread
      the news of the most focused character she has ever met. The disciples
      return to find Jesus silent and pensive, praying for the success of this
      brand-new contact.

When the disciples told Jesus to eat, what did He answer them? (John
      4:32–34). How should we understand those words? What message
      can we take from them for ourselves?

What do the following passages say about the intensity of Jesus’ pas-
      sion for His mission? John 9:1–12, 35–39; 12:27–36.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus’ sentiments in that last passage are pregnant with meaning.
      They came following a request by certain visiting Greeks to meet Him
      (John 12:20–22), a request that opened up before Him the possibility
      of personally taking the message of the kingdom beyond His native
      Palestine to the far corners of the earth. But He knew that to do so
      would run counter to the most vital aspect of His total mission, to give
      His life as a ransom for the nations. Hence, He follows with those
      powerful words about a kernel of wheat falling into the ground (vs.
      24), symbolic not just of His own sacrifice but of the principle that all
      who follow Him must have a full commitment to the will of God,
      regardless of whatever the personal cost might be.

       What has been your own personal experience with what it costs
       to follow Jesus? Why is the cost cheap enough, no matter how
       expensive it turns out to be?

      Our Own Walk With God                           (1 John 2:6)

Read prayerfully the above text. What is the principle there for us to
      follow? Realizing, as we have in previous lessons, that we cannot
      (and should not) do everything that Christ did, how do we, never-
      theless, make this text real in our own lives? In what ways are we
      to walk as Jesus walked?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The idea of walking with God has its roots in hoary antiquity.
      Perhaps the first explicit biblical reference to the idea comes in
      Genesis 5:22, 24. Verse 24 says, “Enoch walked with God; then he
      was no more, because God took him away”(NIV). The Hebrew word
      for walked there appears in a form that implies a kind of continual,
      ongoing walk, something that happened all the time. Whatever his
      faults and struggles, Enoch kept a consistent walk with his Lord.
         We, as Christians, have the opportunity to do the same. However, it
      is so easy to let other things get in the way of that walk.

Wherever you live, whatever your culture, what are the things that
      so easily can hinder your walk with God? Too much leisure time?
      Too much distraction? Too much to do? Too much work in order
      to just survive? Once you identify these concerns, what practical
      steps can you take to try to prevent these things from hurting you
      spiritually?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Read what Jesus said in Matthew 13:22. What is He saying there
      that, in many ways, is the essence of what we are talking about today?
      Thus, it is clear that none of these things can really be a valid excuse
      for losing our way, because the Lord already has foreseen them. How
      crucial then that we, to the best of our God-given ability, make the
      daily choices, as Jesus did, to keep our walk with the Lord intense and
      ongoing. Why should we give the tempter anything at all to hold on to,
      and thus turn us away from Jesus?

    Further Study: “It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour
         each day in contemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it point
         by point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, especially the clos-
         ing ones. As we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice for us, our confi-
         dence in Him will be more constant, our love will be quickened, and
         we shall be more deeply imbued with His spirit.”—Ellen G. White,
         The Desire of Ages, p. 83.

            “In every possible way Satan sought to prevent Jesus from develop-
1
         ing a perfect childhood, a faultless manhood, a holy ministry, and an
         unblemished sacrifice. But he was defeated. He could not lead Jesus
         into sin. He could not discourage Him, or drive Him from the work He
         had come to this earth to do. From the desert to Calvary the storm of
         Satan’s wrath beat upon Him, but the more merciless it fell, the more
         firmly did the Son of God cling to the hand of His Father, and press
2
         on in the bloodstained path.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA
         Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1130.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 The grudging compliments paid to Jesus in Matthew 22:15, 16
          speak of Him as a person of integrity and truth, as unswayed by
          people’s office or power. What would people say about you?
          Could they offer you a similar kind of compliment? What about
3         on a larger level, the level of your local church? Is it as willing to
          help the lower stratum of society as it is to try to impress the
          higher-ups? What does your answer tell you about changes that
          need to be made, if any?

          ●
          2 As a class, go over what you wrote down in Thursday’s lesson
          regarding the things that can hamper your walk with the Lord.
          Compare notes with other class members. What did you list in
          common? What were the differences? Even more important, how
          can you work together to help each other get past these chal-
          lenges? What practical help can you give each other?

          ●3 In Matthew, Jesus frequently is mentioned as spending time
          on mountains and teaching on mountainsides. Finally, He is
          transfigured on a mountain (Matt. 17:1–9). This association with
          higher ground is meant, perhaps, to signify the daily closeness
          Jesus experienced with the higher realms of reality. What are the
          ways that we, as a church, can work together to reach, in a sense,
          the upper regions, even while intensely engaged in the valley
          below?

The Drunkard and the Tailor
by FULGÊNCIO CHALUFOIA
   I was a drunkard, and my drinking robbed me of everything. But a hum-
ble tailor helped me find my way back from the edge of hell.
   I live in Mozambique. I kept my drinking a secret until my wife and I
were married. I hoped to stop drinking, but I was powerless to stop. The
harder I tried to stop, the worse my drinking became. My wife threatened
to leave me if I did not get help.
   I went to a witch doctor, but he could not help me conquer my addiction.
Sometimes I was so drunk I beat my wife. Finally she left me.
   Desperate to stop drinking, I bought a Bible and began attending church.
One Sunday on my way to church, I met a tailor working in his roadside
shop. “Where are you going?” he asked.
   “To church,” I replied.
   “Why are you going today?” he asked. “Yesterday was God’s Sabbath
day.” Curious, I stopped to talk. The tailor told me that God has the answer
to my problems and offered to teach me from the Bible.
   The tailor could not read, but he knew the Bible. He sat down beside me,
opened a notebook filled with Bible references, and pointed to one. “Look
this one up,” he said. I found the Bible verses and read them. Then he
explained to me what they meant.
   We read many Bible texts, and the tailor explained each one to me.
Finally he told me to read Exodus 20. I read the Ten Commandments and
suddenly I realized that I was finding truths I had never known.
   I asked the tailor what church he belonged to, and he said he belonged to
the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He told me where the church was
located and invited me to visit. I thanked him and promised to be in church
the next Sabbath. I then continued on to the Protestant church to tell my
friends what I had just learned and to invite them to come to the Adventist
church on Sabbath.
   The next Sabbath I found the Adventist church and worshiped there. In
that church I found God’s peace and the power to overcome alcohol and
tobacco. It took some time, but with God’s help, I never smoked or drank
again.
   My drinking cost me everything—my job, my wife, my home. But God
has given me my life back. I am happy in Jesus, and I have invited my
friends to find Jesus as well. At least 15 have come to know God’s truth and
joined the Adventist church because I shared with them what God has done
for me.
   Your mission offerings help bring the gospel to thirsty souls everywhere.

           LESSON             9      *May 24–30


       The Tenderness of His
       Love


       SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 5:44–48; 19:13, 14;
       23:37; Luke 10:38–42; John 8:2–11; Acts 6:7.

Memory Text: “But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
       with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scat-
       tered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd” (Matthew 9:36).
                 atthew 9:35 tells how Jesus went through many areas of

       M         Palestine “preaching the good news of the kingdom and heal-
                 ing every disease and sickness” (NIV). In our cynical age, when
      people suspect that every effort to help them is tinged with some hidden
      agenda, the motive behind Jesus’ ministry comes as a breath of fresh air:
      genuine love, described as “compassion” (vs. 36). He was moved for the
      people; His heart went out to them. We see this same general concern in
      Mark 8:1–3, where Jesus is concerned about the people fainting on their
      way home. “They have . . . been with Me three days,” He reminds His
      disciples, “and have nothing to eat. If I send them home hungry, they will
      collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance”
      (vss. 2, 3, NIV).
         This is a remarkably tender concern that says a lot about Jesus. He
      knew His audience. He empathized with their needs. He felt their pain.
      Nor does He ask us to be exactly what He was or to do exactly what He
      did. Although He had gone through 40 days of fasting, He was con-
      cerned about the health and safety of those who had experienced just
      three days eating next to nothing (though perhaps not totally without
      food).
         This is the kind of loving compassion we want to trace in this week’s
      lessons, in the lives of individuals and that of the nation of Israel.

      For the Woman Caught in Adultery
      (John 8:2–11)

Review the story of the woman caught in adultery. Though Ellen G.
      White made it clear that the woman was set up (The Desire of Ages,
      p. 461), there was still no question of her guilt. Nevertheless, how
      did Jesus treat her? What can we learn from this story?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         “In His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live a
      better life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect
      righteousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of
      guilt, He seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for this
      erring woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of
      comfort and hope. The Sinless One pities the weakness of the sinner,
      and reaches to her a helping hand. While the hypocritical Pharisees
      denounce, Jesus bids her, ‘Go, and sin no more.’ ”—Ellen G. White,
      The Desire of Ages, p. 462.
         What tender compassion and love on Jesus’ part! He handled the sit-
      uation in such a way that forever afterward the woman’s accusers
      would be eager to leave her alone, since they never could be sure what
      she had read about their private lives on the pavement that morning.

In what ways was Jesus ministering even to the hypocrites who brought
      this woman to Him in order to try to snare Him?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        If you read the story carefully, you can see the compassion of Jesus
      even for those who were so evil in their intentions. If only their hearts
      would have been as open to the wooing of Christ as was that unfortu-
      nate woman’s.

       How would the typical Adventist congregation handle a situa-
       tion like this? How do we balance adherence to high moral stan-
       dards with compassion for those who fall?


                                                                           73

      For the Children                (Matt. 19:13, 14)

         Children have borne the brunt of suffering over the centuries.
      Helpless and dependent, they often have been caught in the crossfires
      of wars and conflicts, public riots and family feuds. It was children,
      infant males in particular, who bore the brunt of the first hideous
      “solution of the Jewish problem” under the ancient pharaohs of Egypt
      (Exod. 1:15, 16). And it was infant males who again were decimated
      in Herod’s slaughter of the innocents (Matt. 2:16), leading Matthew to
      recall another time of indiscriminate slaughter of children at the start
      of the Babylonian captivity (Matt. 2:17, 18; compare Jer. 31:15).
      Learning about Herod’s slaughter, perhaps on His mother’s knees, how
      keenly Jesus must have remembered it, knowing that these innocent
      little ones had died, in a sense, because of Him. (He had come to die
      for them; but before He was old enough even to conceive of His mis-
      sion, they had died because of Him.)

How do the following passages capture Jesus’ tender love and concern
      for infants and children? What messages are being given to us in
      these accounts that go beyond how we should treat children?
      (Matt. 18:2–6, 19:13–15).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Those children who sat on Jesus’ lap that day and to whom His hand
      had been outstretched in blessing, what might their future have been?
      What memories did they take from that day, those old enough to
      remember? Did some of them later accept Jesus as the Messiah? And
      how must they have felt to know that that loving Person who had put
      His hands on them in blessing was now in the highest heavens minis-
      tering in their behalf? What depth of assurance that must have brought
      them! Politicians kiss babies for their parents’ votes; but Jesus loved
      the children for their own sake. “Let the little children come to me,”
      He scolded His protective disciples, “and do not hinder them, for the
      kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (Matt. 19:14, NIV).

       What children, if any, are within your own sphere of influence?
       How do you respond to them? Think carefully about how you
       treat them. What steps can you take to make sure your influence
       is as positive as possible?

     For the Lazarus Family                         (John 11:5)

       We do not know a great deal about the Lazarus family of Bethany.
     The Gospels provide us with little about them. But it seems clear that they
     were three unmarried adult siblings keeping house together. Probably not
     your typical Jewish family, but that is where Jesus chose to go when-
     ever He came to town. John informs us that “Jesus loved Martha and
     her sister [Mary] and [their brother] Lazarus” (John 11:5, NIV).

Study the incident recorded in Luke 10:38–42. How do you see Jesus’
     handling of Martha? How, even here, do we see the loving com-
     passion of Jesus being manifest?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Martha’s request seems eminently justified. After all, the meal lay
     at the center of Eastern hospitality, and preparing it had to count for
     something. Perhaps too poor to afford servants, Martha in the kitchen
     needed help. In light of all this, Jesus’ response to her comes across as
     uncharacteristically uncaring.
        Perhaps the key to understanding it is to consider the wider dimen-
     sion of Jesus’ mission. For Jesus, nothing was ordinary, as His own
     parents discovered during the incident at the temple (Luke 2:48, 49).
     For Jesus, destiny hung upon every minute of His time with us, and in
     that context, kitchen work did not count, regardless of its importance.
        Still, we misunderstand Jesus if we think He was unsympathetic to
     Martha. Quite the opposite is the case. The Gospels do not provide us
     with video clips of the incidents they report. We cannot see the face of
     Jesus as He responded to Martha. We cannot hear the pathos in His
     voice. Using our imagination, however, and informed by what we know
     of Jesus elsewhere in the Gospels, we may picture Him rising from His
     place as He addresses Martha, affectionately calling her name twice.
     “Martha, Martha,” He says, making His way to the kitchen, Mary fol-
     lowing, “there’s something infinitely more important than entertaining,
     and Mary has found it” (Luke 10:41, 42, paraphrase).

      In what ways might you be in the position of Martha, so busy
      with the cares of this world that you forget what is really impor-
      tant? Most important, how can you tell if your priorities are not
      right?




                                                                            75

     For His Enemies                 (Matt. 5:44)

One of Jesus’ most famous sayings was found in Matthew 5:44–48.
     Review the verses. What is the essence of this important message
     to all who would follow Jesus?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In a real sense, one could say that Christ’s whole life and death were
     a manifestation of this principle, that of loving your enemies, that of
     doing good even to those who do not do you good.
        After the Fall of Adam and Eve, the whole world became, in a sense,
     enemy territory, a race of fallen and rebellious beings living in oppo-
     sition to God. What, though, did God do to this enemy planet? Did He
     send an army of angels down to sweep it away in its iniquity? No,
     instead, He sent Jesus, His Son, who came to save the world, not to
     condemn it.

What overt examples can you find in the Gospels that show the love
     of Jesus, even for His enemies? Which ones stand out the most in
     your mind?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        How about, for example, when He healed the ear of the servant
     when Peter cut it off (Luke 22:50, 51)? Or how about the time He
     revealed to Judas His foreknowledge of what Judas was going to do,
     giving the hardened disciple another opportunity to turn away from
     his sin (Matt. 26:25)?
        Of course, the greatest example has to be His prayer to the Father as
     He was being crucified: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what
     they do” (Luke 23:34). In many ways that is the ultimate example of
     love for those who do not deserve it; though they did not know what
     they were doing, they had no excuse. During His time here, Jesus gave
     ample opportunity, to both Jews and Romans, to know who He was, or
     at least to know enough to know that Jesus did not deserve what He was
     getting. Despite that, Jesus showed His compassion for them anyway.
      It is one thing to say you are supposed to love your enemies; it is
      another to know how to do it. What is the key to manifesting this
      attribute in your own life? How willing are you to make the
      changes needed in order to be able to love your enemies?

     For Israel         (Matt. 23:37)

       “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
     stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
     gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chick-
     ens under her wings, and ye would not!” (Matt. 23:37).

How is the character of Jesus revealed in the above text? What does
     it tell us about God’s love for His people? What does it tell us
     about the limits of what love can do? At the same time, before you
     start pointing fingers at anyone, ask yourself: How might those
     words be applied directly to me?

       If God shared the same emotions as humans, then the story of His
     relationship with Israel would amount to four thousand years of
     almost continuous disappointment and frustration. To be sure, there
     were high points, times when the nation brought God joy, but those
     times were rare and comparatively brief. Eventually, His phenomenal
     patience running out, God gave the nation a period of 490 years (Dan.
     9:24) that would reach to the coming of Messiah. Jesus was that
     Messiah; and what we see in Him, from start to finish, was an attitude
     of compassion, a love at once tough yet tender.

How does Matthew 23:25–35 exemplify the toughness of Jesus’ love?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        What we are watching here is the phenomenon of Divine patience
     nearing its end. Yet, however severely provoked, and however pro-
     tracted the provocation, tenderness breaks through the outer crust of
     Jesus’ toughness. He would not have spoken those harsh words were
     there not hope that some of these people eventually would see the
     error of their ways.

      Read Acts 6:7. Notice who was also “obedient to the faith.”
      Might some of them have been among those Jesus rebuked ear-
      lier? What is the message to us here about being quick to judge
      or condemn?

           “In the work of soul-winning, great tact and wisdom are needed.
         The Saviour never suppressed the truth, but He uttered it always in
         love. In His intercourse with others, He exercised the greatest tact, and
         He was always kind and thoughtful. He was never rude, never need-
         lessly spoke a severe word, never gave unnecessary pain to a sensitive
         soul. He did not censure human weakness. He fearlessly denounced
1        hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His voice as He
         uttered His scathing rebukes. He never made truth cruel, but ever
         manifested a deep tenderness for humanity. Every soul was precious
         in His sight. He bore Himself with divine dignity; yet He bowed with
         the tenderest compassion and regard to every member of the family of
         God. He saw in all, souls whom it was His mission to save.”—Ellen

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Dwell on this idea of loving your enemies. What does that
          mean, in a practical sense? How is this love to be manifested? Is
          there a time when it would be impossible to love your enemies? If
          so, what might that situation be?
3
          ●
          2 What is the situation of the children in your local church?
          How much attention is paid to their needs? What could you as a
          church be doing better in that regard?

          ●
          3 In what ways is it easy to confuse love with cheap grace? That
          is, what danger is there of allowing people to get away with things
          that they should not be doing, all because we want to reveal to
          them love? When is love sometimes best manifested by strict,
          moral accountability? How can we strike the right balance? If
          you are going to err, which side is it best to err on?

          ●
          4 What parallels can you find between the Jewish nation (dur-
          ing the time it was a theocracy) and the Adventist Church today?
          What lessons should we learn from their example? Are we learn-
          ing them?

Rosswick’s Church
by NOS TERRY
   Aniwa is a tiny island in the Vanuatu group in the South Pacific. The
island is home to about 500 people, but the Seventh-day Adventist Church
had no presence there. However, Adventists on nearby islands have been
praying to reach these people. Recently God answered those prayers.
   Rosswick lives on Aniwa Island. He was a leader of a cargo cult* for
years, and traveled to a neighboring island to attend cult activities.
Occasionally, when he could not return to his home because of rough seas,
he would stay with Adventists on the host island.
   He watched his Adventist hosts pray and noted how they took their reli-
gion seriously. And he went to church with them. He learned a few
Christian songs and enjoyed their hospitality until he could return home.
During his visits, he became convinced that Adventists were right in what
they believed, for they lived according to their actions.
   These small acts of kindness made a big impact on Rosswick. In a bold
move, he stepped down from leading the cargo cult and pronounced him-
self a Seventh-day Adventist Christian.
   He cleared a piece of land and built a small thatched grass house-church
in which to worship. Every Sabbath morning he took his little grand-
daughter to worship in the church. They sang the three Christian songs
they knew; he told the child that God loves them both and that Jesus is
coming back someday. Then they prayed. After their simple Sabbath wor-
ship service, Rosswick and his granddaughter returned to their house to
pray and rest. At sunset Rosswick and his granddaughter returned to the
grass church, sang the same three songs, prayed, and closed the Sabbath.
   I visited Rosswick shortly after I heard his story and was humbled to
realize how God used this man to light the flame of truth on a dark island.
   Today on Aniwa Island the door is fully open to the Adventist message.
Youth groups have visited in homes and introduced the Adventist message,
and today a Global Mission pioneer is fanning the flame of faith on this
tiny island. Because of Rosswick’s faithfulness and world mission offer-
ings, today many others on Aniwa Island are worshiping with Rosswick
and his granddaughter each Sabbath.

  * A cargo cult is a religion that rose out of European efforts to colonize
the islands of the South Pacific. Cargo cults focus on material goods that
followers hoped would come to them if they worshiped certain deities.

        LESSON            10 *May 31–June 6
      The Meaning of His
      Death


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 27:45, 46; Luke 2:25–
      35; 1 Cor. 15:3; 2 Cor. 5:18–21; Gal. 6:14; Heb. 2:17.

Memory Text: “ ‘For even the Son of Man did not come to be
      served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many’ ”
      (Mark 10:45, NIV).
              cover article in a major magazine reported on a discussion in

      A       a men’s Bible-study group. The topic? The reason for Jesus’
              death. Among the questions asked in the discussion were such
      things as, What if God’s plan were merely for Jesus to come and give
      us good teachings, such as loving our enemies? Or did He have to suf-
      fer and die, as well? If so, why? Why wouldn’t the teachings be
      enough? And even if He did die, what has that to do with us, today,
      many centuries later?
        Almost two thousand years after His death, the meaning of the
      Cross is still a subject that challenges Christians. In fact, even before
      His death, the prophets constantly tried “to find out the time and cir-
      cumstances” to which the Holy Spirit was calling their attention,
      “when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would
      follow” (1 Pet. 1:10, 11, NIV).
        So, this week we will seek to try to answer the important question
      of why Jesus died, what purpose was accomplished by His death, and
      what it means for us many centuries after the fact. Did Christ, as some
      assert, die merely to show us God’s love, and thus to change our feel-
      ings about God; or did Christ’s death, in fact, do something that
      changed how God relates to us? These are all topics worthy of our
      deepest interest.
*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, June 7.

      Born to Die
Read Luke 2:25–35. What is the meaning of this passage? What is the
      message to Mary? What is its message about Jesus?

        This story, told only by Luke, is powerful in its simplicity and pro-
      found in its implications. The devout Simeon, meeting at last the
      Messiah for whom he had been waiting, reveals the Infant’s future to
      His parents with cryptic terseness: “ ‘This child is destined to cause the
      falling and rising of many in Israel. . . . And a sword will pierce your
      own soul too’ ” (Luke 2:34, 35, NIV). The word for “sword” in the
      Greek signifies a huge, Goliath-type instrument, destined to pierce the
      heart of Mary, a prediction of the agony she would experience at the
      Cross. “These mysterious words of Simeon must have passed over
      Mary’s consciousness like a chilling and ominous portent of things to
      come.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 704.

What do the following passages tell us about the death of Jesus? Was
      it something that had to happen? (Matt. 16:21; 26:52–54; Mark
      10:45; Luke 18:31–33; John 3:14; Heb. 9:25–28).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         The consistent note here is that Jesus was born to die; His death was
      not an accident. It had to happen. Why did it have to? Well, that is not
      a matter that can be explained fully by rational processes, not because
      it is irrational, but because it is suprarational, above human reason. It
      falls in the realm of Divine revelation, part of that “mystery . . . kept
      hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints”
      (Col. 1:26, NIV). The Bible does not go into any long attempt to jus-
      tify it or to explain it, maybe because it is not something subject to
      human logic. We do not have other instances elsewhere by which to
      judge or compare it. Biblical atonement represents a solo occurrence
      in the history of the universe. And our task is to seek to understand
      what the Bible says about it and to apply what it means to our own
      lives.

       The fact that Jesus had to die in order to atone for our sin
       should tell us something about how serious sin really is. How
       seriously do you take the sin in your own life? What efforts are
       you making to overcome?



                                                                            81

      How It Happened                    (Matt. 27:45, 46)

        The Gospels devote an immense amount of space to the final week
      of Jesus’ life. In Matthew, it occupies one-third of the book. In Mark,
      more than one-third. And one-quarter of Luke and one-half of John
      are devoted to it. Clearly, the central focus is on Jesus’ passion, death,
      and resurrection. The Gospels are not biographies; they should be
      seen, rather, as theological summaries of the significance of Jesus’
      death.

Relive the awful events of the Passion by reviewing the following pas-
      sages: Matt. 27:27–31, 45–54; Mark 15:21–32; John 19:28–30. How
      do they make you feel? What is your overwhelming emotion, and
      why?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         None of us ever can claim to understand the full meaning of Jesus’
      death or the circumstances surrounding it. What seems clear, however,
      is that the role played by those physically present and active (whether
      at His trial or at the cross) was theologically incidental, so far as the
      participants’ racial or national identities were concerned. To malign
      Jews today, or modern Italians for that matter, for the involvement of
      some of their ancestors in the death of Jesus is theological stupidity,
      an attitude contrary to the very essence of biblical religion. The indi-
      vidual guilt of those involved in His death will be a matter between
      them and God. Instead of pointing fingers, maybe we should ask our-
      selves, What might we have done were we, ourselves, there? In one
      sense, actually, we were!

       Read Matthew 26:38. What was it that hung so heavy on the
       Savior during this crushing agony? How did He manage to sur-
       vive the ordeal? (See Luke 22:43.) “Having made the [final] deci-
       sion,” wrote Ellen G. White, “He fell dying to the ground [there
       in the garden]” ( The Desire of Ages, p. 693). This means that
       although He later was killed by Roman hands, the fatal blow
       had come much earlier, delivered by one giant, collective hand,
       ours. How does it make you feel, knowing that your own guilt
       caused the death of Jesus? More important, how should you
       respond to those feelings?

      What It Accomplished: Part 1
What is the central focus of these following passages? (1 Cor. 2:2, 15:3,
      Gal. 6:14).

        The writers of the New Testament used a variety of metaphors,
      images, and pictures in their attempts to express the saving work of
      God in Christ. In this lesson (and in Wednesday’s) we sample a few:

         1. The Concept of Sacrifice, Offering, Substitute—Ephesians 5:2:
      Christ “gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering [prosphoran] and
      sacrifice [thusian] to God” (NIV). Hebrews 9:26: He came “to do
      away with sin by the sacrifice [thusias] of himself ” (NIV). Hebrews
      10:14: By means of “one sacrifice [prosphora] he has made perfect
      forever those who are being made holy” (NIV).
         The idea in all these passages is that of vicarious death, death in our
      place, death as our Substitute. Vicarious suffering is suffering endured
      by one person in the stead of another. In 1 Corinthians 15:3, Paul says
      that “Christ died for our sins” (NIV); Romans 5:8 says that “while we
      were still sinners, Christ died for us” (NIV); and 1 Peter 2:24 says that
      Christ “bore our sins in his body on the tree” (NIV).
         2. The Concept of Ransom: The word ransom derives from the
      Greek term lutron; the basic idea conveyed is that of a payment for
      something delivered. In classical Greek the term often was used in
      connection with the redemption of slaves and war prisoners. The
      sacred writers borrowed the concept and pressed it into the service of
      a grander theme (Matthew 20:28; compare Mark 10:45): Jesus came
      “to give his life as a ransom [lutron] for many” (NIV). (Here “many,”
      incidentally, means “all.”)
         The family of words from which lutron comes puts the finger on the
      substitutionary nature of Christ’s sacrifice. He gave His life for us, the
      tense of the verb gave in the original Greek pointing to a specific
      event in time, to Jesus’ death on the cross. The basic concept here is
      that we were slaves to sin, condemned to eternal death, and unable to
      free ourselves; but Jesus came as our ransom, our lutron.

       Think about the things that you have done wrong, things you
       knew were wrong but did them anyway. What does it mean to
       you to know that Someone Else, Jesus, Someone innocent,
       received in Himself the punishment that would, otherwise, be
       yours for those things (and others) you did?




                                                                            83

     What It Accomplished: Part 2
       Yesterday, we discussed two of the many metaphors employed by
     the writers of the New Testament to express the accomplishments of
     Christ’s death. Here are two more:

        1. The Concept of Propitiation (or Expiation) (hilasterion): In
     regard to the mission of Christ, the word is found in Hebrews 2:17,
     where it speaks of Christ making “propitiation for the sins of the peo-
     ple” (NKJV). “Propitiation” has the sense of pacifying someone. The
     belief was that when a god was angry, the people should make a ges-
     ture of appeasement (hilasterion) in order to render the god hilaros
     (happy, joyous) once more. What students of the New Testament
     repeatedly have noted, however, is that its authors, though borrowing
     vocabulary from classical Greek and elsewhere, nevertheless fill that
     vocabulary with brand-new content and meaning.
        Accordingly, many Bible scholars agree that a better English trans-
     lation of the word is “expiation.” So understood, the idea is that by
     means of Jesus’ death, God “expiates,” “covers,” “erases” our sin. Any
     idea of human appeasement of God would be utterly foreign to the
     New Testament writers. Instead, they wanted to emphasize that the
     entire human race, threatened by the righteous wrath of God on
     account of sin, was rescued by Jesus’ death. Jesus became our hilas-
     terion, covering us from the wrath of God (see Heb. 9:5).

       2. The Concept of Reconciliation (katallage):

Read the following passages. What important emphasis do they share
     in common? (Rom. 5:10, 11; 2 Cor. 5:18–21; Eph. 2:16; Col.
     1:20–22).

       Sin is departure from God and God’s will. It puts us into a condition
     of estrangement from God, a state whose end result is death.
       Reconciliation speaks of the restoration of harmony between us and
     God, the recovery of wholeness. And here is a critical point to note: It
     was God who took the initiative (Rom. 5:8–11). “God was in Christ,
     reconciling the world unto himself ” (2 Cor. 5:19). Because of sin, the
     whole world stood condemned before a righteous God; because of the
     Cross, our standing before God changed, and thus all who come to
     Jesus by faith have the assurance of eternal life.

      Because of the Cross, you have the opportunity by faith to stand
      perfect, holy, and accepted by God. In what ways, on a daily
      basis, should your life reflect this new standing that we can have
      through Jesus?

     The Security of the Universe
       The cross has become the central symbol of Christianity. And in the
     theology of the New Testament, it says several things about the human
     condition, pointing beyond itself to its ultimate accomplishment.

Examine the following passages. What do they say about the human
     condition and about the need for Jesus’ death? (Rom. 3:10, 23;
     1 Cor. 2:2; 15:3; Gal. 6:14).
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Greeks and others in the ancient world thought of humanity as
     basically in good moral health. Given the right opportunity, our natu-
     ral, innate goodness will blossom and flourish, they believed. The atti-
     tude represented a significant challenge for Christianity, with its con-
     cept of universal human depravity and our desperate need for outside
     intervention. That is why Paul could say that “the message of the cross
     is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being
     saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18, NIV). That quiet power, he
     said, will eventually conquer, and “every knee [in the universe] should
     bow, . . . confess[ing] that Jesus Christ is Lord” (Phil. 2:10, 11, NIV).
        Yet, however central to our salvation, the Cross has an importance
     that goes beyond us.
        “The significance of the death of Christ will be seen by saints and
     angels. Fallen men could not have a home in the paradise of God with-
     out the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. . . . The angels
     ascribe honor and glory to Christ, for even they are not secure except
     by looking to the sufferings of the Son of God. It is through the effi-
     cacy of the cross that the angels of heaven are guarded from apostasy.
     Without the cross they would be no more secure against evil than were
     the angels before the fall of Satan. Angelic perfection failed in heaven.
     Human perfection failed in Eden, the paradise of bliss. All who wish
     for security in earth or heaven must look to the Lamb of God. The plan
     of salvation, making manifest the justice and love of God, provides an
     eternal safeguard against defection in unfallen worlds, as well as
     among those who shall be redeemed by the blood of the Lamb.”—Ellen
     G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1132.

      Even the angels in heaven are guarded from apostasy because of
      the Cross! What an incredible thought! If the Cross means so
      much to unfallen beings, those whose lives were not even
      redeemed by it, how much more so should the Cross be the cen-
      tral focus for us, we who have been redeemed through it?

                                                                          85

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Calvary,” pp. 744–757; “It
         Is Finished,” pp. 758–764, in The Desire of Ages.

            “Well, then, might the angels rejoice as they looked upon the
         Saviour’s cross; for though they did not then understand all, they knew
         that the destruction of sin and Satan was forever made certain, that the
         redemption of man was assured, and that the universe was made eter-
1
         nally secure. Christ Himself fully comprehended the results of the sac-
         rifice made upon Calvary. To all these He looked forward when upon
         the cross He cried out, ‘It is finished.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
         of Ages, p. 764.
            “The death of Christ upon the cross made sure the destruction of
         him who has the power of death, who was the originator of sin. When
2
         Satan is destroyed, there will be none to tempt to evil; the atonement
         will never need to be repeated; and there will be no danger of another
         rebellion in the universe of God.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The
         SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1132.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Some limit the Cross to a mere demonstration of God’s love,
          devoid of any legal or atoning efficacy. That is, Christ died
3
          merely to show us the Father’s love; there was no change in our
          legal standing before the Father. Hence, the only purpose of the
          Cross was to bring a change in us and in our attitude toward
          God. Why is such a position a radically weak and ultimately

          2 Dwell more on this idea of the universe being made secure by

          the Cross?

          ●3 The life and death of Jesus present us with mystery from start
          to finish. Though there are aspects that we can understand, other
          things remain a mystery. How can you learn to trust the Lord

          keeping your faith strong?

Kobamo’s Urgent Message
   Kobamo is the eldest son of a poor cattle herder in southern Ethiopia.
His parents wanted a better life for him, so they sent him to school. There
Kobamo met some Adventist children. Kobamo knew almost nothing about
God, but he listened as his classmates shared their faith with him. Over
time he realized that God loves even him, a poor farm boy.
   He could not attend the Adventist church with them, for he had many
chores to do on Saturday. However, sometimes he attended special after-
noon programs when his work was done. In time Kobamo accepted Jesus
as his Savior.
   Kobamo’s grandfather was a witch doctor, an important and feared man.
One day Kobamo felt an urge to visit his grandfather, who lived an hour’s
walk away. In Kobamo’s culture children do not associate with their elders,
even their grandparents. So Kobamo’s parents were surprised when he
asked to visit his grandfather. Nevertheless, they allowed him to go.
   Kobamo finished his chores and set out for his grandparents’ home. The
sun was low in the sky when Kobamo reached their home. His grand-
parents were surprised to see Kobamo, and they invited him to come in and
sit down. But Kobamo stood up saying, “I will not sit down until I have told
you what I have come to say. God sent me to tell you to believe in Him.”
   Kobamo did not have a Bible, and he did not know many Bible texts to
quote to his grandfather. He just knew that his grandfather needed to
believe in God. So Kobamo, in his childish way, simply urged his grand-
parents to believe in God.
   Kobamo’s grandparents were surprised that this young boy would talk to
them in this way. For four hours Kobamo told his grandparents what he
knew about God and asked them to believe.
   Finally Kobamo’s grandfather told the boy that he believed that God had
sent Kobamo to share this message. The couple knew nothing about God
except what Kobamo had told them, but because their young grandson
spoke so bravely to them, this influential couple accepted Jesus as their
Savior and faithfully attended church until their deaths.
   Kobamo’s parents joined another Protestant church, but Kobamo insisted
on attending the Adventist Church. He obeyed his parents in everything,
but he refused to work on God’s holy day. His parents allowed Kobamo to
follow his faith, for they had seen God working in his life.
   Our mission offerings help spread the gospel in Ethiopia, where half the
population follows non-Christian religions. Thank you for sharing Christ
through your mission offerings.

KOBAMO continues to share his faith in southern Ethiopia.

      The Power of His
      Resurrection


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 27:62–66, Luke
      24:36–39, Acts 3:14–16, 1 Corinthians 15, Phil. 3:7–10.

Memory Text: “ ‘I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold
      I am alive for ever and ever!’ ” (Revelation 1:18, NIV).

              s Easter approached, a teacher sent her students out into nature

      A       around the school. She gave each a little box with the follow-
              ing assignment: Bring back something in the box that is a sym-
      bol of life. When the children returned, each box was opened, one at a
      time. The first box had a butterfly, which flew away as she opened the
      container. Another had leaves. Another twigs. But then one box she
      opened was empty.
        “How stupid!” one student exclaimed. “Somebody didn’t do the
      assignment!”
        At that point, Philip, a boy with Down’s syndrome, spoke up:
      “That’s my box.”
        “Well, Philip,” the same boy continued, undeterred, “you messed up
      the assignment!”
        “No,” replied Philip, confidently. “The tomb was empty!”
        On that day Philip became a respected member of the group. He
      died not long afterward, and at his funeral all the members of the class
      brought empty boxes to the service, in honor of their fallen classmate.
        Yes indeed, the tomb was empty! And in that empty tomb we find
      the great hope of all Christians everywhere. This week we look at that
      hope, which is found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

     The Story of the Resurrection: Part 1
     (Matt. 27:62–66)

       Several events may be described as pivotal to Christianity, among
     them the Incarnation, the Cross, and the Second Coming. But in a
     sense, the Resurrection trumps them all, even the Cross that we
     extolled in last week’s lesson. For without the Resurrection, nothing
     else matters. Indeed, when we talk about the death of Jesus, we logi-
     cally include the Resurrection, unstated. It is the central doctrine of
     the Christian faith.
       Of all the world religions, Judaism and Christianity are the only two
     that espouse the concept of a resurrection, as such; and only
     Christianity makes it central. Only Christianity has been founded on
     the belief that its central Figure actually was raised from the dead. All
     four Gospels cover the extraordinary event, and they tell the story with
     a straightforwardness that makes it utterly credible.

What contribution does each of the following passages make to the
     credibility of the Resurrection story to follow?

     Matt. 27:50–53

     Matt. 27:62–66

       The occurrences listed here are all public. Given the date of the
     Gospel of Matthew (believed to be written before A.D. 70), eyewit-
     nesses still would have been alive either to confirm or refute these
     reports. Nor would the religious establishment have had any interest
     in letting such claims and assertions go unchallenged if false: The
     rending of the temple curtain “from the top”! (certainly some of those
     who had ministered in the complex that day would have seen some-
     thing); the earthquake would have been public and universal for the
     immediate area; the resurrection of dead people and their appearance
     to many in the city (what possible reason could the writer have for
     manufacturing a detail like that!); the witness of the Roman centurion
     and his fellow soldiers; the sealing of the tomb; the posting of a spe-
     cial guard; the list goes on. These are concrete events, related with no
     special pleading or defensiveness whatsoever.

      The Story of the Resurrection: Part 2
      (Luke 24:36–39)

        In yesterday’s lesson, we began listing a group of passages in the
      Gospels that describe events surrounding the death of Jesus, events
      that in their straightforward and unembellished naturalness commend
      the credibility of the Resurrection story. Following are a few more
      passages in the same vein.

What essential message is found in these verses? What key point do all
      of them have in common? (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24:10–44).

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Although the above list does not carry any reference from John, all
      four Gospels cover the Resurrection in considerable detail.

Why do you think that is so? What is so important about the Resur-
      rection to our faith?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        “The historic faith of the Church has agreed with St. Paul: ‘If Christ
      has not been raised, your faith is futile’ (1 Cor. 15:17). All other
      Christian doctrines are dependent upon the proclamation of the resur-
      rection: the significance of Christmas lies in the fact that the child
      who was born is the one whom God raised from the dead; Good
      Friday is only the anniversary of one more martyrdom, unless he who
      died is the one who rose again; the institution of the Lord’s Supper in
      the Church would have been unthinkable, had not the Lord been
      known to the faithful in the breaking of bread.”—Alan Richardson,
      ed., “Resurrection of Christ,” A Dictionary of Christian Theology
      (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1969), p. 290.

       In the texts for today, we see the power of Jesus’ resurrection,
       both physically and spiritually. He broke the shackles of the
       tomb; the Roman seals gave way; the grave burst open. And He
       declares today, “ ‘I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold
       I am alive for ever and ever!’ ” (Rev. 1:18, NIV). If you were
       asked to say in ten words or fewer what the Resurrection means
       to you, what might those words be?

     It Empowered a Movement                             (Acts 3:14–16)

        How could such an outlandish belief as the resurrection of a dead
     prophet spread through a pagan empire like that of Rome if it had no
     credence? Why would a bunch of fishermen and tax collectors,
     against all odds, invent such a story? And if they did invent it, how did
     they come to believe it so strongly themselves that they were prepared
     not only to forsake family and friends to defend it, but to give their
     lives for the sake of the One they proclaimed as the risen Christ?
        The arrest, trial, and execution of their Master had left these fol-
     lowers broken, traumatized, defeated. Disillusioned, the erstwhile
     inner circle began falling back upon old patterns, moving back into
     their accustomed grooves (and they themselves tell the story). We hear
     only about going fishing (the former livelihood of most of them); but
     there also must have been a lot of brooding by the likes of nonfisher-
     men, such as Matthew and Simon the Zealot, wondering where to go
     from there, what to do next.
        Flash ahead weeks later, to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at
     Pentecost (Acts 2). As Peter delivered his impromptu Pentecostal ser-
     mon, it was his reference to Jesus as a living person, risen and exalted
     before the heavenly Father, the astonishing declaration that Jesus was
     alive, that hearers homed in on. “ ‘Brothers, what shall we do?’ ” they
     responded (Acts 2:37, NIV).
        Nor was the emphasis on the Resurrection a fad for these early
     believers, an ephemeral novelty to be abandoned when something bet-
     ter came along. Quite to the contrary, the Resurrection constituted the
     central element of apostolic preaching, with Peter and the other apos-
     tles repeatedly returning to it in their discourses.

Read Acts 3:11–16, 4:8–12, 7:54–56, 17:29–31. What theme do they
     constantly refer to? And why?

       “For the earliest Christian preaching it is the Resurrection that des-
     ignates Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. . . . This is the point at
     which his reign as Messiah begins, when . . . he enters upon and inau-
     gurates the age of GLORY.”—Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,
     vol. R–Z, p. 44.

      Writing to the Philippians, Paul spoke of wanting to “know
      Christ and the power of his resurrection” (Phil. 3:10, NIV).
      What do you think that means? How can we today experience
      the power of the Resurrection in our lives? (See, for example,
      John 3:3, Rom. 6:1–12.)




                                                                          91

     Provided Authority for Witnessing
     (Phil. 3:7–10)

        We see the power of the Resurrection in the ministry of the apostles.
     Peter’s words to the cripple are anchored solid in a resurrected Savior:
     “ ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk’ ” (Acts 3:6, NIV).
     Then as the people go wild with astonishment and wonder over the
     miracle, Peter reminds them of the trial and death of Jesus (vss. 13,
     14) and then begins to move toward the good news, his goal from the
     start: “ ‘You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the
     dead’ ” (vs. 15, NIV). And, says Peter, it is through the power released
     by His resurrection that the crippled man was made to walk. “ ‘By faith
     in the name of Jesus, this man . . . was made strong. It is Jesus’ name
     and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete
     healing’ ” (vs. 16, NIV).
        The spectacular miracle notwithstanding, Peter is arrested and
     called upon to answer for these unusual developments: “ ‘By what
     power or what name did you do this?’ ” (Acts 4:7, NIV). With such an
     invitation, Peter falls back on what fast was becoming his favorite
     theme, the resurrection of Jesus: “ ‘It is by the name of Jesus Christ
     of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead,
     that this man stands before you healed’ ” (vs. 10, NIV).
        So, on three separate occasions now, Peter has zeroed in like a laser
     beam upon the resurrection of Jesus as the source of his power for wit-
     nessing. In fact, the very preaching of Christ implied His resurrection
     (Acts 5:40–42).
        “The conviction that Jesus continued to live transformed a dozen or
     so disconsolate followers of a slain and discredited leader into one of
     the most dynamic groups in human history. We read that tongues of
     fire descended upon them. People who were not speakers became elo-
     quent. They exploded across the Greco-Roman world, preaching what
     has come to be called the Gospel but is literally the good news.
     Starting in an upper room in Jerusalem, they spread their message
     with such fervor that in their own generation it took root in every
     major city of the region.”—Huston Smith, The Illustrated World’s
     Religions (New York: HarperCollins, 1986), p. 215.

      Read 1 Corinthians 15, Paul’s great treatise on the Resurrection.
      How central is this truth to the Christian faith? In other words,
      how much hangs on it? Do you have loved ones who have passed
      away? What particular sections of Paul’s treatise bring you the
      greatest comfort?

     Guarantees Our Own Resurrection
     (1 Cor. 15:20)

       No matter how clear the New Testament is on the literal bodily res-
     urrection of Jesus, some liberal theologians, trapped in a purely sci-
     entific and rationalist worldview, argue against the Resurrection being
     real. Instead, they say that the Resurrection should be seen as a myth,
     a metaphor of a new resurrected life we can have here and now if and
     when we accept, as a community, the moral teaching of Jesus.
       However nice that might sound, it is a view based on human think-
     ing and not on the clear teaching of God’s Word, which is exceedingly
     clear and unequivocal in the literalness of Christ’s resurrection.
       For us, there is no danger accepting the Resurrection as a metaphor,
     not if we take the Word of God for what it says; and it is explicit about
     the literal bodily resurrection of Jesus. And once we are settled in our
     acceptance of the Resurrection, then we can for ourselves garner the
     hope it offers us in the face of death. Regardless of what happens to
     us in this life, we have the hope that, as Jesus rose from the dead, so
     will we. The promise of the Resurrection helps us to keep everything
     in its proper perspective.

Read the following passages. What hope do they hold out for our own
     resurrection?

     John 5:25–29
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 11:23–26
     ____________________________________________________________________

     1 Cor. 15:51–58
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rev. 1:18
     ____________________________________________________________________

        The resurrection of Jesus established three certainties: (1) Our des-
     tiny is secure in Jesus (1 Pet. 1:3–5); (2) death is a vanquished foe
     (1 Cor. 15:20–22); and (3) power is available to share this fantastic
     news with others (John 14:12, Acts 1:8).

      How should the hope and promise of our resurrection from the
      dead help us to keep our life here, and the things that happen in
      it, in the proper perspective? Imagine what life would be like if
      you did not have this hope.




                                                                          93

    Further Study: “Over the rent sepulcher of Joseph, Christ had pro-
         claimed in triumph, ‘I am the resurrection, and the life.’ These words
         could be spoken only by the Deity. All created beings live by the will
         and power of God. They are dependent recipients of the life of God.
         From the highest seraph to the humblest animate being, all are replen-
         ished from the Source of life. Only He who is one with God could say,
         I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. In
         His divinity, Christ possessed the power to break the bonds of
1
         death.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 785.

           “During His ministry, Jesus had raised the dead to life. He had
         raised the son of the widow of Nain, and the ruler’s daughter and
         Lazarus. But these were not clothed with immortality. After they were
         raised, they were still subject to death. But those who came forth from
2
         the grave at Christ’s resurrection were raised to everlasting life. They
         ascended with Him as trophies of His victory over death and the
         grave. These, said Christ, are no longer the captives of Satan; I have
         redeemed them. I have brought them from the grave as the first fruits
         of My power, to be with Me where I am, nevermore to see death or
         experience sorrow.”—p. 786.

    Discussion Questions:

          ●
          1 Take another look at 1 Corinthians 15, the flagship theologi-
          cal defense of the Resurrection in the New Testament. Follow
          Paul’s arguments in favor of this basic Christian teaching. Why
          do these texts make little sense if you believe that the righteous
          dead go immediately to heaven at death? How is our under-
          standing of the state of the dead vindicated by these texts? What
          makes the promise of the Resurrection so crucial to us as
          Seventh-day Adventists with our view of the state of the dead?

          ●2 Think about this question, and then bring your answer to
          class: How differently would you live if you believed that at death
          everything ended forever?

          ●
          3 Go over all the textual evidence you can find that helps affirm
          the resurrection of Jesus. Bring it to class, and together review the
          evidence. How compelling is it? How can you put this material
          together in a way that could be used as a powerful witnessing
          tool?

Sanjay’s Miracles: Part 1
  Sanjay was a musician and played in a band in India. He was a Christian
and did not join his fellow musicians when they went drinking or dancing.
But something was missing from his life. Sanjay felt bad when his fellow
musicians made fun of his Christian faith.
  One day he prayed that God would show His power to his friends so they
would know that He was the only true God. That evening the band loaded
their equipment into a small bus to drive across a mountain pass to their
next appointment. They passed the summit and began their descent when
the driver suddenly realized that he had no brakes. The bus veered off the
road and rolled into the valley far below. No one was killed, but everyone
was injured except Sanjay.
  Some of the musicians confessed that Sanjay’s God had saved him from
harm and began calling him “God’s man.”
  Sanjay met an Adventist pastor who urged him to surrender his life
totally to God. Sanjay agreed, but even though he felt God wanted him to
use his talents to bring people to Christ, still he hesitated to give up the
band. Then something happened that changed the course of his life.
  One day he climbed an old coconut tree to pick fresh coconuts. He
grasped a palm frond to balance himself while he reached for a coconut.
However, the palm frond broke loose, throwing Sanjay off balance. He fell
from the tall tree into a field of cut sugar cane. The stalks that remained in
the field had been cut at an angle and were as sharp as needles. “Lord, save
me!” Sanjay cried as he fell.
  His brother heard Sanjay’s cry and watched in horror as his brother fell
into the sharp stalks. He raced to his side, expecting to find his brother
dead, but Sanjay was unhurt. He picked himself up and dusted himself off.
Sanjay realized that God had saved his life a second time. “OK, Lord,” he
said, “I’m Yours. Give me something to do for You.”
  He asked the Adventist pastor for work, and the pastor invited him to
come and train to become a lay evangelist. Sanjay agreed. But how could
he lead others to Christ? He had no experience with any work but music.

      The Efficacy of His Priestly
      Ministry


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 25:8; Matt. 27:50,
      51; Acts 7:54–56; Heb. 6:19, 20; 7:23–28; 8:1, 2; 9.

Memory Text: “Now this is the main point of the things we are
      saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand
      of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens” (Hebrews 8:1, NKJV).

      “         ot long after the Creation . . . our first parents fell into sin. . . .

          N     In the wake of this terrible crisis, God’s first concern was for
                human restoration and the eternal security of the universe.
      The death of a member of the Godhead—a contingency already deter-
      mined in the foreknowledge and council of God (see Rev. 13:8)—was
      the only means to that end.
         “To secure human participation and cooperation in this supreme
      endeavor, God moved quickly to inform our first parents of the plan.
      At the same time, He put in place a teaching device to keep it perpet-
      ually before their attention and that of succeeding generations.”—Roy
      Adams, The Sanctuary (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald®
      Publishing Association, 1993), pp. 17, 18. That teaching device, of
      course, was the sanctuary service.
         The sanctuary became the center of Hebrew worship, and through
      its activities and ceremonies it pointed suppliants to the cosmic reali-
      ties of human salvation in a coming Messiah (see Hebrews 9) and to
      the ministry of Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary. This week we will
      look at that heavenly sanctuary and Christ’s ministry there.

Pointers From the Ancient Tabernacle
(Exod. 25:9, 40)

   Moses was told to build the tabernacle according to the pattern God
had shown him on Mount Sinai (Exod. 25:9, 40). And while common
sense would lead us away from the conclusion that every board and
nail of the tabernacle (and later the temple) had theological signifi-
cance, we should, nevertheless, take with all seriousness the teaching
function of the Old Testament sanctuary system. Even so, we are not
given a great deal of information on the meaning of the symbolisms;
in fact, in most cases, none at all. Yet piecing together the little we find
in the Old Testament with what we have in the New Testament, we are
able to arrive at a fairly good understanding of the overall meaning of
certain fundamental aspects of the ancient-sanctuary system and serv-
ice that point beyond themselves to a greater reality. Consider the
following:

1. The morning and evening sacrifice (Exod. 29:38–42, Num. 28:1–6)
2. The shewbread and candlesticks (Exod. 25:23, 30, 31, 37)
3. The Day of Atonement ceremonies (Leviticus 16, Heb. 9:1–12)
4. The high-priestly garments (Exod. 28:6–21)

   The morning and evening sacrifices symbolized “the daily conse-
cration of the nation to Jehovah, and their constant dependence upon
the atoning blood of Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 352. Many allusions to bread in the New Testament seem
to suggest that the bread in the tabernacle/sanctuary pointed forward
to Christ (see, for example, Matt. 26:26, John 6:48–51). “Both the
manna and the shewbread pointed to Christ, the living Bread, who is
ever in the presence of God for us.”—Page 354. Similarly, the candle-
sticks seem to point to Him who said, “I am the light of the world”
(John 8:12). “Those semiprecious gems of the [high priest’s] breast-
plate . . . bore the names of the tribes of Israel, suggesting, says Ellen
G. White . . . that as Christ our Great High Priest pleads His blood
before the Father, He bears upon His heart the name of every repen-
tant, believing soul.”—Roy Adams, The Sanctuary, p. 38. Compare it
to Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 351.

 Review, to the best of your understanding, the earthly sanctuary
 service. How does it help you understand the plan of salvation?

     All Pointers Led to Him
Read John 1:29. What is the significance of John calling Jesus the
     “Lamb of God”?

        The wilderness tabernacle stood at the center of Israelite worship
     for hundreds of years. And as long as Israel remained faithful to God,
     they looked upon this sacred edifice as the place of salvation, the
     place of atonement between God and His people. The supernatural
     manifestations that accompanied the dedication of the structure (see
     Exod. 40:34, 35) had riveted such impressions deep into the psyche of
     those who witnessed them.
        The signal demonstration of God’s attendance at the temple’s dedi-
     cation gave no hint, however, of the structure’s turbulent future.
     Completely destroyed by the Babylonian army, it later was rebuilt,
     though not up to the standard of its previous splendor. This, however,
     was the temple Jesus knew, the one that felt His footsteps. And as
     Jesus died upon a cross outside Jerusalem one Friday afternoon two
     thousand years ago, it was in the inner sanctum of this very temple
     that the curtain mysteriously ripped in two, from top to bottom (Matt.
     27:51).
        “It was the hour of the evening sacrifice. The lamb representing
     Christ had been brought to be slain.” But the earth shakes, and “with
     a rending noise the inner veil of the temple is torn from top to bottom
     by an unseen hand, throwing open to the gaze of the multitude a place
     once filled with the presence of God.” In one fell swoop, this place
     where “the Shekinah had dwelt,” and where “God had manifested His
     glory above the mercy seat,” is now open to public view! “The most
     holy place of the earthly sanctuary is no longer sacred.” Then in dra-
     matic fashion, she brings the message home: “All is terror and confu-
     sion. The priest is about to slay the victim; but the knife drops from
     his nerveless hand, and the lamb escapes. Type has met antitype in the
     death of God’s Son. The great sacrifice has been made. . . . It was as
     if a living voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to
     all sacrifices and offerings for sin. The Son of God is come according
     to His word.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 756, 757.

      Many Christians today are looking toward the rebuilding of the
      temple in Jerusalem as a sign of the end. Even if such a temple
      were rebuilt, and sacrifices were resumed, why would those sac-
      rifices have no efficacy in dealing with the sin problem?

     Our High Priest                (Heb. 7:25)

       The apostle had been saying a host of things in the first chapters of
     Hebrews about angels and their status, about Moses and his wilder-
     ness experience, about Joshua and the land of Canaan, about the
     prophets and Abraham and Melchizedek. But as he reaches chapter 8,
     verse 1, he abruptly calls us back to focus:

Read Hebrews 8:1, 2. What is the main point of all that the apostle
     was saying up to these verses?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Within the physical layout of the ancient Israelite camp, the ordinary
     Israelite worshiper stood several barriers removed from the sanctuary’s
     innermost sanctum. To gain physical access, it would have been neces-
     sary to get by the buffer of priests and Levites and no-go areas sur-
     rounding the sacred enclosure. But now, says the author of Hebrews,
     Christ, our heavenly Priest-Mediator, has opened a door of unlimited
     access to the heavenly sanctuary itself, the throne room of the living
     God. “Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence,” says
     the sacred writer, “so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help
     us in our time of need” (Heb. 4:16, NIV). Jesus is our Intercessor in
     heaven.
        Though we do not know the exact form of Jesus’ intercession for us,
     Scripture offers examples of the idea, albeit from a human standpoint.
     Two of these occurred in the life of Moses, in connection with the rebel-
     lion at Kadesh (Num. 14:10–20), and in connection with the golden calf
     affair (Exod. 32:9–14, 30–32). These are powerful passages. “But now,”
     Moses pled with God in that last reference, “please forgive their sin—
     but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written” (vs. 32, NIV).
     We also witness such forms of priestly intercession in Daniel (Daniel 9)
     and in Jesus’ great prayer before His passion (John 17).

      Examine the following key passages from Hebrews as examples
      of what our heavenly High Priest does for us: Heb. 2:18, 7:25,
      8:3–10, 9:11–14, 10:11–17. Most important, ask yourself, How
      can I personally benefit in my walk with the Lord by knowing
      that Jesus is doing these things for me? How can I apply these
      promises in my life?

      The Difference It Makes: Part 1
Read Hebrews 4:16. What promise is there for us? What are we
      admonished to do? What hopes does this offer us? How can you
      apply what is here to your own life?

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Do those who know Jesus as Savior and High Priest have a spiritual
      advantage over others who know Him only as Savior? We will deal
      with the question in two lessons, but perhaps we can begin by noting
      the contribution of Hebrews 9 to the issue, in general.
         There are, of course, several ways to read the chapter. One is to take
      a strictly exegetical and linguistic approach to it, defining the mean-
      ing of words and phrases, and squeezing out the significance of the
      verses from a purely academic point of view. But another way, equally
      valid, essentially bypasses all that. Without ignoring the results of the
      first approach, it simply reads the chapter and observes what it says.
      When we do that, here is what we find, as it relates to the basic ques-
      tion before us:
         1. What happened under the first covenant (the Old Testament sanc-
      tuary services) was provisional only. Fundamentally inadequate to
      bring about internal change, the offerings and ceremonies pointed
      beyond themselves to something bigger.
         2. That bigger something now has happened. Christ has come. He is
      the real High Priest (Heb. 9:11). His entrance into the heavenly sanc-
      tuary was not through “the blood of goats and calves; but . . . once for
      all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption” (vs. 12,
      NIV).
         3. The offerings under the old system achieved external results (vs.
      13) but could not effect internal change. But the blood of Christ
      reaches to our inner being, cleansing “our consciences from acts that
      lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!” (vs. 14, NIV).
         4. Christ shed His blood once, on our behalf; and now He appears
      for us in the presence of God as our High Priest (vs. 24–28).

       Read over Hebrews 9. What is the essential message it is giving
       us? What promises are found in there that you especially find
       encouraging for yourself?

     The Difference It Makes: Part 2
       The knowledge and acceptance of Jesus as our High Priest should
     make us kind and generous and patient, the same traits He has mani-
     fested toward us. It should make us merciful and gracious, in the same
     way He has shown mercy and grace toward us. And it should make us
     morally upright and everlastingly grateful for the profound sacrifice
     made on our behalf. But any Adventist who has interacted with
     Christians of other persuasions would readily admit that they have
     found them equally gracious and merciful and patient and generous
     and kind and morally upright. So, then, what real difference does “our
     message of the sanctuary” make?
       It probably has something to do with loyalty and faithfulness. When
     the author of Hebrews wanted to reestablish the recipients of his book
     in the faith, he turned to the sanctuary theme.

Read Hebrews 10:19–25. What is the practical message given to us
     here, a message that should influence how we live our lives and
     how we relate to others?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The book of Hebrews invites us to approach “the throne of grace”
     (Heb. 4:16). The implications here are multifaceted, but one of them
     gets to the question before us just now. The way has been made for us,
     through Jesus, to approach God in the heavenly sanctuary. And to fol-
     low Jesus by faith into the sanctuary is not only to have one’s soul
     cleansed by His marvelous grace but also to experience a new appre-
     ciation for His immutable law (see Heb. 8:10). This transaction,
     utterly significant in the context of what Adventists call “the great
     controversy between good and evil,” defines the difference the sanc-
     tuary teaching makes for us. By faith we enter with full assurance into
     that sacred place where Jesus ministers. And there, against all pos-
     sible odds, we cling to the One whose indelible promise is symbolized
     by the ark of the covenant, the throne of the living God Himself,
     founded on justice and mercy. Thus anchored, we do not drift—not
     into a view of the law that leads to the abandonment of God’s holy
     Sabbath, and not into evolutionary conceptions of origins that seek to
     dethrone the living God from His own universe. The doctrine of the
     sanctuary thus becomes a protection for us against rebellion and
     secures for God a faithful remnant in a revolted world.



                                                                       101

    Further study: Read Ellen G. White, “In the Holy of Holies,”
          pp. 423–426, in The Great Controversy; “The Tabernacle and Its
          Services,” pp. 350–358, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

             “The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mys-
          tery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete sys-
          tem of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God’s hand had
          directed the great Advent Movement, and revealing present duty as it
          brought to light the position and work of His people”—Ellen G.
          White, The Great Controversy, p. 423.
1            “I . . . see the heavenly sanctuary as the dwelling place of God, the
          seat of His government, the nerve center of the universe. As such, it has
          always existed. But with the fall of humanity it assumed an added func-
          tion, namely, the solution of the cosmic rebellion and the security of the
          universe. It is in this sense that we picture it when we think of the
          ancient sacrificial system. We see it through a glass colored by the min-
2         istry for the eradication of sin.”—Roy Adams, The Sanctuary, p. 71.
             “I do not visualize an empty heavenly sanctuary. The throne of God,
          in whatever form, is there, surrounded by multitudes of angels. Best
          of all—from our standpoint, at least—our All-sufficient High Priest,
          Jesus Christ Himself, is there! He fills it full! He stands before the
          throne of God for us! And that’s enough for me!”—Page 71.

    Discussion Questions:
3          ●
           1 How does our understanding of the pre-Advent judgment fit
           in with our understanding of Christ as our High Priest in the
           heavenly sanctuary? Why should the judgment be part-and-
           parcel of our sanctuary message? Most important, how can we
           teach the judgment as part of the good news of Jesus as our
           Substitute in judgment?

           ●
           2 What does the reality of Christ’s high-priestly ministry mean
           to you personally? What experience(s) can you share about how
           this teaching has benefited you spiritually?

           ●3 Go back over the week’s lesson and make a list of all the ben-
           efits we derive from Christ as our High Priest. Bring them to
           class and discuss the implication of these benefits and how they
           should impact our lives as individuals and as a church commu-
           nity. How can we better take advantage of these promises in
           order to further our witness and mission to the world?

Sanjay’s Miracles: Part 2
   Sanjay realized that God had miraculously saved his life twice, and now
he dedicated himself to work for God. He became a lay evangelist and was
sent to a village where no one had even heard of Adventists before.
   Sanjay found a family who let him stay in the room in which the family
kept their idols. Sanjay prayed that his host family would be blessed by his
presence and would not force him to leave when they learned that he was
Christian.
   Sanjay learned that his host had a health problem. He asked to pray to
his God for the man’s healing. The man agreed, and the homeowner was
healed. Sanjay told the man that he was a Christian and invited him to
study the Bible. The man invited his family to study with him, and within
a few months the entire family gave their hearts to Jesus and offered their
home for small group meetings.
   Sanjay visited people, prayed for their needs, and urged them to trust in
the living God, who hears and answers prayer. When one family mocked
him, saying that their god protected and blessed them, Sanjay left feeling
that he had failed. The next day the homeowner told Sanjay that after the
family had gone to bed the night before, a rat had entered their home and
knocked over the oil lamp, which caught the straw walls on fire. The fam-
ily barely got out alive. “We were wrong about your God. Please, may we
attend your prayer meetings?”
   Another woman, Ompatti, was troubled by evil spirits. Her husband
abandoned her and their three children. Doctors couldn’t cure the woman,
and trips to religious shrines brought her no relief. Then someone asked
Sanjay to pray for her. As he prayed, Sanjay touched the woman, and she
fell to the ground screaming. The devils left her. She told everyone of her
healing. When her husband learned that she was no longer possessed, he
returned. But he objected to Christianity and refused to have anything to
do with them. Soon after, he became possessed by demons. Church mem-
bers continue to pray for him.
   In the three years that Sanjay has worked as a lay evangelist, some 200
people in seven villages have given their lives to Christ and been baptized.
Some of the groups of believers, which number from 15 to 25 people, have
no place to worship. No one’s home is large enough to accommodate
them. They need churches if these congregations are to continue growing.
   Sanjay continues to use music and prayer to lead people to Jesus. Your
mission offerings help make Sanjay’s work and the work of Global
Mission pioneers around the world possible.

        LESSON           13 *June 21–27
      His Return as King and
      Friend


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Dan. 9:24–27, Matthew 24,
      Luke 21:25–31, John 14:1–3, 1 Thess. 4:13–18, Heb. 9:28.

Memory Text: “So Christ, having been offered once to bear the
      sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to
      save those who are eagerly waiting for him” (Hebrews 9:28, RSV).

             hough a distortion of the truth regarding the Second Coming,

      T      the Left Behind series of books and movies grabbed the atten-
             tion of millions worldwide. The whole episode presented God
      as wickedly capricious, and it fostered a climate of irrational fear (if
      not panic) in people’s minds about the Advent, a mood opposite to the
      way the Bible wants us to think about Christ’s return. In the New
      Testament, generally, the return of Jesus is a glorious, supremely joy-
      ful event. He is our King, and also our Friend.
        Though unpleasant elements are associated with the Second
      Coming (as we will see), it is not the fear factor that will cause peo-
      ple to turn their eyes toward heaven. Fear is important, and we do not
      proclaim the whole truth about the Advent without including it. But in
      doing so, we ought to stick with what the Scriptures explicitly say and
      not present anxiety-provoking nightmares of our own making. To give
      the various aspects of the Advent the same emphasis they receive in
      Scripture is to create in the hearts of those who care to listen some-
      thing akin to the anticipation of children yearning for Christmas.
        The message of the Second Coming should be good news, not
      something that sends people looking for anxiety therapy.

      Waiting in the Outer Court                           (Heb. 9:28)

        The period in which we are now living was foreshadowed by the
      Day of Atonement in ancient Israel. As the high priest performed his
      once-a-year ministry in the Most Holy Place, the people, with bated
      breath, waited in the outer court for his emergence. That emergence
      would signal the successful completion of His work on their behalf,
      the eradication of sin from the nation and from the individual.
        Since 1844, Christ has been engaged in a phase of ministry prefig-
      ured by the Day of Atonement in Israel. When that work is done, He
      will emerge from the heavenly sanctuary to receive His people. In the
      words of Hebrews 9:28, “Christ, having been offered once to bear the
      sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to
      save those who are eagerly waiting for him” (RSV).

How do the following texts relate to the idea of expectant waiting?

         William Miller and his followers ardently expected the emergence of
      the heavenly High Priest in 1844. We know they were disappointed, but
      try to imagine the passion that moved them. Here were people who
      loved Jesus with all they had. They felt close to Him; they yearned to
      see Him. He was their friend. And the sentiments expressed years later
      by Hiram Edson fairly represent how the whole group felt. They had
      “confidently expected to see Jesus Christ and all the holy angels with
      Him,” Edson wrote. When that did not happen, “such a spirit of weep-
      ing came over us as I never experienced before. . . . We wept, and wept,
      till the day dawn.”—Hiram Edson, manuscript fragment, Center for
      Adventist Research (from Heritage Room), James White Library,
      Andrews University. These believers did not breathe a sigh of relief that
      Jesus did not come. Instead, they were disappointed, and bitterly so.

      Addressing the Fear Factor
        There is a dark side to the coming of Jesus. Jesus Himself said it
      will be a time of distress for the nations: “ ‘At that time the sign of the
      Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will
      mourn’ ” (Matt. 24:30, NIV). He compares the event to the judgments
      of the Flood and of Sodom (Matt. 24:37–39; compare Luke
      17:26–30); He speaks of the phenomenon of final separation, using
      the illustration of two women grinding at the mill, with one taken, the
      other left (Matt. 24:40, 41). And when He speaks of remaining watch-
      ful, His warning could not be stronger (see vss. 43–51). Peter, one of
      those present the day Jesus spoke about His coming in Matthew 24,
      refers to “the day of the Lord” as one of fire and terror (2 Pet.
      3:10–12). When John sees the event in vision, he says that “all the
      peoples of the earth will mourn because of him” (Rev. 1:7, NIV); and
      Revelation 6:15, 16 portrays people from every walk of life at the
      Advent appealing to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and
      “hide [them] from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the
      wrath of the Lamb!” (NIV).

What do the following texts say about the Second Coming?

        There are those who torture and abuse others, those who murder
      and exploit, who plunder and pillage, and who rob the coffers of their
      governments, leaving millions to suffer in degradation and poverty.
      And then there are the good people who arrogantly turn their backs on
      God and His gracious offer of mercy and pardon. It would be the
      height of irresponsibility to give them the impression that the Second
      Coming holds anything for them but bad news, unless they change.
      With people’s eternal destiny hanging on these issues, it would be
      criminal on our part to sugarcoat the reality of the situation.

       In what ways might a little fear do us all some good (Phil. 2:12)?
       Maybe some of us need a little more fear than others . . .

      On the Other Hand. . . .
         As we saw in yesterday’s lesson, there is a dark side to the coming
      of Jesus. But for the converted Christian, the scene is always bright;
      for not only is the Coming One their King, He also is their Friend. This
      joyous sense of anticipation is encouraged by Jesus Himself, whatever
      the omen over the horizon. “ ‘When these things begin to take place,’ ”
      He said, “ ‘stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption
      is drawing near’ ” (Luke 21:28, NIV). No heads-down, drop-shoulder
      posture here. Jesus wants His followers to be hopeful, buoyant, radi-
      ant, in anticipation of the climactic day, to set their gaze toward the
      skies in wistful yearning for that glorious hour of His return.

Read the following passages, and see how they strengthen this notion
      of expectation and joy.

      John 14:1–3
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Acts 1:11
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Phil. 3:20, 21
      ____________________________________________________________________

      1 Thess. 4:13–18
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Rev. 7:9, 10, 13–17
      ____________________________________________________________________

        It is instructive to notice that when Jesus is speaking to the pompous
      religious leaders (or when He has the rejecters of His grace in mind),
      He emphasizes the majesty, the kingliness, the judgment aspects of
      His coming. But when His followers come into focus, the emphasis
      switches to ideas of comfort, assurance, joy. Thus in Matthew 24:31,
      immediately after talking about the mourning of the nations at His
      coming, the tone changes as He comes to focus on His people: The
      angels gather them, He says, from every nation into His kingdom. And
      in John 14:1–3, His promise to return is given to calm the “troubled”
      hearts of His followers, to steady their fraying nerves, to anchor them
      in hope.

       If you believed, with all your heart, that Jesus was coming
       within the month, what moral changes would you feel inclined
       to make in your own life? After you think about your answer,
       then ask yourself, Why wait until then to make those changes?
       After all, might it be a little harder to make those changes than
       you think?

      When Will We See Jesus?: Part 1
        Matthew 24 is a pivotal chapter on the second coming of Jesus,
      recording Jesus’ own response to questions raised by His disciples,
      questions we still have today about when the Advent will occur. Jesus
      emphasized several points, among them the following:

        1. We should not be alarmed. (In the Greek, the statement is
      terse; we might even say, emphatic: “ ‘see to it that you are not
      alarmed’ ” (vs. 6, NIV)—whether by famine, by earthquake, or by
      conflict between nations (vss. 6–8).
        2. We will face conflict and hatred, even within the church (vss.
      9–13).
        3. We should not be naive and gullible as we wait for the Second
      Coming (vss. 4, 5, 23–26). (Jesus lingered on this point!)
        4. The gospel will be preached in the whole world before the end
      (vs. 14).
        5. The event will be a spectacular, visible, worldwide phenome-
      non (vs. 27).
        6. Certain cosmic signs will signal the Advent’s approach (vs.
      29).
        7. As the end arrives, angels will gather together the faithful
      from all over the globe (vs. 31).
        8. The day and hour of the Advent is known only to God (vs. 36).
        9. Notwithstanding all warnings or predictions, the Second
      Coming will be sudden and unexpected (vss. 42–44).

        One important point worth emphasizing from the above list has to
      do with the gospel. It says that the gospel will be preached everywhere
      “ ‘as a testimony’ ” to all, “ ‘and then the end will come’ ” (vs. 14,
      NIV). This suggests that Christ’s followers play a role, however indi-
      rectly, in creating a condition vital for the termination of human his-
      tory. It thus calls for increased fervor on the part of each of us to
      advance God’s kingdom where we are.
        Leighton Ford tells about a prison chaplain trying to bring a con-
      demned prisoner to Christ in a London jail. “Do you really believe
      what you say, Chaplain? . . . If I believed your Gospel were true, I
      would crawl across England on broken glass to tell men about it.”
      —The Christian Persuader (New York: Harper & Row, 1966), p. 29.
      That is the kind of enthusiasm needed now.

       If the gospel must go everywhere before Christ returns, and if
       we are called to preach that gospel, then we ourselves have a role
       in working with Him to hasten the Second Advent, do we not?
       Yes or no? What are the challenges, opportunities, or problems
       this idea presents to us?

     When Will We See Jesus?: Part 2
       Sunday’s lesson referred to the Millerites and how they eagerly
     waited (albeit in vain) for the Advent on October 22, 1844. What they,
     and we since, have discovered is that Jesus was not coming back the
     next day, either, nor the next week, the next month, the next year, the
     next decade, or the next century! And here we are today, some 164
     years later, still in this world. How do we grapple with this problem in
     our own minds?
       One way is to focus on the veracity and certainty of the event. In
     other words, regardless of the when of the event, we can come to grips
     with the fact of it, not by logic, but by considering who made the
     promise in the first place. It came from Jesus Himself, an authentic,
     historical figure, whose probity and credibility have stood the test of
     the centuries. We see this very Person addressing a group of follow-
     ers, worried and apprehensive about His impending departure. Do not
     be troubled, He says to them. Trust Me (John 14:1). “ ‘If I go and pre-
     pare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me’ ”
     (vs. 3, NIV).

Review the following passages. How do they help put the issue
     before us in perspective? (Gen. 3:15, Isa. 40:8, Gal. 4:4; see also
     Dan. 9:24–27).
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The promise of the First Advent was given way back in the Garden
     of Eden (Gen. 3:15); and the world was to wait thousands of years for
     its fulfillment. But as God’s great cosmic clock struck the divinely
     prescribed hour, mystic beings announced to startled shepherds on a
     hillside in Bethlehem: “ ‘Today in the town of David a Savior has been
     born to you’ ” (Luke 2:11, NIV). The promise did not fail; for it was
     anchored on the unshakable Word of the living God. And so it will be
     with the second coming of Jesus.

      What good was Christ’s first coming if we do not have the assur-
      ance of the Second Coming? How should the certainty of the
      First Coming, and what Christ did for us at it, make us
      absolutely certain about the reality of the Second Coming,
      regardless of whenever it happens?




                                                                        109

    Further Study: “Christ had ascended to heaven in the form of
          humanity. The disciples had beheld the cloud receive Him. The same
          Jesus who had walked and talked and prayed with them; who had bro-
          ken bread with them; who had been with them in their boats on the
          lake; and who had that very day toiled with them up the ascent of
          Olivet,—the same Jesus had now gone to share His Father’s throne.
          And the angels had assured them that the very One whom they had
          seen go up into heaven, would come again even as He had ascended.
1         . . . Well might the disciples rejoice in the hope of their Lord’s
          return.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 832.

            Our concept of time has a lot to do with the level of anxiety we
          experience in respect to the so-called delay of the Advent. In Western
          society in particular, our expectation of temporal precision affects our
2         thinking about the event. To be told that an event will happen soon has
          a certain currency with us, and we expect it to take place shortly, in
          the Western sense. For the Eastern mind, on the other hand—the con-
          text in which the biblical writers operated—the more important aspect
          of an event was its certainty; time was secondary.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 From about the mid-eighteenth century up through World War
3          I, many people in the West thought that through science, reason,
           and technology, humanity could greatly improve itself, and that
           evils such as war, disease, and other calamities could be eradi-
           cated or at least greatly limited. Contrast that view with the view
           of the world presented by Jesus more than nineteen hundred
           years ago, in Matthew 24. Who was right? How should Matthew
           24 be a factor in helping us have faith in the promises of Christ’s
           second coming, especially when contrasted with these other views
           of what the future would be like?

           ●
           2 There is a subtle danger in the fact that the idea of the Second
           Coming has become part of our regular Adventist vocabulary.
           This can prevent us from fully appreciating (and thus adequately
           conveying to others) the extraordinary, mind-boggling nature of
           this event. How can we protect ourselves from becoming hard-
           ened to this extraordinary event, upon which all our hopes rest?

           ●
           3 Look at your local church, and then ask this question: Are we
           helping hasten the Second Coming of Jesus, or are we part of the
           reason for the delay? Discuss the implications of this question
           and your answers to it in class.

Seeking the Lost
by FERNANDO CUNHA DIAS
   I had always wanted to be a missionary, so I studied for the ministry. But
God had a mission field far closer than I could have dreamed.
   I was assigned to work with a pastor in his three churches in a region of
Brazil where people are closely bound to their traditional religion. It was
difficult to get people to even listen to God’s message here.
   Then someone told me that a woman named Vera lived in a camp of
poor people not far from a town in the district. I set out to find this woman.
The camp was located in a beautiful valley four miles up a steep moun-
tainside. When I arrived, I found 70 families living in simple dwellings
made from bamboo and covered with black plastic tarps.
   I stopped at several bamboo homes asking for Vera, but no one knew
her. Then I met a young man working outside his little hut. I asked the man
whether he knew anyone who was a Seventh-day Adventist.
   “Are you a pastor?” the young man asked. When I told him I was, he
responded, “Praise God! I have prayed for a long time for a pastor.” Then
he introduced me to several people who had been Seventh-day Adventists,
but who had not attended church for a long time. I arranged to return and
visit each of them to study the Bible and minister to them.
   The next time I visited the camp, I brought some church members with
me. We built a little chapel from bamboo and covered the roof with a tarp.
It was not very comfortable, but the people did not mind; they were eager
to hear the Word of God.
   Interest in Bible studies continued to grow, and evangelistic meetings
were arranged. The district pastor led out, and several members of nearby
Adventist churches lent their support to the meetings. Attendance grew
until we had to build more pews to accommodate the people. Eventually
some 200 people attended the nightly meetings.
   Ivanette, a teenage girl who attended the meetings, had a recurring
dream in which she returned home after the meetings to discover that she
had left her sandals at the church. When she returned to the chapel to get
her sandals, she heard a voice saying, “This is the true church, the church
you should follow.”
   Following the meetings, 30 new believers were baptized, including
Ivanette and her father. The “bamboo church” was organized as a com-
pany. Ivanette’s father donated land on which to build a permanent church,
and the believers are working to build a more permanent church.
   Our mission offerings make evangelism such as this possible. Thank
you for giving faithfully.

2008    Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter

          The Bible gives us many inspirational stories of God’s agents of
       hope. In this quarter’s study, “Agents of Hope: God’s Great Mission-
       aries,” we will focus on some of these outstanding missionaries; on
       who they were and what they did in seeking to bring others to a saving
       knowledge of the Lord of salvation.
          This quarter is designed to lead us into a renewed commitment to
       share God’s love with our neighbors, friends, and those in mission fields
       around the world, bringing us to a new dimension in our Christian lives.

Lesson 1—For Such a Time as This: The Apostle Paul
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Paul’s Background (Acts 22:3–5, 25–29)
       MONDAY: Paul: His Conversion and Calling (ACTS 9:1–19)

       Memory Text—Romans                   15:17, NIV

       Sabbath Gem: The apostle Paul had a powerful impact on his world
       and radically helped to spread the gospel well beyond Israel. What a
       model are both his life and ministry to us in our mission to the world.

       Sabbath Gem:       Paul gives us an excellent example of how we need
       to learn to adapt the way we present our message, depending on the
       context and culture in which we are giving witness to the gospel.
