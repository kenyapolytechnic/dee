         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Commitee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of a worldwide evaluation committee and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

                      Agents of
      Swede Ingmar Bergman told a story about a knight named Antonius
   Block who kneels in front of a confessional to confess his sins. He does not
   realize until later that he is talking to Death—a shadowy, robed charac-
   ter—rather than a priest. Block declares that he is seeking not faith, not
   suppositions, but knowledge.
      “I want,” he says, “God to stretch out His hand toward me, reveal
   Himself, and speak to me.”
      Death replies that perhaps there is no God, that there is only nothing.
      “Then,” says Block, “life is an outrageous horror. No one can live in the
   face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.”
      Today millions live in the face of such nothingness. They have no faith
   in God, no hope in anything past the world around them. No wonder,
                                     then, that so many focus on the comforts
  As Christians, we are of this life, seeking solace in pleasure and
                                     the various worldly distractions. The
God’s agents to bring Christian faith—which calls upon us to
people hope, to show “fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on
that there is a God who what is unseen. For what is seen is tempo-
                                     rary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Cor.
loves and cares for them. 4:18, NIV)—is foreign to them.
                                       As Christians, we are God’s agents to
   bring these people hope, to show that there is a God who loves and cares
   for them, to show that although life has many outrageous horrors, it is not
   ultimately an outrageous horror but that God will finally make all things
   right.
      The Bible gives us many inspirational stories of God’s agents of hope. In
   this quarter’s lessons we will focus on some of these outstanding mission-
   aries; on whom they were and what they did in seeking to bring others to
   a saving knowledge of the Lord of salvation.
      Ellen G. White tells the story of a man nearly chilled to death in deep
   snow. He was about to give up struggling for his life when he heard the
   moans from a fellow traveler nearby. His first impulse was to rescue the
Hope
other man. When he found him, he rubbed the man’s frozen limbs. He
finally got him to his feet and carried him through the drifts to safety.
   Then “the truth flashed home to him that in saving his neighbor he had
saved himself also” by quickening “the blood which was freezing in his
own veins.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 319.
   The point? A healthy church is a church focused on mission to others.
Sharing God’s love with the community brings fresh life and energy into
the church.
   It would be a mistake this quarter to study these biblical agents as inter-
esting historical figures and leave it at that. Rather, we need to catch the
inspiration of their lives and focus on our mission to this dying world.
There is nothing more refreshing, or more life-giving, than reaching out to
others.
   Our prayer is that this quarter’s lessons on biblical agents of hope will
lead us into a renewed commitment to share God’s love with our neigh-
bors and friends and in mission fields around the world. In so doing, we
may just find that we have entered into a whole new dimension in our
Christian lives.

      For Such a Time As This:
      The Apostle Paul




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 9:1–9, 22:3–5, 25–29,
      Rom. 7:19–25, 11:1, Phil. 3:5, 2 Pet. 1:3–8.

Memory Text: “Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service
      to God” (Romans 15:17, NIV).

Key Thought: The apostle Paul had a powerful impact on the
      then-known world, spreading Christianity far beyond the geo-
      graphical confines of Israel and the Jewish people. His life and
      ministry is a model for our mission today.

             he idea that the good news was also good news for the Gentiles

      T      was a shocker to people who, despite the teachings of their own
             prophets, had grown up with a different understanding. God’s
      salvation was for the entire world, not just for Jewish people. Talk
      about a paradigm shift!
        The apostle Paul was a key leader in acting on this revelation. His
      background, personality, and calling from God made him the right
      person at the right time to guide the church into this new era of mis-
      sion to all people.
        The Seventh-day Adventist Church went through a similar process
      during the late nineteenth century, when it began its mission work out-
      side North America. This was a radical step that laid the foundation
      for today’s international Adventist mission work in more than two
      hundred countries.

     Paul’s Background
       The apostle Paul is arguably the most influential person in the New
     Testament, apart from Jesus Himself. He took the good news about
     Jesus to much of the then-known world.
       Paul was born in Tarsus, then the capital of Cilicia, a Roman
     province, in what is present-day Turkey. This area was noted for its
     goats’-hair cloth that was widely used for tent making, which was
     Paul’s trade (Acts 18:3).

Read Acts 22:3–5, 25–29, Romans 11:1, and Philippians 3:5. What do
     these texts tell us about Paul that could help us understand why he
     could be so effective a witness at this time in history?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Roman citizenship by birth was highly prized. In Paul’s day, a per-
     son could purchase Roman citizenship for 500 drachmas, close to two
     years’ wages for the average worker. Roman citizenship came with
     certain privileges—safety from scourging and no death penalty with-
     out a trial (see Acts 22:23–29); the right to vote, make contracts, and
     have a legal marriage; and exemption from paying taxes.
        And yet, he was also a Jew, one with a rich spiritual heritage. In later
     years, Paul often referred to his heritage and said, “ ‘I was thoroughly
     trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any
     of you are today’ ” (Acts 22:3, NIV).
        Paul came from the tribe of Benjamin, was reared as a Pharisee, and
     studied under the great Gamaliel (vs. 3), one of the leading Jewish
     teachers of the time. We learn from Paul’s letter to the Galatians that
     he was “extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers” (Gal. 1:14,
     NIV). This zeal translated into full-scale persecution of those who
     became followers of Jesus.
        Zealous Jew, Roman citizen, Paul was soon to become the greatest
     apostle the world has ever seen.

      What aspects of your own life (nationality, education, upbring-
      ing, etc.) can be of special use in witnessing? How can you take
      advantage of your background to better witness for the Lord?




                                                                              7

     Paul: His Conversion and Calling
        The apostle Paul was not always the apostle Paul but Saul of Tarsus,
     persecutor of the early church. He then had an experience that set him
     on the course that would change not only his own life but history
     itself.

Read Acts 9:1–9, Paul’s conversion experience. What happened to
     him that changed him so greatly? How hard must it have been for
     him to accept that he had been so terribly wrong about Jesus?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Paul did not need any deep theological explanation before surren-
     dering Himself to Jesus. Right then and there Paul gave himself to the
     Lord, declaring, “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (vs. 6). The
     fiery opponent of Jesus was now His humbled and broken servant.
        After his conversion, Paul met with Peter, James, and John—the
     “pillars” among the apostles—and they agreed that Paul’s special call-
     ing was to go as an apostle to the Gentiles (Gal. 2:7–9).

Read Acts 13:47 and Isaiah 49:5, 6. What title and purpose do Paul
     and Barnabas apply to themselves that was also applied to Jesus?
     Luke 2:30–32.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Though Paul saw himself as a special envoy or instrument to reach
     the Gentiles, he also shared the good news with Jewish people. In the
     same way, other apostles such as Peter preached mainly to Jews, but
     God also used them to witness to Gentiles. In fact, Peter was the first
     apostle to reach out to Gentiles (see Acts 10).
       Most likely, few of us have had the kind of dramatic conversion
     experience that Paul did. Yet, we all, at some point, need conversion.
     What has your own conversion experience been? Most important,
     what have you learned from that experience that could help you lead
     others toward having their own, as well?

               T UESDAY July 1

     Paul: A Man of Like Passions
        It is so easy to envision Paul, the great apostle to the Gentiles and,
     with the exception of Jesus Himself, the greatest force in all
     Christianity, as some kind of superhuman being, a flawless saint and
     herald of the faith.
        Yet, that is not the picture presented in the New Testament. Scripture
     puts us all under sin, paints us all as sinners in need of divine grace.
     The apostle Paul is no exception either.
        At times Paul seems impulsive, almost aggressive. He often stood
     up for his rights. When he and Silas were in jail, he appealed to his
     rights as a Roman citizen (Acts 16:35–40). Later, when in the court of
     Agrippa, he appealed to Caesar—which was one of his rights as a
     Roman citizen (Acts 25:11, 12). Had he waited and not demanded his
     rights, he later might have been freed (Acts 26:32).

What can we learn about Paul from the following texts? Acts
     15:37–39, Rom. 7:19–25, 1 Cor. 9:27, 2 Cor. 12:7.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        It is a comfort to know that such a giant of faith as the apostle Paul
     was not perfect. He sometimes made mistakes. He needed the daily
     grace and forgiveness of Jesus in his life, just as we do. Indeed, from
     all that we can tell by his writing, Paul was very aware of his own sin-
     fulness. No doubt it was from, partially at least, this awareness of his
     own weaknesses and faults that made him such a powerful teacher of
     God’s saving grace.

Read Romans 7:24. What does this tell us about Paul’s self-
     understanding? What hope and comfort can you draw from your-
     self by these words?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

      Though Paul was not perfect, God used him anyway. Why is it
      important that while being aware of our faults and claiming
      God’s promises for victory we not allow them to discourage us
      from working for the Lord?



                                                                            9

     Life and Salvation Through Christ
        Several major themes dominated and motivated the apostle Paul’s
     life and mission. At the top of the list was the story of Jesus crucified.
     This event was the basis of everything he taught and did. He wrote to
     the Corinthians, “For I determined not to know any thing among you,
     save Jesus Christ, and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2), and to the
     Galatians, “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
     Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal. 6:14). These verses show that for Paul the
     cross of Christ (which of necessity includes Christ’s resurrection, as
     well) was the central theme of his whole theology.
        Throughout his writings, Paul describes in many different ways the
     enormity of what Jesus did through the Cross to save humanity.

Read the following texts in which Paul describes salvation. What do
     these verses tell us about what Christ has done for us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Paul uses a number of different images and word pictures to
     describe what Christ has done for us. Most likely that is because no
     single image alone can do justice to the grandness of what was accom-
     plished for us at the Cross.

      How central is the Cross to your own theology? How focused are
      you on it? Why is it important to keep the Cross at the center of
      all our witnessing?

     Themes of Hope
        In yesterday’s lesson, we saw how Christ’s death on the cross was
     the key theme in Paul’s life and teachings. Today we will touch briefly
     on some other major Pauline themes.
        Living a godly life (sanctification). Paul makes it very clear
     throughout his writings that salvation is free, a gift we cannot earn or
     deserve (Rom. 5:15, 6:23, Eph. 2:8). But salvation does not free us to
     behave as we did before we met Jesus. In response to His grace, we
     must live as Jesus asks us to live.
        Paul writes to Timothy: “Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith,
     love, endurance and gentleness” (1 Tim. 6:11, NIV). We do not do
     what is right in order that Jesus will save us; we do what is right
     because we have been saved. In fact, says Paul, we were “created in
     Christ Jesus to do good works” (Eph. 2:10, NIV).
        We do not obey God so that He will love us, accept us, or give us a
     ticket to heaven. When we accept Jesus’ gift of salvation, we are
     accepted totally and unconditionally. We obey God because His pow-
     erful love leads us to good works. We obey Him because His love
     compels us (see 2 Cor. 5:14).

Paul wrote that he did not want us to “be ignorant” about what hap-
     pens when people die (1 Thess. 4:13). Why is it important to under-
     stand the truth about life after death?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Paul’s key themes are all linked. Through Jesus’ self-sacrifice and
     resurrection, He conquered death. He will return to bring His gift of
     everlasting life to His faithful children (see vss. 13–18) at their resur-
     rection. These followers of Jesus have demonstrated their love for Him
     in the way they have lived their lives (see Eph. 4:20–32).

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “From Persecutor to
          Disciple,” pp. 112–122, in The Acts of the Apostles.

            “The belief of a falsehood did not make Paul a kind, tender, com-
          passionate man. He was a religious zealot, exceedingly mad against
          the truth concerning Jesus. He went through the country, haling men
          and women, and committing them to prison.”—Ellen G. White,
          Selected Messages, book 1, p. 214.
             “The apostle Paul had all the privileges of a Roman citizen. He was
          not behind in the Hebrew education; for he had learned at the feet of
          Gamaliel; but all this did not enable him to reach the highest standard.
1         With all this scientific and literary education, he was, until Christ was
          revealed to him, in as complete darkness as are many at this time. Paul
          became fully conscious that to know Jesus Christ by an experimental
          knowledge was for his present and eternal good. He saw the necessity
          of reaching a high standard.”—Ellen G. White, Advent Review and
          Sabbath Herald, July 18, 1899.
2            “There is one great central truth to be kept ever before the mind in
          the searching of the Scriptures—Christ and Him crucified. Every
          other truth is invested with influence and power corresponding to its
          relation to this theme. It is only in the light of the cross that we can
          discern the exalted character of the law of God. The soul palsied by
          sin can be endowed with life only through the work wrought out upon
          the cross by the Author of our salvation.”—Ellen G. White Comments,
          The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1084.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 What beliefs are most important to you? How do they affect
           the way you live? How do you respond to those who hold other
           beliefs, maybe even contrary beliefs to your own, just as strongly?

           ●
           2 How central is the Cross in your own local church? What
           could you do, as either an individual or a class, to help ensure
           that as with Paul, Christ and Him crucified are central to your
           church and its outreach to the local community?

           3 In class, share your responses to Thursday’s final question.


    Summary: Paul provides a wonderful example of the fact that there is
          no limit to what God can do through us—human and weak though we
          may be. Paul’s unique background and gifts enabled him to take the
          good news about Jesus to an entirely new mission field.

The Hidden Money
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Stefka Mancheva lives in Bulgaria. Life for Stefka was never easy, but
shortly after Communism fell in Bulgaria, her husband died. Inflation
wracked the nation and ate up her meager pension until she could barely
afford to buy food for herself and her son. She prayed that God would
remember the widowed and the orphaned, that He would somehow meet
their needs.
   One cold day she needed her scissors. She looked in the drawer, but they
weren’t there. She emptied her purse of its contents, but couldn’t find the
scissors. However, she noticed that the lining of the purse had been cut,
and it felt as if something had slipped between the lining and the outer
shell. She reached into the hole in the lining and pulled out some paper. It
seemed to be money, but it wasn’t from Bulgaria.
   She examined the money and realized that it was Italian lira—100,000
Italian lira. It wasn’t hers, for she had never been to Italy. But where could
it have come from? God must have sent it in answer to my prayers, she
thought. But why is it foreign money?
   Stefka thanked God for the lira and placed it in a safe place. Then she
went to the bank and asked the manager how much 100,000 Italian lira
were worth. She waited, stiff with apprehension, as the bank manager
punched some numbers into his calculator. Then he told her that 100,000
lira were worth about four months’ wages at the present rate of exchange.
“But,” he added, “with inflation, the value should grow.”
   Stefka thanked him and walked home, praising God. She had bought the
purse in which she found the money four years earlier. The money had
been there all that time. That meant that God had seen her need years
before she even asked Him for help. And God had provided for her by
sending foreign currency that wouldn’t be eaten up by inflation. How good
You are, God! she praised Him in her heart. Before I even called on You,
You answered my prayer.
   Stefka saved the money, exchanging only what she needed to buy food
and clothes for herself and her son. As inflation continued to climb, the
lira became worth more and more. Eventually they were worth the equiv-
alent of more than a year’s pension.
   “I praise God for His faithfulness to me, a poor widow,” Stefka said.
   God provides all our needs according to His riches. As He has blessed
us, let’s give abundantly to mission so that others can know the God who
loves them and will never leave them.

          LESSON            2      *July 5–11


      “All Things to All Men”:
      Paul Preaches to the World




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 11:19–26, 13:16–42,
      17:18–34.

Memory Text: “I have become all things to all men, that I might
      by all means save some” (1 Corinthians 9:22, NKJV).

Key Thought: The apostle Paul, seeking to bring the gospel to
      the world, gives us an example of how we need to learn to adapt
      the way we present our message, depending on the context and
      culture in which we are witnessing.

              dventist missionary pioneers quickly learned that they needed

      A       to present our present truth message in as culturally relevant a
              way as possible. Today the Global Mission initiative of the
      worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church sponsors study centers
      around the world that explore ways to build bridges to people of other
      religions and cultures. Before we can effectively communicate with
      other people, we need to understand their culture and ways of think-
      ing.
        This week we explore what it means to adapt our message to peo-
      ple in different circumstances. And we do so by looking at the various
      ways in which the apostle Paul, a firm and uncompromising believer
      in truth, tailored the message of Jesus for specific audiences. What
      can we learn from Paul that will better enable us to reach people with
      present truth?

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, July 12.

     Paul Encouraged for Mission
       After Paul’s Damascus road experience, some of the apostles were
     not convinced that he was a true disciple (see Acts 9:26). Perhaps they
     feared he was sent as a spy to infiltrate the church and cause further
     problems. At that time, Barnabas stood up for Paul and defended him
     (vss. 27, 28).
       Barnabas was “a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith” (Acts
     11:24, NIV), and he was a tremendous help to Paul as he began his
     ministry.

Read Acts 11:19–24. How did the church begin in Antioch? How suc-
     cessful were the missionary endeavors?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The leaders of the church in Jerusalem heard about the new group
     of believers in Antioch—one of the three leading cities of the Roman
     Empire at that time. Immediately they sent the highly respected
     Barnabas to help establish and build up the church.

Read Acts 11:25, 26. Why do you think Barnabas chose Paul to help
     him?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Acts is full of surprising events: Saul, the persecutor, becomes Paul,
     the missionary; the gospel of salvation becomes good news for all, not
     just for the Jews; and now Paul ministers to a church established indi-
     rectly as a result of his persecution.
        For a year Barnabas and Paul taught the people. As the church grew
     in strength, it developed a spirit of compassion and ministered to oth-
     ers. The new church members sent financial help to their brothers and
     sisters in Judea, who were suffering from a severe famine (Acts
     11:28–30). Thus, they were not going to hoard their own blessings;
     when a need came, they were ready to help.
        The church in Jerusalem, hearing about Antioch, sent Barnabas to
     work with it. And Barnabas, knowing about Paul’s calling, brought
     Paul to help. And that church, hearing about the needs in Jerusalem,
     sent aid to it.

      What lesson can we learn about helping others with the things
      that we ourselves have been blessed?



                                                                           15

     All Things to All People
      “I have become all things to all men so that by all possible
     means I might save some” (1 Cor. 9:22, NIV).

        What does Paul mean when he says that he has “become all things
     to all [people]”? We can be confident that whatever his meaning, the
     apostle is not advocating compromise. He is not talking about chang-
     ing the gospel, the doctrines, the ethics, or any of the truth of God’s
     Word. He is talking about making these things as attractive and under-
     standable as possible for different cultures.
        Paul modeled this approach by using different methods to reach dif-
     ferent people.
        For example, in attempting to reach Jews, Paul would arrive in a
     city, visit the synagogue, and teach (see, for example, Acts 9:19–22,
     13:14–16).

Read Acts 13:16–42. In his sermon, where does Paul’s short overview
     of biblical history begin and end? To what authority does he
     appeal to prove that Jesus is the Messiah? What does this tell you
     about Paul’s approach to Jewish people?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

Read Acts 14:8–18. How does the way Paul talks to the pagans—who
     did not believe the Old Testament—differ from his speeches to the
     Jews?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Paul makes no appeal to Scripture as an authority (he does allude to
     the Old Testament in verse 15, but in the way he might quote a poet,
     not as an authority). Rather, he appeals to the natural world and the
     evidence that nature gives of a Creator God. And he points out the
     futility of worshiping idols.

      How far should we be willing to go in trying to reach people in
      their own culture? How can we avoid the dangers of going too
      far; that is, of compromising truth in our attempts to spread it?

               T UESDAY July 8

     A Witness to the Philosophers
       One of Paul’s most well-known missionary endeavors occurred in
     Athens, home of some of the world’s greatest philosophers of antiq-
     uity, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. And yet, how interesting:
     Even with all the philosophy and all its appeals to reason and logic,
     the city was still “wholly given to idolatry” (Acts 17:16). What a tes-
     timony to how, in the end, philosophy cannot answer basic human
     needs.

Read Acts 17:18–34. What approach did Paul take in trying to reach
     these people? What does he not use? How successful were his
     efforts?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Epicureans taught that happiness comes from living a good life with
     modest pleasures. The Stoics, on the other hand, urged people to be
     content with what they had. Together, Stoic and Epicurean philoso-
     phers heard Paul in the marketplace and started to argue with him,
     calling him a “babbler” (Acts 17:18, NIV).
       Despite ridiculing Paul, these philosophers invited him to speak at
     a meeting of the Areopagus—a group of philosophers that assessed
     new teachings—on what we know as Mars’ Hill.
       In his speech, Paul shapes his message to his pagan audience (vss.
     22–25) by connecting with their culture. He refers to a statue they had
     built to the unknown god and identifies Him as the Creator God.
       At no stage does Paul refer to the Scriptures, as he would with a
     Jewish audience. Rather, he again points to the natural world with
     which they are familiar and connects it to the supernatural. And
     though Paul did not use the Scriptures, his message to them was,
     clearly, very scriptural.

      In what ways do the things of nature speak to your heart about
      God? How could you better cultivate an appreciation of our
      Creator through the things of nature?




                                                                        17
        W EDNESDAY July 9

     The Message on Mars’ Hill
Read again Acts 17:18–34. Look through Paul’s discourse. Where do
     you find these basic doctrines: Creation, Redemption, and judg-
     ment? In what ways does it sound like our Adventist message?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Paul not only knew pagan literature; he quoted parts of it from
     memory. First, he quotes a Cretan poet who wrote, “ ‘In Him we live
     and move and have our being’ ” (vs. 28, NIV). And second, the pagan
     Cleanthes, whose love poem to the god Zeus contained the line “ ‘We
     are his offspring’ ” (vs. 28, NIV). In each case, Paul takes something
     from their culture and connects it to the truth he wants to teach them.
        “With hand outstretched toward the temple crowded with idols, Paul
     poured out the burden of his soul, and exposed the fallacies of the reli-
     gion of the Athenians,” writes Ellen G. White. “The wisest of his hear-
     ers were astonished as they listened to his reasoning. He showed himself
     familiar with their works of art, their literature, and their religion.”—The
     Acts of the Apostles, p. 237.
        Ellen White adds: “Paul’s words contain a treasure of knowledge for
     the church. . . . Had his oration been a direct attack upon their gods
     and the great men of the city, he would have been in danger of meet-
     ing the fate of Socrates. But with a tact born of divine love, he care-
     fully drew their minds away from heathen deities, by revealing to them
     the true God, who was to them unknown.”—The Acts of the Apostles,
     p. 241.
        Paul understood that before we can lead people to where we want
     them to be we must first meet them where they are. That means focus-
     ing on their needs, their interests—and shaping our message in a way
     that connects with them. This does not mean watering down the mes-
     sage. It is just an issue of communication—talking to people in terms
     and in language they can understand.

      What was the one aspect of Paul’s teaching that caused the most
      dissent in this environment? Why? What should this tell us
      about the limits of trying to explain rationally all that we
      believe?

           T HURSDAY July 10

     Paul’s Method of Church Planting
Read Romans 15:18–23. How could he claim that “I have fully
     preached the gospel of Christ” (vs. 19, NIV), when obviously most
     of the population were still not Christians? What does the answer
     tell us about how we are to determine what success is?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Paul chose to start new congregations in strategic cities throughout
     the region. He chose places that were major transport hubs—on major
     Roman roads or seaports—and that were important commercial, trad-
     ing, or administrative centers. He thus established strategic light-
     houses throughout the area, planning that the new groups of believers
     would take the good news to the areas surrounding these centers.
     Although Paul’s work was finished, the task of outreach had only
     begun for the new believers.
        On his second missionary journey, Paul, with the help of Timothy
     and Silas, established a Christian church in Thessalonica, the largest
     city in Macedonia. It was located at the crossroads of two important
     Roman highways and was the major seaport for the entire region. A
     strongly established group of believers in this city would provide a
     center from which other church plants could grow throughout that
     area.
        This is exactly what happened. Paul says, “You became a model to
     all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. The Lord’s message rang
     out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your faith in God
     has become known everywhere” (1 Thess. 1:7, 8, NIV).
        This church was a model for others. Interestingly enough, the Greek
     word for church (ekklesia) was not a specifically Christian word. It
     was used for any gathering of people in various settings. However, the
     Christian ekklesia was called to specific functions—not just to wor-
     ship together but to reach out to their communities with the good news
     that they themselves had received.

      The church did not exist solely to feed its own members. What
      is your own attitude? Do you go to church seeking only to get
      your own needs met, or do you go hoping to give even more than
      you receive?



                                                                        19

    Further Study: “Thus [Paul] varied his manner of labor, shaping
         his message to the circumstances under which he was placed.”—Ellen
         G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 118.
             “There are some who will not be convinced by any presentation of
         the truth. The laborer for God should, nevertheless, study carefully the
         best method, in order that he may not arouse prejudice or stir up com-
         bativeness in his hearers.”—Ellen G. White, The Advent Review and
         Sabbath Herald, November 25, 1890.
             “They [God’s workmen] are not to be one-idea men, stereotyped in
         their manner of working, unable to see that their advocacy of truth
1
         must vary with the class of people among whom they work and the
         circumstances they have to meet.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers,
         p. 119.
            “By cheerful, patient kindness and Christian courtesy, he won the
         hearts of the people, quieted their prejudices, and endeavored to teach
         them the truth without exciting their combativeness. All this he did
2
         because he loved the souls of men, and desired to bring them to Christ
         that they might be saved.”—Ellen G. White, Sketches From the Life of
         Paul, p. 162.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 How would you best communicate what we as Adventists
          believe to an atheist university student? A person from another
3
          religion? Someone who believes the Bible but is not an Adventist?
          A former Adventist? Someone who seems totally indifferent to
          the whole question of faith or God?

          ●
          2 No matter how different our approaches might be, what are
          some of the common things that must always accompany our wit-
          ness to others? That is, what things should always be front and
          center of our witness, regardless of the circumstances?

          ●
          3 How mission centered is your local church? What can you do
          to help your church get more involved in outreach to your local
          community?

    Summary: Communication does not take place if the listener cannot
         understand what is being said. Paul provides many examples of how
         in our witness we must translate the good news into terms that people
         can understand.

Jesus’ Helper
by OMAR REYES TORRES
   I wanted to be a civil engineer, but God had other plans for my life. I
had studied in Adventist schools until I entered the state university in
Puerto Rico. I soon discovered the difference between Adventist education
and public education. Several teachers were atheists and made it a point to
undermine my faith.
   When an exam fell on Sabbath, the teacher refused to allow me to take
it another day, saying that if there was a God, He would understand why I
needed to be in class that day. In this university the teachers are kings, and
the classroom is their kingdom.
   Eventually I transferred to Antillian Adventist University to finish my
studies. As I compared the teachers and the school atmosphere, I realized
that the Adventist school had something that the public schools could
never have—a Christian atmosphere. While not everyone on campus is an
Adventist, the teachers are very committed to their students. For them it’s
a calling; they believe in what they are doing.
   I’m now teaching at this same university. It’s a privilege to teach here
where I can integrate Adventist beliefs into my class and no one forbids
me to talk about God. I feel the atmosphere change when I invite God to
come into the classroom.
   In this school we don’t strive to make Adventists of every student;
instead we strive to draw them closer to God and to understand what God
wants and who He is.
   If I can help one student see the Lord in a different way, understand God
in a more mature way, then I have done my job well. I wanted to be an
engineer. But I wouldn’t have had the influence I have now as a teacher in
an Adventist school.
   One day a student came to me and said, “You had a worship that
changed my life. I was having problems with drugs, but your worship
helped me to quit drugs. Thanks.” Another boy told me that his mother had
died. A worship talk on death helped him work through his feelings of
grief and meant a lot to him. I know that God was speaking through me.
And it changed this boy’s life.
   I don’t think of myself as a teacher; Jesus is the Teacher, and I am His
helper, preparing young people for eternity.

       John the Baptist:
       Preparing the Way for Jesus




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 14:1–12, Luke 1,
      Col. 2:8, Rev. 14:6–12.

Memory Text: “ ‘I tell you the truth:Among those born of women
      there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he
      who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he’ ”
      (Matthew 11:11, NIV).

Key Thought: John the Baptist had a special calling from God;
      we, as a church, have been called in a similar way. What can we
      learn from the example of John?

            ollowers of the ancient Mandaean religion venerate John the

      F     Baptist as the last and greatest of the prophets. Today Mandaean
            believers still can be found, mostly in Iraq and Iran. The great
      irony is that although they venerate John, they believe that Jesus was
      a false prophet, which is hard to understand since the whole purpose
      of John’s message was to prepare the way for Jesus.
         From his base near the Jordan River, John preached a message of
      repentance, forgiveness, and social justice, all to prepare people for
      the coming of the Messiah. Large crowds gathered to hear him speak;
      and many followed his teachings. In fact, several of Jesus’ disciples
      were first disciples of John the Baptist.
         This week we will discover more about the mission of a man whom
      Jesus praised more highly than anyone else; plus, we will look at the
      parallel between John’s calling and ours.

     A Special Calling
       John is one of a small group of people whom the Bible says God
     chose before birth for a special mission, people such as Samuel and
     Samson, and even Jesus Himself. Hundreds of years earlier, the
     prophet Isaiah prophesied the ministry of John as one who would be
     “a voice of one calling: ‘In the desert’ ” (Isa. 40:3–5, NIV; see also
     Luke 3:4–6). John’s father, Zechariah, also predicted that his son
     would prepare the way for the Lord (Luke 1:76).

Skim over Luke 1, where John the Baptist’s mission and calling are
     prophesied. Make notes on the things that it said that John would
     accomplish. Compare those prophecies with what we know about
     John the Baptist. In what ways were they fulfilled?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

After looking at John’s accomplishments, look at John’s ignoble end
     (Matt. 14:1–12). How does that end match all the glorious things
     predicted about him?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        John the Baptist’s calling and ministry brought him to a hard and
     difficult path, one that ended almost as ignobly as His cousin’s, Jesus.
     Despite the trials, the sufferings, and the misunderstanding, he
     remained faithful, fulfilling the prophecies made about his life. John
     is an example of the suffering that any of us could face if we seek to
     remain faithful to God and to whatever calling He has for us.

      By most standards, John the Baptist’s life and, especially, his
      death would not have made him someone whom the world
      would call successful. What should that tell us about the differ-
      ence between God’s ideals and the world’s? Are your standards
      of success more like God’s or the world’s, and what does the
      answer tell you about yourself?




                                                                         23

     Preparing the Preparer
        The Lord made many predictions about the life of John the Baptist,
     saying even before John was born what he could accomplish in his
     life. This raises the difficult question: Was John predestined to do
     these things simply because God predicted that he would? In other
     words, did John have any choice other than to do what God had pre-
     dicted? Though the question of God’s foreknowledge and our free will
     has challenged theologians and philosophers for centuries (and so we
     certainly cannot answer the question right now), we can be sure of one
     thing: John needed a special preparation for the work he was to under-
     take.

Read Luke 1:80. What is found in the text that helps us understand
     some of the preparation John needed? What principles can we
     draw from here that could help us strengthen our own spiritual
     life?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Luke 1:15 says that John would be filled with the Holy Ghost
     “ ‘even from his mother’s womb’ ”(NKJV). And yet, even with that
     special promise, he needed the kind of preparation found in the harsh-
     ness of the desert. Often in the Bible the desert or wilderness is por-
     trayed as a place for spiritual discipline and growth. Here it was that
     “the word of God came to John” (Luke 3:2, NIV). Certainly, John
     became a man of prayer and later taught his disciples how to pray
     (Luke 11:1) and fast (Mark 2:18). He knew the importance of a spiri-
     tual connection to heaven.
        The spiritual power John received from God allowed him to pro-
     claim his message with great force. He was a voice crying in the
     wilderness or, according to the literal Greek, “bellowing like an ox.”
        As Jesus later suggested, nobody went to see John because he was
     some kind of weakling—“ ‘a reed shaken by the wind’ ” (Matt. 11:7,
     NKJV). On the contrary, they went to hear a man who spoke the truth
     with power and conviction.

      Take an honest look at your own spiritual life. How often do you
      pray? How often do you study the Word? How immersed are
      you in the world and worldly things? What changes do you need
      to make? Might you need to spend some time in a desert some-
      where?

The Spirit of Elijah
  The angel who appeared to Zechariah alluded to Malachi’s
prophecy and applied it directly to John (Luke 1:17). Jesus Himself
confirmed it—“ ‘If you are willing to accept it, he [John] is the Elijah
who was to come’ ” (Matt. 11:14, NIV; see also 17:11–13).
  Elijah stands tall among the great prophets of the Old Testament. He
called on King Ahab and the people of Israel, who were steeped in
idolatry and apostasy, to return to God and reform their ways. The test
on Mount Carmel, where he stood up for God against the pagan
prophets, is one of the watershed moments in the entire Bible.
  The “Elijah message” is a phrase deep with meaning for Seventh-
day Adventists. Ellen G. White parallels the tasks of Elijah, John the
Baptist, and God’s end-time people. She describes the “Elijah mes-
sage” simply as “ ‘Prepare to meet thy God.’ ”—Ellen G. White
Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1184.

                  THE ELIJAH MESSAGE

  The apostle John wrote about three angels with special messages to
proclaim to the world (Rev. 14:6–12) at the end of time. These mes-
sages include a call to worship God (because His judgment has come)
and to remain faithful to Jesus. The gospel is central to this warning
message. Ellen G. White wrote, “Several have written to me, inquir-
ing if the message of justification by faith is the third angel’s message,
and I have answered, ‘It is the third angel’s message in verity.’ ”—The
Review and Herald, April 1, 1890.

 Read Revelation 14:6–12, the three angels’ messages. Where do
 you see warnings, as well as hope, mingled? In what sense was
 John’s message both warning and hope? How can we use warn-
 ings to point people toward hope?

                                                                      25

     Changed Behavior
       There were two key parts to John the Baptist’s message—repent-
     ance and behavior. Both were closely connected.
       The Greek word John uses for repentance (metanoeo) is a compound
     word: meta, meaning “change,” and noeo, meaning “thinking.” Thus,
     repentance means to change one’s thinking about something.
       When John says “ ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near’ ”
     (Matt. 3:2, NIV), he is telling the people that the coming kingdom of
     heaven requires a totally new outlook. In other words, in preparing the
     people for Jesus’ arrival, in preparing the way for the Lord and mak-
     ing “straight paths” for Him (vs. 3, NIV), John was challenging the
     people to change their worldview and how they live.

Read Luke 3:10–15. What is the essence of John’s message here?
     What is he telling the people? See also James 2:14–26.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       One key aspect of repentance was the confessing of sin (Matt. 3:6).
     The other key aspect was changing behavior according to the princi-
     ples of the kingdom of heaven (vs. 8). Nothing less could prepare
     them for Jesus, who would bring a time of refreshing such as they had
     never seen.
       Baptism was closely associated with repentance. In fact, Luke says
     John preached “a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins”
     (Luke 3:3, NIV). Being washed in the water symbolized the changed
     view of life, the fresh start, and the forgiveness of sin.
       Although John’s strong words offended some people, the Bible indi-
     cates that large crowds came to hear him. “People went out to him
     from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan”
     (Matt. 3:5, NIV). But not only did they come and listen, they con-
     fessed their sins and were baptized (vs. 6).

      OK, you believe in God, believe in Jesus, believe that He died for
      your sins, and that you have salvation only through His righ-
      teousness credited to you, by faith alone. The question is, How
      well are you following the principles of righteousness as
      expressed by John the Baptist? How well does your life reveal
      the faith that you profess to have?

      A Crucial Lesson From John
Read Colossians 2:8. What is it saying to you, in your own culture and
      tradition? What must you be careful about?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The Bible has much to say about tradition, and little of it is good.
      On one occasion the Pharisees and the teachers of the law asked Jesus
      why His disciples broke the tradition of the elders by not washing their
      hands before they ate (Matt. 15:2). This tradition was based on rules
      and regulations established by the rabbis, not by the Scriptures.

Read Matthew 15:3 and Mark 7:13. What specific points is Jesus
      making that gets at the heart of why tradition can be faith-
      destroying?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        An essential part of John the Baptist’s mission was to speak out
      against tradition and point people back to the revealed Word of God.
      Ellen G. White writes: “What was it that made John the Baptist great?
      He closed his mind to the mass of tradition presented by the teachers
      of the Jewish nation, and opened it to the wisdom which comes from
      above.”—Conflict and Courage, p. 276.
        John the Baptist was not bound by tradition or by accepted modes
      of speech. He spoke against sin in all its forms, from adultery to social
      injustice. Whenever God’s message is given in a clear, unambiguous
      way, people react differently. Some people responded to John the
      Baptist by accusing him of being demon-possessed (Matt. 11:18). Of
      course, exactly the same thing happened with Jesus (John 7:20).

       Is tradition always bad? Why, or why not? How can we, in what-
       ever culture we are in, retain aspects of that culture while still
       staying faithful to the Lord?




                                                                           27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Voice in the Wilder-
         ness,” pp. 97–108, in The Desire of Ages.

            “God had directed John the Baptist to dwell in the wilderness, that
         he might be shielded from the influence of the priests and rabbis, and
         be prepared for a special mission. But the austerity and isolation of his
         life were not an example for the people. John himself had not directed
         his hearers to forsake their former duties. He bade them give evidence
         of their repentance by faithfulness to God in the place where He had
         called them.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 150.
1           “In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds
         of heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God calls for men
         who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The
         message preceding the public ministry of Christ was, Repent, publi-
         cans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees; ‘repent ye: for the
         kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ As a people who believe in Christ’s
2        soon coming, we have a message to bear,—‘Prepare to meet thy God.’ ”
         (Amos 4:12).—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 55.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What dangers are there in following tradition? Is there any
          way that tradition actually can help your spiritual life? If so,
          how? As a class, talk about the traditions in your own culture.
          Which ones are helpful to faith, and which ones go contrary to it?
3         How can you know the difference, and how can you help others
          who might have trouble breaking away from the traditions that
          are harmful to their Christian walk?

          ●
          2 What has been your own “desert” experience, if any? What
          have you learned that could be a blessing to others who might be
          going through something similar?

          ●
          3 Review the parallels between John’s mission and ours as a
          church. How well are we doing? What could we be doing better?
          How could we, as individuals and as a local church, help in ful-
          filling this high calling?

    Summary: John the Baptist had the high calling of preparing the way
         for Jesus. In many ways his mission parallels that given to God’s peo-
         ple at the end of time—to preach the Elijah message to prepare peo-
         ple to meet God.

Freed From the Devil’s Chains
   Saketa Balcha lived with his parents on their small farm in western
Ethiopia. When Saketa entered his teens, he began to chew chat, a narcotic
leaf. His new habit quickly became an addiction, to the dismay of his par-
ents. Friction grew among family members, and Saketa rebelled even more.
Then he began to have episodes of dizziness.
   His condition worsened until he showed signs of insanity or demon pos-
session. The family didn’t know what to do, so they took him to a religious
teacher, hoping this man could cure him. The religious teacher called other
leaders to his home, where they chewed chat and prayed for the boy’s heal-
ing. But Saketa began throwing stones, shouting obscenities, and threaten-
ing people.
   Realizing that they couldn’t help the boy, the religious leaders gave up.
They tied him up with ropes, but Saketa escaped. So, they chained him and
carried him to his parents’ home.
   Saketa’s parents cried when they saw their son returning in chains. They
didn’t know what else to do for their son. Then someone suggested that they
ask the Adventist pastor to pray for their son. Desperate to have their boy
back, the parents sent for the pastor. Before going to the boy, the pastor
prayed for forgiveness of sin in his own life and for the presence of the Holy
Spirit.
   When he arrived at Saketa’s home, he found the boy chained to the cen-
ter pole of the house, shouting obscenities and talking nonsense. The pastor
told the family, “Humans cannot cast out demons or heal disease. Only God
can. We must pray, and we must believe that Jesus Christ has the power to
save your son.” The pastor invited everyone to kneel with him. Even Saketa
knelt down in spite of his chains, and became silent while the pastor prayed.
   After prayer, the pastor urged the family to believe in God and His power
to heal. Then he left. The next day the pastor returned and found Saketa sit-
ting in a chair, free from his chains. Saketa responded to the pastor’s ques-
tions. Again he prayed for Sakata’s complete healing and the family’s faith.
The next day the pastor found Saketa helping his father put up a fence. The
family and the neighbors were amazed.
   On Sabbath the family worshiped in the Adventist church. Saketa and
eight members of his family enrolled in the Bible class to learn more about
God, who had saved him. Today Saketa sings in the choir and praises God
for healing him.
   Millions in Ethiopia are bound by fears and superstitions. They don’t
know the freedom that faith in Jesus brings. Our mission offerings help
bring the news of salvation in Jesus to the people of this land. Thank you for
giving faithfully to world missions.

      The Son of God Among Us




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matthew 23; Mark 9:12;
      Luke 24:7; John 1:1–14, 29; Heb. 2:9.

Memory Text: “The one who existed from the beginning is the one
      we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and
      touched him with our own hands. He is Jesus Christ, the Word of
      life” (1 John 1:1, NLT).

Key Thought: Nobody else in history has had such a huge impact
      on the world or such a divided opinion as much as Jesus. The
      future of each of our lives comes down to one crucial question
      Jesus Himself asked: “ ‘Who do you say I am?’ ” (Matt. 16:15, NIV).

            ome people today dispute whether Jesus ever lived, but the his-

      S     torical evidence is overwhelmingly clear. The real issue concerns
            His identity and purpose. Was He just a good man or God’s Son?
        “A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said
      would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on
      the level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would
      be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was,
      and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.”—C. S.
      Lewis, Mere Christianity (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1960), p. 52.
        As Adventists, we work from the starting point that the Bible is the
      Word of God and that what it says about Jesus is the truth, period. We
      do not have the time to waste on nonsensical high-critical speculations
      about whether Jesus did the things the Bible says that He did.
        After all, if we cannot believe the Bible, what can we believe?

     Who Was Jesus? Part 1
       Over the centuries, people have argued about Jesus, sung about
     Him, written about Him, preached about Him, cursed Him, made
     movies about Him, even died for Him; but most people in the world
     today either do not know Him or know only what He has accom-
     plished in their behalf.

If someone were to ask you, Who was Jesus? what would you say, and
     why?


        Your answer, whatever it contained, should have dealt with the fact
     that Jesus was the divine Son of God and that He died for our sins and
     rose again. That He did great things while here is fine; that He
     preached powerful sermons is fine; that He revealed to us the charac-
     ter of God is fine. But none of these things, in the end, really matter if
     Jesus did not come and die as the Substitute for us, thus giving each
     of us the promise of eternal life (if we but claim it for ourselves).

Why is the death of Jesus, and what it accomplished, so crucial in
     helping us understand who Jesus was? Mark 9:12, Luke 24:7, John
     1:29, Rom. 5:15–21, Heb. 2:9.


        There have through history been many great men and women who
     have accomplished marvelous things, things that on the surface
     seemed even more impressive than what Jesus of Nazareth had
     accomplished. After all, He was an “unofficial” rabbi from a relatively
     small and insignificant province of Rome who died an early death and
     left just a handful of fearful and demoralized followers. On the other
     hand, when we grasp who Jesus was and just what He did while here,
     we realize that nothing that any other human being could have done is
     even worth comparing with Him. In fact, in the end, without Jesus and
     what He did for us, anything that anyone ever accomplished in this
     world would, in the large scheme of things, ultimately come to noth-
     ing. Because without Jesus and His death, the whole world and every-
     thing in it would come to nothing.




                                                                           31

      Who Was Jesus? Part 2

        What made Jesus unique in human history? It certainly was not a
      powerful public relations and marketing team. He did not have one. It
      certainly was not His wealth. He did not have any, at least not as the
      world understands wealth. And He did not have any political power to
      speak of either. On the contrary, He had been essentially on the mar-
      gins of political power.
        Jesus did have power, but it was a selfless power. He healed dis-
      eases, restored broken lives, and left pious hypocrites speechless. He
      once said to His disciples, “ ‘You know that those who are regarded as
      rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exer-
      cise authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to
      become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to
      be first must be slave of all’ ” (Mark 10:42–44, NIV). Not exactly a
      formula for those aggressively seeking political power, is it?

Read John 1:1–14. What is found in these texts that reveals to us why
      Jesus was so special, unique, in all human history?

         We can read these famous words so often that we tend to forget just
      how incredible they really are. Dwell on the implications of what John
      is telling us. These should be words filled with hope, especially in
      contrast to the teachings of modern science, which has us all here as
      the mere by-products of some great cosmic accident, the result of
      blind forces that, purely by chance, created humanity. In other words,
      instead of us being the creations of a loving God, One who became
      “flesh, and dwelt among us” (John 1:14), we are just a complicated
      conglomeration of chemicals that just happened to form on the sur-
      face of this planet, and just as there was no meaning or purpose to our
      creation, there is no meaning and purpose to lives and deaths. What a
      contrast to the hope offered us through Jesus.

     Jesus Among Sinners and Publicans
       Jesus, the eternal Son of God, was also a human who lived and
     dwelt among us. As such, He had various kinds of human interactions,
     both with family and friends. The amazing thing about Christ was not
     so much that as a human He had interaction with other people; no,
     what is amazing is that He chose to interact with certain types of peo-
     ple.

Read Matthew 11:19; Mark 2:15, 16; Luke 15:1, 2. What kind of peo-
     ple was Jesus associating with? What kind of people in your own
     society might have elicited the same response from other more
     “respectable” folk?


       Jesus came to reveal the character of God to all the world through
     both His life and His death. By associating with those who were con-
     sidered, at least by worldly standards, lowlifes, Jesus was giving us a
     message about the character of God and about what God deems good
     and bad. As humans, we tend to look at the outward appearances
     (1 Sam. 16:7); God, though, looks at the heart, where He can see what
     we often do not.

Read Matthew 21:28–32. How does that help us understand why
     Jesus associated with the kinds of people He did? What important
     message can we, those who are “religious and respectable,” take
     from this?


       Unlike us, Jesus knew the heart; Jesus saw what was going on inside
     those who, from the outside, looked so unworthy and so unpromising.
     At the same time, He knew what was going on inside those who, from
     the outside, looked so righteous and pious. We might be able to fool
     each other, and even ourselves, but never the Lord.

      What is your attitude toward the “publicans and sinners” of
      your own society? How much of the attitude of the scribes and
      the Pharisees do you harbor in your own heart? (Remember,
      these men were exceedingly self-deceived.)




                                                                        33

     Exposing the Hypocrites
       “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
     shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in
     yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in” (Matt.
     23:13).

       Though we often picture the kind and gentle Jesus working gingerly
     and softly with the worst of sinners, that is not the whole picture pre-
     sented in the Bible. On the contrary, when the time was right Jesus
     unleashed a torrent of warnings about and toward a certain group of
     people. As we all know, Jesus had strong words to speak against many
     of the religious leaders of ancient Israel, very strong words, in fact.
     Indeed, in some ways He sounded just as some of the Old Testament
     prophets did; which, of course, is not surprising, because He was the
     One who inspired them to write what they did to begin with. Thus, for
     centuries, in one venue or another, Jesus was pleading with His peo-
     ple. Is it any different today?

Read Matthew 23. What were the charges Jesus was leveling against
     the leaders? How would you categorize them? Which, in your own
     mind, would be the worst, and why? If you could summarize in
     just a few sentences the essence of His complaints, what would you
     write?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       If you really read carefully, all the things that Jesus accuses them of
     doing are amazing. One theme, however, comes through very clearly:
     These men were hypocrites, hiding the ugliness of their souls under
     the veneer of faith and piety.
       What kind of outward show of piety do you put on? How different
     are you in private than in public? How might your local church view
     you if they knew the real you? What can you do to make the real you
     more like the public version?

      Love for the Hypocrites
        “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
      yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8).

What is the message of the above text? How seriously do we take it?
      That is, do we understand that Christ’s death included the worst
      sinners, even the hypocrites we read about yesterday?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The amazing thing about the life of Jesus was that even amid the
      harshest circumstances He never lost sight of His mission: to save the
      lost. Even as He hung on the cross, even as the weight of the world’s
      sin was crushing out His life, the good of others was constantly on His
      mind. (See Luke 23:34, 42, 43; John 19:26.) What a powerful lesson
      for us, we who are called to follow in His footsteps.
        This applies to the religious leaders that Jesus railed against.
      Yesterday we read His scathing denunciations against them, as
      recorded in Matthew 23.

Read Matthew 23:37. How is it different in tone from the rest of the
      chapter? What does this tell us about Jesus and His feelings
      toward even those He just denounced? What very important prin-
      ciple is found here for us? How can we take what we see here and
      apply it in our own lives and our treatment of others, even those
      who reject our overtures toward them?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Missionary work is not easy. Look at what happened when Jesus
      Himself was here. Look at how so many reacted. Yet, even toward the
      worst Jesus showed love and care and compassion. Our feelings
      toward those who reject us should not be anger or resentment; they
      should be of pity, of concern, and of care. When people refuse to lis-
      ten, they are not rejecting us personally; they are rejecting Jesus.

       How do you respond to those who react negatively toward your
       witness? How can you learn to feel compassion, as opposed to
       anger and resentment? Why would anger and resentment only
       make things worse?

                                                                          35

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Woes on the Pharisees,”
         pp. 610–620, in The Desire of Ages.

            “The Pharisees thought themselves too wise to need instruction, too
         righteous to need salvation, too highly honored to need the honor that
         comes from Christ. The Saviour turned away from them to find others
         who would receive the message of heaven. In the untutored fishermen,
         in the publican at the market place, in the woman of Samaria, in the
         common people who heard Him gladly, He found His new bottles for
         the new wine. The instrumentalities to be used in the gospel work are
         those souls who gladly receive the light which God sends them. These
1        are His agencies for imparting the knowledge of truth to the world.”
         —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 279.
             “We may do much in a short time if we will work as Christ worked.
         We may reflect with profit upon His manner of teaching. He sought to
         meet the minds of the common people. His style was plain, simple,
         comprehensive. He took His illustrations from the scenes with which
2        His hearers were most familiar. By the things of nature He illustrated
         truths of eternal importance, thus connecting heaven and earth.”
         —Ellen G. White, Evangelism, p. 565.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Why is the idea of Jesus as just a great moral teacher not good
          enough? What hope do we have if Christ were only a moral
          teacher and nothing else? Look at the C. S. Lewis quote from the
3
          introduction for Sabbath’s study. Why is that such a powerful
          argument in favor of the deity of Christ? Or is it? What options
          do we have if Jesus isn’t the Son of God?

          2 As a class, discuss your answer to Monday’s last question.


          ●3 Whatever we might have to say about the Pharisees, one point
          we shouldn’t forget. They were members of God’s remnant
          church, the elite of the only faith in the world that had present
          truth. What’s the message, and warning, for us in that fact?

    Summary: The story of Jesus is the most important story in history.
         His life and teachings show us not only the way to live and how to
         treat one another but also the way to eternal life—by believing in the
         salvation He brought to us through His death on the Cross.

After-hours Ministry
   Dr. Danielle is a dentist in southern Brazil. During the day she works to
give people a more beautiful and healthy smile. But after hours, when her
patients have gone and the dental hygienists have cleared away the day’s
tools, the dental clinic transforms into an evangelistic center, where she
holds a small group Bible study.
   Danielle always wanted to serve God, and she chose dentistry as a way
to meet people and share her faith. But she wanted to do more, to sit with
friends and patients and share deeply of God’s love. It was then that the
idea of creating a space in her clinic to study the Bible came about. Now,
besides giving her patients quality dental care, she gives them a personal
invitation to participate in the Bible study group.
   Sandra, 32, accepted Danielle’s invitation and came to the Bible study.
“I came to participate, and I liked what I was hearing very much, so I
invited a friend to the group,” she said.
   “I was invited by a friend to come to this Bible study group,” Ruben, 30,
said. “I came, and I really liked it, so I invited my mother to come. She,
too, enjoyed the Bible study, and she invited my brother to come with her.
Then she invited her husband. Now the entire family is studying the Bible
together in this dental clinic.”
   Danielle is happy that she decided to expand her ministry beyond the
dental chair. “The Bible study group grows because people are finding
answers to their questions and their doubts,” she says. “And when they
find something that meets their needs, they invite their family and
friends.”
   And the ministry of this group goes beyond casual Bible studies. So far
the small group that meets in a dental clinic has led 60 people to baptism.
“I want Jesus to return soon,” Danielle says. “But I want as many of my
friends and clients to be ready as possible. This is one small way I can
share my faith with those with whom I have contact.”
   Every Christian knows someone, a friend, a neighbor, someone they
meet at the store each week or at work every day who doesn’t know the joy
                                they’ve found in Jesus. Danielle’s example
                                challenges each of us to find a way to reach
                                out to those we meet with the good news of
                                salvation every day.

          LESSON            5      *July 26–August 1


      Matthew 10: Jesus and His
      Disciples


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Lev. 25:8–54, Matthew 10,
      John 10:10.

Memory Text: “ ‘So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than
      many sparrows’ ” (Matthew 10:31, NIV).

Key Thought: Jesus, the world’s greatest Teacher, gave His dis-
      ciples instructions before sending them out to witness. What prin-
      ciples can we take from His words for ourselves today?

          esus knew that an important part of His task was to train a group

      J   of His followers to continue His mission. So now, after touring
          Galilee—preaching, teaching, and healing—He knew it was time
      to send out His 12 disciples on their first assignment. They were to
      receive their first practical experience.
         The disciples had received a highly specialized education from the
      greatest Teacher the world has ever known. They had seen in Jesus—
      in living action—the principles on which the universe is founded.
      They had seen the ultimate model of how human beings should live.
         The disciples had been with Jesus for only a year or so. But they had
      walked and talked with the One who was, Himself, the Way, the Truth,
      and the Life (John 14:6). The time had finally come to put into prac-
      tice what they had learned. Before Jesus sent out the disciples, He
      gave them special instruction.
         This week we will explore the highlights from Jesus’ words to His
      disciples as they embarked on their mission.

     The Kingdom of Heaven Is Near
Read Matthew 10:7. What does it mean that the “kingdom of heaven”
     is near? What is your understanding of the “kingdom of heaven”?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       A kingdom is the territory under the authority of a king. God’s king-
     dom, the kingdom of heaven, includes not only geographical territory
     but spiritual, as well. At one point Jesus even said, “The kingdom of
     God is within you” (Luke 17:21).

What does it mean that the “kingdom of God” is within us? How are
     we to understand this idea?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Before Jesus and His disciples began their ministry, John the
     Baptist began preaching that the kingdom of heaven was near (Matt.
     3:2). The New Testament clearly sees Jesus as Israel’s promised King,
     fulfilling all the hopes and predictions of the Old Testament (see Luke
     1:32, 33). But the people were expecting a political king who would
     establish a political rule over specific geographical territory and free
     them from the Romans.
       The kingdom that Jesus preached about was far different. It was not
     going to come when the Romans were overthrown. The kingdom of
     heaven was now. Now people could see Jesus, hear His words, and
     learn the principles on which salvation and heaven are based. Now
     they could learn to follow His example of how to live. Now they could
     see how the principles of God’s government operate in real life. Now
     they could choose to become part of that kingdom. Now they could
     have the promises of the Holy Spirit, of victory over sin, of hope for
     eternal life.

      In what ways are you now enjoying and benefiting from the
      privileges of living in the “kingdom of God”? What opportuni-
      ties and promises are you not yet fully taking advantage of?

      missionary work. Read over the chapter and then answer the fol-
      lowing questions:

What does Jesus mean by telling the disciples to be wise as serpents
      and harmless as doves (vs. 16)? How can we apply these words to

Read Matthew 10:2–4. What is the one thing that all of Jesus’ disci-

      ous cultures?

     Gentiles and Jews
Read Matthew 10:5, 6. How are we to understand these words in light
     of His later commission to witness to all the world?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       As He sent out His disciples, Jesus clearly told them to go only to
     the Israelites, not the Gentiles. Looking back from our perspective, we
     might deem this unfair. Why should the good news go only to the
     Jewish people? Why should everyone else be ignored, at least at that
     time?
       The answer, it seems, stems from cultural sensitivities. Jesus did not
     want the disciples to jeopardize their mission. As Ellen G. White
     writes, “If they had first preached the gospel to these, they would have
     lost their influence among the Jews who were first to hear the message
     of God.”—The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, April 19, 1892.
     She also suggests that it would have involved them in controversy with
     the Pharisees, and this would have discouraged the disciples in their
     work.—Ellen G. White, The Signs of the Times, July 18, 1900.
       In our mission today, there will always be certain cultural practices
     to which we must be sensitive. These practices may be misguided.
     They may be wrong. They might be exceedingly offensive to us. But
     we cannot ignore them and be effective witnesses.

Read John 10:10. What is Jesus saying here that can help us as we
     meet people with harmful cultures and traditions?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

         As followers of Christ, we need to be very sensitive to the cultures
     that we are working in. The last thing we need is to portray a sense of
     arrogance and superiority. If we have something better, if we can point
     others to a more abundant life, let our message and lifestyle testify to
     it.

      If someone were to look at your Christian lifestyle, what would
      they see that would make it appealing? What kind of message
      does your lifestyle send to others?



                                                                         41

     A Holistic Ministry
Read Matthew 10:7, 8. Besides preaching the gospel, what else was
     involved in the disciples’ mission?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus’ commission to His disciples was not concerned with just the
     spiritual aspect of life. The disciples were to teach and preach, but
     they were also to care for people’s physical needs. Sure, in the end, the
     ultimate goal for everyone is salvation and eternal life, but that does not
     mean we need to ignore the pain and suffering we find all around us.
        When Jesus spoke in the synagogue in Nazareth, He read from the
     book of Isaiah and made the words His own (see Luke 4:18, 19). Not
     only is He going to help the poor, the blind, the oppressed, and the
     imprisoned; He also is going to proclaim “ ‘the year of the Lord’s
     favor’ ” (vs. 19, NIV). Jesus here refers to the jubilee year (Lev.
     25:8–54), where every 50 years the ownership of land returned to the
     original owners.

Skim Leviticus 25:8–54. What seems to be the main moral concern
     there? What principle is the Lord conveying to His people?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       As Ellen White says, “a safeguard was afforded against the
     extremes either of wealth or of poverty.”—Education, p. 43. In the
     jubilee year, all slaves were also to be freed, and all debts were to be
     canceled.
       Jesus instructs His disciples to have a balanced ministry. Certainly,
     they were to prepare people for the kingdom of heaven. But they were
     also to remember that, in an important sense, the kingdom was already
     with them. And that meant they were to have concern for people’s total
     needs—including physical and social. By ministering to folks’ needs
     now, we can open them up to the reality and promise of eternal life.

      How do you treat those less fortunate than you? When is the last
      time you did something for someone purely out of selfless com-
      passion and concern?

      Do Not Be Afraid of Them
         Much of Jesus’ address to His disciples is devoted to advice on how
      to deal with problems they will encounter. The message they pro-
      claim, although it is about love and right living, will encounter oppo-
      sition in certain places. In fact, said Jesus, they should be prepared for
      persecution.

Read Matthew 10:22 and Hebrews 10:35, 36. What is the crucial mes-
      sage to us in these texts?


        Jesus’ reference to perseverance is in the context of persecution.
      The apostle Paul says, “We know that suffering produces persever-
      ance; perseverance, character; and character, hope” (Rom. 5:3, 4,
      NIV). Likewise, James writes, “The testing of your faith develops per-
      severance” (James 1:3, NIV).

In what ways can difficult times test your faith? How can you strengthen
      your spiritual life so that you will persevere in your faith through
      these times?


        Jesus tells His disciples that they should not fear the difficult cir-
      cumstances they will encounter. They will be brought before gover-
      nors and kings to be His witnesses.
        “ ‘But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how
      to say it,’ ” He says (Matt. 10:19, NIV). He promises that God will
      speak through them and give them the words to speak.
        The book of Acts provides plenty of examples of what Jesus warned
      about. Peter and Paul and many others were taken constantly before
      the authorities to give an account of their actions. Each time they
      spoke boldly of their faith. Jesus reassures the disciples that God cares
      even for sparrows and that He has numbered “ ‘the very hairs of your
      head. . . . So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows’ ”
      (Matt. 10:30, 31, NIV).

       Read Matthew 10:38, 39. What is Jesus promising us? What is
       He not promising us? What comfort can you draw for yourself
       from these words?

         earth. They will do all in their power to aid the great adversary in mak-
         ing it as hard as possible for the servants of Christ, just as the people
         did with Christ when He was upon the earth. They will scourge with
1
         the tongue of slander and falsehood. They will criticize, and turn
         against the servant of God the very efforts he is leading them to make.
         They will, with their evil surmisings, see fraud and dishonesty where
         all is right and where perfect integrity exists. They lay selfish motives
         to the charge of God’s servants, when He Himself is leading them, and
         when they would give even their lives if God required, if by so doing
2
         they could advance His cause.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the
         Church, vol. 4, p. 234.


    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In what ways does our mission field today differ from the one
          Jesus’ disciples went into? What are the similarities?

3         ●
          2 As a class, talk about what it means to be living in the “king-
          dom of heaven” now. What, if anything, do we have to show for it;
          that is, if someone were to look at us as a whole, what would they
          see that is different than what they would see in any other volun-
          tary organization working together for a common cause?

          ●3 How involved are you and your local church in evangelism, in
          witnessing? How are you working to relieve the suffering of those
          around you? How can your local church do better in that area?
          Why is that aspect of our work so crucial? Why, though, is minis-
          tering to the physical needs of those around us not enough? At
          the same time, what happens when we emphasize preaching and
          ignore the social dimension of the gospel?

    Summary: The greatest Teacher the world has ever seen took time to
         give specific instructions to His disciples before He sent them out into
         their mission field. The principles He outlined to them are timeless,
         and we must not ignore them today.

Homes of Hope: Part 1
by LESLEY DAVIDSON
    Two years ago I met Robin, an outgoing, witty, and friendly woman. She
had come to my church, she said, “for the company.” She was lonely and
wanted an outlet. But she made it clear that she didn’t believe what
Adventists teach. This might have intimidated me, except our church in
Australia had begun a new program called “Homes of Hope.” And Robin
fit right into this program. I decided to prayerfully make Robin my Homes
of Hope project.
    Homes of Hope is a program designed to help church members befriend
visitors and those in the community who are searching for something bet-
ter. Jesus befriended people before He taught them, and we were trying to
follow His pattern when we inaugurated Homes of Hope. It seemed easy
to just be friends and answer questions if they came up.
    I invited Robin to tea to get acquainted. We talked for two hours. She
shared her troubled past, her pain, and the issues she was dealing with.
Several times she reminded me that she was not attending church because
she believed but because she wanted company. That was fine with me. She
was welcome to come. Because I did not have to try to “save” her, I was
free to be Robin’s friend, to love her for Jesus, to encourage her to taste
and see that God was for real.
    Soon Robin and I were spending hours talking by phone and visiting.
We shared so much, and I found in her a real friend.
     Robin enjoyed church and wanted more to do, so I introduced her to
Adventurers. She adored the children and often brought them treats or vis-
ited them during the week.
    Then Robin began feeling tired. She decided to visit a health spa, hop-
ing that the mineral baths would help her feel better. I went along, looking
forward to four days alone with my friend, sharing my faith without inter-
ruption.
    By the end of the second day she began asking questions, hard ques-
tions. She told me she believed in reincarnation. How can I answer that
one, God? I prayed silently. And God gave me the words to say to her.
Before I realized it, I was quoting scripture and explaining theology that I
had never uttered before. To my amazement, she understood and accepted
it.
    (Continued next week)



LESLEY DAVIDSON met Robin in the Central Coast Community Church in Wyong, New South
Wales, Australia. She now lives in Kariong, New South Wales.

          LESSON            6       *August 2–8


      The Compassionate
      Savior


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: John 1:14, John 3, John
      4; 9:1–7, Eph. 4:32, 1 John 2:12.

Memory Text: “When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on
      them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without
      a shepherd” (Matthew 9:36, NIV).

Key Thought: Jesus ever ministered to the needs of the people.
      What can we take away from His example that can help us do the
      same?

             hese lines from “The New Colossus,” by poet Emma Lazarus,

      T      sit on the bottom of the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired,
             your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Her
      words echo the ministry of Jesus, who said, “Come unto me, all ye that
      labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
      upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye
      shall find rest unto your souls” (Matt. 11:28, 29).
         Compassion motivated every aspect of Christ’s ministry. He minis-
      tered to all types of people, regardless of their social class, gender, or
      race. He demonstrated unconditional love and forgiveness in His life
      and, most powerfully, in His death on the cross, paying in Himself the
      penalty for our sins.
         This week we will look more at Jesus and how He ministered, learn-
      ing what we can that will help us as we minster, as well.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, August 9.

      Reaching the Masses
Read Matthew 4:25 and Luke 6:17. What two specific points do the
      texts make about how people responded to Jesus’ ministry? Also,
      what do those points tell us about the effectiveness of Christ’s
      ministry?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        There was no mass transit back then; no one jumped on a plane, in
      a car, or even on a bicycle to come and see Jesus. Travel back then
      was, in contrast to our day, painfully slow and exceedingly treacher-
      ous. Nonetheless, that did not stop “a great multitude” from coming
      to hear Jesus.

What do the following texts tell us about the motives of some of those
      who came to hear Jesus? Mark 5:25–29, 6:15, John 12:9.

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The crowds who followed Jesus had mixed motives. Some had
      heard that He had the words of life that He spoke with authority, and
      they hungered after spiritual food. Others were looking for physical
      healing for themselves or for friends or family. Some wanted to see for
      themselves if He was the promised One who would liberate them from
      Roman rule. Still others were mere curiosity seekers. One time the
      crowd was so large and pressing against Him that He had to get into a
      boat and teach them from a distance (Matt. 13:2). The crowds grew so
      big that the Pharisees commented, “ ‘Look how the whole world has
      gone after him!’ ” (John 12:19, NIV).

       Write out a paragraph answering this question, What is my
       motive for following Jesus? Bring your answer to class on
       Sabbath.



                                                                         47

     The Personal Touch
       People were attracted to Jesus. Mark says they listened to him “with
     delight” (Mark 12:37, NIV) and were “amazed at his teaching” (Mark
     1:22, 11:18, NIV). He often spoke and ministered to large crowds.
     There was, however, another whole aspect of Christ’s ministry.

Look up the following texts. What is the one thing they all have in
     common? What important message does this send to us regarding
     ministry? John 3, 4, 9:1–7.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The foundation of Jesus’ ministry was personal contact. “He went
     journeying from town to town and village to village, proclaiming the
     good news of the kingdom of God” (Luke 8:1, NEB).
       Within decades His message had spread throughout the then-known
     world. But it happened for one reason—the Master’s hand had per-
     sonally touched lives, and those lives, particularly His 12 disciples,
     went on to touch others personally.
       The 12 disciples had seen Jesus interact with people. They had seen
     the way He spoke words of comfort and encouragement to those who
     were “harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd” (Matt.
     9:36, NIV). They heard Jesus say, “ ‘Come to me, all you who are
     weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you
     and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will
     find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light’ ”
     (Matt. 11:28–30, NIV).
       What more attractive message could there be for people today who
     are stressed, burned out, and looking for comfort and peace?

      Why is the personal touch so important? How have you been
      blessed by those taking time to minister to you, personally, one
      on one? Think about ways you can use your gifts and time to
      minister directly, one on one, to the needs of someone else.

      Forgiveness
        Compassion drove everything Jesus said and did. Note how often
      the Gospel writers say He was “filled with compassion” or “had com-
      passion.” Sometimes this meant strongly condemning sin. At times
      Jesus did speak harshly to the religious leaders, but He always did it
      in love.
        And central to that expression of compassion was forgiveness. So
      often Jesus taught and revealed forgiveness. Considering the essence
      of Christian theology, that we are sinners in need of God’s forgiveness,
      no wonder it is such a powerful theme in Jesus’ life and teachings.

What do these texts reveal to us about forgiveness? Matt. 18:21, 22;
      Luke 23:34; John 8:1–11; Eph. 4:32; 1 John 2:12.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus often likens His grace to being forgiven a great debt. Imagine
      you owed someone one million dollars, and they canceled the debt.
      Imagine how you would feel. That is what God’s grace is like. And the
      reason that debt has been canceled is that Jesus, Himself, paid it for us.
        Also, again and again, Jesus taught that those who have been for-
      given must forgive others. An unforgiving Christian is a contradiction
      in terms. Think of the parable of the ungrateful servant (Matt.
      18:21–34), the story of Mary and Simon the Pharisee (Luke 7:36–50),
      and even the Lord’s Prayer—“ ‘Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive
      everyone who sins against us’ ” (Luke 11:4, NIV). When we consider
      what happened at the Cross, and what it cost God in order to be able
      to justly forgive us our sins, it is not that hard to understand why such
      an emphasis is placed on our learning to forgive others. Think about
      our world and how different a place it would be if we learned how to
      forgive others. Think about the difference, not only in world politics
      but in our own personal relations, our families, our homes, etc.

       How much resentment, anger, and bitterness resides in you
       because you still refuse to forgive? How can you better learn to
       forgive those who have done you wrong?



                                                                            49

      God With Us
Read John 1:14. What are the amazing implications of that text? What
      does it tell us about the character of God? Think about the size and
      complexity of the universe as you contemplate your answer.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         In the 1700s and the 1800s, an idea arose, an outgrowth of the sci-
      entific revolution, called deism. Though it taught that God created us,
      this God—far from being involved in our everyday lives—has left us
      on our own, basically to fend for ourselves. According to this view, the
      world was like a clock that God wound up and then left. God created
      His natural laws, and we here have to live within those laws the best
      we can. It is like a parent who raises a child until that child is 18 and
      then says, “OK, Sonny, you’re on your own. I’ll never see you again.
      Good luck.”
         But that god is not the God of the Bible, that is not Jesus Christ, who
      became one of us, who lived among us, who took upon Himself our
      humanity and in that humanity died for our sins, the God depicted in
      John 1:14.
         The Greek word translated “dwelt,” skenoo, in John 1:14 means to
      “pitch one’s tent” or “live in a tent.” When Jesus came to this world,
      He did not live at a distance from the people to whom He minis-
      tered. He “pitched His tent” among them, living and working
      among them—relating to them at their level.
         Matthew quotes Isaiah’s prophecy about a virgin giving birth to a
      son named Immanuel and directly applies it to Jesus. He even trans-
      lates the meaning of Immanuel—“God with us” (Matt. 1:23).
         Besides coming to die as a substitute for us, Jesus came to earth to
      show us exactly what God is like. On one occasion Philip asked Jesus,
      “ ‘Show us the Father.’ ”

       How did Jesus respond to Philip’s request (John 14:8–11)?
       What does Jesus’ answer tell us about what God is like? What
       aspects of that character come through very clearly? Are there
       some that you find disturbing? If so, what are they? Bring your
       concerns, if any, to class.

      Speaking in Parables
        Jesus knew how to communicate with people. His speech was
      aimed at their level. He did not use deep philosophical and theologi-
      cal language, although He spoke the most profound truth. He spoke in
      simple, practical terms that everyone could understand. He spoke of
      things that people could apply to their lives.
        Jesus illustrated His teaching with objects from nature and common
      household items. He spoke about coins (Luke 15:8–10); farmers sow-
      ing seed (Mark 4:26–29); yeast and flour (Matt. 13:33); sheep (Matt.
      18:12–14); fig trees (Mark 13:28–32)—and numerous other items to
      which the people could relate.

Pick a few of the parables listed above. Read them. What point was
      Jesus making in each case? Why were those images so appropri-
      ate? Ask yourself this: Were Jesus walking among us today, in the
      flesh, what images might He have used to make those same
      points?


        As you read those parables, perhaps you noticed something about
      them, and that was how most, if not all, of those images would be just
      as appropriate today. That is, there was a timelessness, a universality,
      of those images that in a way paralleled the timelessness of His mes-
      sage.

How does that fact help us understand why, perhaps, Jesus used those
      specific images?


         Matthew records several mini-parables Jesus used to try to describe
      what the kingdom of heaven is like. He said that the kingdom of heaven
      is like “a grain of mustard seed” (Matt. 13:31); “leaven” (vs. 33);
      “treasure hid in a field” (vs. 44); “a merchant man, seeking goodly
      pearls” (vs. 45); “a net” (vs. 47); “a man that is an householder, which
      bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old” (vs. 52); “a man
      that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
      labourers into his vineyard” (Matt. 20:1); “a certain king, which made
      a marriage for his son” (Matt. 22:2).

       Which one of those images works best for you? Why would
       Jesus use so many different images to make the same point?
       What message could the Lord be sending us through this delib-
       erate use of different images that could help us learn how to wit-
       ness to others?


                                                                          51

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Go Teach All Nations,”
         pp. 818–828, in The Desire of Ages.

            “In all true teaching the personal element is essential. Christ in His
         teaching dealt with men individually. It was by personal contact and
1
         association that He trained the Twelve. It was in private, often to but
         one listener, that He gave His most precious instruction. To the hon-
         ored rabbi at the night conference on the Mount of Olives, to the
         despised woman at the well of Sychar, He opened His richest treas-
         ures; for in these hearers He discerned the impressible heart, the open
         mind, the receptive spirit. Even the crowd that so often thronged His
2
         steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate mass of human beings. He
         spoke directly to every mind and appealed to every heart. He watched
         the faces of His hearers, marked the lighting up of the countenance,
         the quick, responsive glance, which told that truth had reached the
         soul; and there vibrated in His heart the answering chord of sympa-
         thetic joy.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 231.

    Discussion Questions:
3         ●1 Since 1983, the majority of new Adventist congregations around
          the world have been established by Global Mission pioneers (for
          more information, visit http://www.adventistmission.org). These
          Adventist lay people live among the people to whom they are
          ministering at the same socioeconomic level. Why do you think
          they have had so much success?

          ●
          2 As a class, discuss your answers to the questions at the end of
          Sunday’s and Wednesday’s lessons.

          ●3 As we saw, it was the personal touch that was so central to
          Jesus’ ministry. In what ways did someone’s personal touch influ-
          ence you to accept Jesus? Share your stories and then ask your-
          selves, How can we as a local church work better to minister to
          people’s needs on a personal level?

          ●
          4 Because of Jesus’ example of love and acceptance, should we
          accept anybody to worship in our church—no matter what their
          lifestyle?

    Summary: Jesus, the compassionate Savior, hated sin and loved sin-
         ners. His method of ministering to people in crowds and individually
         should be the model for our witness today. Because of the salvation
         we have received through Him, we can extend His love and forgive-
         ness to others.

Homes of Hope: Part 2
by LESLEY DAVIDSON
   Robin and I spent our time at the spa talking about issues that interested
her. God is so wonderful. He cemented our friendship and drew Robin into
His circle of friendship at the same time.
   Robin continued to attend church, continued to grow and ask lots of
questions. When I couldn’t answer her questions, my husband did. By this
time Robin was a part of our family.
   We invited Robin to camp meeting, where she spent ten days growing
in God’s love and being loved by other Christians. By the time we returned
home, Robin was hooked on God. She believed, and she accepted Jesus
Christ as her Savior. But she wasn’t interested in being baptized.
   Then Robin was diagnosed with cancer. She had battled cancer two
years earlier, had undergone surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy,
alone. I was determined that this time she would not be alone. I went to
her doctor’s appointments with her and to every test and appointment after
that. She was given just months to live.
   Robin grew weaker before our eyes and was in constant pain. She lost
her ability to walk. We all knew that she was deteriorating fast. Before
long she was seeing double and couldn’t read. I read to her a lot. She loved
the book of James, and we read it often.
   The pastor anointed Robin, and her spirit soared, even as her body grew
weaker by the day. She asked to be baptized. But she was growing weaker
and was hospitalized. We knew Robin had just days to live. But in spite of
her weakening body, she was determined to be baptized.
   The pastor arranged for a baptism in a hospital bathtub. Her church
friends gathered to witness the beautiful ceremony. Robin, though in pain,
was fully alert and had a peaceful countenance during the ceremony. She
glowed when she received her baptismal certificate, but the rest of us
cried.
   Three days later Robin fell asleep in Jesus. Her last words were, “I am
saved, I am forgiven.”
   If it had not been for Homes of Hope to give me the kick I needed, I
might never have gotten to know my wonderful friend Robin, and she
might never have met the Savior who wanted to be her best Friend. God
gave me the words to nurture her, and my church family loved her and
gave her the affirmation she so desperately needed. I can’t wait to see
Robin again, to talk for eternity about our wonderful Lord.

          LESSON             7       *August 9–15



      The Apostle John




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 8:21, 22; Mark 10:
      35–45; 1 John; 2 John; 3 John.

Memory Text: “I have no greater joy than to hear that my chil-
      dren are walking in the truth” (3 John 4, NIV).

Key Thought: The apostle John is one of the most loved charac-
      ters from the Bible. What can we learn from him?

                church tradition describes the apostle John as an old man living

      A         in Ephesus. Because of his feeble condition, his followers had to
                carry him to church. As they met together, his only spoken words
      were, “Little children, love one another.”
         His followers tired of hearing John repeat the same thing all the time
      and asked, “Master, why do you always say this?”
         “It is the Lord’s command,” he replied. “And if this alone be done, it is
      enough!”
         Whether true or not, this story captures the essence of this “son of
      thunder” who was eventually transformed into a “son of love and grace.”
         In John’s three epistles, or letters, we see the heart of a man whose life
      is motivated by love; we see also some of the most encouraging verses
      in the Bible, one of the most famous is “My dear children, I write this to
      you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who
      speaks to the Father in our defense—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One”
      (1 John 2:1, NIV).
         This week we will explore further the life and mission of this pillar of
      the early Christian church.

     A Special Calling

       When Jesus called John and his brother James to follow Him, they
     were working in their boat fishing. “And straightway he called them:
     and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants,
     and went after him” (Mark 1:20).

Read carefully Mark 1:20 again. What important principles can we
     take from there about what it means to follow Jesus? See also Matt.
     8:21, 22; Luke 14:26; Phil. 3:8.


       John’s decision to follow Jesus and leave his father’s business would
     forever change his life. Luke gives the most detailed account of Jesus’
     call (Luke 5:1–11).

What verse in Luke 5:1–11 again conveys what it means to be a fol-
     lower of Jesus? What, again, is the point that is being made?


        No question, those who follow Jesus need to make a full and com-
     plete commitment. Jesus, as Lord of all, is owed all. Yet, He does not
     demand our hearts out of selfishness; no, not at all. Instead, He knows
     the reality of the battle that we are in, and if there is any opening, any
     area of self not surrendered, the evil one will take advantage and use
     it to try to destroy us. Thus, we need to surrender completely to the
     Lord.
        Which John did. And thus, instead of catching fish, John spent the
     rest of his life catching people for the kingdom of heaven. From now
     on, John’s mission field was the world—to carry hope and healing and
     the good news to those who desperately needed it. Though he would
     have some hard lessons to learn, because he was dedicated to Jesus,
     he was in a position to learn them, no matter the pain that would come.

      How committed are you to Jesus? Have you forsaken all for
      Him? How can you know where your heart truly is? What
      changes might you need to make?




                                                                           57

     Son of Thunder
       Jesus gave John and his brother James a special nickname—“the
     sons of thunder” (or Boanerges in Aramaic). Evidence suggests that
     this name referred to their disposition—a disposition that Jesus gently
     corrects.

Read Mark 10:35–45. What request do James and John make? How
     does Jesus respond to their request? What does this tell us about
     the character of both these men?


       John and his brother also showed an unhealthy pride. In response to
     their request, Jesus asked if they could share His fate. “We can,” they
     boasted (Mark 10:39).
       On another occasion Jesus and His disciples were traveling from
     Galilee to Jerusalem. As appears to have been His normal habit, Jesus
     went directly through Samaria rather than circumnavigating in order
     to avoid the hated Samaritans. He sent James and John ahead to find
     lodging for the night. They approached one village, but when the peo-
     ple learned they were headed for Jerusalem, they showed no hos-
     pitality.

What does their response to this indignity also reveal about their
     character? How much does the beloved John have to learn? Luke
     9:54.


       What a contrast we can see in the John depicted here in these
     accounts and the one who writes the letters he does later. What a
     changed man; what a changed personality! No doubt, though, the
     change did not happen easily or overnight. John had some hard les-
     sons to learn that enabled him to become the great missionary that he
     eventually became.

      Recount some of your most recent hard lessons. What did you
      learn? What other ways could you have learned what you did
      other than through suffering? What other lessons do you need
      to learn? What changes do you need to make in your life now
      that, perhaps, could spare you from having to learn them the
      hard way?

     The Witness of John
       As an eyewitness who had spent much time in Jesus’ company, John
     had much to tell; more, in fact, than he could.

Read John 21:25. What message do you think John was seeking to
     convey by that statement? What hope can we find in that text?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Though not able to tell us everything, John, under the guidance of
     the Holy Spirit, does teach us one of the most important of all truths,
     that Jesus Christ came in human flesh. That truth is something that all
     the philosophy, science, and logic could never lead us 10. Instead, God
     uses John to tell it to us.
       In the first verse of his Gospel, John refers to the Word, or in Greek,
     the logos. To the Jewish reader, the Word referred to the Word of God
     that created the world, as well as to His teachings, or law, that guides
     the way we should live our lives (see Deut. 32:45–47).
       For the Greek reader, logos had other meanings. The logos was a life
     force that kept the universe together. The symmetry of a leaf, the har-
     mony of the seasons, the stars in the sky—all were kept in balance by
     the logos. The philosophers Heracleitus, Plutarch, Philo, and Plato, as
     well as various stoic philosophers, wrote about the logos.
       For both Jewish and Greek readers, John makes a startling claim:
     This Logos is a person. The Logos became flesh and broke into human
     history in a specific place at a specific time with a specific purpose—
     to bring salvation to humanity.

Read John 1:1–3, 14. What does this mean? In your own words, write
     out your best understanding of what the Lord is revealing to us
     here.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus, our Creator, entered into humanity and became a human
     being. That alone is amazing; add to it the reason He came, to die for
     our sins, and we are given a revelation of the character of God that
     should bring us to our knees in gratefulness, faith, and humble obedi-
     ence.


                                                                          59

      Life-Giver
        “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the
      Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in
      his name” (John 20:31, NIV).

        In these words John summarizes the reason he wrote his Gospel,
      and the entire purpose of his life—to lead people to believe in Jesus
      in order that they might gain eternal life. A key theme, all through the
      New Testament, is that eternal life exists only in Jesus.

Look up the following verses to see some of the things John says about
      this key theme, that of “life.” Also, as you read them, where can
      you see how the idea of “life” applies not only to eternal life but
      has immediate implications for life now?

         What makes these promises of eternal life so important is that,
      although all creatures on earth die, human beings alone are capable of
      contemplating the idea of eternity. We alone can grasp the vast gap
      between our short existence and the prospect of eternity, and the cold
      reality of that gap hangs over us every instant of our lives—lives that
      are just a clogged artery, a drunken driver, or an AIDS virus away
      from ending.
         What a wonderful hope we have, then, to know that death is not the
      end; on the contrary, it is just a sleep that to us will seem like a sec-
      ond, and the next thing we know we will be with Jesus, for eternity.

       How should the hope of eternal life impact how we live now? In
       what ways do you live this life differently, knowing that you have
       the promise of eternal life?

     Spending Time With Jesus
      “Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
     He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen
     God” (3 John 11).

What does John mean about those who had not seen God? What is
     his point? How does one see God?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        John had much to learn from Jesus. Even after spending time in His
     compassionate presence, John was still protective of his own turf and
     intolerant of others. On one occasion he stopped someone from cast-
     ing out demons in Jesus’ name because he was not an official disciple
     (Mark 9:38). Jesus gently taught him that “ ‘whoever is not against us
     is for us’ ” (vs. 40, NIV).
        John grew in strength of character at the Master’s side. At the time
     of Jesus’ crucifixion, when other disciples had fled, John alone
     remained at the foot of the cross. The regard Jesus held for John is
     shown in the way He entrusted His mother into John’s care (John
     19:26, 27).

Read 2 Corinthians 3:18. What important principle is found there?
     What practical ways can we apply this principle to our own lives?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       If you read the epistles of John, you cannot help noting the kind-
     ness, the gentleness, the compassion found all through them. What a
     profound difference from the John presented in the Gospels. Truly
     something utterly remarkable happened to that man. We, of course,
     know what it was: He had been with Jesus, and his life and character
     had been radically altered from the experience.

      Skim through the three epistles of 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John.
      Look at the character revealed there. How did Jesus change
      John’s life? What aspects of your own life could use change, as
      well? What practical steps are you taking in order to allow God
      to bring those changes?


                                                                        61

    Further      Study: Read Ellen G. White, “John the Beloved,”
         pp. 539–545, in The Acts of the Apostles.

            “In the terrible persecution that followed, the apostle John did much
         to confirm and strengthen the faith of the believers. He bore a testi-
         mony which his adversaries could not controvert and which helped his
         brethren to meet with courage and loyalty the trials that came upon
         them. When the faith of the Christians would seem to waver under the
         fierce opposition they were forced to meet, the old, tried servant of
1        Jesus would repeat with power and eloquence the story of the cruci-
         fied and risen Saviour.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles,
          p. 568.
              “John lived to be very old. He witnessed the destruction of
         Jerusalem and the ruin of the stately temple. The last survivor of the
         disciples who had been intimately connected with the Saviour, his
2        message had great influence in setting forth the fact that Jesus was the
         Messiah, the Redeemer of the world. No one could doubt his sincer-
         ity, and through his teachings many were led to turn from unbelief.”
         —Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 569.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Go through the three epistles of John again. What other ele-
          ments of John’s character can be found there? What strong
3         words can you find there for those who are not following truth?
          How does this help us understand what love is all about?

          ●
          2 What is your understanding of the idea of character develop-
          ment? How does it work? How does Jesus change our charac-
          ters? Though the Bible does relate many supernatural events, is
          there any event in which a person’s character is changed imme-
          diately, supernaturally, in the same way the blind were given sight
          or the lepers cured? If not, why not? What does the answer tell
          us about the process of character development?

          ●3 As a class, talk about the answers to these questions: How lov-
          ing and accepting is your local church? What things can you do
          to help your church become more loving and accepting of others?

    Summary: Having experienced firsthand the life-giving love of his
         Savior, the apostle John let that experience flow into all his words and
         actions. His life and writings remind us of the primacy of love in the
         Christian life and how it must be the basis of all our mission activity.

Midnight Cry in Malawi
by MIKE NYONDO
   A group of lay men and women in northern Malawi have a passion for
souls. Although they lack equipment and supplies, they are making an
impact on unreached areas of Malawi.
   In one prison where they serve, they held evangelistic meetings, baptiz-
ing 100 prisoners. Among those who responded was Samson, a robber.
Some prisoners doubted his sincerity, for he had attended only a few of the
meetings. But Samson testified, “Even though I did not attend the meet-
ings, I listened from my cell. I heard God’s voice calling me, and I have
answered.”
   Several of the newly baptized prisoners have been released and live in
northern Malawi, where they faithfully attend church. The lay evangelists
continue to work in the prison and have held subsequent baptisms.
   Few Adventists live along the shores of Lake Malawi, an area dominated
by another Protestant denomination. When Midnight Cry held meetings
there, opposition was strong, and few came the first week. But then atten-
dance picked up.
   When 16-year-old Viyezgo (vee-AY-joh) responded to the first altar call,
his parents were angry and locked him out of the house. He was forced to
sleep outside. But he kept coming to the meetings. His parents tried to
send him to stay with his aunt in Lilongwe, but on his way to the bus sta-
tion, he met his aunt, who was coming to visit the family. He walked home
with her then hurried to Lake Malawi to be baptized. When he returned
home that evening, his parents again locked him out of the house. They
sent him to Lilongwe with his aunt, where he attends the Adventist church.
   The group is energized as they see God working through them. God
invites every believer to become a lay evangelist and share His love in
                             their corner of the world.




                                 MIKE NYONDO (left), leader of the Midnight Cry, is a

          LESSON            8      *August 16–22


      From Folly to Faith:
      The Apostle Peter




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 2:14–40, Acts 3,
      5:1–11, 1 Peter, 2 Peter.

Memory Text: “Simon Peter answered him, ‘Lord, to whom shall
      we go? You have the words of eternal life’ ” (John 6:68, NIV).

Key Thought: The apostle Peter was one of the central pillars of
      the early church. Jesus changed Peter from an unreliable but pas-
      sionate disciple into a rocklike tower of strength in sharing the
      gospel.

             eter’s impulsive, emotional character has made him an interest-

      P      ing study. He was a disciple whose heart was in the right place
             but who made many mistakes.
        Peter’s story especially helps us understand the role of emotions in
      the Christian life. When you are lost in a forest, your senses can take
      you only so far. You can see, hear, and smell—and still be lost. You
      need a compass and a map, something more than what you have nat-
      urally.
        So it is in our spiritual lives. What we feel is not the final test of
      what is truth. We need something more—something outside of us. We
      need a spiritual compass and map. Emotions are a vital part of the
      Christian life but not the most important part. Without appropriate
      care, they even can be dangerous. Peter was someone whose emotions
      got him into trouble more often than not. However, once placed under
      submission to Jesus, his emotions and zeal became powerful tools for
      the Lord’s work.

     The Fisherman
       Peter came from Bethsaida, a fishing village on the northeastern
     coast of the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida, which means House of Fishing,
     was where Jesus later performed many miracles. For nearly two thou-
     sand years, Bethsaida was lost to history. Not until 1987 was the
     archaeological site of this village discovered.
       Although Peter was married (Matt. 8:14), we know nothing about
     his wife or any children he might have had. We do know he was liv-
     ing with his wife and mother-in-law in Capernaum when Jesus called
     him to be His disciple.

Read Matthew 4:18–20. How did Peter respond to Jesus’ call? What
     significance is found in the fact that they “left their nets” (vs. 20)?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The simplicity of this description leaves us to guess what went
     through Peter’s mind. Obviously, something about Jesus was so com-
     pelling that Peter was prepared to leave his home and livelihood to fol-
     low this itinerant Teacher. The point should be obvious to all of us. We
     need to be ready to do the same thing; that is, to follow Jesus no mat-
     ter the personal cost (see Luke 14:26, 27).

Peter came from a humble working-class background. Contrast that
     to Paul’s background. Acts 22:3, Rom. 11:1, Phil. 3:5; see also Acts
     5:34. What point can we take away from this contrast?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Either way, for both Peter and Paul, regardless of their different
     backgrounds, the call of Jesus required total commitment on their
     part. Upper class, working class, it does not matter.

      Recount your own experience when being called by Jesus. What
      did it cost you? What did you have to give up? If someone asked
      you, Was it worth it? how would you respond, and why?




                                                                         65

      Peter’s Folly
        Like the other disciples, Peter had a unique opportunity to learn
      from Jesus. He walked many miles with Him, ate with Him, worked
      with Him. He listened to Jesus speak, watched the way He dealt with
      people, saw Him heal the sick. He witnessed dramatic spectacles—the
      Mount of Transfiguration, where Jesus talked with Moses and Elijah;
      Jesus raising the dead; Jesus arrested; Jesus risen from the grave.
        Peter also had many opportunities for practical learning. Often Peter
      found himself in the middle of experiences that provided life-
      changing object lessons. All these lessons were preparing him for his
      role as one of the great missionaries of the early church.

In the course of his experiences with Jesus, Peter made many mistakes.
      Read the mistakes depicted below. What were they, and what les-
      sons should Peter have learned from them?

         Brash, presumptuous, prone to violence, collapsing under pressure,
      sleeping on the job, Peter on one level appeared to be everything that
      a humble, meek, faithful Christian should not be. And yet, before it
      was all over, Peter became one of the key leaders in the early Christian
      church, a powerful evangelist and missionary for Jesus. What a testi-
      mony to what God can do in a life surrendered to Him.

     Learning From Jesus
Read Matthew 16:13–26. What was the nature of the exchange? Why
     did Peter respond as he did? What basic lesson was Jesus seeking
     to teach the disciples?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Though Peter had declared that Jesus was the Messiah, the Christ,
     he had a false understanding of what that meant. The view Peter and
     the other disciples had of the Messiah reflected the common under-
     standing of the day. The Messiah would come from the line of David
     and would overthrow the Romans and bring justice and peace.
        Yet, Jesus clearly taught the disciples and the crowds that the king-
     dom of God was a spiritual kingdom. They would not establish it by
     power, swords, and daggers but by love, forgiveness, and righteous-
     ness.
        At a pivotal stage of His ministry, Jesus decided to tell the disciples
     about His death—that He would go to Jerusalem, be killed, and rise
     again after three days. Peter was offended by the idea that Jesus was
     going to die—even though this death was to be the central pillar of the
     plan of salvation.
        Within Peter’s worldview, there was no room for this. Peter had left
     his home village and his fishing business to follow Jesus. He had
     given his life to supporting Him and His ministry. The death of his
     Master, therefore, had no place in the scenario Peter had painted in his
     mind. Jesus would set up His kingdom on earth, and Peter would play
     a key role in that kingdom of justice and peace. How could such a
     wonderful movement of righteousness and healing end in the death of
     its Leader? It is almost as if Peter either did not hear or did not under-
     stand Jesus’ promise to rise on the third day.

      Notice the degree of selfishness seen in Peter here. That
      explains, it seems, Christ’s words in Matthew 16:23–26. Read
      those verses again. In what areas of your own life might you
      apply those words?

     The Peter of Acts
       No doubt, much of the Gospels do not paint Peter in a particularly
     great light. He is shown, time and again, floundering, falling, making
     great mistakes. Yet, the Gospels end with a clear indication of the
     bumbling disciple’s future.

Read John 21:14–19. What is Jesus saying to Peter here? Why is that
     so astonishing, considering Peter’s past?

       “Feed my sheep”? That is exactly what Peter eventually comes to
     do. Again, what a powerful testimony to what God can do in the life
     of someone dedicated to Him. The fiery, impetuous Peter now takes a
     key role in the formation of the early church.

Browse through the following texts. What do they tell us about the
     role and work of Peter?

       The transformation was astounding, and the lessons for us should
     be obvious. Through the surrender of himself to Christ, Peter became
     a powerful witness for the Lord. Despite Peter’s numerous mistakes
     and shortcomings, the Lord was still able to use him as a powerful wit-
     ness.

      improvement? Why, no matter how slow the progress seems,
      should you never give up?

      The Peter of the Epistles
         When Jesus told Peter, “Feed my sheep,” no doubt the discouraged
      fisherman had no idea what was coming, or the role he would play in
      the Lord’s church. Though we have seen, in Acts, Peter fulfilling that
      command, we can see it also in the fact that this same Peter was also
      the author of two epistles, his way of “feeding the sheep” not just in
      his own time but for all church history. In a sense, every time we read
      one of his letters, we are seeing another fulfillment of Christ’s words
      to His disciple.

Pick one chapter, any chapter, from either of the epistles of Peter.
      Read it over, pray over it, and try to imagine the character of the
      person writing it. What can you learn about the new Peter from
      what you have read in that chapter?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In some ways it is hard to imagine these deep, eloquent words com-
      ing from the same man seen in the Gospels, the harsh, brash fisher-
      man whose mouth ran faster than his mind or his faith. Yet, this is the
      Peter transformed by God’s grace into what Paul called “a new crea-
      ture” (2 Cor. 5:17).
        Particularly powerful are Peter’s words in 1 Peter 1:18–21 and in
      1 Peter 2:24, in which Peter puts emphasis on the death of Jesus for
      the redemption of our souls. The Peter who once was determined that
      Jesus should never go to the Cross is now the Peter who is proclaim-
      ing the Cross as the means of redemption, as the place where Jesus,
      our Substitute, bore our sins. Notice, too, the wording of 1 Peter
      2:18–23 in which Peter is advocating a kind of pacifism, a turning of
      the cheek that one would not have found in the Peter of the Gospels.
      Truly, the change was remarkable. It should give us all hope, regard-
      less of where we are in our own personal character development.

       Go back over the chapter you picked from one of Peter’s
       epistles. What was the main point? How can you take what this
       shepherd is feeding you and make it your own?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “A Night on the Lake,”
         pp. 377–382, in The Desire of Ages.

            “In his early discipleship Peter thought himself strong. Like the
         Pharisee, in his own estimation he was ‘not as other men are.’ When
         Christ on the eve of His betrayal forewarned His disciples, ‘All ye
         shall be offended because of Me this night,’ Peter confidently
         declared, ‘Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.’ Mark 14:27,
         29. Peter did not know his own danger. Self-confidence misled him.
1
         He thought himself able to withstand temptation; but in a few short
         hours the test came, and with cursing and swearing he denied his
         Lord.
            “When the crowing of the cock reminded him of the words of
         Christ, surprised and shocked at what he had just done he turned and
         looked at his Master. At that moment Christ looked at Peter, and
2
         beneath that grieved look, in which compassion and love for him were
         blended, Peter understood himself. He went out and wept bitterly. That
         look of Christ’s broke his heart. Peter had come to the turning point,
         and bitterly did he repent his sin. He was like the publican in his con-
         trition and repentance, and like the publican he found mercy. The look
         of Christ assured him of pardon.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object
         Lessons, pp. 152–154.

    Discussion Questions:
3
          ●
          1 Go through Peter’s epistles and look for things in there that
          specifically show how different a person he was from the Peter of
          the Gospels. What encouragement can you draw from what you
          find?

          ●
          2 It is easy to criticize Peter’s lack of faith as he sank into the
          water. But Peter was the only disciple who had the courage to get
          out of the boat. What are some of the ways you need to “get out
          of the boat” in your Christian life? What about your own
          church? Does it need to do the same?

          ●3 Ellen G. White writes, “Every true disciple is born into the
          kingdom of God as a missionary.”—The Desire of Ages, p. 195.
          Many followers of Christ lose their early enthusiasm to share
          what they have learned with others. How can church members
          recapture that passion for sharing the good news? How can you
          help each other regain this desire for witnessing?

    Summary: The story of Peter is a tribute to what God can do through
         even the weakest disciple. Jesus harnessed Peter’s passion and good
         intentions and strengthened him in the faith to be a mighty pillar of
         the early Christian church.

God Hater Becomes a God
Lover
by ROSELLE MONTEBON
   Pangilinan, a lay evangelist, and his team of volunteers, held evangelistic
meetings in a rural area in the northern Philippines. Toward the end of the
meetings a number of people asked to prepare for baptism.
   Pangilinan asked his team for a volunteer to stay behind and care for the
new believers, and Roselle agreed to stay. She lived in a room provided by
the village and spent her days visiting the people, holding evening worships,
and teaching a literacy class twice a week. Two young women from the vil-
lage stayed with her to protect her.
   In this village lived a man, Totoy, who hated Adventists and didn’t want
them in the village. When the team left the area, he showed his anger toward
them by sprinkling blood outside the door of Roselle’s room while she slept.
Most of the villagers suspected that Totoy had done this to frighten Roselle
into leaving the village, but they had no proof. Roselle wasn’t frightened by
the demonstration of hatred, and she continued her work in the village.
   Several months later Totoy became ill and was hospitalized with tubercu-
losis. After being released, he asked his physician for the medicine he
needed to continue his recovery. But to his surprise, the doctor refused to
give it to him. “You must go see Pangilinan,” the doctor said. “He will give
you the medicine.” The doctor chose to distribute medicines to tribal people
through trusted local workers, and in Totoy’s area that trusted person was the
Adventist lay evangelist.
   Totoy didn’t want to visit Pangilinan, but he needed the medicine. Finally
he gave in and went to Pangilinan to ask for the medicine. Pangilinan gave
him the medicine and vitamins he needed. Then Totoy went to live with rela-
tives in another village, away from Adventists, he thought.
   But in his new village lived Mar, another lay evangelist. Mar didn’t know
about Totoy’s hatred for Adventists, and when he met Totoy, he invited him
to church. Totoy agreed to go and began attending church regularly. He even
brought his family with him. In time this man who hated God and His peo-
ple surrendered his life to the Savior and asked to be baptized. He testified,
“I hated God, and I hated Adventists. But God did not give up on me. His
great love has saved me.”
   Your mission offerings help support lay evangelists such as Pangilinan,
Roselle, and Mar, who work to bring people to the Savior in difficult and
isolated areas of the world. Thank you.

      A Pillar of Mission:
      The Apostle Peter




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Pss. 18:2, 31; 95:1; Matt.
      16:18; Acts 5:15; 10:25, 28–43; 11:19–26; Gal. 2:11–14.

Memory Text: “When they saw the courage of Peter and John
      and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were
      astonished and they took note that these men had been with
      Jesus” (Acts 4:13, NIV).

Key Thought: Peter, the transformed Peter, became one of the
      greatest missionaries the world has ever seen, even despite some
      lessons he still needed to learn.

             ast week we looked at the amazing transformation of Peter, how

      L      he went from instability to a pillar in the church. How easy it
             would have been, after his disastrous fall, to have written him
      off from the service of the Lord. As we saw, however, that was not
      God’s intention for this flawed hero.
        Indeed, after his restoration, Peter would devote his life to one mis-
      sion: to share spiritual food with Jesus’ flock—both inside and outside
      the sheepfold.
        Last week we also saw what Christ did in Peter’s life to make him
      the great missionary that he became. This week we will look at the
      results of his mission. We will follow some of Peter’s experiences as
      he played a key role in the work of the early church and in helping
      spread the gospel to the Gentiles.
        There are some powerful lessons for us today from the story of
      Peter, both his successes and his failures.

      Peter’s Commission: A Closer Look
         “I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
      will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
      it” (Matt. 16:18).

        These are some of the most controversial words in all of the Bible.
      A lot of Christian history has been based on how people have inter-
      preted the meaning of this text.
        For many, it meant that Jesus built His church on Peter, that he was
      what has been called “the first pope,” and that he, Peter, was the rock
      that Jesus was talking about.
        Others, however, interpret it as Jesus saying, essentially, “You are
      Peter, but on this Rock, Myself, I will build My church.” The evidence,
      as we’ll see below, is strongly in favor of the latter.

Look up the following texts. How do they help us understand what the
      rock is that Jesus is talking about here? Deut. 32:4; Pss. 18:2, 31;
      95:1; 1 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:6.

        No matter how privileged Peter was, no matter his gifts, no matter
      the importance of his role, God’s church has never been built upon a
      sinful human being. Heaven forbid! Jesus Himself is the Rock, the
      foundation upon which His church rests. All of us, including Peter,
      whatever our role and position, are secure as long as we rest on that
      foundation, that Rock, and we can do that only to the extent that we
      are surrendered in faith and obedience (see Matt. 7:24) to the words
      and command of our Lord. Sure, the Lord knew the future of Peter and
      knew what Peter would become, but He certainly was not going to
      make Peter, a sinful, fallen human being, the foundation rock of His
      church.

       What should Christ’s words tell us about the importance of
       humility in our lives and especially in our work for the salvation
       of others? Why, whatever our gifts, are they nothing if not sur-
       rendered to the Lord?

     The Shadow of Peter
        It appears that immediately after Jesus returned to heaven, Peter took
     the role of leader among the believers, about 120 people. In the book
     of Acts he is usually named first in lists of the apostles, and he led the
     believers in choosing an apostle to replace Judas. As we saw last week,
     however, it is not until after Pentecost, when he stands up and preaches
     powerfully to the crowd, that we fully see the amazing transformation
     in Peter’s life (Acts 2:14–41). As a result of the Holy Spirit’s working
     through his preaching, 3,000 people accept Jesus and are baptized.
        The next time we see Peter, he is walking up with his fellow apos-
     tle and longtime friend John to the temple to pray. Peter then performs
     the first healing miracle recorded in Acts, as he heals a man crippled
     from birth (Acts 3:6–8).

Compare Acts 3:6, 12, 13; 4:10. What common theme runs through
     Peter’s words?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Peter had a long and bitter experience of trying to do things in his
     own strength. He would never forget sinking into the dark waters after
     he took his eyes off Jesus. He would never forget betraying his Master
     after His arrest. He would never forget Jesus rebuking him for trying
     to do things his own way. Peter, apparently having learned his lessons,
     was leaning on the power of the Lord. He would need 10.

Read Acts 5:15, 10:25. What was going on in these two accounts?
     What kind of incredible pressure was being placed on Peter here?
     What great danger would he, or anyone, face in that situation?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       People wanting only to have “the shadow of Peter” touch them? In
     many ways now, Peter, filled with power from on high, would face his
     greatest spiritual challenges.

      What would it do to you if people responded to you the way they
      did to Peter? What is the only way you could keep yourself from
      spiritual pride of the most damaging kind?

     Organizing the Early Church
        In the early stages of the Christian church, the new believers shared
     their possessions and goods, met together daily for worship, and
     enjoyed fellowship together. They were “praising God and enjoying
     the favor of all the people” (Acts 2:47, NIV). Things were going well
     under the leadership of the apostles.
        But, as the church grew, problems arose. It became clear that the
     church needed an organizational structure. Peter and the other apos-
     tles realized there had to be a proper balance between maintenance
     work and their main mission. They decided: “It would not be right for
     us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on
     tables” (Acts 6:2, NIV).
        As new congregations were formed in new areas, proper church
     organization became even more critical. It was vital to ensure that the
     believers were properly established and nurtured in their new faith.
        The Jerusalem church began sending missionaries in groups of two
     (following the example of Jesus when He sent out the apostles and the
     disciples two by two).

What did the leaders in Jerusalem do when they heard about the new
     group of believers in Samaria that Philip had established? Acts
     8:14. Or when a new church was founded in Antioch? Acts
     11:19–26. What is the significance of these actions?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Throughout the book of Acts, we see Peter and the other church
     leaders in Jerusalem keeping a close administrative and spiritual eye
     on the rapid growth of the church, particularly among the Gentiles.
     They realized how easy it would be for them to slip back into pagan-
     ism or to be led astray by false doctrines. Having come to Jesus as
     babes in the faith, these new believers needed to be weaned from the
     “milk” of the Word and firmly planted in solid doctrine.

      What more could you do to help new members be better
      grounded in Jesus and our message? Why not take a new mem-
      ber under your wing and help him or her along?

     A Wider Vision
       After Pentecost, Peter’s life was transformed, and he became a
     mighty pillar of the church. But there still was more for him to learn.
     Like the other apostles, Peter still saw his mission as exclusively to the
     Jews.

Read Acts 1:8. What was Jesus saying that should have helped Peter
     and others understand that things were not going to be quite what
     they expected, at least in terms of mission?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In Acts 10:1–14, Peter was given a vision in which he was told to
     eat unclean foods. As a Jew, he was astounded at what was told him.
     “ ‘Surely not, Lord!’ ” Peter replied.
        “ ‘I have never eaten anything impure or unclean’ ” (Acts 10:14,
     NIV). It would be the same as a Seventh-day Adventist being told in
     vision to smoke a cigarette and drink from a bottle of alcohol.
        Of course, God was not literally telling Peter to eat unclean foods—
     just as He would not ask us to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. Peter’s
     vision was a parable. At first he wondered about the meaning (vs. 17),
     but soon it became apparent as he was invited to the house of
     Cornelius, a Gentile.

Read Acts 10:28–43. What was the real meaning of the vision? What
     did Peter now understand that he did not before?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       For us today, it is obvious that the gospel was a message for the
     whole world, but it must have been quite a surprise for someone like
     Peter, coming out of the background that he did. How important that,
     whatever our position in the church, we not let our cultural prejudices
     put blinders on us. How important that, as with Peter, we get a wider
     vision of the mission of our church.

      What are some personal or cultural blinders that you have had
      to deal with? Or, perhaps, that many in your church still do?
      How can you get a wider vision?

     Growing in Grace
        Even when church members in Christ are working together for the
     same mission, misunderstandings and disagreements can arise. The
     early Christian church was no exception.
        Nor was Peter. However singularly blessed of God, however crucial
     to the work of the church, even Peter, after Pentecost, still had some
     growing to do. How nice to know that even with his faults, God was
     still using him.

Read Galatians 2:11–14. What did Peter still not understand?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Paul was upset because he believed that Peter was acting like a hypo-
     crite. After Peter’s vision about unclean foods and his encounter with
     Cornelius, he had begun associating with Gentiles. For this he was
     criticized by the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem (Acts 11:2). Peter
     defended his actions, and as a result, his critics changed their minds.
     “They had no further objections and praised God, saying, ‘So then,
     God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life’ ” (vs. 18,
     NIV).
       But now, to Paul’s disgust, after having achieved so much on behalf
     of the Gentiles, Peter was reversing his behavior. He was now bowing
     to pressure from Jewish Christians and going against his convictions.
     He was now refusing to eat with Gentiles, because he did not want to
     offend the Jewish Christians. Paul, though, was offended by Peter’s
     actions, even though in another place he warned about a stronger
     brother being an offense to a weaker one (1 Cor. 8:9–14).
       Obviously, though, in this case, that of associating with Gentiles,
     Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, thought that the sense of mission to
     others, the sense of all being one in Christ, was the overriding and
     most important principle.

      Read 1 Corinthians 8:9–14. What is Paul talking about there?
      How could you take what he is saying and apply it to yourself
      and your church? What things might you be doing that are
      offending weaker members?




                                                                        77

    Further Study: “The Saviour’s manner of dealing with Peter had a
         lesson for him and his brethren. Although Peter had denied his Lord,
         the love which Jesus bore him had never faltered. And as the apostle
         should take up the work of ministering the word to others, he was to
         meet the transgressor with patience, sympathy, and forgiving love.
         Remembering his own weakness and failure, he was to deal with the
         sheep and lambs committed to his care as tenderly as Christ had dealt
         with him.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 516.
           “After all the failures of Peter, after his fall and restoration, his long
         course of service, his intimate acquaintance with Christ, his knowl-
1        edge of Christ’s pure, straightforward practice of principle; after all
         the instruction he had received, all the gifts and knowledge and great
         influence in preaching and teaching the Word, is it not strange that he
         should dissemble and evade the principles of the gospel, for fear of
         man, or in order to gain his esteem? Is it not strange that he should
         waver, and be two-sided in his position? May God give every man a
2        sense of his own personal helplessness to steer his own vessel straight
         and safely into the harbor. The grace of Christ is essential every day.

    Discussion Questions:
3
          ●
          1 As a class, discuss the issue of dealing with weaker folk in the
          church who might be offended by certain practices. How far do
          we go in accommodating them? What principles should we follow
          so that we do not, as did Peter, sacrifice a higher purpose in our
          well-meaning attempts not to offend?

          ●2 Spiritual pride is always a danger for anyone. How can we pro-
          tect ourselves from this, especially if we are having great success
          in soul winning, in ministering, or in any area of church life?
          How does the Lord help keep His servants humble?

          ●
          3 Is your church organized more as a club than a mission organi-
          zation? If so, what can you do to help restructure the church for
          its central mission?

    Summary: The apostle Peter went through a dark night of the soul
         before, during, and after Jesus’ death. When Jesus was resurrected, he
         was given another chance to be faithful to his Lord. Peter dedicated
         his life to that task and led the church from strength to strength in
         challenging times.

God Healed Me
by MARINA
   I live in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. For years I suffered from a serious
heart-related illness that filled my body with fluid. Whenever I tried to
move, I would lose my breath. I spent two years in a wheelchair and
thought I would die. The treatments the doctors offered promised little
help, and I feared the consequences of them.
   One day a friend visited me. She brought a young man who asked to
pray for me. I agreed, thinking, What other hope do I have? I just want to
get better. After that my friend and other Christians came often to pray for
me.
   Little by little I felt better and could breathe more easily. In one month
I could leave my wheelchair and walk. Every day I felt stronger. My new
friends urged me to exercise to regain strength. Their encouragement and
their prayers saved my life. Soon I could walk to the little church to wor-
ship.
   Then tragedy struck. One of my sons was killed and then a daughter
died. I grieved and wondered how God could heal me but allow my chil-
dren to die. Eventually I realized that I must be grateful for the healing I
have experienced and not allow anger to destroy my faith.
   My children are amazed at how healthy I am, and I tell them that God
healed me. My doctors were amazed at my strength, and I told them what
God has done for me. I tell everyone who asks that God healed me, and I
invite them to church. I know now that in life we have shadows and sun-
light. In both places God is with us. He was with me when I was sick, and
He was with me when my children died.
   My grandsons who live with me attend church, and I pray that my other
children will accept God as their God, even as I have.
                                   Pray for the people of Mongolia. The
                                 church here is young and growing. And
                                 remember, your mission offerings support lay
                                 evangelists such as the one who prayed for me
                                 and touched me with God’s love.

      Women of Mission




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 8:41–55; John 4:1–40;
      Acts 16:14–16; 18:1–3, 24–28; Rom. 16:3–5.

Memory Text: “ ‘Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been
      forgiven—for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little
      loves little’ ” (Luke 7:47, NIV).
Key Thought: Though women were often given background roles,
      the New Testament shows them heavily involved in advancing the
      mission of the church.
                omen play key parts in biblical history. They include good and

      W         bad queens, righteous maids, praying mothers, powerful lead-
                ers, influential wives, generous givers, prostitutes, prophets,
      deaconesses, gracious hosts, and faithful supporters and friends of Jesus.
         In such stories as Esther and Deborah, women take center stage.
      Throughout the Bible’s broad canvas, we can see how women with a mis-
      sion have helped advance the kingdom of heaven in many ways.
         In the New Testament we see examples of how Jesus dealt with
      women. At the same time, many women followed Jesus and supported
      Him financially (Luke 8:1–3) and helped care for His needs (Mark
      15:41). Jesus specifically ministered to women on several occasions.
      When many of His disciples deserted Jesus at His death, women
      remained true and stayed with Him to the cross. Women were the first
      witnesses of His resurrection.
         This week we will look at just a few of the women in the New
      Testament who, although their stories may be brief, played a vital part in
      the mission of the church.

      Breaking the Rules
         In the society in which Jesus lived and worked, women were largely
      kept out of public life. At Sabbath worship, they were mere onlookers,
      not participants. Like the Gentiles, women had a specially designated
      outer court at the synagogue, from which they could not stray.
      Significantly, it was located beneath the court for the men.
         In public, men were restricted in how much they could talk to a
      woman, even their wives. Women were not allowed to study the Torah;
      in fact, they were not even allowed to touch the Scriptures, lest they
      contaminate them.
         Jesus took a different approach. Women were His beloved children,
      just as much as men. His death covered them just as much as any
      male.
         Although rabbis of the time were not permitted to teach women,
      Jesus happily did. On one occasion, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, sat at
      His feet like a pupil (Luke 10:38–42).
         Prejudice against women entered every aspect of life. Men were
      allowed to divorce women, even for the most trivial offenses, but
      women were not allowed to divorce men, even for the most serious of
      offenses. Jesus had strong words to say about the current practice of
      divorce, which treated women as if they were objects owned by men
      (Matt. 19:3–8).

In the space of two chapters in Luke, Jesus breaks the laws regarding
      contact with ceremonially unclean women. He touches a dead girl
      and restores her to life (Luke 8:41, 42, 49–55); allows a hemor-
      rhaging woman to touch Him (Luke 8:43–48); and lets a woman of
      ill repute wash His feet (Luke 7:37–39). Read each of those
      accounts. What principles do you think led Jesus to break these
      rules? How are those principles applicable today?


        While He was on earth, Jesus broke down earthly, human barriers.
      As the apostle Paul said, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is nei-
      ther bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one
      in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28).

       What kind of prejudices are you still harboring against any
       group? How can you recognize those prejudices? More impor-
       tant, why must you overcome them?




                                                                          81

     The Woman at the Well: Part 1
        The division between Jews and Samaritans was long and bitter (for
     its historical roots, see 2 Kings 17:24–41). When the exiles returned
     from Babylon and attempted to rebuild Jerusalem’s temple and walls,
     the Samaritans tried to stop their work (see Ezra 4:7–22 and Neh.
     4:1–5). Incidents such as this, as well as the dispute over the true site
     for the temple, fueled hatred between both groups. On one occasion a
     group of people tried to insult Jesus by calling Him demon-possessed
     and a Samaritan (John 8:48).
        The most direct and quickest route between Jerusalem in the south
     and Galilee in the north was through Samaria. However, when making
     this trip, people would often take a detour around Samaria—despite
     the inconvenient longer distance in order to avoid their long and bitter
     enemies.

Look up the following passages in Luke. What do they reveal about
     Christ’s attitude toward Samaritans? What should this tell us
     about what our attitudes toward those traditionally despised by
     our own culture must be? Luke 9:51–56, 10:30–37, 17:11–19.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       On more than one occasion the Gospel writers show Jesus traveling
     directly through Samaria. One time on His way from Judea to Galilee,
     He stopped at the Samaritan town of Sychar—the site of Jacob’s well
     and near Mount Gerizim, the holy place for the Samaritans, the site of
     their temple. It was here that He had His famous exchange not just
     with a Samaritan but a Samaritan woman (see John 4).
       Much to the woman’s surprise, He asks her if she would draw water
     for Him to drink. The request shocks her, because Jesus was a Jew and
     she was a Samaritan and a woman!
       As Jesus speaks to this woman, He breaks several cultural taboos.
     The apostle John says that when he and the other disciples returned,
     they “were surprised to find him talking with a woman” (John 4:27,
     NIV). It was not considered appropriate for a man, even a religious
     teacher, to be seen talking to a woman in public—especially, of all
     people, a Samaritan woman.

      Jesus did not let social custom interfere with His mission. How
      do you find the right balance between not giving social offense
      and doing what is right?

     The Woman at the Well: Part 2
Read John 4:1–40, Christ’s encounter with the woman. In what way
     does Jesus connect the woman’s daily life and circumstances to the
     spiritual truth He wants to share? That is, how was He able to con-
     nect to her spiritual needs?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The woman is so excited by what she has seen and heard that she
     rushes back to town, not even bothering to take her water jar (John
     4:28). She has met the Messiah, and she just has to share the news
     with others.
       The first part of her testimony is an invitation for them to meet for
     themselves the Man who knew her life story (vs. 29). Here is a simple
     but classic truth about witnessing. Our mission is not to convert peo-
     ple. Our task is to sow the seed and bring people to Jesus. From there,
     the Holy Spirit cares for conversion. As the people later testify after
     meeting Jesus—“Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we
     have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
     Saviour of the world” (John 4:42).
       The second part of her testimony is a question—“Is not this the
     Christ?” (vs. 29). The way this question is structured in the Greek sug-
     gests that she is assuming that the answer to her question is negative.
     Thus, her question is literally: “He could not be the Messiah, could
     He?” or “This is not the Christ, is it?”
       Either the woman was still not 100 percent certain about Jesus
     being the Messiah or, more likely, she was breaking the news gently
     to people who could be hostile to her for making such a claim.
       Though many lessons could be taken from this account, one impor-
     tant one is that by doing what He did, Jesus clearly broke with the tra-
     ditions of His time, witnessing to not only a woman but a Samaritan
     woman but then using this woman to be a messenger and evangelist
     for the gospel.

      Jesus uses a Samaritan, a woman, and one of hardly the best
      moral background, too, to be a witness for Him. It is as if He
      purposely went against every taboo and prejudice of His time.
      What lessons should we draw from this for ourselves about who
      is or is not qualified to work for the Lord?


                                                                         83

     Women in the Early Church
       Throughout the book of Acts and in Paul’s letters, women are often
     mentioned as playing a role in the early church. The early Christians
     did not worship in churches but instead met in people’s homes, often
     around the meal table.
       Many of these homes were owned by women such as Lydia, a
     businesswoman who traded purple cloth. Paul, Silas, Timothy, and
     Luke met her in Philippi, in Macedonia, when they worshiped on
     Sabbath with a group of women gathered by the river.

Read Acts 16:14–16. In what role do we see Lydia?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       What a rich story must lie behind these few words. In the space of
     two sentences Lydia accepts Jesus, witnesses about her newfound
     beliefs to her entire household, is baptized with her household, and
     opens up her home to the apostles. Lydia is the first recorded convert
     in Europe, and her home provides the base from which the apostles
     minister in the area.

Read Acts 18:1–3, 24–28; Romans 16:3–5; 1 Corinthians 16:19. From
     these various texts, how was the Lord able to use Priscilla for minis-
     try?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       After some time in Corinth, Paul sailed to Syria, accompanied by
     Priscilla and Aquila. Here Priscilla and Aquila opened up their home
     to a Jew named Apollos and taught him about Jesus (Acts 18:24–26).
     Apollos later became a great help to the church in Achaia (vss. 27, 28).

      Look again at Romans 16:3–5. Paul is expressing thanks to both
      Priscilla and her husband. She, obviously, had a crucial role, one
      that Paul wanted to acknowledge. How can we be more sensitive
      in affirming women in whatever role they are in?

     “I Commend to You Phoebe”
        Although limited by social customs and expectations, many women
     in the early Christian church distinguished themselves through lives of
     service. The Bible rarely gives many details, but it is clear that women
     played an active role in the mission of the church.

Read Acts 21:9. What important principle can we get from this one
     short text?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Writing to the church in Rome, Paul commends to them a woman
     by the name of Phoebe—whom he refers to as “our sister” (Rom. 16:1,
     NIV). Phoebe belonged to the church in Cenchrea—a port city a few
     miles from the city of Corinth.
       Paul describes Phoebe as “a servant of the church” (vs. 1). In his
     writings, Paul often uses the Greek word diakonos, translated here
     “servant” and in other places “deacon.” Whatever the correct word, the
     meaning is that Phoebe was one who served the church. Paul contin-
     ues: “She has been a great help to many people, including me” (vs. 2).

Many other women in the New Testament are known for their good
     works. Look up the following texts. What can we gather from them
     and the ones already looked at about the various positions women
     held in the early days of Christianity? Acts 9:36; Rom. 16:7, 12;
     Phil. 4:2, 3; Philemon 2.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Not only did women play an important role behind the scenes in
     supporting the early church; it appears that many played a leading role
     in the frontline work of sharing the good news. No doubt, in the clos-
     ing work of the gospel, in the work of spreading the three angels’ mes-
     sages to “every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (Rev.
     14:6), women will continue to have an important role.

      Man or woman, what is the best way you can utilize your gifts
      in the work of ministry and mission?



                                                                         85

    Further Study: “The Samaritan woman who talked with Jesus at
         Jacob’s well had no sooner found the Saviour than she brought others
         to Him. She proved herself a more effective missionary than His own
         disciples. The disciples saw nothing in Samaria to indicate that it was
         an encouraging field. Their thoughts were fixed upon a great work to
         be done in the future. They did not see that right around them was a
         harvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they despised a
1
         whole cityful were brought to hear Jesus.”—Ellen G. White, The
         Ministry of Healing, p. 102.
           “The Lord has a work for women as well as for men to do. They can
         accomplish a good work for God, if they will learn first in the school
         of Christ the precious, all-important lesson of meekness. They must
         not only bear the name of Christ, but possess His spirit.”—Ellen

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In some parts of the world, women rarely play any leadership
          roles in the church. This is often dismissed as just a cultural
          issue; others see it as a moral one. When do customs and cultural
          issues become moral issues?
3
          ●2 Ellen G. White says that the woman at the well proved a more
          effective missionary than Jesus’ disciples did. What special
          strengths can women bring to the mission of the church? Without
          delving into the controversial issue of women’s ordination, how
          can we better affirm and use the women who are part of our
          movement and message?

          ●
          3 As a class, talk about Jesus and the Samaritan woman. Take
          that story and put it into your own culture and context. Imagine
          Jesus ministering so readily to someone despised and hated by
          your own culture, someone many folk would not even talk 10.
          What can you learn from this exercise about what the gospel
          commission is really all about?

    Summary: Throughout the New Testament, women appear more in
         background roles. However, Jesus and the apostle Paul often com-
         mended women—for their acts of love and mercy and for advancing
         the mission of the church.

The Green Robes
by ADRIAN GEORGE
   I grew up in Liberia, West Africa. I lived with my uncle until he died
when I was a teenager. Suddenly I was on my own. In Africa it is almost
impossible for a student to find work.
   One day I dreamed I was singing in a choir. I noticed that we weren’t
wearing the blue and gold robes that the choir in my church normally
wore. Instead, the robes were green with gold trim. I had this same dream
again a few weeks later, but I wasn’t sure what it meant.
   I became sick and went to stay with my sister in the capital city. When
I was feeling better, she invited me to attend evangelistic meetings. At first
I resisted going, for I knew that my sister was an Adventist. But she kept
inviting me. Finally I went with her.
   The pastor spoke on what happens when we die. I still remember the
sermon to this day. Then the choir sang, “Now is the time, make up your
mind, there is no time to wait.” I felt impressed to respond to the pastor’s
call, but I resisted. I didn’t want to become a Seventh-day Adventist. Then
it felt as if someone was pulling me out of my chair. I hung on tightly to
the arms of the chair. Finally I couldn’t resist any longer. I stood and
walked forward.
   I took Bible studies with the pastor and was baptized before I returned
to my home to finish school. But when my friends learned that I had
become an Adventist, they laughed at me. I decided I wouldn’t go to the
Adventist church anymore. Then I heard a voice saying, “You’d rather
serve men than God?” I turned to see who was talking to me, but no one
was there. That scared me. Still I didn’t attend the Adventist church.
   School ended, and I went to stay with my sister for the summer. My sis-
ter didn’t have money to take a taxi to go to her own church, so we went
to the Central church, which was closer. After Sabbath School, the choir
marched into the sanctuary from the back as they sung an anthem. I turned
to look at them, and to my amazement, the choir was wearing green
gowns, the very gowns that I had dreamed about months earlier. So this is
where God wants me to be, I thought to myself. I knew then that God had
given me that dream to cement me in the faith. Since then I have never
gone back on my faith.
   Your mission offerings helped to raise up a new congregation in
Monrovia, Liberia, and in 2007 your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings are
helping to build a church for this group. Thank you!

      Mission in a Pagan Land:
      Daniel and Company




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 1–3, 6.
Memory Text: “But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with
      the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for per-
      mission not to defile himself this way” (Daniel 1:8, NIV).

Key Thought: The accounts of Daniel and his companions in
      Babylon offer us insights into faithfulness and mission that
      remain relevant even after twenty-six hundred years.
              nd we know that all things work together for good to them that

      A       love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose”
              (Rom. 8:28).
         In the darkest of circumstances, when things seem to be going
      totally wrong, we can comfort ourselves that in the end all things will
      work together for good. Not that all things are good but only that, with
      God, they can work together for good. We are not guaranteed it will be
      the way we want it; and we may never witness the good that does
      finally result. But the promise remains.
         This week we will focus on God turning bad into good in the expe-
      rience of four young Jewish men who, through no fault of their own,
      were exiled to a foreign country. Yet, because of their unswerving
      commitment, God was able to use them as witnesses for His purposes
      and power. Through various ordeals, such as a fiery furnace and a den
      of lions, God not only displayed His care for Daniel and his friends,
      but He demonstrated His power before pagans who knew only their
      idols. Who but God knows the eternal results of the faithfulness dis-
      played by these young Hebrews?

      A Spiritual Foundation
        Most of us know the basic story of Daniel and his friends, who were
      taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, about six hundred
      years before Christ. Through their faithfulness, God used these young
      men to further His plans and mission in Babylon, the world’s most
      powerful nation at the time. Yet, to a large extent the stories of Daniel,
      Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah are a tribute to the faithful training by
      their parents.
        Jewish families were not to take lightly the duty of instructing their
      children. Much of this took place through storytelling, an important
      part of family life. Parents were to tell and retell the stories of God’s
      leading in the history of their nation. Children were to learn how fol-
      lowing God’s commandments leads to life, while disregarding them
      leads to death.

Read Deuteronomy 6:6, 7 (see also Deut. 4:9). What spiritual princi-
      ple is found here that is important, not just for children but for all
      of us? In what ways is daily, personal devotions a means of apply-
      ing this principle in our own lives?

        The parents of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah could not
      have predicted what would happen to their children. But through faith-
      ful, daily religious instruction, they provided a strong spiritual foun-
      dation for the rest of their lives. How important that parents seek to do
      the same for their own children today. At the same time, the constant
      dwelling upon God, the constant recounting of the miracles, the good-
      ness, and the love of God can be as much a benefit to the parents as
      to the children. Even for those who do not have children or for those
      whose children are gone, how important to keep the reality, goodness,
      and power of God before us at all times. After all, how can we share
      with others what we, ourselves, have not experienced?

       How consistent are you in your personal devotions? How can
       they help strengthen faith and make us better witnesses?

      The Early Tests
        Immediately after the boys arrived in Babylon, it was clear that
      Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah would face many temptations
      and negative influences.

Read Daniel 1:4. Where does the first potential attack on their faith
      occur? Why could it be so deadly?


        It is all too true that what we read, what we are exposed to, cannot
      help influencing our thoughts. Perhaps for the first time in their lives,
      these young men were exposed to literature that espoused values and
      beliefs opposed to what they had been taught. In Babylonian literature
      they were confronted with astrology, false gods, and myths of various
      descriptions. The battle for their minds, and hence their souls, had
      begun (see Phil. 4:8). And it was a battle for their bodies, as well,
      which, as modern science has aptly shown, is linked intimately with
      our minds.

Read Daniel 1:8. What key word there shows why Daniel and his
      friends (see vss. 12–14) did not want to partake of the king’s food?


        The key word is defile, which in Hebrew means just that, to “pol-
      lute, defile.” Thus, for these young men, the issue was not just health-
      ful living or a mere preference. It was a moral issue.

What kind of excuses could they have made to themselves to justify
      eating the food?


         From the beginning of their time in Babylon, the four young men
      resolved to stand for principle, no matter what the cost. It set the pat-
      tern for the rest of their time in Babylon, where more than once they
      were tested for their faith. Through their faithfulness, they bore a
      strong witness to the God of heaven.

       It is a human tendency to make excuses for bad choices or
       wrong behavior. In what areas of your life do you rationalize
       what you do? What steps can you take to deal with this spiri-
       tually dangerous tendency?

     No Compromise
       The biblical story clearly shows God’s involvement in the lives of
     the Babylonians—interacting with King Nebuchadnezzar and later
     with King Cyrus. He is portrayed as the God not only of the children
     of Israel but of all nations.

Read Isaiah 56:1–8. Think of the time when it was written. What is
     the crucial point made there?


Read Daniel 1:6, 7. What is going on here? What reasons did their
     captors have for doing this?


       The meaning of names was important to Jewish families, and chil-
     dren were named carefully. The names Daniel (God is my Judge),
     Hananiah (God has favored), Mishael (who is what God is), and
     Azariah (Jehovah has helped) reflect the high priority the parents
     placed on their children’s spiritual lives.
       Nebuchadnezzar’s top official, Ashpenaz, gives the four young
     Jewish men new Babylonian names—Belteshazzar, Shadrach,
     Meshach, and Abednego—which were mainly tributes to Babylonian
     gods.
       But that is the closest these four men would get to idolatry, names
     over which they had no choice but to go by. Under God’s blessing they
     soon moved into prominent positions in the court and government of
     Babylon.
       After their period of preparation, Ashpenaz presents the four young
     men to the king. The king talks with them and “found none equal” to
     them (Dan. 1:19, NIV). “In every matter of wisdom and understand-
     ing about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times
     better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom”
     (vs. 20, NIV).
       What a tremendous testimony to what God could do through four
     faithful young men. Taken from obscurity in Jerusalem to the court of
     the most powerful person in the world, they rose to the occasion and
     stood before the king as witnesses to the power of God.

      Why was it acceptable for the four Jewish young men to take
      pagan names but not acceptable for them to eat pagan food?
      How do we draw the line in our own lives between what are
      merely cultural issues and what are moral or religious ones? Be
      prepared to discuss your answer in class.



                                                                      91

     Interpreter of Dreams
       Daniel and his companions had made it to the highest levels of the
     court in Babylon, the greatest empire in the world at that time.
     However, as in most of the courts of power, perils awaited them.

Read Daniel 2:1–13 and answer the following questions:

      ●
      1 How were the wise men trying to fool the king?


      ___________________________________________________________________

      ●
      2 How did the king ensure that their tricks would be of no avail?


      ___________________________________________________________________

      ●3 What words of the wise men revealed the impossibility of what
      the king asked? Why would those words later help witness to the
      power of God?

      ___________________________________________________________________


        God had earlier given Daniel the gift of interpreting dreams and
     visions (Dan. 1:17), but Daniel was not going to be presumptuous and
     take anything for granted. He gathered together his three friends and
     urged them to pray (Dan. 2:18), for clearly without divine interven-
     tion they were going to meet the same fate as the charlatans and frauds
     in the king’s court.

Read Daniel’s prayer of thanksgiving (Dan. 2:20–23). What is the
     essence of his prayer? What hope and encouragement can you
     take from it for yourself, whatever situation you are facing?


       Most of us know the rest of the story (if not, then read the chapter).
     Think about what it meant for the monarch of the greatest empire in
     the world to bow down and worship a foreign captive in his court
     (vss. 46–48)! The king was obviously impressed, no matter how much
     more he had to learn.
       Through Daniel, then, God spares the lives of the wise men
     throughout Babylon, leads a pagan king to at least the beginnings of
     belief in the true God, and advances Daniel and his friends to positions
     of authority, where they can be greater witnesses for Him.

     Two Life-or-Death Tests
       Two more major tests give Daniel and his three friends opportunity
     to witness to the true God in a public and influential way.
       As much as your time allows, read through Daniel 3 and the test of
     faith the three Hebrew boys faced there.

Read Daniel 3:16–18. What is the essence of what they were saying?
     How is the principle still important for all believers today? See
     also Matt. 10:28.


       Read Daniel 3:28–30 to see just how impressed the king was
     regarding what he had seen. Though the king still had a lot to learn,
     through the faithfulness of these young men, a powerful witness for
     the living God was spread through the pagan world.
       Again, as much as your time allows, read through the story of
     Daniel in the lions’ den (Daniel 6), another test of faith but now in a
     new kingdom.

What evidence can you find in the chapter that shows that the king
     already knew something about the power of Daniel’s God?


What kind of testimony does Darius give about Daniel’s God? How
     accurate a testimony is it? What does this show about what God
     can reveal to pagans about His power and wisdom without the
     Written Word?


       Imagine if in both stories these Jews would have compromised to
     save their own lives. Again, how easy in both situations it would have
     been to rationalize doing the easy thing. Instead, they remained faith-
     ful, and as a result, they helped spread a knowledge of the true God.

      In the past, have you sought the easy way out and compromised
      what you knew was right? How did you feel? How can you for-
      tify yourself in faith so that whenever the next test comes, you
      do what you know is right?




                                                                        93

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “In the Court of Babylon,”
         pp. 479–490; “Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream,” pp. 491–502; and “The
         Fiery Furnace,” pp. 503–513, in Prophets and Kings.

            “As God called Daniel to witness for Him in Babylon, so He calls
         us to be His witnesses in the world today. In the smallest as well as the
         largest affairs of life, He desires us to reveal to men the principles of
         His kingdom. Many are waiting for some great work to be brought to
1
         them, while daily they lose opportunities for revealing faithfulness to
         God. Daily they fail of discharging with wholeheartedness the little
         duties of life. While they wait for some large work in which they may
         exercise supposedly great talents, and thus satisfy their ambitious
         longings, their days pass away.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
         Kings, pp. 487, 488.

            “The tidings of their wonderful deliverance were carried to many
         countries by the representatives of the different nations that had been
         invited by Nebuchadnezzar to the dedication. Through the faithfulness
         of His children, God was glorified in all the earth.”—Ellen G. White,
         Prophets and Kings, p. 512.

          2 The stories in Daniel are powerful lessons of how, by staying
          faithful to God in trying circumstances, these men were able to
          witness to others about the Lord. At the same time, how many of
          us have heard stories of folk doing crazy things in the name of
          God, even to the point of losing their lives? When faced with a
          difficult situation, how can we know whether we should stand
          firm or whether we could be a more effective witness for God by
          showing our willingness to compromise with the given situation?

          ●3 For every Daniel in the lions’ den story, there is a story of John
          the Baptist. How are we to understand these different endings?

    Summary: The book of Daniel describes the experience of four
         young men who, in the face of massive challenges to their faith,
         remain true to principle and to their God. Their faithfulness is a dra-
         matic witness not only to the people and rulers of Babylon but also to
         people of surrounding nations.

Terrorist Meets the Savior
by VASANTHAKUMAR VETHAMUTHU
   I was a political activist in my village in India. I worked for justice and fair
treatment for the poor of the community. But some politicians didn’t like me
and wanted me out of their way. So, when a clash between two groups in the
community resulted in the death of several people, I was accused of inciting
the riot. I had nothing to do with it, but some politicians called me a terrorist
and had me put into jail. The judge, however, saw the injustice and gave me
probation. However, the accusation made me an outcast in my own village
and among the people I had sought to help.
   My own church disfellowshiped me, so I decided to build my own church
on land at the edge of the village where my family and I could worship. As I
was building the church, I met an Adventist pastor. When he learned why I
was building a church, he said, “That’s a good idea. But since you are build-
ing a new church, why not make it a true Bible-believing church, an
Adventist church?”
   I was intrigued and listened to this man explain the Sabbath, the state of
the dead, and other basic Bible doctrines I didn’t know. I agreed to make my
church a Sabbath keeping church. I helped the pastor hold evangelistic meet-
ings in the area, though some of my political enemies accused me of politi-
cal activism again, and we had to stop the meetings.
   After explaining our position to the police, they finally allowed the meet-
ings to continue. The pastor focused his talks on God’s love, salvation, and
general topics, but in our private studies, he challenged me to study the Bible
to understand the Sabbath and other important doctrines. I did, and I realized
they all were true. I began telling people about the Sabbath. I knew that the
Christians in the village would not accept it, so I told my idol worshiping
friends and invited them to come to meetings in the half-finished church.
   Following the pastor’s meetings, 35 people were baptized, including my
wife, my father, and me. The new church members and even some non-
Adventist believers worked to finish the new church. Some two hundred peo-
ple came to the dedication, including some political officials. It was a grand
day for the entire village.
   I have given up my political activity and now work for Christ. I am driven
by the love of God rather than social justice. Now I work as a lay evangelist
in my area, helping the pastor and going from village to village to teach peo-
ple about Christ. We now have congregations in eight nearby villages. Your
Thirteenth Sabbath offerings provided two of these congregations with sim-
ple chapels. Thank you for your gifts to God that support God’s work in
India.

      Gifted for Service:
      Philip


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 6:3; Acts 8; Rom.
      12:6–8; 1 Cor. 12:1–11, 27–31; 1 Tim. 3:8–12.

Memory Text: “And the people with one accord gave heed unto
      those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles
      which he did” (Acts 8:6).

Key Thought: Through Philip’s ministry, Samaria is turned up-
      side down by the good news, and an influential Gentile Ethiopian
      comes to Jesus.When we surrender our lives to God, there is no limit
      to what He may choose to do through us to advance His kingdom.

               leeing persecution, confronting a sorcerer, casting out demons,

        F      healing those crippled and paralyzed, converting a rich
               Ethiopian from the royal court, being physically transported
      long distances by the Holy Spirit—life for Philip was anything but dull.
         When many people think of Christianity, they picture long sermons
      in church, lists of do’s and don’ts, and bored-looking people with long
      faces. These stereotypes, of course, could not be further from the
      truth. Following Jesus is the most exciting life possible.
         For example, this week we will be looking at the exciting life and
      mission of Philip, a man whose world took on a totally new dimension
      when he was ordained for service. Chosen as one of the seven deacons
      for the early church, Philip took a course he could never have pre-
      dicted. He personally shared the good news of Jesus in Samaria and,
      indirectly, with the continent of Africa.

What can we learn from his story?

      Called to Service
         The church in Jerusalem chose Philip and six other men to serve as
      deacons, or servants. The Greek word translated here as deacon,
      diakonos, is translated as servant in other parts of the New Testament
      (in the King James Version and many other translations). Speaking to
      the crowds and to His disciples, Jesus said, “But he that is greatest
      among you shall be your servant [or your deacon]” (Matt. 23:11). And
      in predicting His death, He said, “If any man serve me, let him follow
      me; and where I am, there shall also my servant [or deacon] be” (John
      12:26).

Read Acts 6:3 and 1 Timothy 3:8–12. From these scriptures, what
      assumptions can we make about the character of Philip?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________


Read Acts 2:46, 47; 4:32, 33. What kind of picture do these texts pres-
      ent of the church at that time?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        The good times did not last, however. Eventually, a major crisis
      arose (see Acts 6:1). Although at this stage almost all the new believ-
      ers were Jewish, there were two major types of Jews: the Grecian
      Jews, who were not born in Israel, spoke Greek, and approached
      things from a Greek cultural outlook; and the Hebraic Jews, who
      spoke Aramaic and/or Hebrew, and their worldview was strictly
      Jewish. As the church grew rapidly, the Grecian Jews complained that
      when food was distributed, their widows were overlooked in favor of
      those of the Hebraic Jews.
        Faced with their first major problem from within the community,
      the 12 apostles met together and implemented one of the key strate-
      gies of good leadership: delegation. The role of deacon was created.

       How much time does your local church waste dealing with
       members fighting among themselves? How can you help the
       local church direct its energy toward reaching the lost?



                                                                         97

     Missionary to Samaria
       When Philip reappears in the biblical record, we find him in
     Samaria, the area north of Judea. Jesus had predicted that His follow-
     ers would become missionaries not only in Jerusalem but “ ‘in all
     Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth’ ” (Acts 1:8, NIV).
     Now Philip is part of the fulfillment of this prophecy but perhaps not
     in the way he and the other believers would have predicted.
       The leaders did not send Philip to Samaria as a missionary. He was
     not part of the early church’s Global Mission plan to reach unentered
     areas.

Read Acts 8:1–5. What events caused Philip to flee to Samaria? What
     did the scattered believers do when they fled?


       After the stoning of Stephen, Saul’s persecution of the Christian
     church grew stronger, and all the believers, except the 12 apostles,
     scattered. This is the first example we see in history of the under-
     ground church. Many times since then we have seen God’s faithful
     followers driven into hiding for their faith. Even today, in many parts
     of the world, Adventist believers are forced to worship in secret.

As they scattered, these believers “preached the word wherever they
     went” (Acts 8:4, NIV). Ironically, persecution ensured that the
     good news spread more widely. What other examples of this hap-
     pening can you think of?


        This was a terrible time for the early Christians—forced from home,
     scattered to foreign areas, living in fear of further attacks. Philip was
     the father of four daughters, and no doubt this would have been a
     stressful time for his family (Acts 21:9). And yet, despite their diffi-
     cult circumstances, Philip and the other Christian believers continued
     to share the good news of Jesus faithfully.


      Despite the trials, the believers worked hard to spread the mes-
      sage. Why? Because they had a sense of mission, of purpose.
      Why are so many of us lacking that same sense of mission?
      Could it be because we are too busy looking inward and not out-
      ward, too busy thinking of our own needs and not the needs of
      a lost world? Think about this and be prepared to discuss your
      thoughts on Sabbath.

     Opportunities for Witness
        As Adventists we often speak of finding an entering wedge for our
     mission. In many places we cannot, because of prejudice, immediately
     start speaking about Jesus or the Bible. People often put up barriers as
     soon as we start talking about spiritual things. The health message
     often has broken down barriers in many parts of the world. Personal
     friendship is perhaps the most effective entering wedge. When we
     become friends with people, they often start to ask us about our
     Christian beliefs.

Read Acts 8:26–39, the story of Philip and the eunuch, and then
     answer the following questions:

      ●
      1 What prompted Philip to go where and when he did? What
      important message is there for us in your answer?

      ______________________________________________________

      ●2 What entering wedge did Philip use in order to start witness-
      ing to this person? That is, what need did he help fulfill for the
      eunuch? What important lesson can we take away from this, as
      well?

      ______________________________________________________

      ●3 What was required of the eunuch in order for him to be bap-
      tized? What message can we take away from this for ourselves?

      ______________________________________________________

        The Ethiopian had gone to Jerusalem to worship, and the chances
     are that he was returning disappointed. He would have quickly dis-
     covered that, as a Gentile and as a eunuch, he was doubly disqualified
     from worshiping in the court of the Jews (see Deut. 23:1).
        Now, new light breaks through his discouragement as he learns of the
     One who, through His death, has “broken down the middle wall of par-
     tition” (Eph. 2:14). In response to the wonderful news he hears, the
     eunuch asks Philip to baptize him. And here we read of the first recorded
     Gentile convert to Christianity—a wealthy and powerful African.

      How often do you have opportunities to witness for your faith?
      How well do you use those opportunities? What could you do
      better?



                                                                          99

      Gifted for Service
         Each of us as followers of Christ are given spiritual gifts to accom-
      plish the mission God has for us. Spiritual gifts were vital in the life
      of the early Christian church and fired the missionary zeal of the new
      believers. The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian believers and told
      them that he did not want them to be ignorant about spiritual gifts
      (1 Cor. 12:1). The Greek word Paul uses for gifts, charismata, empha-
      sizes that these are gifts of grace—totally unearned by us.
         The fifth fundamental belief of the Seventh-day Adventist Church,
      which focuses on the work of the Holy Spirit, says: “He extends spiri-
      tual gifts to the church.” This is an important concept. Although the
      gifts are given through the believer, they are really gifts for the church.
         Spiritual gifts are never given merely for the benefit and edification
      of individual believers. They are always given in the context of mis-
      sion and service. Spiritual gifts are given to believers in the context of
      the wider church community, so they can benefit the church in its mis-
      sion to the world.
         The account of Philip’s experience in Samaria (Acts 8:4–8) is not
      detailed. At some stage God gave him extra spiritual gifts, and he
      changed from Philip the deacon to Philip the evangelist. It must have
      been a significant step for Philip to go from administering the church
      in Jerusalem to casting out demons and healing the sick in Samaria.

The two main biblical sources for our understanding of spiritual gifts
      come from Romans 12:6–8 and 1 Corinthians 12:1–11, 27–31.
      Read these passages and compare with Acts 8:4–8. What spiritual
      gifts did Philip display, and how did he use them?

       what principle is seen here? What is it about us, our lives, our
       teachings, that would cause anyone to pay close attention to
       what we say?

     Philip and Simon Magus
       When the apostles in Jerusalem heard of the tremendous success in
     Samaria, they sent Peter and John to visit Philip and the new believ-
     ers. They both arrived in Samaria at a providential time to support
     Philip. They first prayed for the new believers to receive the Holy
     Spirit—something that, apparently, Philip had not done. Then they
     helped Philip deal with a former sorcerer named Simon.

Read Acts 8:9–25, the story of Simon, Philip, Peter, and John, and
     then answer the following questions:

      ●
      1 Why are miracles and other supernatural manifestations not
      absolute proof that God is directly behind what is happening?

      ______________________________________________________

      ●
      2 Simon wanted the right thing, just in the wrong way, or so it
      seemed. (After all, what is wrong with wanting to bestow the
      Holy Spirit on others?) Judging by Peter’s reaction, what might
      have been the true motive for Simon’s request?

      ______________________________________________________

      ●3 In what way was Peter’s reaction to Simon similar to Jesus’
      reaction to Peter? Matt. 16:21–27.

      ______________________________________________________

      ●
      4 Where do we see, in this section, the grace of Christ and the
      gospel of forgiveness?

      ______________________________________________________

        No matter how gifted Philip was, even he needed help, which
     explains why Peter and John came. The important point is, no one is
     good enough or gifted enough to do the work of the Lord alone. We
     all need the help of others.

      Wanting to buy the power to bestow the Holy Spirit? Come on!
      Yet, Simon was said to be a believer, and he was even baptized.
      What kind of foolish things did you once believe early in your
      walk with God that you now know better about? How could this
      help you be more tolerant of those who, in their ignorance,
      might be holding foolish beliefs, as well?


                                                                     101

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Gospel in Samaria,”
          pp. 103–111, in The Acts of the Apostles.

            “In this instance we have an illustration of the care of God for his
          children. He called Philip from his successful ministry in Samaria, to
          cross the desert and go to Gaza to labor for a single inquiring soul.
          The promptness with which the eunuch accepted the gospel and acted
          upon its belief should be a lesson to us. God designs that we should
          be prompt in accepting and confessing Christ, prompt in obeying him,
          and in answering the call of duty. The eunuch was a man of good
1         repute, and occupied a high and responsible position. Through his
          conversion the gospel was carried to Ethiopia, and many there
          accepted Christ, and came out from the darkness of heathenism into
          the clear light of Christianity.”—Ellen G. White, The Spirit of
          Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 305.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●1 As a class, talk about your answer to Monday’s final question.
           In fact, before you do that, it would be better to discuss your
           answer to Sunday’s question.

           ●2 Early on in the Lord’s church, ethnic divisions arose. Even
           today, in various parts of the world, similar tensions exist among
3          church members. What about in your own local church? How
           can you as an individual help your church see just how contrary
           to every principle of the gospel these attitudes are?

           ●
           3 Philip baptized the eunuch immediately after he accepted
           Jesus as his Savior. Why does the Adventist Church not do the
           same today? Should or should we not? Justify your answer.

           ●
           4 What are some of the needs in your community that your
           church could use as an entering wedge in order to reach people
           with the gospel of Christ? How could you help your church in the
           crucial area of outreach?

    Summary: Philip provides another powerful example of what God
          can do through somebody who has dedicated his or her life to Him.
          Whether witnessing to the eunuch, sharing with the Gentiles in
          Samaria, or converting Simon the sorcerer, Philip’s one goal was to
          uphold the name of Jesus.

Salwa’s Blessing
   Salwa was a faithful wife and mother living in a displaced persons camp
in southern Sudan. Women were not allowed to worship in the mosque,
and she knew little about God. Then she learned that some Adventist lay
evangelists were holding meetings in the camp. She asked her husband for
permission to go to the meetings. When he learned that Adventists have
many beliefs in common with Muslims, he allowed her to go to the meet-
ings.
   Salwa shared what she was learning with her husband, and soon he
joined her. She learned that she was a sinner but that Jesus had come to
forgive her and save her. She stopped brewing and selling alcohol, and
soon her back pain, caused by carrying heavy loads of wood used to pre-
pare the beer, was gone.
   Salwa gave her heart to God and asked to be baptized. Her husband didn’t
object, for he saw the differences in her since she learned about Jesus. She
shared her new faith with other women in their homes and in the market-
place. Her enthusiasm was contagious, and several of her friends began
attending church. Some even brought their husbands.
   When Salwa began attending the church, it had only four members, but
within a year the church had grown to 32.
   Salwa’s friends, Hidia and Alima, had new babies and couldn’t attend
the meetings, so Salwa shared with them what she was learning. Later
these women began attending the church. Alima earned a living brewing
beer, as Salwa had. She, too, stopped making alcohol and found another
way to earn money. When people came to buy Alima’s beer, she told them
she was no longer making it. People asked questions, and more people
learned about God’s love and salvation.
   Sadia, one new convert, sums up the feeling of these women. “We fled
here because of war, but here we have found peace in Jesus. I thank God
that I had to be displaced by war in order to meet the Savior and have His
peace.”
   When it is again safe to return to their own villages, many will take with
them a faith they found during a time of war, a faith in Jesus, who brings
peace to their hearts.
   Your mission offerings help support the lay evangelists who serve God
in Sudan and many other countries around the world. Thank you for your
part in bringing peace to troubled hearts.



Salwa has returned to her home village near Bahr Naam, in southern Sudan, where she
continues sharing her faith.

        LESSON            13 *September 20–26
      “Here Am I! Send Me”:
      The Prophet Isaiah




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Lev. 16:30, 17:11, Isa. 6:
      1–10, 49:6, Jer. 3:22, Matt. 28:18–20, Heb. 1:2.

Memory Text: “Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: ‘Whom
      shall I send, and who will go for Us?’Then I said, ‘Here am I! Send
      me’ ” (Isaiah 6:8, NKJV).

Key Thought: Isaiah was a powerful eighth-century prophet who
      spoke out against sin and corruption, championed justice and
      righteousness, and prophesied the coming of the Messiah. What
      parallels can we find for ourselves today?

              central part of Isaiah’s mission was to reform the southern

      A       kingdom of Judah. He spoke out against sin and corruption
              and the nation’s rebellion against God.
         But Isaiah’s mission extended further than just reform within Judah.
      He envisioned a day when Judah’s mission would be to represent God
      to the world. Judah was not to remain inward-looking; it had a mis-
      sion to all other nations. Isaiah quotes God as saying, “ ‘I will keep
      you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for
      the Gentiles’ ” (Isa. 42:6, NIV).
         This large vision of mission extending to the whole world was lost
      sight of in following years. Not until Jesus’ own ministry, and the minis-
      try of the apostles in the book of Acts, do we see this vision of the
      gospel to all the world put into action, a vision that we are called to be
      part of in our day and age, as well.

     Woe Is Me!
Read Isaiah 6:1–6. What was happening to Isaiah?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        God transports Isaiah through vision into the heavenly throne room,
     where he sees God Himself seated on a throne, “high and lifted up”
     (Isa. 6:1).
        In his vision of God’s throne room, Isaiah is treated to an amazing
     spectacle. He sees the train of God’s robe filling the temple and six-
     winged flying beings called seraphim. He hears them calling to each
     other in praise to God. Their voices must have been powerful, because
     they caused the doorposts to shake and the temple was filled with
     smoke.

Compare Isaiah’s vision with these others who had an experience
     of seeing God. What was the common reaction? What important
     lesson can we take from these reactions about ourselves and our
     relationship to our Creator? Exod. 20:18, 19; Judg. 13:22; Job
     42:5, 6; Rev. 1:17.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In response to his vision of “the King, the Lord of hosts,” Isaiah
     cries out, “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean
     lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips” (Isa. 6:5,
     NIV).
        Damah, the Hebrew word for undone, means “cut off ” or “finished.”
     The King James Version also translates the word as “perish” (Ps. 49:12,
     20) and as “destroyed” (Hos. 4:6). This word indicates that the expe-
     rience totally devastated Isaiah. The vision of God helped Isaiah
     understand what he, himself, was really like in contrast to his Maker.

      What was it about seeing God that caused this reaction? How
      does this help us understand why Jesus came in human flesh to
      reveal to us what God is really like?




                                                                       105

      Thy Sin Is Purged
        Isaiah’s encounter with the Divine is an extraordinary occasion. He
      describes it as an experience that affects all his senses: He sees the six-
      winged seraph and God on His throne; he hears the seraphims’ thun-
      dering voices; he smells the smoke in the temple; and he feels and
      tastes the live coal the seraphim places on his lips (Isa. 6:1–6).
        As we saw in yesterday’s lesson, after this experience of seeing God,
      Isaiah is overcome by his own unworthiness.
        Indeed, his utterance in Isaiah 6:5 is a confession of his sin and that
      of his people.

Why the emphasis on “unclean lips”? Was Isaiah’s and his people’s
      only sin that of what they spoke? What might that have been a
      symbol of? See also Prov. 13:3, Matt. 12:37, Luke 6:45.


        As soon as Isaiah confesses, a seraphim takes a live coal from the
      heavenly altar, flies with it to Isaiah, and touches it to his lips.

Read Isaiah 6:6, 7. What happens here? What is symbolized by this
      act? What message can we take from this for ourselves?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        In and of himself, Isaiah, a man of unclean lips, has nothing to offer
      God. But through the work of the Lord Himself, Isaiah’s sin is purged.
      The Hebrew word translated purged comes from the root qaphar,
      commonly translated in the Old Testament as “atone” or “atonement”
      (see Exod. 29:36, 30:10, Lev. 16:30, 17:11). The point is that Isaiah,
      without divine intervention, without his sin being purged or covered
      (qaphar has also been understood to mean covered; see Gen. 6:14)
      would not have been able to do anything for the Lord. He had to be
      made right with God first; only then could the Lord use him.

       What things in your own life are standing in the way of God’s
       being able to use you? What must you submit to in order to have
       your sin purged?

              T UESDAY September 23

     “Here Am I! Send Me”
       When Isaiah hears the call from God, he immediately responds,
     “Here am I! Send me” (Isa. 6:8). Notice that Isaiah answers the call
     before he knows the details of the assignment (see also Heb. 11:8).
       Isaiah does not respond because he believes he has the necessary
     gifts and talents or because he knows that he will do a good job. And
     he does not respond because it is a task that appeals to him (he does
     not even know what the task is). Isaiah responds because he knows
     that although he is unworthy, God is worthy. Although he is powerless,
     God is all powerful. Although it may not be a mission he would have
     chosen for himself, it is a mission God has chosen.

Read the Great Commission to go and teach all nations—perhaps the
     most important commission in all of Scripture (Matt. 28:18–20).
     Read carefully the first part of this commission. Why is this an
     important section that we must not overlook?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        The “therefore” is critical. The only reason we can go and teach all
     nations is because we go in the power of the One who has all author-
     ity in heaven and on earth. If we had only our own strength, we could
     not go. If we relied on our own skills, we could not go. Our mission is
     fired by Jesus, who owns “all authority” (NIV) or “all power” (KJV)
     in the universe (see Acts 17:28, Heb. 1:2, Col. 1:16).
        If we are willing, God gives us the power we need to accomplish the
     mission He gives us. He purifies Isaiah’s unclean lips (Isa. 6:7); He
     gives Mary the Holy Spirit and “ ‘the power of the Most High’ ” (Luke
     1:35, NIV); Jesus prays for Peter (Luke 22:32); He anoints Saul with
     the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:17, 18); He puts words in Jeremiah’s mouth
     (Jer. 1:9). Should we expect any less for ourselves, now at this crucial
     time in earth’s history?

      What, if anything, is holding you back from doing more for the
      Lord? What changes must you make? How can you learn to rely
      on God’s power and not your own gifts, whatever they are?



                                                                        107

      Isaiah’s Call
Read God’s commission to Isaiah (Isa. 6:9, 10). How are we to under-
      stand what God was telling Isaiah here?


         Most translations of the Bible, including the King James Version,
      make these verses sound as if God is purposely aiming to dull the peo-
      ple’s hearts and minds. Yet, if you read the texts carefully, you can see
      a bit of sarcasm, a bit of irony, in them. Why would God—who other-
      wise is constantly pleading with His people to listen to Him, to under-
      stand Him, to open their hearts to Him, to know Him, to look to Him,
      to return to Him, and to be healed by Him—say what He was saying
      unless He meant something else?

Read the following texts. How are we to understand them in light of
      the texts we have just seen?

      Deut. 30:6
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Prov. 2:5
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Jer. 3:22
      ____________________________________________________________________

      Jer. 4:1
      ____________________________________________________________________

         All through the Bible, God was calling His people to listen, to obey,
      to return to Him, to be healed by Him. And yet, as we know, many did
      not listen. Thus, what seems to be happening here is that God is sim-
      ply stating how the people will respond to Isaiah; He is not saying
      what He wants to happen or what He will cause to happen. As the peo-
      ple continually reject Isaiah’s warnings, their hearts naturally harden.
      But this does not mean that Isaiah or God wanted this result. On the
      contrary, the whole Bible is a call of God to people to do all the things
      Isaiah said to do; as we know, however, many did not.

       What about us today? How different are we from the folk in
       Isaiah’s time? And though, perhaps, there is not much we can do
       about others, what about ourselves, individually? How can we
       make sure we do not fall into the same spiritual trap as those
       depicted in Isaiah?

      A Light to the Gentiles
         Isaiah’s mission was far larger than just reforming Judah. He also
      cast a vision of Jerusalem as a light on a hill, a witness to all nations
      about the one true God, and His commandments: “the mountain of the
      Lord’s temple will be established . . . and all nations will stream to it”
      (Isa. 2:2).

How do we, as Adventists, understand our role in the outreach to the
      world? See Rev. 14:6.


Read Isaiah 42:6, 7. What role does God call Judah to play? How do
      we see ourselves in that role today?


Read Isaiah 49:6. What does this have to do with us, as Seventh-day
      Adventists?


         It was not until the late 1860s that the Seventh-day Adventist
      Church realized it had a mission to foreign lands. Early Adventists had
      assumed the gospel commission extended only to the various people
      groups within North America. America was a multicultural society,
      and early Adventists thought they were reaching out to every nation,
      kindred, tongue, and people right there at home. Arthur Spalding sug-
      gests that it was a “comforting rationalization” for the early Adventist
      Church to assume that its mission was only to North America.
      —Arthur Whitefield Spalding, Origin and History of Seventh-day
      Adventists (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald® Publishing
      Association, 1962), vol. 2, p. 193.
         But it was not long before the young church realized that its vision
      was too limited, and it launched out and began establishing the church
      in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and all over the world, a work that
      we, individually, can be a part of, one way or another.


       What are ways you, or even your local church, could be more
       involved in outreach, in bringing “salvation unto the ends of the
       earth” (Acts 13:47)?




                                                                           109

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Call of Isaiah,”
          pp. 303–310, in Prophets and Kings.

            “This assurance of the final fulfillment of God’s purpose brought
          courage to the heart of Isaiah. What though earthly powers array
          themselves against Judah? What though the Lord’s messenger meet
          with opposition and resistance? Isaiah had seen the King, the Lord of
          hosts; he had heard the song of the seraphim, ‘The whole earth is full
1         of his glory’ (verse 3); he had the promise that the messages of
          Jehovah to backsliding Judah would be accompanied by the convict-
          ing power of the Holy Spirit; and the prophet was nerved for the work
          before him. Throughout his long and arduous mission he carried with
          him the memory of this vision. For sixty years or more he stood before
          the children of Judah as a prophet of hope, waxing bolder and still
2         bolder in his predictions of the future triumph of the church.”—Ellen
          G. White, “The Call of Isaiah,” Advent Review and Sabbath Herald,
          March 11, 1915.
            “The exhortations of the prophet to Judah to behold the living God,
          and to accept His gracious offers, were not in vain. There were some
          who gave earnest heed, and who turned from their idols to the worship
          of Jehovah. They learned to see in their Maker love and mercy and
          tender compassion. And in the dark days that were to come in the his-
3         tory of Judah, when only a remnant were to be left in the land, the
          prophet’s words were to continue bearing fruit in decided reformation.
          ‘At that day,’ declared Isaiah, ‘shall a man look to his Maker, and his
          eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.’ Isaiah 17:7, 8.”—

           ●
           1 Why is a prophet never popular? Imagine if Isaiah came back
           to life and functioned as a prophet to the Adventist Church. What
           do you think he would have to say? Would his message have
           changed? What about our views toward Ellen G. White? Are
           many of us, perhaps, doing the same thing to her that many in
           Israel did to their own prophets? Discuss.

           ●
           2 Just what role do we have in the worldwide mission of the
           Seventh-day Adventist Church? How do we balance our own local
           needs, our own local outreach, with the divine call to spread this
           message to the world? How can we be faithful to both callings?

    Summary: The prophet Isaiah accepted a mission from God that was
          unpopular and, in many ways, unrewarding. It was also a mission that
          ended with his being sawn in half. And yet, through his ministry, lives
          were changed—and the power of his words is still felt today.

A New Direction
by JEAN GILBERT GAËTAN
   I’m from southern Haiti. When I was young, my father wanted me to
become a priest. Every day after school I spent time with a priest, learn-
ing the teachings of our church.
   But when I started secondary school, I lived with my sister. I found
other passions, karate and the cinema. I made new friends at my new
school, friends of every religion. I realized that not everyone believed as I
did, and I began examining the beliefs of my friends. I joined a Protestant
church, but I kept my beliefs a secret from my parents, for I knew they
wouldn’t be happy if they found out. I read the Bible in secret and went to
church services only at night, when my friends wouldn’t see me and tell
my sister or my parents.
   Two of my friends were Adventists; they invited me to some evangelis-
tic meetings, but I wanted to go to the movies instead. However, one night
toward the end of the series, I had nothing to do and went to the evangelis-
tic meeting. The pastor’s message was so compelling that when he invited
those who wanted to take a stand for God and be baptized, I stood up.
Some people objected, knowing that I had not attended all the meetings.
They feared that I was playing with God, but I was serious!
   I told my family that I was an Adventist. Mother objected, but I was
determined to stand true to my new faith. I was 18 at the time, old enough
to make such a decision. But I still was under my parents’ rule.
   Life became difficult at home. Mother refused to cook without pork, so
many days I went without food. But I felt strong. My parents refused to
pay my school fees or buy me clothes, but God provided someone to pay
my school fees and give me clothes.
   My parents are disappointed that I didn’t become a priest, and to this
                              day I’m the only one in the family to become
                              an Adventist. I pray that my family will
                              embrace the truth I’ve found. Thank you for
                              your mission offerings, which helped finance
                              the evangelistic meetings that brought me to
                              God.

2008    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter

          The atonement is the biblical doctrine around which all others
       revolve. It is centered in Christ’s life, death, resurrection, ascension,
       mediation, and return. It presupposes the presence of sin, our fun-
       damental and desperate need of salvation, and God’s loving dispo-
       sition to save us.
          This quarter’s study will explore the rich meaning of Christ’s sub-
       stitutionary sacrifice. The aim of the lessons is to move you toward
       a greater commitment to the One who suffered so much in order to
       reconcile us to Himself.

Lesson 1—God’s Nature: The Basis of Atonement
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Eternal God (Gen. 21:33, Ps. 90:2)
       MONDAY: A Loving God (Ps. 118:1–4, Rom. 5:8, 8:37–39)

       Sabbath Gem: God’s work of salvation is a self-willed outflow
       of His very nature; it does not require sinners to persuade Him to
       love them.

Lesson 2—Cosmic Crisis: The Disruption of God’s
                  Established Order
       The Week at a Glance:

       between God and Satan.
