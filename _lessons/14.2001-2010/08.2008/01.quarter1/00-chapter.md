     Though discipleship has been a topic of interest to Christians for
   centuries, for the first followers of Jesus discipleship was so much
   more than just that. For them, discipleship was the experience of fol-
   lowing the Lord Jesus. At its core, discipleship was a relationship, one
   that was transforming, liberating, and empowering. And, as it was for
   them, so must it be for us.
     A disciple is a person who has accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, com-
   mitted himself or herself to a growing relationship with God, and by
   the Holy Spirit is integrating the Lordship of Jesus into every area of
   daily life. Disciples are committed to being responsible members of
   the church through active and consistent participation in mission, and
   they are moved by the internal motivation of God’s Spirit.
                             Discipleship can be viewed from varying per-
Christian                 spectives. First, it can be examined with respect to
discipleship . . . the         historical situation in which the Master and
                          His disciples interacted. Second, it can be judged
involves                  from the viewpoint of the nature of the Christian
following, even           life. In order for us to grasp the character and
                          meaning of Christian discipleship, both these
imitating,                approaches must be captured.
Jesus.                       The theme Christian discipleship implies a dis-
                          cipleship different from others. Though the first
   century had many disciples—gathering teachers who were revered
   and whose styles of instruction were venerated—Christian disciple-
   ship speaks to a specific mode of discipleship. Because a Christian is
   an imitator of Jesus, and because a disciple is a follower, Christian
   discipleship is, then, the kind of discipleship that involves following,
   even imitating, Jesus.
     Discipleship also can be viewed from two different levels: (1) that
   of the first disciples of Jesus and (2) that of His subsequent ones.
     When one thinks of discipleship as it relates to Jesus and His fol-
   lowers, several questions arise. What must it have been like to have
   2
Discipleship
Jesus call, teach, and train you for discipleship? What must it have
been like to watch Jesus in action and to learn from His example?
  On the other hand, and in some ways more relevant to us now, what
does discipleship entail for Christians living so many centuries
removed from the time when Jesus lived and taught? What does dis-
cipleship entail for Christ’s disciples in the twenty-first century? What
does discipleship involve for people who live in a society radically dif-
ferent from where Jesus and His first disciples lived?
  In this quarter’s Bible study guide, we will look at discipleship as an
experience between Jesus and those He called to apprenticeship with
Him. We will explore what is involved in discipleship and who is truly
a disciple. We will also examine the process of becoming a disciple and
the major characteristics of discipleship. We will compare Jesus’ disci-
pleship with that of other disciple-gathering teachers. Additionally, we
will look at such questions as would-be disciples, gender and disciple-
ship, ethnicity and discipleship, instructions for discipleship, and dis-
cipleship under pressure. In short, we will consider what we need to
be modern-day disciples living in what we believe is close to the sec-
ond coming of Jesus.

           LESSON           1      *December 29–January 4


      An Overview of
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:18–22; 10:24, 25;
      Mark 3:13, 14; 8:34, 35; Luke 14:25, 26.

Memory Text: “As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two
      brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, cast-
      ing a net into the sea—for they were fishermen. And he said to
      them, ‘Follow me, and I will make you fish for people’ ” (Matthew
      4:18, 19, NRSV).

               wight E. Stevenson tells a story from the days of the conquis-

      D        tadors that illustrates an important aspect of discipleship.
               “When Cortez disembarked his five hundred conquistadors
      upon the eastern coast of Mexico, he set fire to the ships.”—Charles
      L. Wallis, ed., Speaker’s Illustrations for Special Days (Grand Rapids,
      Mich.: Baker Book House, 1975), p. 25. As his warriors watched their
      means of retreat go up in flames, they knew that they were commit-
      ting their lives to the conquest of the New World for Spain. They had
      to be totally dedicated to the mission.
         In the same way, those who accept Christ and commit to the task of
      discipleship are called to burn their ships in the harbor. There is no
      room for retreat. There is no turning back. The motto of this complete
      surrender to Christ should be “forward ever, backward never.”

The Week at a Glance: What is discipleship? Who is a
      disciple? Can one volunteer to be a disciple? What are the
      requirements of discipleship? What is the essence of discipleship?

      Discipleship—Historical and Personal
        In Scripture, the concept of discipleship appears in two ways, his-
      torical and personal.
        In the historical Christian context it refers to the interaction between
      Christ, the Master Teacher, and His first followers, known as the dis-
      ciples. At the core, it referred to those who had a close and special
      affiliation with the Rabbi from Nazareth, Jesus Christ, the Son of
      God.
        On the personal level, discipleship refers to the encounter that
      occurs between Christ, the transformed individual, and the world. It
      refers also to the challenges that Christian commitment brings and to
      the resultant life of faith. Thus, discipleship involves not only what a
      Christian does on behalf of Christ but how Christ is represented in the
      world.
        It is here that the two aspects of discipleship, historical and per-
      sonal, can intersect. Modern discipleship can benefit from the insights
      offered by the experience of the historical disciples and the Master.

Outline the concepts of discipleship found in Matthew 4:18–22.
      What did Jesus ask Peter and Andrew to do? Compare the call
      extended to James and John with that given to Peter and Andrew.
      What light does the response of these four disciples shed on our
      understanding of discipleship? See also John 1:40–42. What do
      these passages teach us, as well?

       discipleship? What personal lessons can you take away from the
       few texts looked at today?

     Who Is a Disciple?
        The word disciple comes from the Greek word mathetes, meaning
     “learner,” “apprentice,” or “adherent.” It depicts a person whose mind
     is set on a purpose. In the New Testament, it is used mostly of Jesus’
     disciples, especially in the Gospels. It refers to “an apprentice or pupil
     attached to a teacher or movement; one whose allegiance is to the
     instruction and commitments of the teacher or movement.”—Paul J.
     Achtemeier, ed., Harper’s Bible Dictionary (New York: Harper San
     Francisco, 1985), p. 222. A disciple, then, is a pupil or learner who is
     apprenticed to a master or teacher for the purpose of receiving instruc-
     tion. There can be no disciple without a teacher. The New Testament
     term disciple is used primarily of Jesus’ disciples.

Discipleship involves willingness to follow commands and to
     make commitments. What does Jesus mean, and what is He call-
     ing for, in His statement to the crowds, “ ‘If anyone comes to Me,
     and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and chil-
     dren and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he can-
     not be My disciple’ ” (Luke 14:25, 26, NASB)? How are these words
     applied to us in our daily life?

        If Christians are disciples, to whom are modern Christians appren-
     ticed? Who should have the allegiance and commitment of Christians?
     The church? The doctrines? A charismatic preacher who does a good job
     of teaching and instructing? Or Jesus? What light does 1 Corinthians
     1:10–17, especially verse 12, shed on this matter?


      In the New Testament, a disciple was one whom Jesus taught
      and who was committed to following Him. Is it any different
      today? Read again Jesus’ words in Luke, as quoted above. How
      well does that picture fit you? Are you truly a disciple of Christ?
      What does your answer tell you about yourself and your com-

      How Does One Become a Disciple?
Read Mark 1:19, 20 (see also Matt. 4:18, 19). What do these texts tell
      us about how people became followers of Jesus?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         In most instances in the New Testament, disciples were chosen; that
      is, they were called by the Lord, and they responded to the call. In
      other words, one doesn’t make oneself a disciple. Instead, one
      becomes a disciple by responding to a call.
What do the following texts say about this topic?

      Mark 2:13, 14
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Mark  3:13, 14
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Luke 5:8–11
      ____________________________________________________________________


      John 1:43
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Acts 9:4–6
      ____________________________________________________________________

         These texts show that the initiative for discipleship in the historical
      situation did not rest with an individual. It resided with the Master.
      Each disciple responded to a call the Lord extended.
         Even the response to the call Jesus extended did not wholly reside
      with the called. This, too, involved a divine initiative. “ ‘No one can
      come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him’ ” (John 6:44,
      NIV). Discipleship indeed is a work of grace. God provided the means
      of salvation. He extends the call for us, and He woos us to accept. Can
      anyone doubt that salvation is all of grace?

       The fact that you are even reading these words indicates the
       work of God in your life. How have you responded to the call of
       the Master? How do your works reveal the answer?
                                                                              9

     Requirements of Discipleship
        From our study thus far, we can discern a few conditions for disci-
     pleship.
        First, discipleship in the New Testament began with Jesus’ call to
     people to follow Him. A response from those called was essential.
     Thus, willingness to follow must have been a requirement of disciple-
     ship.
        Second, willingness had to be based on something concrete, on
     something the disciple saw as valuable. Did those called discern
     something in Jesus they had not previously seen in anyone else? If so,
     they exercised faith in Him to follow willingly.
        The third requirement of discipleship is a natural outgrowth of the
     first two. Willingness to follow and faith to believe must have led to a
     positive response to His call to discipleship. Without a positive
     response there could be no discipleship.
        A positive response and willingness to follow are ineffective unless
     put into active reality through obedience. Jesus invited each person
     initially called to follow Him, and they did so immediately. This
     means that they were obedient and that obedience was a requirement
     for discipleship. No willfully disobedient person can be a successful
     follower of the Master.
        Also, in the case of the disciples, their response to the call implied
     a total break with the past. They left their jobs, their families, and their
     possessions to follow Jesus, and they heeded the call to love these
     things less than they loved the Master. Being a disciple doesn’t neces-
     sarily mean that we have to do all those things, only that we be will-
     ing to, if needed.

      What other requirements of discipleship can you find in the fol-
      lowing texts? Matt. 16:24, 25; Mark 8:34, 35; Luke 9:23. What is
      the basic message that Jesus is giving to us here? How can you
      apply this principle in your own life?

      The Essence of Discipleship
        Implicit in the reality of following the Master was a call to a life of
      community and fellowship. Jesus and the disciples must have had a
      close companionship. That such a relationship is at the core of disciple-
      ship can be seen from His words in John 15:5, “ ‘I am the vine; you
      are the branches’ ” (NIV). The intimate attachment between a vine and
      a branch that inspired Jesus’ illustration is noteworthy.
        In John 15:9 Jesus compares their relationship with that between
      Him and His Father. He calls on His disciples to abide in His love, fur-
      ther strengthening this idea of our need to be closely attached to Him.

From each of the texts below, what else can we learn about disciple-
      ship?

      Matt. 10:32, 33
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Matt. 22:37–40
      ____________________________________________________________________


      John 14:15
      ____________________________________________________________________

What is your understanding of Matthew 10:24, 25 and Luke 6:40?
      What do they illustrate about discipleship?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        If discipleship, as previously seen, involves a clean break with the
      past, then out of necessity it must inspire a vision of the future. The dis-
      ciple envisions being with the Master, learning from Him, and becom-
      ing like Him. Mark 3:14 says that disciples were called “to be with
      Him” (NKJV). There is no way that a disciple can be with Jesus and
      not learn from Him and not be inspired to be like Him. Moreover, they
      would also catch the vision of His kingdom and would desire to be
      part of it.

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 319,
         322, 323, 374, 484, 582, 584, 585, 592–594, 738, 749, 750, 910, 1036,
         1037, 1083, 1084; Ellen G. White, “We Have Found the Messias,”
         pp. 139–143; “The Call by the Sea,” pp. 244–251; “He Ordained
         Twelve,” p. 292, in The Desire of Ages.

            “No mere theory of truth or profession of discipleship will save any
         soul. We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly. It is by
         halfheartedness in the Christian life that men become feeble in pur-
         pose and changeable in desire.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object
         Lessons, p. 50.
1           “Matthew ‘left all, rose up, and followed Him.’ There was no hesi-
         tation, no questioning, no thought of the lucrative business to be
         exchanged for poverty and hardship. . . . So it was with the disciples
         previously called.
            “When Jesus bade Peter and his companions follow Him, immedi-
         ately they left their boats and nets. Some of these disciples had friends
2        dependent on them for support; but when they received the Saviour’s
         invitation, they did not hesitate, and inquire, How shall I live, and sus-
         tain my family? They were obedient to the call.”—Ellen G. White, The
         Desire of Ages, p. 273.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What is the difference between discipleship and church mem-
          bership? Why is it important for us to know the difference? In what
3         ways can a person be a church member and not be a disciple?

          ●
          2 Read the second Ellen G. White reference above. At one level,
          the meaning is clear: We must be wholly devoted to Jesus, no
          matter the personal cost. At the same time, how is this principle
          open to abuse? In what ways could this idea be used by someone
          to evade what are, really, God-given responsibilities? How can we
          know the difference between being committed and using com-
          mitment as an excuse for some other agenda?

          ●3 What does it mean to be committed wholly to the Lord? What
          are the practical and positive ways commitment and discipleship
          can be manifested? Also, ask yourself this question: How are the
          lives of those around me improved and helped by my faithfulness
          to the Lord?

          ●
          4 What does it mean to deny self and take up your cross?
          Though we always tend to think of this command on an individ-
          ual basis, would this also be words to your local church, as a
          whole? If so, how so?

Fishing for Souls
by GABRIEL ZANCHIOR
   A friend stopped by the bar and dance hall that I operated in Benin, a
country in western Africa, and invited me to his home for dinner. After eat-
ing I fell asleep and thought I was dreaming when I heard someone speak-
ing beautifully. I opened my eyes and saw my friend and another man
praying. The prayer was so beautiful that I knelt beside them.
   When the man finished praying, he apologized for waking me. I asked
him to teach me to pray as he prayed, and he said, “When you know God
personally, praying is easy.” He was a pastor and offered to teach me about
God.
   As I studied the Bible with the pastor, I realized how little I knew about
the Bible. I told my friend, “You have known this, and you didn’t tell me?”
   Surprised, he responded, “But you own a bar. How could I know that
you would listen to these things?”
   As I studied the Bible, I realized that to follow Jesus I would have to
give up my bar and dance hall. But these truths were so beautiful, how
could I not follow them? I walked away from everything I had invested in
the bar and turned my life over to Christ. My wife and I were baptized.
   I found work as a fisherman, but fishing was poor in Benin, so I went
to neighboring Ghana to work. While there I found the Adventist church
and realized that this church was worldwide.
   When I returned to Benin, I looked at our little chapel and our handful
of members. I realized that the challenge was huge. Voodoo worship and
witchcraft permeate life in Benin. People prefer to join a church that
allows them to mix their voodoo practices with Christianity rather than
stand up for the truth and become a Seventh-day Adventist.
   I started evangelizing my town, calling people to Jesus. Ten people
joined the Adventist church. But when trouble comes, staying in the
church becomes difficult. In our culture funerals include drinking and
offering gifts to the gods to assure that the dead person does not haunt
family members. But when we Adventists don’t take part in these cere-
monies, our families make it very difficult.
   I now know that God’s church is a worldwide family. I pray, and I ask
you to pray, that God will work powerfully in Benin to convince people of
His love and power.
   I continue casting God’s net in the devil’s sea, seeking to be a fisher of
souls for Christ. Your mission offerings will help the work in my country
grow stronger each day.

      Discipleship Then and
      Now


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20;
      Mark 16:20; John 3:21–30; Acts 5:34–39.

Memory Text: “Then the disciples went out and preached
      everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his
      word by the signs that accompanied it” (Mark 16:20, NIV).

              iscipleship goes back to even before the time of Jesus’ earthly

      D       ministry. Several centuries before His coming into this world
              in human flesh, there were disciple-gathering teachers who
      influenced the lives of others with their instructions. This was true
      with the Greeks, the Jews, the Chinese, and other ancient cultures.
      Several of these teachers refused to accept the use of the term teacher
      in reference to themselves or that of disciple in reference to their
      pupils, so close was the bond between them.
         This week’s lesson explores discipleship in other settings, compares
      it with Jesus’ discipleship, and examines the implications for the dis-
      ciples of Jesus who live in the twenty-first century.

The Week at a Glance: What was discipleship like among
      the Greeks and the Jews? How was discipleship different with
      John the Baptist and with Jesus of Nazareth? What applications for
      the contemporary task of discipleship can we gain from disciple-
      ship in the time of Jesus?

      Discipleship Among the Greeks
        “Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were
      some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in
      Galilee, and said to him, ‘Sir, we wish to see Jesus’ ”(John 12:20,
      21, NRSV).

        The fact that these Greeks went to worship at the festival should tell
      us something about them already. Also, the verses beforehand reveal
      that so much was happening that the attitude of the Greeks should not
      be surprising.

Read the following texts. What insight could they shed upon what was
      happening here? Jer. 29:13; John 1:9; 6:44; Acts 10:34, 35.

         Last week we saw that Jesus always chose His own disciples. The
      above texts might, at first glance, indicate something different. Yet,
      that is not the case. Even here the Spirit was wooing these Greeks.
         In Greek culture, discipleship took many different forms. Though
      some Greek teachers would initiate the call to discipleship, the tradi-
      tion was for the students to choose the teacher. The students, not the
      teacher, initiated the relationship. Also, it was common for the teach-
      ers to charge a fee for the students who studied with them.
         In this case, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, these Greeks
      were seeking Jesus, to learn from Him. Given that God uses what we
      know to teach us what we need to know, this is a viable notion. Indeed,
      Ellen G. White notes that “the Greeks longed to know the truth in
      regard to His mission.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 622.
      She also said that Jesus granted their request.

       If someone were to come up to you, as these Greeks did to
       Philip, and say, “We wish to see Jesus,” what would you answer?
       How would you introduce them to Him?

      Discipleship Among the Jews
         Pupil-teacher relations are mentioned in the writings of Jewish
      scholars such as Philo and Josephus. There were also two famed rab-
      bis, Hillel and Shammai, who had rival schools in Jerusalem and who
      attracted followers. We also are told in Acts that Saul of Tarsus was the
      pupil of Rabbi Gamaliel, another famed first-century Jewish teacher
      (Acts 5:34–39, 22:3).

Read the above texts. What can we learn about Gamaliel from them?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         These teachers were reputed throughout the first century among the
      Jews. They attracted pupils from the whole world to Jerusalem, the
      center of theological and juridical knowledge of Judaism, to sit at the
      feet of these masters. A young Jew who desired to become a rabbi
      began his education as a pupil at a very early age, perhaps as early as
      fourteen. He was in personal contact with his teacher, listening to his
      instructions, imitating his gestures, and learning from him in the
      classroom and in daily life. In the classroom, he assumed the posture
      of a learner, sitting at his master’s feet. When he mastered the tradi-
      tional material, he was designated a nonordained scholar. Ordination
      came later at a prefixed age. At that time, the title rabbi was bestowed
      upon him, as well as the power to bind or loose for all time the Jews
      of the entire world.

What we have seen in the preceding paragraphs is consistent with the
      glimpses of Jewish teacher-pupil relations we get from the New
      Testament. What light do they shed on the understanding of the
      following passages? Matt. 16:19, 18:18.

       Have you known a teacher you have admired, who made a great
       impact on your life for good? What were the aspects of that
       teacher that so impressed you? In what ways can you emulate
       those traits in your own life?

     Discipleship With John the Baptist
Read John 3:21–30. Explain what this passage says about John the
     Baptist in relationship to discipleship. Was he also a disciple-
     gathering teacher? Because he did not have rabbinical education,
     what does the title rabbi say about the regard his pupils had for
     him?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        It is apparent that some Jews wondered whether John the Baptist
     was the Messiah. This is implied by the questions of the messengers
     whom the priests and Levites from Jerusalem sent to John the Baptist
     (John 1:19–28). Their questions are significant, especially when one
     considers that a two-messiah concept had developed among the Jews
     during this period between the Old and New Testaments. It anticipated
     a priestly messiah from the tribe of Levi and a kingly messiah from
     the tribe of Judah. The fact that priests and Levites were sent is there-
     fore notable since they belonged to the tribe of Levi.
        It is possible that the disciples of John saw him as a priestly mes-
     siah; after all, he was from the tribe of Levi. This belief could also
     have motivated the Jerusalem visitors, who inquired of John regarding
     his mission. Some scholars believe that this was the reason the author
     of the fourth Gospel recorded so much of what the Baptist said about
     Jesus. He wanted it to be absolutely clear that John the Baptist saw
     Jesus, not himself, as the Messiah. Perhaps it is against this back-
     ground that we must understand John 3:25, 26.

      What was the issue that caused some distress among John’s dis-
      ciples? See John 3:21–30. What does their attitude say about
      them? In contrast, what does John’s response tell us about his
      character? What principle can we learn from John’s response
      that we could apply to our own lives?

     Discipleship With Jesus
        From the very outset of His public ministry, Jesus had disciples. He
     appeared on the first-century Jewish scene as a disciple-gathering
     teacher in the tradition of both Greek and Jewish teachers. There were
     also points of contact with John the Baptist since John baptized Him
     in preparation for His mission.
        As in both Jewish and Greek traditions, Jesus had disciples who fol-
     lowed Him everywhere, who listened to His teaching, and who imi-
     tated Him (Matt. 5:1, 2; John 1:35–40; 2:1, 2).

Carefully read Matthew 4:18–20; then (going back over Sunday’s
     and Monday’s lessons) compare the ways in which one came to be
     a disciple of Jesus, of the Greek teachers, and of the established
     rabbis. What things did they have in common? What things were
     different?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        “Until this time none of the disciples had fully united as colaborers
     with Jesus. They had witnessed many of His miracles, and had lis-
     tened to His teaching; but they had not entirely forsaken their former
     employment. The imprisonment of John the Baptist had been to them
     all a bitter disappointment. If such were to be the outcome of John’s
     mission, they could have little hope for their Master, with all the reli-
     gious leaders combined against Him. Under the circumstances it was
     a relief to them to return for a short time to their fishing. But now
     Jesus called them to forsake their former life, and unite their interests
     with His. Peter had accepted the call. Upon reaching the shore, Jesus
     bade the three other disciples, ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fish-
     ers of men.’ Immediately they left all, and followed Him [Matt. 4:19,
     20].”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 246–249.

      What has Jesus called you to give up in order to follow Him?
      What has your response to that call been? Might you still be
      holding on to something that is standing in the way of a full
      commitment to the Lord?

      Contemporary Discipleship
        “Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the
      Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that
      accompanied it” (Mark 16:20, NIV).

According to the above verse, what was one major characteristic
      seen in the disciples of Christ? What message is there for us, as
      well? See also Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20; Rev. 14:6–12.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

          Beside the fact that the disciples were preaching everywhere, Mark
      said that the Lord worked with the early disciples after His departure
      and confirmed His word among them by the signs that accompanied
      it. Are contemporary disciples seeing God’s confirmation of His word
      among them through signs and miracles? What are some of the signs
      and miracles we see? How do we define signs and miracles? Should
      we expect the same kind of signs and miracles in every culture, time,
      and society?

Are there other ways, besides signs and miracles, for God to confirm
      His word among us? If so, how?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus has no less expectation of His disciples today than He had for
      the early ones. He requires the same commitment to the task from us.
      However, He says, “ ‘According to your faith be it unto you’ ” (Matt.
      9:29). Moreover, He says, “ ‘And I will do whatever you ask in my
      name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me
      for anything in my name, and I will do it’ ” (John 14:13, 14, NIV).

       How involved are you in the work of spreading the gospel? What
       are your own spiritual gifts, and how can they be used in this
       work? When was the last time you did anything at all in terms
       of helping others know the wonderful truths that you have been

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 432,
         433, 582–585, 932, 1022, 1023; Ellen G. White, “Who Is the
         Greatest?” p. 432, in The Desire of Ages.

            “For a time the Baptist’s influence over the nation had been greater
         than that of its rulers, priests, or princes. If he had announced himself
         as the Messiah, and raised a revolt against Rome, priests and people
         would have flocked to his standard. Every consideration that appeals
         to the ambition of the world’s conquerors Satan had stood ready to
         urge upon John the Baptist. But with the evidence before him of his
1
         power, he had steadfastly refused the splendid bribe. The attention
         which was fixed upon him he had directed to Another. Now he saw the
         tide of popularity turning away from himself to the Saviour. Day by
         day the crowds about him lessened. . . . But the disciples of John
         looked with jealousy upon the growing popularity of Jesus.”—Ellen
         G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 178.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 What is involved in leaving everything behind in order to fol-
          low Jesus? What are the different ways such a commitment is
          made manifest in our lives? In class on Sabbath, be prepared to
          talk about your own understanding of what this means.

          ●
          2 What roles should our educational institutions have in helping
          make disciples? How can our churches and our schools better
          work together in this important challenge?

          ●3 Even in the time of Jesus there was a rivalry among disciples.
          Why is something like this so common, even among a work that
          is, ideally, so exalted, a work that should by its very nature keep
          us all humble and eager for the success of others? What practi-
          cal things can we do to keep ourselves from falling into this trap?

          ●4 What about this whole question of signs and wonders and mira-
          cles? Do we believe in this? If so, what do we believe about it?
          What do signs and wonders prove? What do they not prove? Why
          should we always approach these things with caution, humility,
          and firm reliance on the Word of God?

Religion Class Discovery
by THOMAS WALTER
   Herr Singer teaches religion to fifth- and sixth-grade children in a pub-
lic school in Germany. One day he saw an ad for the Voice of Hope Bible
correspondence course and signed up to take the basic course. Then he
asked whether the Bible school offered lessons for children.
   The Voice of Hope sent him their children’s lessons, and Herr Singer
asked permission to use them in his religion class. The Voice of Hope sent
lessons for each student, and Herr Singer assigned the lessons to his stu-
dents, who began completing them. Several students sent questions they
had along with their lessons. From the first the teacher, his students, and
their parents knew that the materials they studied were sponsored by
Seventh-day Adventists.
   Herr Singer taught another religion teacher’s class when she was ill.
When she returned to school her students wanted to continue taking the
Bible course and asked Herr Singer to offer a second hour of Bible class
so they could continue taking the Bible course. These public school chil-
dren were willing to stay after school to study the Bible. So, once a week
the students met in Herr Singer’s class to complete their Bible course.
   The other religion teachers at the school learned about Herr Singer’s
Bible class discovery and asked to use the material in their own religion
classes. Herr Singer created a curriculum plan in which he explained how
to use the Bible correspondence course to teach religion to children. He
sent a copy to the Voice of Hope so that other religion teachers in Germany
can use the material if they wish.
   When the children completed the basic Bible course, some asked for
more Bible material. Herr Singer directed them to the Voice of Hope,
where they could study on their own. Six children enrolled in the basic
adult course. They completed this course without their teacher’s assis-
tance. The course is not easy, and the children began asking their parents
for help. When their parents couldn’t answer their children’s questions,
some of them enrolled in the Bible study course in order to help answer
their children’s questions.
   So, one teacher’s quest for religious materials has sown seeds of faith in
the minds of children and their families in Germany.
   Your mission offerings support the Voice of Hope in Germany and
around the world.

          LESSON            3      *January 12–18


      Called to Discipleship by
      Jesus


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:18–22; 5:46;
      9:10, 11; Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11; 18:10, 11; John 1:35–51.

Memory Text: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,
      the evidence of things not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).

                hen Garibaldi published that famous proclamation to his

      W         soldiers after the storming of Rome, ‘Soldiers! I have noth-
                ing to offer you but hunger, thirst, hardship, death. Let all
      who love their country follow me!’ he knew many a gallant youth
      would follow him, accepting hunger, and thirst, and death.”—A.
      Gordon Nasby, ed., Treasury of the Christian World (New York:
      Harper and Brothers, 1953), p. 92. Unlike Garibaldi’s, Jesus’ call was
      not for love of country but for love of God, a call that—though possi-
      bly involving hunger, thirst, hardship, and death—also offers the
      promise of eternal life. Thus, people then and now accept His call to
      follow and to commit their lives to Him and by so doing make a dif-
      ference in this world now and for eternity.
        This week we will take another look at the earliest calls to disciple-
      ship and seek to glean from them lessons for ourselves.

The Week at a Glance: What were the first calls to dis-
      cipleship like? What role did Scripture have in those calls? What
      can we learn from the call of Levi Matthew? Despite many differ-
      ences, what are some of the common elements found in the call to
      discipleship? What advantages do we have today over the early
      disciples?

     The First Calls
Read John 1:35–51 and then answer the following questions:

     1. How did John the Baptist help set the stage for the call of these first
     disciples? From what John did, what can we learn for ourselves and
     for our mission as a people?

     ____________________________________________________________________

      2. How central were the Scriptures to the people’s willingness to fol-
     low Jesus? What message is there for us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     3. What role do we see for the disciples in calling others to follow
     Jesus? What does that tell us about our own calling?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       After Andrew spent a little time with Jesus, he not only believed that
     Jesus was the Messiah, but he immediately did what the Master expects
     every disciple to do: Spread the joy of discipleship. Andrew seemed to
     have understood a vital principle of discipleship: It is neither for pri-
     vate use nor does it belong to a gated community or an exclusive club.
     Rather, it is an experience that must be shared with others.
       From Andrew’s response to discipleship, a pattern emerges. Andrew
     heard John speak and followed Jesus. Next, he told his brother Peter
     of his experience and brought him to Jesus, and Peter became a fol-
     lower, as well.

       In the same way, we hear the truth about Jesus, make a commitment
     to follow Him, and then tell others about Jesus. This is repeated day
     by day, all over the world.

      If you were to tell someone about Jesus, what would you say?
      How deep is your experience with the Lord? What would you
      say about Jesus that could make someone be interested in fol-
      lowing Him?




                                                                           23

      The First Call in Matthew and Mark
In Matthew 4:18–22 and Mark 1:16–20, we are given other perspectives
      on this first call. In both examples, those He called dropped their
      nets and followed Him. What does that mean?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        This is not the only time and place this principle is found in the
      Bible.

Look up the following texts. How do we see the same principle being
      manifested here, however different the circumstances?

      Gen. 12:1 (see also Heb. 11:8)
      ____________________________________________________________________


      1 Kings 19:19–21
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Phil. 3:8
      ____________________________________________________________________


      Heb. 11:24
      ____________________________________________________________________


         The point cannot be repeated enough: The Lord demands the whole
      heart. That which we do not surrender to Him, that which we cling to,
      refusing to give up, becomes an idol, something we deem more impor-
      tant than the Lord. What is worse, those things we cling to become the
      hooks the devil uses to wean us away from the Lord completely. That
      is why we must be willing to forsake anything and everything the Lord
      asks us 10. We cannot, as He said, “serve two masters” (Matt. 6:24).

                T UESDAY January 15

      The Call in Luke
        Luke 5:1–11 contains Luke’s version of the disciples’ call. As with
      the other Gospel accounts, it brings in elements not found in other
      Gospels, while omitting elements found in others. Some claim that the
      accounts are, therefore, contradictory. Instead, careful scrutiny usually
      resolves any issues, showing simply that despite the different details or
      emphasis, the accounts harmonize, especially on the crucial points.

Read Luke 5:1–11. What indications are there that Peter already had
      some faith in Jesus?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Think about it. They had fished all night, when fishing was the best,
      and caught nothing. Jesus then comes along and tells them to let the
      net into the water. Is He joking? If we did not catch anything all night,
      how are we going to in the day? Yet for some reason, Peter listens. Did
      he already have reasons to trust in Jesus?

What was Peter’s response? How does that response, in many ways, cap-
      ture the essence of discipleship and the everlasting gospel? Isa.
      53:6, Rom. 5:16–21, 1 John 1:7–9.

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Despite our fallen natures, despite our faults and our weaknesses,
      despite the fact that we, like Peter, are sinful, God does not abandon
      us. How natural it would be for any of us, in the presence of the
      Divine, to say, “Depart from me.” Under the blood of the Cross, we
      can abide in the presence of God. Under the blood of the Cross, we
      can be His disciples.

       Dwell on what Jesus did for us at Calvary. Dwell on the prom-
       ises of acceptance, forgiveness, and reconciliation with God
       because of the Cross. Claim the promises made to you, not
       because you feel worthy of them (was Peter?) but because God
       has promised them, and you want to take Him at His Word.




                                                                           25

     The Call of Levi Matthew
Read Matthew 9:9; Mark 2:14; and Luke 5:27, 28. Compare the call
     of Levi Matthew with that of the other early disciples. What are
     the similarities and the differences between the call of Levi
     Matthew and the other disciples so far?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Up to this point, those Jesus called to discipleship were apparently
     devout Jews, as John 1:44, 45 implies. The call to Levi Matthew, how-
     ever, comes to one on the fringes of society. He was a publican and, as
     such, was deemed among the worst of society by the Jews.

Read Matthew 5:46; 9:10, 11; Mark 2:16; and Luke 18:10, 11. What
     do these texts tell us about how people such as Matthew were
     viewed in that society?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Matthew was the most unlikely candidate for a call to discipleship.
     First, he was called from the tax collector’s booth. Roman writers
     linked these people with brothel keepers; the rabbis classed them with
     robbers. They were seen as extortionists (Luke 3:12, 13), notoriously
     dishonest and universally hated, especially since they were Jews who
     defrauded their countrymen for the enemy and also swindled the gov-
     ernment.
        How unlikely that one with such a character and a reputation should
     have been called to discipleship by Jesus! Yet, that is precisely what
     happened. Christ’s call here speaks to the universality of the salvation
     He brought, the inclusiveness of His kingdom, and His willingness to
     give all a chance at salvation.

      Who are some in your own society that are deemed outcasts,
      socially and morally unacceptable? What kind of attitude do
      you have toward those people? What can we learn, from the
      story of Levi Matthew’s call, about not being too quick to pass
      judgment upon others?

     The Calling
Based on what we have looked at this week (and in previous weeks)
     about the call to discipleship, what special message can we find for
     ourselves in Hebrews 11:1?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The amazing thing about the response of these disciples to Christ’s
     call was how little they must have known about what was coming,
     about what they were getting into by leaving everything and following
     the Master.
       Though, as we saw this week, they had some biblical evidence at
     that time for believing that Jesus was the Messiah (John 1:45), a study
     of the Gospels reveals how much of the work and ministry of Jesus
     was still unknown to them, especially the most important part of His
     work: His death on the cross. As we know, right up until the end, and
     even after, they had grave misconceptions about what was to come.

Read Mark 10:35–40, John 18:10, and Acts 1:6. How do these texts
     help us grasp just how little they really understood?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Think about the advantages that we, as modern-day disciples, have
     over those early disciples, especially right at the time they were first
     called. Sure, they got to witness many incredible miracles; but at the
     same time they did not know what we know about the work, the mis-
     sion, and the ultimate triumph of what Christ was to accomplish. And
     yet, despite this, they moved ahead in faith, the kind of faith revealed
     in Hebrews 11:1.

      Are you weak in faith? Could it be the things you are watching,
      the things you are thinking about, the things you are devoting
      your time to? What proactive steps can you take, right now, that
      will help your faith grow?




                                                                         27
                      F RIDAY January 18

    Further Study: Read Luke 5:1–11; Ellen G. White, “We Have
         Found the Messias,” pp. 132–143; “The Call by the Sea,” pp. 244–252,
         in The Desire of Ages; The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 352,
         739, 909–911.

            “Here were the four partners, in possession of the largest catch of
         fish they had ever brought to shore. At the moment of their greatest
         material success they abandoned their business. . . . Even in view of the
         higher significance of the miracle it must have taken a real measure of
         faith to leave their chosen occupation for an uncertain livelihood as
1        followers of an itinerant teacher who, up to this time, had apparently
         had small success. . . . On the part of the disciples there was not the
         least hesitancy. The decision to dissolve their successful partnership as
         fishermen for a higher partnership with Jesus as fishers of men was
         made instantly and intelligently. They needed no time to think things
         over, no time to provide for the needs of their families. . . . They had
2        launched out into the deep as ordinary fishermen; when they returned
         to shore they launched out by faith into the ‘deep’ to which Christ now
         called them, to fish for men.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
         p. 739.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In what ways do you need to rearrange your priorities so that
          you can glorify God more effectively and be more consistent in
3         your discipleship?

          ●
          2 In reference to Thursday’s lesson, what are the advantages
          that we today have over the disciples? What are the things that
          we know about that they did not? Make a list of these things and
          bring them to class. Discuss what you each find and then ask
          yourselves: What are we doing with these advantages to help us
          grow in grace ourselves? How can these advantages help us go
          out and make disciples?

          ●
          3 Dwell more on the question regarding the call of Levi Matthew.
          In class discuss the question of prejudice against certain groups.
          What about your church as a whole? What groups of people are
          deemed outcasts in your society? How can you minister to them?
          So often churches reflect the culture around them, including the
          prejudices of that culture. How open are you to the Matthews of
          your own society? What can you do to help your own church
          overcome this terrible symptom of fallen human nature?

Growing God’s Church
by OD
   I remember the day well. My cousin Tulga and I were chatting in his
home in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He started talking about Jesus and invited
me to visit a Bible study he attended. I decided to go.
   I really enjoyed the small group meeting in someone’s apartment and
attended whenever I could. My new friends were different from other peo-
ple I knew. I felt safe there; no one was trying to hurt me or make me look
bad. I began to come out of my shell.
   The Bible texts they read were powerful and seemed directed straight at
me. The principles I learned helped me deal with issues in my life. I began
reading the Bible on my own, and I could see my life changing.
   Tulga told me that Sabbath was the day God had set aside as holy, that
humans changed the day of worship to Sunday. I realized he was right, that
my church didn’t teach the Bible as Adventists did. I eventually started
attending the Adventist church. After months of deep Bible study, I joined
the Adventist Church.
   I love music and play the guitar and the piano. At first I wanted to intro-
duce the livelier music that had drawn me to the Sunday church into the
Adventist church. But my new church family helped me realize that some
of this music was not appropriate to worship.
   I joined a singing group that sang several styles of music—classical, tra-
ditional, and some modern. But all the music focused on Jesus. I realized
that through our music we can touch people who don’t know Jesus yet, and
we can share our faith with other Christians.
   God gave me musical talent, and I want to use it to build up the young
church in Mongolia. I have translated some Christian songs into
Mongolian and teach them to new groups.
   Recently I helped some Korean young people hold evangelistic meet-
ings in Mongolia. After they left, I was shocked to learn that someone
wanted to sponsor me to study theology in Korea. I had finished high
school and had planned to attend a university in Mongolia and study
mechanical engineering. But I understand that this is God’s will, and I am
thrilled.
   I used to look forward to being older and having authority and power.
But now I realize that God is challenging the young people of Mongolia
to use their talents for Him while they are young.
   Your mission offerings have had a huge impact on growing the church
in Mongolia. Thank you for your support.

OD is studying theology in Korea and will return to Mongolia to minister to his people.

          LESSON            4      *January 19–25


      Lessons From Would-be
      Disciples


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 8:19–22, 19:16–26,
      Mark 10:17–23, Luke 4:16–30, 18:18–30, John 3:1–21.

Memory Text: “Another said, ‘I will follow you, Lord; but let
      me first say farewell to those at my home.’ Jesus said to him, ‘No
      one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the
      kingdom of God’ ”(Luke 9:61, 62, RSV).


            ife comes filled with mysteries at every level. From the work-

      L
      stand.
            ings of subatomic particles, to the very nature of space and time
            themselves, there is so much we do not even begin to under-

         Probably, though, of all things mysterious and hard to fathom, noth-
      ing is more so than the workings of the human heart. People, in an
      instant, for reasons that seem so unknowable (perhaps even to them-
      selves), make decisions that can impact their lives in a dramatic way,
      for good or bad, for all eternity. No wonder that Scripture, when talk-
      ing about the heart, says, “Who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9).
         This week we will look at some would-be disciples and the decision
      of their hearts.

The Week at a Glance: What do the Gospels say about
      would-be disciples? What lessons may we learn from their experi-
      ences that can inform our discipleship, strengthen our faith, and
      deepen our commitment?

      The Scribe
Read Matthew 8:19, 20 (see also Luke 9:57, 58). What is the point of
      this story? What message is here for us? What principles can we
      take from it?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

          Here is a case of someone who, not specifically called by Jesus,
      volunteered instead. Notice, too, just how intense his profession was.
      He would follow the Lord anywhere. It is easy, even for a true follower
      of the Lord, to make all sorts of pronouncements about being faithful
      (Luke 22:33); it is not so easy, however, to follow up on them (vss.
      55–61).

When was the last time you made some bold promise of faithfulness
      to God that you later broke? What lesson did you learn from that
      experience?

         What also is interesting about this encounter is that the person who
      came to Jesus with that profession was a scribe, one of the educated
      elite in Israel. They were men of “culture, education, and station in
      life.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 365. Few scribes identi-
      fied with Jesus; they were too upstanding. They followed Him, not to
      be influenced by His teaching but to entrap Him. Yet, here was a scribe
      who was touched by Jesus’ teaching to the extent that he volunteered
      to become a disciple.
         Yet, Jesus knew the heart, and His response shows that, perhaps, this
      scribe’s motives were not pure. He may have wanted to join himself to
      Jesus in hopes of gaining worldly advantage. Christ’s response, how-
      ever, quickly should have disabused him of any such notions. In the
      end, the text does not tell us what the ultimate choice of this scribe was.
      From what Jesus said, it is not hard to imagine the scribe turning away.

       How do we understand what was happening with this scribe and
       with, for instance, Christ’s words in Mark 10:30? Are we not
       promised some immediate advantages in following Jesus now?
       If so, why is it not wrong to want those advantages? Or is it?


                                                                             31

     An Unnamed Disciple
Read Matthew 8:21, 22. How do you understand what is going on
     here? Why would Jesus say something like this to a person who
     first wanted to bury his own father?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Yesterday we viewed a scribe who sought discipleship. Today we
     encounter another volunteer, but one who is neither named as an indi-
     vidual or identified with a specific group. Examining the narrative,
     one wonders if Jesus was not unreasonable in His expectations. The
     man asked to bury his father, and in the Jewish faith it was a sacred
     duty to ensure a decent burial for a parent. What is going on?
        Contrary to popular belief, the young man’s father was neither dead
     nor even at the point of death. It was even possible that he was at the
     time “enjoying good health, and the time of his death was indefinitely
     in the future.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 366. If this is
     so, why did the man answer the way he did? Was it an excuse, one that
     Jesus saw through? Because the dead were usually buried the same
     day, had his father actually died, there would not have been a problem,
     because he could have attended to matters and then returned to disci-
     pleship.
        This man’s response revealed his character. In contrast to the
     scribe’s hastiness and impulsiveness, he was slow, lethargic, lacking in
     zeal for the work, indecisive, and prone to procrastination. He was in
     fact delaying his discipleship to the indefinite future because he did
     not want to make an immediate commitment. If he did not commit
     right then, he would perhaps never commit. The man was, apparently,
     saying that he could begin discipleship only when the time was con-
     venient for him. Furthermore, Jesus wanted it known that because of
     the limited time He had for ministry and training disciples, disciple-
     ship required undivided attention and full commitment.

      Is the Lord calling you to do something (End a relationship?
      Give up a habit? Be faithful in tithe? Witness to someone?) that
      you intend to do, but not now? What are the dangers of delaying?

     The Rich Young Ruler
Read Mark 10:17–23 (see also Matt. 19:16–26, Luke 18:18–30). What
     lessons can we pull from the story of this would-be disciple?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Today’s lesson covers a colorful character. He did not come either
     timidly or under cover. He made a grand entrance. Mark says he ran
     to Jesus and fell on his knees before Him. While Mark and Matthew
     do not name the man, Luke says he was a ruler and thus perhaps a
     member of the honored council of the Jews. Matthew says that he was
     young. The name, the “rich young ruler,” is a composite description
     derived from all three accounts.
       In Jesus’ presence, he immediately began a discussion, seeking, it
     seems, to flatter Jesus, who did not fall for the flattery. Instead, Jesus
     went right to the heart of his question, pointing the man to the law of
     God.

Why would Jesus, who knew that salvation could not be attained by
     works of the law (Rom. 3:28, Gal. 2:16), point him toward the law?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       In a certain sense, the answer to that question is found in the
     response of the young man. Though he kept the law, he sensed that it
     was not enough. Something was missing, which is why he asked,
     “What lack I yet?” (Matt. 19:20). In other words, though he out-
     wardly, in his actions, seemed a faithful follower of the Lord, some-
     thing more was needed. Jesus’ words, and the man’s response to those
     words, showed that his heart was not truly converted. By pointing him
     to the commandments, Jesus showed him that true salvation is mani-
     fested in an obedience to the law that involves death to self. The man’s
     wealth had become an idol to him, and Jesus showed him that, despite
     his outward propriety, his treasure was on earth, not in heaven, and he
     needed a radical change of heart.

      You might be keeping the commandments, at least outwardly, but
      where is your treasure? What reasons do you have for justifying
      your answer?


                                                                           33

     Nicodemus
       One of the most famous accounts in the New Testament is that of
     Nicodemus, who came to Jesus by night and asked the question, “How
     can these things be?” (John 3:9).
Read John 3:1–21. What “things” was Nicodemus asking about?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       How interesting that Jesus would be talking to Nicodemus about the
     workings of the Holy Spirit when, in fact, it was obvious from
     Nicodemus’s words and actions that he himself was being convicted
     by the Holy Spirit. For him to come to Jesus, not to try to trap him (as
     so many of his contemporaries did) but to learn, shows the sincerity
     of his heart.

What can we learn from Christ’s words about discipleship from what
     He said to Nicodemus?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus’ response to Nicodemus not only was tailored to his needs but,
     in John’s Gospel, serves to identify suitable and unsuitable character-
     istics for discipleship. It says that physical birth and descent from the
     Jewish nation are insufficient for authentic discipleship. Discipleship
     presupposes a rebirth that unites one with the heavenly realm and
     opens one up to the constant working of the Holy Spirit. That
     Nicodemus misunderstood all this even further revealed the inade-
     quacy of merely being born a Jew or being born into the right family;
     it also provided an opportunity for further instruction on the nature of
     discipleship. Although Nicodemus did not make an immediate and
     open response to discipleship, he at times acted as a secret disciple. At
     least initially, he was a would-be disciple, because he did not commit
     then. As we know, that later changed (John 19:39).

      You might be of right descent; that is, you might be in the right
      church, with the right doctrines and teaching. Why, though, is
      that not enough? How can we avoid the danger of thinking that
      membership in the right church, or even knowledge of true doc-
      trines, is all that we need?

     Herd Mentality
       Salvation, we know, is personal. We are not saved in bunches; we
     are not corporately brought into the kingdom of heaven (see Ezek.
     14:20). In the end, we each will have to answer for our own deeds, not
     for the deeds of others (Rom. 14:12).
       Nevertheless, most of us do not live in isolation. We are in contact
     with other people, and we influence others, just as we are influenced
     by them. It is just part of human nature, even unfallen human nature
     (see Gen. 3:6), that we influence one another, either for good or for
     evil. How unfortunate that, unless we are careful, the influences can
     be negative.

Read Luke 4:16–30. What happened here? Why did the people, as a
     group, act as they did? What led to the downfall of these would-be
     disciples?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Though at first they all marveled at His words, once those words
     became cutting, they turned, en masse, against Him. Imagine if some
     would-be disciple there, instead of succumbing to anger, submitted to
     the rebuke humbly. Who knows what his or her influence might have
     been on the others? Instead, it says that they all in the synagogue
     became angry, so angry that they tried to kill Him. No doubt each
     one’s anger influenced another, and then another, until the whole syna-
     gogue, who had come there to worship the Lord, in a spasm of anger
     sought to kill Him instead. Had any one of these people encountered
     Jesus’ rebuke on a one-to-one basis, they might have been angry, but
     most likely they would have walked away. Now, though, feeling the
     strength of a mob, they acted in a horrible way.

      How easily influenced are you by the crowd, by the prejudices
      and teachings of your own society and culture? What practical
      steps could you take that could help protect you from the dan-
      gers of this herd mentality?

            “In this age of diseased piety and perverted principle, those who

         spirituality. Those who have a knowledge of the truth as it is revealed
         in God’s word must now come to the front. My brethren, God requires
         this of you. Every jot of your influence is now to be used on the right
         side. All are now to learn how to stand in defense of truth that is wor-

             “But while Nicodemus had not publicly acknowledged Christ, he
         had in the Sanhedrin council repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the
         priests to destroy Him. When at last Christ had been lifted up on the
         cross, Nicodemus remembered the words that He had spoken to him
2        in the night interview on the Mount of Olives, ‘As Moses lifted up the
         serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up’
         (John 3:14); and he saw in Jesus the world’s Redeemer.”—Ellen G.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Has there ever been a time when you got caught up in a herd
          mentality, when you went along with the crowd, perhaps in a fit
3
          of emotion, and did something you later regretted? If so, what
          have you learned from that experience that could help protect
          you from doing the same thing again?

          ●
          2 Think more about the point addressed earlier this week
          regarding the idea that being part of the true church is not
          enough. What message is there for us as Seventh-day Adventists?
          How are we in danger of falling into that same trap, that idea
          that because we believe that we have truth, that is all we need? In
          class, talk about how we can protect ourselves from that delusion.

          ●
          3 Review the reason that these would-be disciples used to not
          make a commitment (with, we know for sure, the exception of
          Nicodemus). What other excuses do people use? How can we as a
          church help those who are struggling with this momentous deci-
          sion?

          ●
          4 What’s the difference between being a “believer” and being a
          disciple?

Crash Course in Faith
by JOHN MAKEUSA
   I was a new believer. I boarded a small passenger plane in the Congo to
fly to another city. Halfway to our destination in torrential rain, the navi-
gation system developed a problem. Then one engine stopped. The pilot
descended to look for a place to land.
   I prayed as the pilot struggled to bring the plane down safely. Then the
other engine stopped working. Without power we had no control over the
plane. I prayed earnestly, “Lord, if You have work for me to do, please save
us.”
   We crashed onto the savannah and flipped over, tumbling to a stop. My
seatbelt broke, and I was knocked unconscious. I awoke lying outside the
plane. I had neck and leg injuries and couldn’t walk. We saw no one
around and had no idea where to go for help, so we slept fitfully by the
plane that night.
   The next morning we saw two men paddling a canoe down a nearby
river and shouted at them. Because it was a time of war, the men thought
we were military and took us to the guerilla army headquarters nearby.
These soldiers could have killed us, for we were from “enemy” territory.
But God protected us, and the soldiers fed us and bandaged our wounds.
   A week later when we were able to walk, soldiers marched us to their
commander, 130 miles (200 kilometers) away. When we arrived four days
later, the commander questioned us. I told him I was an Adventist
Christian, not a soldier. He held us for a month. During this time I shared
my faith, and one soldier asked how to become a Christian. I told him all
that I knew and prayed with him as he accepted Jesus as his Lord. When
we were set free, we walked toward the Tanzanian border to find help.
   Soldiers at the border arrested us, thinking we were soldiers. They held
us for more than two months. Throughout our ordeal I shared my faith
with the pilot and other passengers as well as with our captors. We prayed
together, and the other men asked me to pray for them, as well.
   When finally we were freed to return home, we had been gone four
months. Everyone thought we were dead. What gladness when we arrived!
What rejoicing when I testified how God had saved us, not once but four
times, and helped me share my faith with strangers. The experience helped
me know I can trust God in everything.
   Evangelism takes many forms, and your mission offerings make evan-
gelism possible.

          LESSON            5      *January 26–February 1


      Gender and
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Mark 5:25–34, Luke
      1:26–38, 8:1–3, 10:38–42, John 4:4–30.

Memory Text: “Then Mary said, ‘Here am I, the servant of the
      Lord; let it be with me according to your word’ ” (Luke 1:38,
      NRSV).

                 omen were, one way or another, intimately involved in

      W          Christ’s ministry, even from the start. Mary, His earthly
                 mother, gave birth to the infant Jesus. Of course, only a
      woman could have done that, but her example of faith and submission
      remains a powerful one for all who would seek to be a disciple of
      Jesus. Then, all through the Gospels, we can see the crucial role of
      women. From Mary the mother of Jesus, from the woman who
      touched His garment and was healed, to the woman at the well, and
      others, it is clear that a woman open to the prompting of God’s grace
      could be a follower and disciple of Christ.
        In an attempt to gain more insights into what it means to be a disci-
      ple, this week we will take a look at how Jesus interacted with some
      women.

The Week at a Glance: What incredible things was Mary,
      Jesus’ mother, asked to accept on faith? What does the Bible say
      about the role of women in the ministry of Jesus? What can we
      learn about discipleship from the story of the woman at the well?

      “Be It Unto Me”
Read Luke 1:26–38. Try to place yourself in the position of Mary.
      What can we learn about her character from these verses? What
      very difficult things was she told to believe?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Even in an ancient society, where the concept of the supernatural
      was much more readily accepted than it is in many of our modernistic,
      scientific cultures, the angel’s words to Mary must have stretched her
      faith to the limits. First, she would be pregnant though still a virgin.
      Had that ever happened before in the history of the world? If that were
      not hard enough, her child would be the Son of God. Her question,
      “How shall this be?” was natural and normal enough. But once the
      angel pointed her to the miracle of her cousin Elisabeth, who con-
      ceived in old age (Luke 1:5–25), and then gave her the powerful re-
      assurance, “For with God nothing shall be impossible” (vs. 37), Mary
      responded with an affirmation of faith and acceptance.

Read prayerfully and carefully her response to the angel: “Be it unto
      me, according to thy word” (vs. 38). What kind of attitude does
      this reveal? What kind of model of faith does Mary’s example pro-
      vide for us?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        After centuries of theological discussion on the question of the
      Incarnation (the coming of Jesus in humanity), the subject remains an
      incredible mystery. Imagine how much this young woman did not
      understand about what was happening to her. And yet, even with all
      she did not know, she surrendered herself in faith to the Lord and
      wanted His will to be done.

       As with Mary, we are asked to believe in things we do not fully
       understand. Compare your spirit to the spirit of faith Mary rep-
       resented here. How open are you to trusting God on the things
       you just do not understand?

      Female Followers of Jesus
Luke 8:1–3 describes Jesus’ second Galilean tour. Besides the Twelve
      original disciples, who else accompanied Jesus on this tour?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Luke is very explicit that women accompanied Jesus on His mis-
      sionary tours. This should not be surprising, because Luke’s Gospel
      emphasizes the salvation and the release Jesus brought to the outcasts,
      the women.
         “Luke is the only gospel writer to record many of the details of the
      early life of Jesus, and often does so from the viewpoint of the women
      most concerned—Mary, Elisabeth, and Anna. . . . It is as if Luke were
      saying the gospel of the kingdom of heaven was as much for women as
      for men, and that their part in its proclamation was equally impor-
      tant.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 769, 770.
         Jesus’ act of allowing female disciples was unique. Various religious
      movements in that time did not include women. Some teachers said that
      women were emptyheaded, were not to be taught, should not be seen in
      public with men, and should be confined to the home and domestic arts.
      Yet, from the earliest pages of the Gospel right up to the end, women, in
      one way or another, were involved in the life and mission of Jesus.

Read Matthew 27:55, 56 and Mark 15:40, 41. What more do they add
      about the role of women in the ministry of Jesus?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Having been healed of various maladies, some of these women
      showed their love and devotion by assisting in His work and providing
      for His sustenance. Some of them might have been widows, since they
      were part of the missionary tour and had sustenance to provide for the
      needs of Jesus and His disciples. Whatever the specifics, the Word of
      God shows that women played an important role in the earliest days of
      the church.

       Read Galatians 3:28. Looking beyond the immediate context,
       what should these words tell about how contrary to the princi-
       ples of Christ prejudice is? Examine your own heart. What atti-
       tude and prejudices might you be holding that are contrary to
       God’s Word?

     “If I May Touch His Clothes . . .”
Read Mark 5:25–34, the famous account of the woman healed from a
     distressing malady. Though the story does not portray the woman
     as a disciple per se, she displayed the kind of faith so necessary for
     discipleship.
       Notice the interesting contrast between how she approached Jesus
     and how Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, did (Mark 5:22, 23).

What were the differences between their approaches? At the same
     time, what was the one thing they apparently had in common?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        As far as we can tell, this woman had not seen Jesus before.
     According to the text, it was when she had heard of Him that she
     came. Someone had witnessed to her, telling her of this Man, and she
     moved ahead in faith, even without seeing anything for herself. This
     was her first act of faith (see also John 20:29, Heb. 11:1).
        No question; according to the texts, the woman was desperate.
     Levitical law deemed her unclean. People were not to come in physi-
     cal contact with her. If she had been married, she would not have been
     allowed intimate relations with her husband; in fact, technically, she
     would not even have been able to touch her own children. All this for
     12 years!

What was the next great act of faith on her part?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

         However secretly the woman sought to act, Jesus turned it into a
     public display. She told Him (and everyone listening) what had hap-
     pened. By giving her own testimony, she did her first act as a disciple.
     Now that the whole event was known publicly, how much easier it
     would be for her to tell others about what Jesus had done for her. She
     had come to Jesus because she had heard about Him; she now could
     tell others about Him, as well.

      Why must we continue to trust in the Lord even when healing,
      as or when we want it, does not come? If we stop trusting, what
      have we left?

                                                                         41

     Troubled by Many Things
       In order to be a disciple, we need to know Jesus personally. We must
     have a close relationship with Him. This can come only by spending
     time with Him. In our busy lives, with so many important things vying
     for our time, how easy it is to get caught up in things, even good and
     important things, and let our relationship with God slip.

Read Luke 10:38–42. How does this episode reveal how even good
     things can distract us from what is most important? What message
     for you can be found in the story of these two female “disciples”?

        Mary heard His word. No one can be a true disciple who does not
     hear His word. The text said, too, that she sat at His feet. First-century
     teachers sat on high stools while their students sat at their feet on
     lower stools or the floor. To sit at one’s feet means to adopt the pos-
     ture of a disciple or learner. That she sat at Jesus’ feet meant that she
     was His student (compare Acts 22:3).
        In contrast was her sister, Martha. The Greek text says that she was
     “drawn away” by much serving. In one sense, this could be under-
     standable. After all, the Master had come to their house, so it was their
     responsibility to tend to their guests’ needs. At the same time, her plea
     that her sister help also echoed customary conventional values and
     expectations. Mary’s place was in the kitchen—the part of the house-
     hold designated for women—not in the dining area with the men.
        Yet, Jesus did not rebuke Mary; He chided Martha. He named her
     twice, perhaps showing concern. Martha’s complaints were justified,
     but Jesus’ rebuke reminds us there are issues more important than
     other necessary things. We all need to take heed, for sometimes we
     allow the urgent to crowd out the important or the good to exclude the
     vital and necessary.

      How can you find the proper balance in your own life between
      things that must be done and spending time at the feet of Jesus?
      What adjustments might you need to make? At the same time,
      can one ever be too much like Mary and not enough like
      Martha? If so, how?

     The Woman at the Well
Read John 4:4–30. How did Jesus go about winning the confidence of
     this woman and, essentially, turning her into a disciple?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The process of winning the woman of Samaria deserves the most
     careful study on the part of all who set out to win others to Christ.
       There were four main stages in this process: (1) The awakening of
     a desire for something better (vss. 7–15); (2) The awakening of a con-
     viction of personal need (vss. 16–20); (3) The call for a decision to
     acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah (vss. 21–26); (4) The stimulus to
     action appropriate to the decision (vss. 26–30, 39–42).
       Imagine what must have gone on in the mind of this woman. First,
     this stranger, a Jew, shows her unexpected kindness. The next thing
     she knows, He reveals to her some of her deepest and darkest secrets,
     something that most likely no one but she knew. Her response, “Sir, I
     perceive that thou art a prophet” (vs. 19), is a confession, not only of
     her own sins but that Jesus is Someone special. Notice, too, that when
     the woman sought to change the subject, Jesus did not press her any-
     more with her sins. Instead, He picked up on her conversation and
     used it to point to more truth, ultimately leading her back to Himself,
     this time not as a prophet but as the Messiah. Impressed by Jesus—no
     doubt mostly by His knowledge of her secrets—the woman believed
     Him.

Look at how she witnessed to her own people (vss. 29, 39). What so
     impressed her about Jesus? Might there not have been a bit of a
     confession in her own witness? How effective was this witness?

      The Lord changed this woman, apparently no bastion of purity
      and piety, into a powerful witness for Himself. What lessons can
      you draw from this story about (1) not judging the hearts of oth-
      ers and (2) forgiveness and grace even for the worst of sinners?

                                                                          43

         Come Forth,” pp. 524–536, in The Desire of Ages.

            “The ‘one thing’ that Martha needed was a calm, devotional spirit,
         a deeper anxiety for knowledge concerning the future, immortal life,
         and the graces necessary for spiritual advancement. She needed less
1
         anxiety for the things which pass away, and more for those things
         which endure forever. Jesus would teach His children to seize every
         opportunity of gaining that knowledge which will make them wise
         unto salvation.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 525.
            “One of the characteristics of the Gospel of Luke is its frequent ref-
         erences to Christ’s ministry for the womenfolk of Palestine and the
2
         ministry of some of them on His behalf. This was something new, for
         the role of Jewish women in public life had been a relatively minor
         one, although in isolated instances, prophets like Elisha had minis-
         tered to women and been ministered to by them.”—The SDA Bible
         Commentary, vol. 5, p. 769.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Go back over the story of Mary being told about becoming

3         Jesus’ mother. Again, think about what amazing things she was
          told to believe, things she could not possibly understand. Think
          about many of the things we Christians are told to believe that we
          cannot possibly understand. And though we do not understand
          them, we still have faith and even reasons to believe them. Bring
          your thoughts to class and, as a class, talk about these things and
          why we can and should believe them, regardless of what we do
          not understand. How can we help others who are struggling to
          believe in things that, in the end, have to be taken on faith?

          ●
          2 At a time when, in most countries, the membership of the
          church seems to be predominantly female, why should the
          church not discourage female discipleship?

          ●3 Jesus was revolutionary, transforming, liberating, innovative,
          restorative, sensitive, and supportive. No one was ignored, mar-
          ginalized, or ostracized in His presence. Contemporary disciples
          should emulate Him and model His example for all classes, cul-
          tures, genders, peoples, and nations. How can you help your local
          church be a place where all are welcomed and can find a role in
          service?

   Only a few of the teenagers attend the little mission school on our island
in southern Philippines. Most are embarrassed because they can’t read or
write and don’t want to be teased by their younger siblings who attend the
mission school. So these teenage boys spend their time diving in the coral
reefs and catching fish. They keep us supplied with fresh fish every day.
   We teachers wanted to reach these young men, but we were not sure
how. Finally we decided to try to engage them through sports. We told the
boys what we wanted to do, and they helped us clear an area to make a
simple basketball court. We found a metal ring to use as the hoop and
pooled our money to buy a basketball. Then we taught them to play. They
enjoyed the game and soon played quite well. We formed teams to encour-
age them.
   We went swimming with them and invited them to eat at our cottage.
Sometimes we worshiped with them in their Mosque. We became friends.
   During a group massage session we held for the boys, some of them
opened their hearts to us. They talked about problems they faced, and we
listened. Little by little we realized that they noticed we don’t smoke, don’t
drink fermented coconut juice, and don’t eat shellfish. Their religion for-
bids these things, but they do them anyway.
   One day they expressed their questions to us. “Teacher,” one said. “You
are different from most Christians we know. You don’t smoke or drink
alcohol or eat pork as most Christians do. Our elders tell us that smoking
and drinking alcohol is bad because it destroys the Masjid [temple] of
Allah.
   “We Muslims worship on Friday, and most Christians worship on
Sunday. You Adventists are a bridge between Muslims and Christians, and
you worship on Saturday. Thus, you live the life of true Islam. That is why
we respect you as you live up to what a true child of Allah should be. Thus,
we will call you Chrislams, which means Christians who live as Islam.”
   We were humbled as we realized that our actions had spoken so clearly
what our mouths couldn’t say to these sincere and open young sons of
Islam. Pray for them as they search for the path to the living God. Pray for
the student missionaries who teach these children of Allah to truly live for
Him.
   Our mission offerings help support Mountain View College, which
sends student missionaries throughout southern Philippines.

          LESSON            6       *February 2–8


      Ethnicity and
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 15:21–28; Luke
      7:1–11; John 1:3; Acts 10:28, 34, 35; 11:25–30.

Memory Text: “I have become all things to all men, that I might
      by all means save some” (1 Corinthians 9:22, RSV).

          im felt called to take the gospel to a foreign country. Upon arrival,

      J   he discovered that the people had a test for foreigners to earn the
          right to stay among them. The foreigner had to swallow, and not
      regurgitate, a potion. If the person failed the test, he or she had to
      leave immediately; otherwise, they could be eaten by the tribe. Jim
      watched the tribe prepare the potion of milk, human saliva, blood,
      chewed-up herbs, and other herbal concoctions. It looked and smelled
      sickening. All he could do was pray—and drink. To everyone’s amaze-
      ment (especially his own), Jim drank it and held it down, earning the
      right to remain.
         Making disciples might require us to do strange things: eat or drink
      strange mixtures and be all things to all people so we can win some.
      This is the call and challenge of discipleship, especially as the gospel
      goes around the world and into cultures sometimes radically different
      from our own.

The Week at a Glance: What other examples do we have
      of Jesus ministering to others besides Jews? Who were the God-
      fearers, and what can we learn from them about discipleship?
      What can we learn today from the Antioch model of discipleship?

     Disciples Among the Samaritans
Look up the following texts. What can we learn from them about
     God’s attitude toward all races and people? John 1:3; Acts 10:28,
     34, 35; 17:26–28; Heb. 2:9.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Scripture is clear: Not only did Christ create all humanity, He died
     for all humanity as well, regardless of race, nationality, or ethnic ori-
     gin. The universality of Christ’s death, the fact that His death was for
     every human being, should be more than enough to show us how
     repugnant prejudice is to God.
        It is no wonder, then, that when Jesus was here, He ministered not
     just to the Jews but to non-Jews, as well. Though Paul is understood
     to be the apostle to the Gentiles, Jesus was already witnessing to them
     when here in the flesh.

Read Luke 17:11–16 and John 4:39–42. What is going on here? What
     message should we take away from these texts?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Last week’s lesson showed that the woman at the well left her water
     pots and went to invite the villagers to meet Jesus after He had told
     her everything she ever did. She even introduced the possibility of His
     being the Messiah. Scripture says that many of the villagers believed
     because of the woman’s testimony. When they met Jesus, they per-
     suaded Him to stay, presumably to teach them.
       The story of the ten lepers (Luke 17:11–16) also speaks to Jesus’ work
     for Samaritans. The tenth leper, who returned to give thanks, was a
     Samaritan. By praising God in a loud voice, he showed his gratefulness
     for what Jesus had done for him. Jesus told this Samaritan that his faith
     had made him well. The Greek word used for this healing denotes the
     idea of being saved. This implies that the Samaritan’s faith had saved him
     not only physically but spiritually. Jesus also called the Samaritan a for-
     eigner. Despite knowing him to be a Samaritan and a foreigner, Jesus did
     not discriminate against him but rewarded his faith. These encounters
     show that Jesus did not conform to the prejudices of His time.
      It is one thing to say we should not harbor prejudice against
      anyone; it is another, actually, to be free of these poisonous emo-
      tions. What practical steps can you take to help break the bonds
      of prejudice in your own heart?
                                                                            47

     The God-Fearers
       In the first century, some Gentiles were called God-fearers. They
     nominally accepted Judaism, made gifts to synagogues, and attended
     Sabbath services. They did not, however, submit to proselyte baptism
     or adopt all the rabbinic regulations. One such God-fearer was the
     centurion of Luke 7:1–11.

Read Luke 7:1–11. From these texts, what can we learn about the
     faith and character of this Gentile disciple?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        For Jesus, the faith of this centurion “was an earnest of the work
     which the gospel was to accomplish among the Gentiles. With joy He
     looked forward to the gathering of souls from all nations to His king-
     dom.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 317.
        Acts 10 mentions another Roman official. Cornelius was a devout
     God-fearer and a centurion. He was generous to the needy and prayed
     earnestly to God. God sent an angel to inform him of the acceptance
     of his gifts and prayers and sent him in search of Peter. Peter went to
     his home, contrary to Jewish scruples, and was even reprimanded for
     it. But God told him not to call common or unclean those, like
     Cornelius, whom He had cleansed.
        As Peter preached to Cornelius’s assembled household (Acts
     10:44–46), the Holy Spirit interrupted him with the Gentile Pentecost,
     to the amazement of his Jewish companions.

Read Acts 11:1–3. What was the reaction of the Jewish followers of
     Jesus? What makes that reaction so shocking to us today? What
     message can we take away from their actions?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Here they were, themselves followers of Jesus, yet not understand-
     ing the fullness of the gospel. How careful we should be not to allow
     any cultural, educational, or social influences contrary to the princi-
     ples of Christ to hinder us from living to the fullest the profession we
     claim for ourselves.

     The Canaanite
       At one point in His ministry, Jesus withdrew to the regions of Tyre
     and Sidon. He had to, in a sense, get out of town because things were
     getting tense with the leaders. In this Gentile territory He entered a
     house but did not want anyone to know it (Mark 7:24). Yet, a
     Canaanite woman soon found Him.

Read Matthew 15:21–28 and answer the following questions:

     1. Why did the woman call Jesus by a Messianic name, “Son of
     David”? What did that imply concerning her knowledge of Jesus?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     2. How did His disciples react to her, and why was that typical of
     them?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     3. What kind of appeal did she make? How helpless is she?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     4. What things happened that should have discouraged her but did
     not?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Despite coming from a despised nation that had a long history of
     enmity with Israel, despite being ignored at first by Jesus, despite the
     attitude of the disciples, even despite Christ’s own words to her at first,
     she knew that Jesus was her only hope. Perhaps it was a tenacity born
     out of desperation. Who knows? But in the end, we are all just as
     dependent upon Christ, whether we acknowledge it or not.
        Jesus also has a powerful lesson for His own disciples. Christ’s pur-
     pose was to teach them about the need to work for non-Jews, and this
     He did by acting out the contrast between the usual attitudes and His
     own. These Twelve had a lot to learn about what it meant to be disciples.

      Look again at this woman. What can we learn from her attitudes,
      actions, words, and faith that can make us better disciples?
                                                                            49

     Philip and the Ethiopian Official
      One of the most fascinating stories about discipleship is found in
     Acts 8:26–40. It is the story of Philip and the eunuch.

Read the whole story (Acts 8:26–40) and answer the following ques-
     tions:

     1. What indications show us that this man already had some
     knowledge of truth and was a seeker after truth?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     2. What role did the Scriptures play in his becoming a disciple?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     3. What can we learn about discipleship from the role of Philip in
     this story? What characteristics did Philip show that made him
     such an effective witness for the Lord?
     ____________________________________________________________________

       In this story, providence played a powerful role, did it not? After
     obeying the angel, Philip met the eunuch on the road. Interesting, too,
     that Philip was to go from Jerusalem to Gaza (What symbolism do
     you see there?). The Ethiopian was, apparently, another God-fearer.
     He also just happened to be reading the Bible, and not only the
     Scripture but Isaiah, and not only Isaiah but the greatest Messianic
     prophecy in all the Bible, chapter 53. This chapter, of course, depicts
     Christ’s substitutionary death for us. Then, after Philip explained to
     him the meaning of the Scripture, they came to a certain water, and the
     eunuch wanted to be baptized. Everything fell right into place.

      Read Acts 8:39. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing, surely
      about His newfound discovery of Jesus’ dying for His sins. We
      say that faith is not feeling and that we need to maintain faith
      even when we feel bad. At the same time, why should we, as dis-
      ciples who have been forgiven our sins through the death of
      Jesus, always have a place in our heart for rejoicing, regardless
      of our immediate circumstances?

     The Antioch Church
       The persecution that followed the stoning of Stephen and the pre-
     conversion activities of Saul of Tarsus took the gospel to many lands.
     Among the places it went was Syrian Antioch, where the first orga-
     nized presentation of the gospel for Gentiles occurred. Luke says that
     the Lord was with this initiative and that “a great number of people
     believed and turned to the Lord” (Acts 11:21, NIV). So phenomenal
     was the growth that the Jerusalem leaders sent Barnabas to assist
     them.
       Upon his arrival, Barnabas secured the help of Saul of Tarsus for
     this discipleship mission. This had a positive effect on the church. It
     not only caused the church to grow but also gave it a sense of social
     concern, stewardship, and mission.

Read Acts 11:25–30. What were the issues? How did the church
     respond? What lessons can we take away from this account for our
     mission today?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Notice, too, that when Paul and Barnabas got to Antioch, they
     taught much people for a year. What should that tell us about the
     importance of teaching in the question of discipleship?

        Acts 13:1–3 reveals more about the makeup of the early church. We
     know that Barnabas was a Cypriot Jew; Saul, of course, came from
     Tarsus, another city that was not part of Israel proper. Manaen was
     either a good friend or foster-brother of Herod Antipas. Simeon was
     called Niger, the Latin word for “black.” Lucius hailed from Cyrene in
     North Africa. This means that the leadership of the church was ethni-
     cally diverse, with some of the leaders not being Jews at all.
        These leaders took their discipleship seriously. They worshiped the
     Lord with fasting and prayer. It was to this church, one that took disciple-
     ship seriously, that the Spirit revealed God’s will for missions. Saul
     and Barnabas were commissioned and consecrated to take the gospel
     to the ends of the earth in fulfillment of Acts 1:8.
        Thus, we see in these texts mission, teaching, consecration, and dedi-
     cation of both Jew and Gentile, as the cornerstones of discipleship.

      The needs of others present the church with great opportunities
      for service and witness. No doubt there are a great many needs
      around you. How well have you taken advantage of these needs
      to serve others and to witness to them about Jesus?

                                                                             51

           “He [the Centurion] had not seen the Saviour, but the reports he
         heard had inspired him with faith. Notwithstanding the formalism of
         the Jews, this Roman was convinced that their religion was superior to
         his own. Already he had broken through the barriers of national preju-
         dice and hatred that separated the conquerors from the conquered

         people. He had manifested respect for the service of God, and had
         shown kindness to the Jews as His worshipers. In the teaching of
         Christ, as it had been reported to him, he found that which met the
         need of the soul. All that was spiritual within him responded to the
         Saviour’s words.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 315.

    Discussion Questions:
3         ●1 Look more closely at the Antioch model. What things could
          your local church learn from this model that could make it a
          more effective witness for Christ?

          ●
          2 As a church, the Adventists are very good at getting people to
          join, as our growing numbers of baptisms prove. We are, though,
          struggling with the question of discipleship, the question of what
          to do with these people after we baptize them. As we know, far
          too many who join soon leave. What are your own thoughts on this
          problem? What has been your experience with being discipled
          after you were baptized and joined the church? What do you
          wish might have been done differently with you? What do you
          think your local church could do, must do, to disciple new mem-
          bers better? Be prepared to talk about this issue in your Sabbath
          School class.

          3 The eunuch was reading Isaiah 53. Go over the chapter and
          review what it tells us about the death of Jesus on our behalf. What
          does the text tell us that Jesus did for us? What hope does it offer?
          Why is it so important to keep His death for us at the forefront of
          all our witnessing? Why is it so important that we keep the Cross
          at the front and center of all our discipling, as well?

Are You Sure?
by HOMER TRECARTIN
   Raquel’s parents are church planters for their denomination in Brazil.
Their first church plant has 10,000 members, and their second numbered
2,000 when Raquel moved to the United States to study.
   Raquel missed home and yearned to hear her native Portuguese. She
met a Brazilian Adventist couple who befriended her and invited her to
church. She went once, but she loved her own church.
   A year later the Adventist couple told Raquel that they were planting a
new church and invited her to visit. Raquel went and felt drawn to this
group. She began studying the Bible and shared what she was learning
with her parents.
   Raquel’s worried mother pleaded, “Those Adventists are a cult. They
will brainwash you.” Raquel explained that no one was brainwashing her,
she was just studying the Bible. But her mother worried even more.
   Then her brother came to visit. Raquel knew that her parents had sent
him to “straighten her out,” but she was glad to have family nearby. David
insisted that they attend their family church on Sunday, and Raquel
agreed—provided David attended the Adventist church with her on
Sabbath. David thought he would see how this cult was misleading her.
   Three months later David and Raquel were still attending the Adventist
church on Sabbath and their family’s church on Sunday. David studied the
Bible, too, trying to prove Raquel wrong. When Raquel decided to be bap-
tized, David asked her, “Are you sure you want to do this? You know what
it is going to do to Mother and Father.”
   “Yes, David,” Raquel replied. “It will break their hearts, but I have to
follow Jesus.”
   She noticed tears on David’s cheeks. Then David said, “Raquel, I want
to be baptized with you.”
   When they told their parents the news, their mother cried. But their
father said simply, “Be faithful to what you believe God wants you to do.”
   Raquel’s parents came to the United States for her wedding. They vis-
ited the Adventist church with their children. It seemed strange to them,
but they saw the deep love Raquel and David have for Jesus. They still
attend the church they planted in Brazil, but they are studying the things
Raquel and David are sharing with them.
   Your mission offerings help plant new churches such as the one Raquel
and David attend.

      Preparation for
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matthew 5–7, 10:1,
      10:5–11:1, Mark 3:1–19, Luke 6:12–16.

Memory Text: “You are the light of the world. A city built on a
      hill cannot be hid. No one after lighting a lamp puts it under the
      bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the
      house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that
      they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in
      heaven” (Matthew 5:14–16, NRSV).
              disciple is a learner/follower of Jesus Christ who constantly

      A       seeks to become like the Master. Just as Jesus trained and sent
              out His disciples, every local church must inaugurate an effec-
      tive program for the facilitating, encouraging, and developing of disci-
      ples. After all, what good does it do us if the folk we baptize soon leave?
      We are not being faithful to our Divine commission, because Jesus said,
      “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
      the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” (Matt. 28:19); yet,
      the word translated “teach” comes from the Greek word that also means
      “to make a disciple.” (Indeed, numerous versions translate it in that
      manner.)
         This week we will look at preparation for discipleship.
The Week at a Glance: How did Jesus prepare His disci-
      ples? What principles can we learn for ourselves regarding disciple-
      ship from what He said to them before sending them out? What can
      we learn from the Sermon on the Mount that is crucial for disciple-
      ship? What kind of opposition should disciples of Christ expect?

     The Appointing of the Apostles
        Mark 3 begins with Jesus entering a synagogue and healing a man
     with a withered hand on the Sabbath, one of His famous Sabbath heal-
     ings. A great irony is found in these texts (Mark 3:1–12): The rulers
     sought how they might kill Him, while great multitudes of people
     flocked after Him. One group feared His power; another coveted to be
     blessed and benefited by it.

Read Mark 3:13–18. What was happening here? See also Luke
     6:12–16.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        From both accounts, it seems that at some point Jesus got away
     from the great multitude that followed Him, taking with Him a select
     group of disciples. From among this group of disciples, He then
     picked out twelve to do the work of apostles.
        For this task, Jesus chose the ones He wanted. This implies, as we
     have seen, that the initiative resides with Him. He extends the call; we
     respond. This means that we must be available for service, in whatever
     capacity we are called to serve in.
        How do disciples and apostles differ? Disciples were learners. They
     followed a master to study with that master. The term apostle comes
     from two Greek words, apo and stello, implying “to send from.” An
     apostle was an ambassador or emissary sent to represent a master or a
     kingdom. While both a disciple and an apostle are students, an apos-
     tle received additional training to be sent forth as a representative of
     the master or organization.
        Jesus appointed the Twelve so that they might be with Him and that
     He might send them out to preach. Matthew says that, He “gave them
     authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sick-
     ness” (Matt. 10:1, NIV). It appears He chose them to provide trained
     workers to assist in caring for the large throngs that flocked wherever
     He went (adapted from The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 322).

      How content are you with the work that you are doing for the
      Lord? Should you be doing more? Could you be doing more?
      What is holding you back? In most cases, is it not your own
      pride and selfishness?



                                                                         57

      The Sermon on the Mount
        Many see the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) as Jesus’ inau-
      gural address, in which He outlined the ethics of His kingdom. It is
      also, in many ways, a manifesto of discipleship, for it holds the keys
      to being a faithful disciple of Christ.

Read Matthew 5:1. What was the background of the sermon? To
      whom did He immediately give it?
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Who knows how many books have been written expounding upon
      this sermon? For our purposes, we want to look at what things in it are
      especially pertinent to what it means to be a disciple of Jesus.

Read Matthew 5:13–16. What is the message there for us, as disciples
      of Christ? Why are these words particularly important to us as
      Adventists, given our understanding of the three angels’ messages
      of Revelation 14:6–12?

       Read Matthew 6:19–21. Why are these words, in many ways, the
       essence of what true discipleship is about? Ask yourself, “Where
       is my treasure [That is, where is my heart?], in heaven or on
       earth?” If you do not like the answer, what can you do to
       change?

     The Sermon on the Mount, Continued
        As said in a previous lesson, one of the greatest struggles we face
     as a church is retaining new members, keeping them in the flock after
     we baptize them. All this is linked with the theme of discipleship, the
     theme of teaching people what it means to be a follower of Christ, a
     citizen in His new kingdom. The Sermon on the Mount is filled with
     illustrations and teachings that all disciples of Christ must learn to fol-
     low. As we continue studying the sermon, ask yourself, “How can I
     apply these teachings in my own life? Also, how can our church bet-
     ter teach these things to new members, to make them better disciples
     of Christ?”

Read Matthew 7:1–5. What important lesson, and warning, is given
     there that is crucial for all disciples of Christ to learn? What does
     it mean not to judge?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     I, myself, bearing?”

       It is one thing to profess being a follower, a student, or a disciple of
     Christ; it is another to be one. As we seek to make disciples, or to be
     good disciples ourselves, we must not forget the clear words of Jesus
     in the following texts.

      Read Matthew 7:24–27. Why is it important to understand what
      Jesus is saying here? What issues are, literally, at stake here?
      How do we understand these words with the other Bible prom-
      ises of salvation being by faith and not by works?

      Instructions for a Missionary Tour
         Jesus’ promise that His disciples would be fishers of men (Matt.
      4:19) was not immediately fulfilled. At first they observed His activ-
      ities. While ministering in Galilee “preaching the good news of the
      kingdom and healing every disease and sickness,” He saw the crowds
      and had compassion on them, “because they were harassed and help-
      less, like sheep without a shepherd” (Matt. 9:35, 36, NIV). He com-
      mented to His disciples, “ ‘The harvest is plentiful but the workers are
      few’ ” and invited them to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out
      workers (vs. 37, NIV).

Read Jesus’ words to the Twelve (Matt. 10:1, Matt 10:5–11:1). What prin-
      ciples are found in these words that would apply to us today in our
      work of seeking to make disciples?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        There is a lot that Christ’s modern-day disciples could learn from
      these texts. One thing, however, that should come through clearly is
      that witnessing for Christ is not going to be easy. There is going to be
      opposition, turmoil, and even, in some cases, persecution. Thus, we
      should not be surprised when these things come. What should concern
      us is when they do not.

Read again the texts for today. What kind of opposition, turmoil, and
      suffering should we expect? In what ways have you experienced in
      your own life some of what Jesus said here almost two thousand
      years ago?

      ____________________________________________________________________

       Jesus did not promise His disciples an easy time of it. The history
       of the church proves just how accurate His words were.Yet, at the
       same time, even amid these warnings, the Lord gives these men
       wonderful words of encouragement and hope. Read those words,
       those promises, and claim them for yourself. What can you take
       from them that you need in particular for yourself right now?

     Mission of the Seventy
       Luke alone mentions that Jesus appointed seventy disciples, whom
     He sent on a missionary tour (Luke 10:1–23; see also Exod. 24:1, 9).
     In many ways, His instructions were similar to what He gave to the
     Twelve. After instructing them, Jesus sent them two by two to the
     towns and places He was about to go. It appears that their mission was
     preparatory to Jesus’ own. In a sense, they were to prepare the way for
     people to accept Jesus when He came. How does that fit in with what
     we are to do today in helping prepare people to meet Jesus?

What was the advantage of sending them two by two? What can we
     take from that for ourselves today?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Luke 10:17 says the Seventy returned from their mission with joy
     because “the devils are subject unto us through thy name.” No doubt,
     they must have been thrilled at the power given them through Jesus,
     and they acknowledge that it is His power. Jesus, though, while
     acknowledging the power given them, tells them to rejoice about the
     thing that really matters.

Read Luke 10:20. Why did Jesus say this? What message is there for
     us in these words, as well?

       Doing great deeds in the name of Jesus is no guarantee of salvation
     (Matt. 7:22, 23), as some will one day find out. Spiritual position,
     church authority, and even great success at winning souls are not the
     things that really matter. What really matters is having our names writ-
     ten in heaven, names that are not blotted out (Rev. 3:5), because a
     name written in heaven means eternal life through Jesus.

      We can be so busy working for others that we neglect our own
      spiritual life and health. How can you avoid falling into that
      subtle trap? At the same time, how does working for the salva-
      tion of others strengthen your own walk with Jesus?
                                                                         61

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
         pp. 322–326, 746–750; Ellen G. White, “The Sermon on the Mount,”
         pp. 312–314; “The First Evangelists,” pp. 349–358, in The Desire of
         Ages; “The Teacher Sent from God,” pp. 79, 80, in Education; Mark
         6:6–13.

            “In that brief verse [Matthew 5:1] there are three clues to the real
         significance of the Sermon on the Mount. (i) Jesus began to teach
         when he had sat down. When a Jewish Rabbi was teaching officially
1        he sat to teach. . . . So, then, the very intimation that Jesus sat down
         to teach his disciples is the indication that this teaching is central and
         official. (ii) Matthew goes on to say that when he had opened His
         mouth, he taught them. . . . In Greek the phrase has a double signifi-
         cance. (a) In Greek it is used of a solemn, grave and dignified utter-
         ance. . . . (b) It is used of a person’s utterance when he is really open-
2        ing his heart and fully pouring out his mind. It is used of intimate
         teaching with no barriers between. . . . (iii) . . . Now the point is that
         in the Greek of this sentence, which we are studying, the verb taught
         is not an aorist [tense], but an imperfect and therefore it describes
         repeated and habitual action, and the translation should be: ‘This is
         what he used to teach them.’ Matthew has said as plainly as Greek will
         say it that the Sermon on the Mount is not one sermon of Jesus, given
         at one particular time and on one particular occasion; it is the essence
3        of all that Jesus continuously and habitually taught his disciples.”
         —William Barclay, The Gospel of Matthew (Philadelphia: The
         Westminster Press, 1975), vol. 1, pp. 86, 87.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What kind of discipleship program does your own local
          church have? What are its strong points? Its weak points? What
          practical steps can your church make to be stronger in the area
          of discipleship?

          ●2 When a person joins your local church, what can you do, per-
          sonally, to help disciple that person along? What specific gifts
          might you have that can be of help? Also, what about your
          Sabbath School class itself? What role can and should it have in
          the discipling process?

          ●3 Discipling takes disciples, those who know what it means to
          follow Jesus, to learn from Jesus, to be an imitator of Jesus. What
          did you learn this week from the texts we looked at that, if
          applied in your life, could make you better prepared to disciple
          new members?

Hope Meets Hopelessness:
Part 1
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   S. S. and Geetha Karikalan lived a comfortable life. They bought rice
from farmers and sold it to retailers. Then the government cut out the middle-
men in order to regulate the rice industry, and suddenly the Karikalans were
out of work.
   The family was desperate and talked about committing suicide. One day
two Adventist women noticed the sad-looking couple getting off the city bus
and asked if something was wrong. One of the women, Sahira, offered to
pray for the couple there beside the road. Although S. S. and Geetha were of
another religion, they accepted the prayers of these devout women. Sahira
prayed that God would help them find work and that they would also find
peace and hope in their lives.
   After Sahira prayed, the couple admitted that they had thought about sui-
cide, but because of her prayer, they felt peace. Sahira had to hurry to an
appointment, but she asked permission to visit S. S. and Geetha. The couple
gave her the address of Geetha’s parents, where they were staying. Sahira
invited the couple to visit their church that Sabbath and promised that they
would find that Jesus could meet their needs. She gave them the address.
   The couple attended the church that week. Sahira welcomed them warmly
and gave them a Bible. The next day she visited them. The couple agreed to
Bible studies, and Sahira and the pastor studied with them for several weeks.
The couple’s 13-year-old son, Santosh, joined them for the studies.
   One day the pastor needed medicine for his asthma from Santosh’s grand-
father. Santosh and his grandfather walked to the pastor’s apartment to
deliver the medicine. While Grandfather talked with the pastor, Santosh
went to the roof on the third floor of the apartment building to play cricket
                                                  with the pastor’s children.
                                                     During the game Santosh
                                                  stepped back and stretched
                                                  to catch the ball. Suddenly
                                                  he lost his balance and fell
                                                  backward off the roof.
                                                  “Lord, save me!” he cried
                                                  as he tumbled toward some
                                                  high voltage wires.

          LESSON           8       *February 16–22


      Experiencing
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 17:1–13; 18:1–4,
      24; Mark 8:27–30; John 6:43–58.

Memory Text: “And when he had called the people unto him
      with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come
      after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
      me” (Mark 8:34).
              ll through the Gospels, all through the stories of Jesus as

      A       recorded there, we can find material that will help us under-
              stand what it means to be a disciple.
        As we read, one point should come through again and again:
      Discipleship is an experience. To be a true follower of Christ, we need
      to have an experience with Jesus. We need to know Jesus; we need to
      have been changed by Jesus; we need to partake of Jesus and what He
      offers us.
        Head knowledge is not enough; being able to recite Bible texts is
      not enough; knowing doctrines is not enough. To be a disciple of
      Christ, you must have had a personal experience with Him, one that
      has changed and is still changing your life.
        This week’s lesson will help us better understand what some of
      these experiences must entail.
The Week at a Glance: What does it mean to eat the flesh
      and drink the blood of Christ? What lessons about faith can we
      learn from the Transfiguration? Why does Jesus tell us we must
      become as little children? What does it mean to bear our cross for
      Jesus?

      The Bread of Life
Read John 6:43–58. What important spiritual lesson is Jesus giving
      here? Why is what Jesus says here so important for all would-be
      disciples? Why are the truths here so important for those who seek
      to disciple others?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         It is no coincidence that Jesus expressed these words not long after
      the miracle of feeding the five thousand (John 6:1–14). The response
      of the people, however, showed that their hearts were still set on
      worldly things, that they saw Jesus as a worldly king, one who could
      meet their temporal needs. That is not why Jesus came; that was not
      His primary purpose.

What did the texts for today tell us the purpose of Jesus’ coming was?
      See also John 6:26, 27.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

          “To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as
      a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins, and that we are
      complete in Him. It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon it, by
      drinking it in, that we are to become partakers of His nature. What food
      is to the body, Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us unless
      we eat it, unless it becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of no value
      to us if we do not know Him as a personal Saviour. A theoretical
      knowledge will do us no good. We must feed upon Him, receive Him
      into the heart, so that His life becomes our life. His love, His grace,
      must be assimilated.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 389.

       What has been your own experience in eating the flesh and
       drinking the blood of Jesus? How do you do this, and what
       changes has this brought to your life? Be prepared to talk about
       your answer in class.

     Children and Discipleship
       In Matthew 18:1, the disciples came to Jesus, wondering who was
     the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Why would they be asking such
     a question? Parallel accounts show that the disciples were, in fact,
     fighting among themselves over which one of them would be the
     greatest in the kingdom of God (Mark 9:33, 34; Luke 9:46–48). This
     not only showed insensitivity but demonstrated the disciples’ poor
     understanding of the principles of humility and love, key elements of
     Jesus’ kingdom.

How did Jesus answer them? Matt. 18:1–4. What is it about children
     that make them such good examples of discipleship?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        Think about the importance of what Jesus is saying. Unless we are
     converted, unless we become as little children, we shall not enter His
     kingdom. In other words, we shall be lost!
        There are a number of ways to look at what Jesus said. Perhaps the
     key word in these texts is humble. As disciples, we must be humble,
     like children. We must realize our total need and dependency on God
     our Father, just as children realize their need of their own parents.
     Children cannot survive on their own; we cannot survive without God.
     And it is so crucial that we recognize our need. Sin began on earth
     with Adam and Eve thinking that they could do things their own way,
     apart from God.
        Children often believe, even without full understanding, what we
     tell them. In the same way, how often must we learn to believe and
     trust, without full understanding, what the Lord tells us? If we have to
     have everything about Jesus and salvation explained to us fully before
     we will believe, we will never be saved, because we will never believe.
     We must have the conversion that Jesus talked about, and conversion
     involves becoming like children, believing in what we do not fully
     understand. Plus, if we fully understood, then where would be the role
     of faith?

     The Transfiguration and Failure
       One of the most amazing experiences recorded in the Gospels is
     what is called the Transfiguration, in which God manifested His pres-
     ence in a remarkable way before the eyes of some of Christ’s disciples.

Read Matthew 17:1–13. What three specific things happened that
     should have done much to strengthen the faith of the disciples?

       Jesus never calls us to discipleship, to being a follower, without giv-
     ing us reasons to believe. Not everything, of course, is answered, but
     we are given enough reasons to have faith, enough reasons to believe
     even in what we do not fully understand. And though we might not
     witness the kind of things that the three did on the mountain, as disci-
     ples of Christ we have been given enough for us to trust in the Lord
     and in His goodness. What we do with that faith, that gift (John 1:9,
     Eph. 2:8), will determine whether it grows, stagnates, or dies away.

       The disciples had the great privilege of seeing things that most
     of us in this world never will. Still, what do the following texts
     reveal to us about them? Matt. 26:56, 69–75; Mark 9:30–32; John
     20:19. What lessons can we draw from their experiences?

      Sometimes we can get caught up in the attitude, “Oh, if only
      God would do this for me, then my faith would be stronger, or if
      God did that for me . . .” What are the dangers of such an atti-
      tude for a disciple of Christ? Instead, what positive things can
      we do to build up and utilize the faith that we already have been
      given?


                                                                          67

     The Olivet Discourse
       In Matthew 24 and 25, Jesus gives what has been called the Olivet
     discourse (because He gave it on the Mount of Olives). The disciples’
     action in pointing out the magnificence of Herod’s temple formed the
     background to Jesus’ words.

What are some of the major signs of the Advent that Jesus gave the
     disciples in the Olivet discourse?

     vss. 36–44
     ____________________________________________________________________

       There are a number of important things about discipleship that we
     can take from here. Perhaps one of the most important is that, as dis-
     ciples, we need to be aware of the spiritual dangers out there. We are
     in the midst of a great controversy, one between good and evil, one in
     which we will be subject to many deceptions, some so great that if it
     were possible even the elect would be deceived (Matt. 24:24). And,
     considering the context of Jesus’ message, as we near the end of time,
     we must be even more vigilant regarding these deceptions.
       Thus, we must be sure that we, ourselves, are firmly grounded in
     what we believe and why we believe it, and that as we bring in new
     members, discipling must include making new members aware of
     these deceptions.
       Of course, the best way always is to know the truth; to be grounded
     in what is right is the surest way to know what is error. Especially as
     we near the second coming of Jesus, how crucial that we make an
     earnest effort to help all members, especially new ones, to be aware of
     the signs of the times and dangers we can face in these times.

      False christs might not necessarily be manifested as someone
      coming and claiming to be Jesus. What are other ways we can
      be led astray by anything that usurps the place that Christ alone
      deserves in our hearts?
68
            T HURSDAY February 21

     Bearing the Cross
       In Mark 8:27–30, Jesus asks the disciples about how He is per-
     ceived by others. After getting an answer from them, He asks who they
     think He is. Of them all, Peter is recorded as confessing Jesus as the
     Christ. Jesus, though, then tells them basically not to tell others. Why
     would He say that? Wasn’t the whole point of everything He did to get
     the people to know that He was the Christ?

Why do you think Jesus told them what He did? Could there be a les-
     son here for us, as disciples, about how time and circumstances
     must be considered before we act? See also John 4:25–30.


       Notice what follows next in Mark. Jesus’ response to Peter should
     have basically affirmed for them that He was the Messiah. Imagine
     what must have gone through their minds when He started telling
     them what would happen to Him (Mark 8:31). Notice, too, it is again
     Peter who responds, the same Peter who just a few verses earlier pro-
     fessed Jesus as the Messiah (vs. 32).

Read Jesus’ response to Peter (Mark 8:33–38). What crucial message
     is Jesus giving for all who would be His disciples?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Verse 34 brings in an important element. It says that when Jesus
     called the people along with His disciples, He then began to give them
     these powerful words about what it means to be a follower, a disciple,
     of Christ. Though at that time there were certain things only a select
     few were privileged to know, this message here, about death to self,
     about bearing a cross, about losing everything for the sake of the
     gospel, was one everyone who wanted to follow Him needed to hear.

      Ask yourself this question: When was the last time I bore a cross
      for Christ? What does your answer tell you about the kind of
      disciple you truly are? What changes might you need to make,
      and how can you make them?



                                                                         69

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
         pp. 746–750, 973, 974; Ellen G. White, “The Crisis in Galilee,”
         pp. 383–394; “The Foreshadowing of the Cross,” pp. 410–418; “He
         Was Transfigured,” pp. 419–425; “Ministry,” pp. 426–431; “Who Is the
         Greatest?” pp. 432–442; “Blessing the Children,” pp. 511–517, in The
         Desire of Ages.

            “Our Lord has said, ‘Except ye eat of the flesh of the Son of man,
         and drink His blood, ye have no life in you. . . . For My flesh is meat
1
         indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.’ John 6:53-55. This is true of our
         physical nature. To the death of Christ we owe even this earthly life.
         The bread we eat is the purchase of His broken body. The water we
         drink is bought by His spilled blood. Never one, saint or sinner, eats his
         daily food, but he is nourished by the body and the blood of Christ. The
         cross of Calvary is stamped on every loaf. It is reflected in every water
2
         spring. All this Christ has taught in appointing the emblems of His
         great sacrifice. The light shining from that Communion service in the
         upper chamber makes sacred the provisions for our daily life. The fam-
         ily board becomes as the table of the Lord, and every meal a sacra-
         ment.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 660.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 In class, discuss what it means to eat the flesh and drink the

3         blood of Jesus.

          ●
          2 Dwell more on the idea that we need to be like children. What
          other traits do we find in children that make them such good
          examples? How can we be more childlike in our faith? At the
          same time, in what ways can we take the child analogy too far?

          ●
          3 The lesson this week talked about various deceptions that we
          will have to face as disciples of Christ. What are some of these
          deceptions that the church is facing in your area of the world?
          How are they manifested? What kind of guises do they come in?
          How easily are our members swayed by them? As a church, what
          can you do to help protect all members from whatever spiritual
          traps might come their way?

          ●
          4 What are all the reasons we have been given for faith? In other
          words, why are we believers? What evidence do we have for our
          faith? Dwell on your reasons for belief and then as a class discuss
          your responses.

          ●
          5 Summarize what you understand to be the experience of
          discipleship. What has that experience been for you? What does
          it encompass? In class, share your experiences.

Hope Meets Hopelessness:
Part 2
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
  Santosh was playing cricket with the pastor’s children on the roof of the
apartment building when he lost his balance and fell backward off the
roof. “Lord, save me!” he cried as he tumbled toward some high voltage
wires. The instant he hit the wires the transformer burst, cutting off all cur-
rent. The wires broke his fall, and he landed on the ground.
  He struggled to get up but couldn’t. A crowd gathered, wondering aloud
that this boy could have fallen three floors, hit the high voltage wires and
the hard ground, and survived. “How did you survive that fall?” someone
asked.
  “I prayed, ‘Lord, save me!’ ” Santosh said.
  The pastor rushed to Santosh’s side. He took the boy to the hospital,
where he needed surgery to set his broken leg. His parents rushed to his
bedside.
  Family members learned of Santosh’s fall and blamed the family’s inter-
est in Christianity. But Santosh strongly disagreed. “God saved me from
worse injury because I prayed,” he told them.
  Santosh’s parents worried about his injury, his medical bills, and what
may have caused the fall, but Santosh encouraged them to trust God in
spite of what the family said. During his two-week stay in the hospital, and
afterward as he recuperated at home, Santosh shared his love for Jesus
with those who visited him.
  Santosh has recovered from his injuries. He and his parents have given
their lives to Jesus and have thrown out their idols. Santosh’s grandparents,
who once opposed Christianity, now attend church with Santosh and his
                               parents. He urges them to trust in Jesus.
                                 Santosh is bright and enjoys studying the
                               Bible with several of his relatives. One aunt
                               has been baptized, though she must sneak to
                               church against her husband’s will. Two
                               uncles, another aunt, and his other grand-
                               mother attend church because of Santosh’s

      Following the Master:
      Discipleship in Action




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 8:14, 15; 10:34–37;
      28:18–20; Luke 5:17–26.

Memory Text: “ ‘For whoever desires to save his life will lose it,
      but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it.
      For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses
      his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?’ ”
      (Mark 8:35–37, NKJV).

            his week’s lesson calls us to contemplate what is involved in

      T     discipleship. We want to look at discipleship in action. God has
            called us, but each must discern that call and follow its leadings.
      Thomas Cameron tells of a famous preacher who said he would have
      loved “to have blown the bellows for Handel, to have picked up the
      fallen brush for Michelangelo, to have held the spy-glass for
      Christopher Columbus, or to have carried Shakespeare’s bag. If men
      count it an honour to do some humble service for the world’s great
      heroes, what distinction lay in the opportunity of serving the Savior of
      men?”—A. Gordon Nasby, ed., Treasury of the Christian World, p. 327.

The Week at a Glance: What should be our motivation
      for service as disciples? What kind of opposition should we
      expect? What promises do we have as we embark on the work of
      discipleship?

     Service and Discipleship
Read Matthew 8:14, 15; Mark 1:29–31; and Luke 4:38, 39. What can
     we learn from these accounts about discipleship? In other words,
     regardless of the particular circumstances, what principles are
     seen here that should apply to all of us?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Though all three of these accounts record that Peter’s mother-in-law
     was sick with a fever, Luke alone says she was suffering from a high
     fever. This detail, some believe, is indicative of Luke’s status as a
     physician, especially because the phrase itself in the Greek language
     sounds like one of the technical classes the Greeks used to classify a
     specific fever.
        Notice, too, that in all the accounts it is stressed that the disciples
     told Jesus about her being sick and that they asked for His help. We
     should assume, of course, that Jesus already knew all about her prob-
     lem, yet He still let them tell Him, as well as ask for His divine heal-
     ing. What lesson could we draw from this about our role as disciples?
     Is this really discipleship or just plain hospitality?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       After Peter’s mother-in-law was healed, she did not shrink from
     service. On recovery, she found a houseful of tired and hungry guests
     who had been concerned for her. Although she could have, she did not
     claim exhaustion or fatigue from the malady. Rather, she immediately
     began to wait on them—she began to serve them. The Greek word
     used is akin to that meaning a “servant,” “minister,” or “deacon.”
     Inspired by Jesus, she began her service immediately upon recovery.

      What has Christ done for you? What has He saved you from?
      What has been your response? In what ways should the whole
      Christian life be a response to what Jesus has done for us?

     Jesus and the Paralytic
       A well-known story is found in Luke 5:17–26, the story of Jesus
     healing the paralytic. From it we can learn some important lessons
     about discipleship in action.

Read verse 17. What powerful and important point can be found
     there? What message of warning should it have for us, as well?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Here they were, leaders, teachers of the law, coming from all over,
     apparently to hear Jesus. The text says that at the time, the “power of
     the Lord was present to heal them.” In other words, Jesus was there;
     the power of God was there; help, healing, and salvation were there.
     The only problem was that self, sin, and pride got in their way. What
     a powerful warning to us all.
       Meanwhile, in this story, we can see discipleship in action. First,
     there were those who brought the paralytic to Jesus. Notice how hard
     they worked. Unable to get past the crowd, they had to resort to other
     means. Think about how desperate they were for their friend. How
     easily they could have given up! Notice, too, how Jesus acknowledged
     their faith. Whether they had personally been healed by Jesus, the
     texts do not say. What we do know is that their works truly revealed
     their faith. They acted as disciples in the sense of bringing someone
     needy to Jesus.
       After the paralytic was healed, he left glorifying God. No doubt his
     body and his words were a powerful tool for witness and discipleship
     (see also vs. 26).
       Meanwhile, as all this is going on, the leaders fulminated in dark-
     ness over Jesus’ blasphemies. They let their religion, faith, and teach-
     ing get in the way of a living experience with Jesus. What a lesson to
     us all!

      In what ways can we, even as professed disciples of Christ, let
      things get in the way of the Lord working in our lives, or even in
      the lives of others? What are some of the things that we harbor
      in our hearts that can blind us to the power of God? Most
      important, how can we get rid of them?

     “To Send Fire on the Earth”                             (Matt. 10:34–37,
     Luke 12:49–53)

        Christianity is regarded most often in peaceful terms. At Jesus’
     birth, the angels sang, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
     peace, good will toward men” (Luke 2:14). Even more important,
     Christianity advocates love, not hate, even for our enemies. Jesus said,
     “Blessed are the peacemakers” (Matt. 5:9). How, then, do we under-
     stand what Jesus is saying in these verses?
        “Jesus here dispels the mistaken opinion that some of the disciples
     apparently had, that the message they were to bear would result in
     nothing but harmony. They were not to be surprised, in their house-to-
     house work . . . , if differences arose as a result of their ministry. . . .
     When a [person] accepts Christ his closest friends often turn out to be
     [the] most bitter and relentless enemies. This is often true, not only in
     heathen lands, but also in Christian lands and among professed
     Christians who practice a form of religion but know little if anything of
     its power to transform the life.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
     pp. 379, 380.

From your experience as a Christian, and from what you know of
     Jesus through other texts, what do you believe Jesus is telling us
     here, and why are these words so important for discipleship? See
     also Matt. 10:24, 25.
      _____________________________________________________
      _____________________________________________________

       The important point to remember is that following Jesus will cost us
     big, one way or another. If it does not, then perhaps something is
     wrong. Maybe we are deceiving ourselves. In the end, we must realize
     that our witness and life of discipleship, of discipleship in action, can
     lead to dissension and division among even those to whom we are the
     closest. It does not always have to be that way, but Jesus wants us to
     realize that it can and to not be surprised by it when it does.

      What has following Christ cost you, at least in terms of rela-
      tionships with others? What have you learned in your own expe-
      rience that could help you disciple someone else who is strug-
      gling because his or her faith has, as Jesus said it would,
      brought division into their life?




                                                                             75

     The Worth of Our Souls
       “ ‘For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses
     his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it. For what will it profit
     a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what
     will a man give in exchange for his soul?’ ” (Mark 8:35–37, NKJV).

        A magazine article told about a special high school where students
     were doing exceptional work. Their level of academic achievement far
     exceeded that of most students in the same age bracket anywhere else
     in the country. These kids, young, ambitious, and bright, seemed des-
     tined to go places, to be, by the world’s standards, true success stories.
     The magazine then quoted one of these young people, who said:
     “We’re doing all this in order to beat death.”
        To beat death? He is going to need more than good grades and a
     good job to do that.
        The fact is that no matter who we are, or what we achieve in this
     life, sooner or later death comes, sooner or later everything we are
     ends up in a grave somewhere. And how long do we live, at best? For
     most of us, not even a hundred years, often not even close. And then
     it is all gone. What can it mean? What is the purpose of it all, if it all
     ends in death? What kind of legacy will we leave behind? Thousands
     of years ago, Solomon mused over these same issues (see Ecclesiastes
     1, 2), and concluded that this life, in and of itself, with all its toils and
     troubles, was all vanity, from a Hebrew word meaning “breath,”
     “vapor.”

      With this in mind, read over the texts for today, thinking about
      them in the context of this week’s lesson on discipleship in
      action. Ask yourself, in light of what Jesus is saying here, “What
      kind of life should I be living? What does it mean to lose my life
      for the sake of the gospel? What possibly could be worth my own
      soul? And what role does my discipling of others play in what
      Jesus is saying to me?” In other words, what could it cost us
      here, in this life, to be actively involved in discipleship? What
      changes do you need to make in order to be truly a disciple of
      Christ?

      “ ‘Go Therefore and Make Disciples’ ”
        One of the greatest sections on the work of discipleship, on disciple-
      ship in action, is found in Matthew 28:18–20. Read over the verses.
      Look at all the verbs there: go, make, baptize, teach (NKJV). Disciples
      should be making more disciples. It is as simple as that.

Read through the verses again, focusing on what Jesus said in the
      beginning, about all authority (or power) being given to Him in
      heaven and in earth (see Luke 1:32, Acts 10:36, Eph. 1:20, Heb.
      1:13). Why are those words so important for all who are involved
      in the work of making disciples?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Notice, too, what Jesus says is involved in this work. They are to
      teach all nations. No exclusivity here, no ethnic, gender, or national
      boundaries. The death of Christ was for all humanity, everywhere
      (Rom. 5:17–19, Heb. 2:9); hence, it only makes sense that the gospel
      commission would be for all humanity, as well (Rev. 14:6, 7).

Notice carefully that Jesus tells them to teach all nations. Where is
      His emphasis?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Again, as we can see, discipleship is action. Those who become dis-
      ciples are those who obey, who do the things that Jesus commanded.
      With these words, Jesus utterly destroys any notion that salvation is
      purely an intellectual assent to certain doctrinal truths. Though that is
      certainly part of what it means to be a disciple, it does not end there.
      Disciples are those who follow Jesus, and we follow Jesus by obeying
      Him—and we obey Him, not in order to be saved but because we
      already are saved, in Him.

       Jesus’ promise is that He will be with us until the end of the
       world. How have you experienced in your own life the reality of
       that promise? Dwell on the evidences of Christ’s presence with
       you. Write and/or recite a prayer of praise and thanksgiving for
       what Jesus has done and is doing in your life.




                                                                           77

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 379–
         381, 746–750; Ellen G. White, “The First Evangelists,” pp. 350–358;
         “Who Is the Greatest?” pp. 433–436, in The Desire of Ages; Dietrich
         Bonhoeffer, “Discipleship and the Cross,” pp. 85–104, in The Cost of
         Discipleship; Mark 16:15–20, John 14–17.

            “The Saviour bade His disciples not to hope that the world’s enmity
         to the gospel would be overcome, and that after a time its opposition
         would cease. He said, ‘I came not to send peace, but a sword.’ This cre-
         ating of strife is not the effect of the gospel, but the result of opposi-
1        tion to it. Of all persecution the hardest to bear is variance in the home,
         the estrangement of dearest earthly friends. But Jesus declares, ‘He
         that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he
         that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.’ ”
         —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 357.
            “Jesus sanctioned the binding claims of the fifth commandment and
2        rebuked any attempt to escape the obligations of children toward their
         parents. . . . Nevertheless, love for one’s parents must never stand in the
         way of obedience to God in every particular, should the two be in con-
         flict. Love to God and service for Him are to be the supreme rule of
         life, ‘the first and great commandment’. . . ; but ‘the second’ table of the
         Decalogue, which contains the fifth commandment, is ‘like’ the first in
         nature and importance.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 380.
3   Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Do you know of anyone suffering now directly because of their
          commitment to Jesus? If so, how can you help? What can you as
          an individual, as a Sabbath School class, or as a church do to
          bring some relief?

          ●2 Dwell more on the texts for Wednesday’s lesson. What impor-
          tant message is Jesus giving us here? Bring your thoughts to
          class, and as a class talk about what it means to lose your life for
          the sake of the gospel. What can you learn from each other’s
          experiences?

          ●
          3 This week’s lesson was on discipleship in action. What is going
          on in your own church in the area of discipleship? What can you
          as a class do to help the church as a whole take a more active role
          in this important work? For example, what is being done to help
          disciple new members?

Wayward Wanderings
by MIKE BROWNHILL
   “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they
shall be filled.” Cyrus Jacobs hungered after righteousness. The trouble is,
like so many others, Cyrus sought it in the wrong places.
   Cyrus grew up in Sydney and Brisbane, Australia. This young agnostic
thought he had all the answers and loved to debate with Christians. And
since most Christians didn’t know the Bible well, he usually won. He
experimented with heroin and LSD, which led him to believe he was close
to God.
   While serving in the Australian army, Cyrus went absent without leave.
He was imprisoned and received a dishonorable discharge. Then he met
some dubious characters who led him into more trouble, including arson.
   In spite of his brushes with the law, God didn’t give up on young Cyrus.
The Holy Spirit wooed him throughout the twists and turns of his troubled
life. Cyrus decided to embark on a spiritual journey to find himself and
God.
   He sought enlightenment through Eastern meditation and teachings. But
God led him to an old Christian farmer who answered Cyrus’s questions
with God’s Word. Cyrus found the Bible miraculously relevant to his life.
He gave his heart to Jesus and was baptized in a Protestant church that
same day.
   While sharing his faith in Jesus one night, a deranged man didn’t like
what Cyrus was saying and stabbed him in the stomach, the chest, and the
throat. Miraculously, Cyrus survived.
   From his personal Bible study, Cyrus became convinced that God val-
ued the Sabbath that He had established in Eden. But he found his fellow
church members didn’t share his convictions.
   Cyrus experienced God’s hand in his life again and again during several
years of adventure and study. While scuba diving in Indonesia, he met his
wife, Suminah. They returned to Australia and settled in Queensland.
   Here they met Rob and Molly Cock, who were studying the Bible with
a local pastor. They invited Cyrus and Suminah to join them. Cyrus
responded to a television advertisement and requested a free viewing of
The Search video series on biblical truths. In time he was rebaptized as a
Seventh-day Adventist Christian. Suminah soon followed.
   God follows searching people relentlessly until they find Him. Our mis-
sion offerings support evangelistic outreach around the world.

      Discipleship Under
      Pressure


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Kings 18, Matt. 26:56,
      Luke 9:51–56, John 6:1–15, 12:1–6, 18:1–11, 21:15–19.

Memory Text: “If you have run with the footmen, and they have
      wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? And if in the
      land of peace, in which you trusted, they wearied you, then how
      will you do in the flooding of the Jordan?” (Jeremiah 12:5, NKJV).

             ver hear of Murphy’s law? It is considered by some to be one of

      E      the fundamental laws of nature, as pervasive as gravity and
             electromagnetism. Stated briefly, it reads, “Whatever can go
      wrong will go wrong.”
         We have all had moments, even days (or longer), that seem to fol-
      low Murphy’s law. Sometimes our experiences as disciples seem to
      follow it, as well. No doubt, we have the promises of God that should
      help us not to get discouraged, but how easy it is sometimes, even with
      the promises, to be tempted to give up in despair. Of course, no mat-
      ter what, we never should.
         This week we will look at some disciples and see what we can learn
      from their bad days.

The Week at a Glance: What warning should we take away
      from the disciples’ bid for political power? What lessons does Judas
      have for us? What was behind James’s and John’s willingness to
      destroy those who rejected Jesus? What can we take away from
      Peter’s rashness and repentance? Why, after having seen so much,
      did all the disciples forsake Jesus in the hour of His great need?

     The Power Model
       Religious faith can be a very powerful tool, either for good or for
     evil. The same kind of drive that motivates someone to “lose his life”
     (Matt. 16:25) for Christ’s sake can, in other circumstances, drive oth-
     ers to blow themselves up in the name of God. After all, if you believe
     that God is calling you to do something, who is going to let any kind
     of earthly or worldly considerations stand in your way? That is why,
     for instance, some governments seek to quell religion among the peo-
     ple, because they do not want people having allegiance to a higher
     authority, and you cannot get any higher than the Divine. On the other
     hand, governments are not immune from seeking to co-opt the incredi-
     ble power of religion and using it to their own advantage. The disciple
     of Christ has to be aware of the various dangers involved with abus-
     ing the power of religion.

Read John 6:1–15. What lesson can we learn from this about how the
     disciple of Christ should view political power?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Though, of course, Jesus’ purpose on earth was not to become an
     earthly king, it is clear that garnering earthly political power should not
     be equated with doing the work of discipleship. That God can put peo-
     ple in power, or that He can use people in power, is one thing; it is
     another to somehow view the amassing of political power in the name
     of God as the work of God, the work of discipleship. Nothing in the
     New Testament presents this power model of the gospel. Unfortunately,
     even His closest disciples missed this important point: “The disciples
     unite with the multitude in declaring the throne of David the rightful
     inheritance of their Master. It is the modesty of Christ, they say, that
     causes Him to refuse such honor. . . . They eagerly arrange to carry out
     their purpose.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 378. Building
     on the eager expectation and enthusiasm of the multitude, they force-
     fully attempted to take Jesus and make Him King over the nation (John
     6:14, 15). This was discipleship their way. In reaction to this move,
     Jesus dismissed the multitude, sent the disciples to cross the lake, and
     went into the mountains alone to pray.

      What are ways, even on a more personal level, that we can abuse
      religion and co-opt it for our own selfish ends?




                                                                            81

     The Greed Model
        Someone once said, “If you want to get rich, start a religion.” How
     unfortunate, but there is a lot of truth to that cynical statement. After
     all, when dealing with religious faith, we are dealing with some of the
     most important aspects of human existence. We are dealing with the
     meaning of life, with the hope of eternity, with the belief that we are
     forgiven by God for our sins. However much Jesus Himself, by model
     and example, lived a life of self-denial and poverty, however much He
     warned us against getting caught up in the things of this world, church
     history is replete with examples of those who have used the power of
     religion and religious ideas to gain wealth for themselves, often at the
     expense of the poor.
Read John 12:1–6 and then answer the following questions:
     1. What symbolism is found in the act of Mary? In other words, in
     what ways does it represent the attitudes of the true disciples of
     Christ? See also Matt. 13:46, Phil. 3:8.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     2. What does this story tell us about the importance of the motives of
     our actions?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

     3. The texts say that Lazarus, the resurrected Lazarus, was at the table
     with them. Why does that fact make Judas’s actions even more repug-
     nant, more indicative of how blinded he was by his own sin?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        It is with good reason that Paul made the famous statement he did
     in 1 Timothy 6:10. Judas eventually lost his soul over his love of
     money. From the start, it seems, he was looking out only for number
     one; he himself, and the desire to gain things for himself, was woven
     all through his own discipleship. Of course, the other disciples were
     not totally selfless either, but with Judas it got the best of him.

      How can you be sure that greedy motives are not poisoning your
      role as a disciple of Christ? More so, if you detect some impure
      motives, how can you be purged of them?

      The Thunder Model
        There were at least two pairs of brothers among Jesus’ twelve disci-
      ples. At their call, Jesus surnamed the pair of James and John
      boanerges, or “sons of thunder” (Mark 3:17). Some commentators
      believe that Jesus gave them this name because of their vehement tem-
      peraments and fiery tempers. Therefore, we have chosen to call their
      approach to discipleship the thunder model.

Read Luke 9:51–56. Look at the reaction of the disciples to the rejec-
      tion of Jesus. As you read this, try to put yourself in the place of
      these disciples. What reasons would they have for reacting as they
      did? In other words, what things did they hear Jesus say, or what
      other Old Testament examples might they have drawn from, that
      could have caused them to react as they did? See, for example,
      Genesis 6, 7, Matt. 8:12, 13:42, Mark 6:11.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

          A number of problems exist with the reaction of the disciples.
      There is zeal for the Lord, which is good, which all disciples should
      have. But misdirected zeal, even in a good cause, can produce more
      harm than good. For instance, James and John used the story of Elijah
      as their model. The only problem is that they misused it. Elijah
      brought fire down from heaven to consume sacrifices (1 Kings 18),
      not recalcitrant people (he had them slain another way).
         Even worse, of course, was their harsh and judgmental attitude
      toward sinners. The work of every disciple of Christ should be that of
      seeking ways to bring sinners to the foot of the Cross, to show them
      the incredible mercy and grace of God, who in Himself bore the pun-
      ishment of their sins. Thus, no matter how sinful their lives have been,
      through Jesus they can have full pardon, full forgiveness, and a new
      life in Him. That is our work as disciples; we can leave the judging to
      the Lord.

       How judgmental are you toward those whom you deem way-
       ward and wrong? How do we show these people the grace and
       mercy of God, while at the same time not giving the impression
       that we condone or approve of their lives and/or beliefs?



                                                                          83

     The Repentant-Peter Model
       Peter is known as that impetuous disciple who always had some-
     thing to say on everything. Luke 22:33, 34 says he was so sure of him-
     self and his discipleship that he promised to go with Jesus even to
     prison and death. Of course, not long after, he had to retract those
     words (Matt. 26:69–75).

Read John 18:1–11. What does this tell us about the personality and
     character of Peter, especially in light of Matthew 26:69–75?

        We all know about Peter’s failure. It exists as a powerful lesson to
     all disciples of Christ. We cannot work for the Lord in our own power.
     How crucial it is that we day by day surrender ourselves to Jesus. He
     is the Vine, we are the branches; without Him we can do nothing,
     especially not be faithful disciples. Again, zeal for the Lord and His
     cause is wonderful, but it must be done under the Lordship of Jesus
     Christ.

Read John 21:15–19. What does this teach us about what Jesus can
     do for those of His disciples who, repenting of their mistakes, do
     not give up on Christ?

        “Here is given a lesson for all Christ’s followers. The gospel makes
     no compromise with evil. It cannot excuse sin. Secret sins are to be
     confessed in secret to God; but, for open sin, open confession is
     required. . . . By giving proof of repentance, the disciple, so far as lies
     in His power, is to remove this reproach. . . . Three times Peter had
     openly denied his Lord, and three times Jesus drew from him the
     assurance of his love and loyalty, pressing home that pointed question,
     like a barbed arrow to his wounded heart. Before the assembled disci-
     ples Jesus revealed the depth of Peter’s repentance, and showed how
     thoroughly humbled was the once boasting disciple.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 811, 812.
        Notice what Jesus said to Peter in John 21:18, 19. Jesus, basically,
     was telling Peter that in the end, Peter would end up dying for the Lord
     he so fervently loved. Peter’s words, in the end, came true, but only
     after he had learned some hard lessons about discipleship.

      Have you made boastful promises, only to fail time and again,
      from fulfilling them? What can you take away from the story of
      Peter that can help you not to give up?

     The Flight Model
       “Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled” (Matt. 26:56).

       The disciples spent three and a half years with Jesus. They had privi-
     leges that very few in the world ever had. They saw things few humans
     ever did. After all, among the world’s billions, how many ever saw
     Jesus in the flesh? More so, how many ever interacted day after day
     with Him while He was here in the flesh? These disciples were among
     the most privileged humans ever to have lived.
       Of course, that was part of the problem—they were humans, fallen
     humans, and thus, no matter what the Lord did for them, the lessons
     were not easily learned.

Skim through a Gospel, any Gospel. What were the amazing things
     that Jesus said and did in the sight of His disciples? How much
     incredible proof did He give them concerning who He was? After
     going over those incidents, look at the text for today. What fearful
     message, even warning, can we draw from this for ourselves?

        Knowing He would be leaving them, Jesus prepared the disciples
     for His departure, but they did not listen. Knowing what would hap-
     pen in Jerusalem, He prepared them for His passion, but they did not
     listen. They arrived in Jerusalem totally unprepared.
        During Jesus’ ministry, the disciples seemed to look at what He did
     rather than to listen to what He said. His deeds confirmed their
     Messianic hopes, and that pleased them very much. At the
     Transfiguration the heavenly Voice called them to listen to Jesus, yet
     they did not benefit from His instructions about the Passion.
        Following the Passover meal, Jesus tried to show His followers what
     lay ahead, but they would not listen. In the Garden, He tried to get
     them to pray to gain strength, but they slept.

      Meditate on all that Jesus has done for you: the promises, the
      hope, the gifts given you, the changes made in your life, the evi-
      dences for your faith, all through Christ. How can we, by cling-
      ing to these things, avoid the mistakes of the disciples?

           “The love of money in the heart of Judas was growing with the exer-
         cise of his shrewd abilities. His practical financiering ability, if exer-
         cised and enlightened and moulded by the Holy Spirit, would have
         been of great service to the little church, and by the sanctification of
         his spirit he would have had a clear insight, a correct discernment to
2
         appreciate heavenly things. But worldly policy plans were constantly
         cherished by Judas. There was no outbreaking sin on his part, but his
         sharp scheming, the selfish, parsimonious spirit that took possession
         of him, finally led him to sell his Lord for a small sum of money.”
         —Ellen G. White, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1101.
           “Judas was with Christ through the entire period of the Saviour’s
         public ministry. He had all that Christ could give him. . . . Had he
         sought to be a blessing, instead of a questioning, criticizing, selfish
3
         man, the Lord would have used him to advance His kingdom. But
         Judas was a speculator. He thought that he could manage the finances
         of the church, and by his sharpness in business get gain. He was
         divided in heart. He loved the praise of the world. He refused to give
         up the world for Christ. He never committed his eternal interests to
         Christ. . . . Judas was a religious fraud.”—Ellen G. White, The SDA

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 If disciples are followers, are those who follow their own ideas
          and programs still disciples? Dwell on that question and your
          answer.

          ●
          2 What other models of discipleship under pressure can you
          think of, and what lessons can we learn from them?

          ●3 While we can find in Peter someone who jumped ahead too
          fast, only to stumble and fall, what are the dangers of being too
          cautious? In what ways can we go too far the other way? Think
          about this and bring some thoughts to class. As you do, think
          about your local church as a whole. Is your church too ready to
          jump ahead of the Lord, or does it tend to be too timid to follow
          the leading of the Lord? What can you do, as a class, to help your
          church strike the right balance?

Death in the Night
by JAMES APPEL
   A cool east wind chilled my tired body. Sarah and I prayed then crawled
into bed to sleep. The chirping of thousands of African insects lulled me to
sleep.
   A soft tap, tapping on the door pulled me awake. “Doctor?” David’s voice
stirred my consciousness.
   “Yes,” I replied groggily.
   “One of the patients has died. The family has arrived with their ox cart to
take the body to their village for burial. But I can’t open the combination lock
on the gate.”
   I became aware of the wails and shrieks of mourning as I pulled aside the
mosquito net and grabbed my flashlight.
   “I’m coming,” I mumbled as I searched for my clothes. I pushed open the
metal door, slipped on my flip flops, and followed David toward the hospital.
   “Aaaahh! Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh! Aye yi yi yi yi yi yi!” The nightmarish
sounds wafted across the campus as we approached the gate. I dialed the
combination and tugged the lock open. David opened the gate, and two shad-
owy forms slipped silently past us. Outside a group of women, one with a
baby strapped to her back, danced the dance of death, their arms flailing the
air. Others sat in a tight bunch accompanying the dancers with chants, wails,
and moans of death. A man beat his breast as an agonizing yell tore from his
throat. Dogs barked at the nighttime disturbance.
   Anger, pity, and sorrow welled up within me. These same people had let
their relative lie sick for a week before bringing him to the hospital. They
couldn’t afford to pay $20 for his treatment; yet now they will spend hun-
dreds of dollars to feed relatives and friends who will come for his funeral.
People will gather and “weep” to prove their sorrow and to be sure that his
spirit doesn’t come back to haunt them.
   I am sick of the fear of death, the spirits, and the hauntings that these peo-
ple endure. It breaks my heart to see the ignorance that holds them captive. I
know the One who has promised to “free those who all their lives were held
in slavery by their fear of death” (Heb. 2:15).
   But fighting against so much superstition and fear and tradition seems so
overwhelming.
   The two men reappear pulling the ox cart past us. We replace the lock, then
I walk back home as the sounds of the funeral procession fade into the dark
African night.
   “Lord Jesus,” I pray, “what can I do to show them Your way? How can I
teach them to trust You with their lives—and their death?”

      More Lessons in
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 14:22–33; Mark
      4:36–41; 6:51, 52; Luke 8:25; 24:37; John 6:19.

Memory Text: “But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying,
      ‘Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid’ ” (Matthew 14:27).

          esus selected His disciples so that they could be with Him and

      J   could learn from Him. Apparently, they were not as sharp and
          quick-witted as one would expect. How much different are we?
      Some of us have been walking with God for several years, and we still
      do not understand fully what the demands of discipleship are. As in
      the natural world, so it is in the spiritual. Growth is essential for life.
      Every day should bring some growth in depth, width, or height. What
      preparation of soil and nutrients are you making to assure growth and
      success in discipleship?
        This week’s lesson will look at more examples from the Word of
      God that can help us understand what it means to be a disciple of
      Christ.

The Week at a Glance: Why were the disciples of Christ
      often full of fear? What can we learn from Jesus’ warnings about
      the leaven of the Pharisees? How do we respond to those who pur-
      posely close their hearts to our witness?

      Lessons at Sea
        By the time of the events in Mark 4, the disciples had already been
      with Jesus for a while. How much they must have learned at the foot
      of the Master.

Read Mark 4:36–41. What is so revealing about their words to Him
      in verse 38? How often do we find ourselves having a similar
      response in frightful times?

        It is so easy for us to do the same thing, to wonder, when tragedy
      and problems strike, if God cares at all. The irony, of course, is that
      Jesus was right there the whole time. He was the One who first told
      them to take the boat across to begin with. This storm did not take
      Him by surprise, and neither do our trials.

What significance (if any) can be found in the fact that the disciples,
      not the storm, woke Jesus?
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Notice the element of fear in the disciples all through the account.
      They feared the storm; and then, after the storm was calmed, they
      seemed to fear Jesus. The manifestation of such power was impres-
      sive, of course, but one would have thought by now that, after their
      time with Christ, they would have known that they had nothing to fear
      from Him. On the contrary, this power should have been a source of
      great hope and comfort to them, because by now they should have
      known the character of the One who possessed all that power. This
      account shows that these men still had a lot to learn about what it
      means to be a disciple of Christ.

       When was the last time you wondered if the Lord cared about
       you and your situation, whatever it was? What lessons did you
       learn from that trial that you could use next time you face a trial
       or tragedy?

     Lessons at Sea (Continued)
       If you think about it, the sea is a good place to learn lessons about
     discipleship. After all, though as humans we are totally dependent
     upon God for everything (see Job 12:10, Dan. 5:23, Acts 17:28), it is
     not so easy to forget it when you are out on the water, where what is
     beneath your feet will not hold you up but will swallow you instead.
     Perhaps that is why the Lord chose to use the sea to teach His disci-
     ples a few more lessons about faith, the key element for any success-
     ful discipleship.
       Following a successful missionary tour (Mark 6:6–13), the feeding
     of the five thousand, and their first encounter on the lake, the disciples
     finally should have been catching on. The evening after the feeding of
     the five thousand, another storm overtook them on the lake, this time
     without Jesus in the boat with them.

Read Matthew 14:22, 33 and Mark 6:45–52. What are the numerous
     mistakes the disciples made in these two accounts?

       Though one account omits the story of Peter walking on the water,
     one point both make is that those who witnessed what happened were
     duly impressed. Some openly called Jesus the Son of God; in Mark’s
     account, they were amazed beyond measure about what they had
     experienced. It was one thing to be able to get the weather to obey
     Him, but to have the power to walk on water, especially during a
     storm? Truly they had been witnesses to the power of God in ways that
     few people have ever seen.

      Read Mark 6:51, 52. What point do you think Mark was mak-
      ing about faith and belief? What lessons might there be for us in
      that point?

     The Leaven of the Pharisees
Read Matthew 16:1–12 and then answer the following questions:

     1. What evidence do we have that the leaders who came to Jesus were
     not sincere in their question? After all, what is wrong with having a
     sign from heaven? Is the Bible not full of signs from heaven? What
     point should we as disciples take from what is happening here? See
     earlier chapters in Matthew; see also Luke 16:29–31.

     3. Read Jesus’ words to the disciples in Matthew 16:8–11. What point
     is Jesus making to them? Why do we find it so easy to do the same
     thing; that is, to forget the great things God has done before our eyes?

     ____________________________________________________________________

        What a contrast between the Bread of Life and the leaven of the
     Sadducees and the Pharisees, and yet how easy to get them confused.
     All disciples of Christ need to be aware that belief or following tradi-
     tions or defending the faith are not always the same as being a disci-
     ple of Christ. How easy, once we get established, even comfortable, in
     what we believe, or in how we worship, or in how we practice our
     faith, to let these things become ends in and of themselves, instead of
     a means to an end. That end, of course, is to be a faithful disciple of
     Christ, doing His will and revealing His love and His character to the
     world.




                                                                         91

     Lessons From Fear
       “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear”
     (1 John 4:18).

       Perhaps you have noticed something through the course of this
     study, and that is how often the disciples were afraid. All through the
     Gospels, we find time and again the disciples in various situations,
     and time and again the Bible records them as being afraid.

What was it in these various situations that caused them to fear?
     Matt. 14:27; 17:6, 7; Mark 10:32; Luke 8:25; 24:37; John 6:19.
     What can we learn from their experiences?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

Read Mark 9:30–32. What made them fearful here? What important
     point can we take away from this example?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       What is so sad about this case is that they were fearing the one thing
     that offered them the greatest hope they could possibly have: salvation
     through the atoning death of Jesus on their behalf. They feared what
     they did not understand; they feared what they did not want to hear.
     Had they understood what the Cross was all about, they would not
     have feared. Hence, it was their ignorance that kept them fearful.
       As disciples, as followers of Christ, we should, of all people, have
     the least to fear. The same Jesus who could walk on water during a
     storm, who could bring healing to a paralytic, who could feed five
     thousand with just a few loaves of bread, is the same Jesus who
     revealed His love to us by dying on the cross as our Substitute. Sure,
     sin is real, the devil is real, hell will be real, and we need to be aware
     of the dangers to our souls (Matt. 10:28), but in the end, as disciples,
     as long as we cling to the reality of God’s love as revealed in Christ,
     we should learn to live within the hope and comfort of God’s amazing
     love for, and grace toward, us.

      Discipleship and Witness
        “I want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that
      some of the most intelligent and well-informed people I know are reli-
      gious believers. It isn’t just that I don’t believe in God and, naturally,
      hope that I’m right in my belief. It’s that I hope there is no God! I don’t
      want there to be a God; I don’t want the universe to be like that.”
      —Thomas Nagel, The Last Word (New York: Oxford University Press,
      1997), p. 130.

Look at the above quote.As disciples, what is to be our attitude toward
      someone like that? Which Bible texts come to mind as you think
      about this person? Write out the texts.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

Now that you have written down the texts, take the time to go over
      them. Does a particular theme come through? Are your texts those
      of compassion, judgment, sorrow, or retribution? Or something
      else? What does your answer tell you about yourself?

        An inseparable part of what it means to be a disciple is, of course,
      witnessing. All through the Gospels, we see Jesus preparing His dis-
      ciples to lead others to salvation. Some folk believed quite readily;
      others seemed determined to reject Jesus no matter what.
        No question, as disciples of Christ, as we witness, we will come
      across all types, including those who, perhaps not as honestly as the
      man quoted above, will nevertheless reflect the same kind of attitude.
        How do we respond to these people? Anger? Love? A feeling of per-
      sonal failure? All or none of the above?
        What can we learn from the life and teachings of Jesus that will help
      us, as disciples of Jesus, to deal with those who are determined to
      close their hearts and minds? At what point, if ever, does our respon-
      sibility toward them end?

           “Although Peter had been long with the Master, he had a very
         imperfect conception of the plan of salvation. He did not desire to see
         the cross in the work of Christ; but it was through the cross that life
         and hope were to come to dying men.”—Ellen G. White, Review and

         When they fluctuate between hope and fear, the heart of Christ is hurt;
         for He has given them unmistakable evidence of His love. He wants
         them to be established, strengthened, and settled in the most holy faith.
         He wants them to do the work He has given them; then their hearts
         will become in His hands as sacred harps, every chord of which will
         send forth praise and thanksgiving to the One sent by God to take
         away the sins of the world.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies to
         Ministers and Gospel Workers, pp. 518, 519.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 What are some of the things that you fear? How can you learn
          to overcome those fears? On the other hand, are there things that
          we should rightly fear? Be prepared to discuss your answers in
          class on Sabbath.

          ●
          2 What are ways we can become modern-day Sadducees and
          Pharisees? Why is that easier than we think? How are these atti-
          tudes manifested in the church today? Also, what are the steps
          that one takes in going from being a disciple to being a Pharisee?
          Are they easier than going from being a Pharisee to a disciple?
          Be prepared to discuss your thoughts in class.

          ●
          3 What would you classify as the leaven of the Sadducees and
          Pharisees in the church today?

          ●4 As a class, talk about the attitude of the man expressed in
          Thursday’s lesson. In what ways are the principles of the attitude
          manifested in us, even as Christians? Are there things about our
          faith or doctrines that we shut our minds to because we simply
          do not want to believe them? Could it be that we have a hard time
          learning the lessons the Lord wants to teach us because we do not
          want to learn them?

More Than Adventure
by PATRICIA GONZÁLEZ
   Ruben González of Argentina loves adventure. He loves sharing his
faith even more. On a bus, in the market, wherever he goes he talks to peo-
ple about Jesus. He led the members of one Protestant church, including
their pastor, into the Adventist faith.
   Four years ago Ruben heard a mission report in Sabbath School that
spoke of the struggles Adventists in Spain face in leading people to Christ.
When his nephew in Spain offered him work, Ruben decided to go to
Spain. He was 59.
   The family borrowed money to buy his airline ticket, and with $33 in his
pocket, he left on his mission adventure to Spain. He spent his last pesos
on a visa and a taxi to take him to his nephew’s home. But when he arrived,
he learned that his nephew’s shop had closed down the day before.
   Ruben had no money and no place to stay. He found a cheap hostel and
left his passport and clothes as guarantee of payment. Then he went look-
ing for work. Praying as he went, he knocked at shops and houses offer-
ing to cook, cut grass, paint, build—whatever people needed. But nothing
opened up for him. Then Sabbath came.
   Ruben worshiped in the hostel on Sabbath. Then in the afternoon he
went to visit Don Salvador, a man he had met earlier that week. Not many
people liked Don Salvador, but Ruben and Salvador became friends.
When Don Salvador realized that Ruben was hungry, he offered him food.
The next morning Don Salvador paid Ruben’s bill at the hostel and invited
him home.
   “For lunch?” Ruben asked.
   “No, come and live in my house.” Ruben gladly accepted.
   Don Salvador introduced Ruben to a man who offered Ruben a job. He
found an Adventist church and started worshiping with them. The church
was large but had only a handful of members. “There are many empty
chairs here,” Ruben told the members. “We must invite more people to
come.” He worked with the church members and shared his zeal for evan-
gelism. His enthusiasm sparked the members to invite others to worship,
and the church grew to 128 members.
   Ruben began preaching and sharing his testimony in churches through-
out Spain. His desire to see the church there grow has had an impact on
the work. The adventurer found more than adventure in Spain, and the
kingdom of God has grown because of his work.
   Our mission offerings support many forms of evangelism around the
world.

        LESSON             12 *March 15–21
      Mission and
      Commission


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 25:31–46; Mark
      16:14–20; Luke 24:36–53; John 3:14–19; Rom. 5:6–10; 1 Cor. 5:7;
      15:3, 4; Gal. 1:4; 1 Pet. 2:22–25.

Memory Text: “And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus
      it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
      day” (Luke 24:46).

              s Adventists, we understand much of our role in the Great

      A       Commission to be linked to the three angels’ messages of
              Revelation 14. At the center of these messages is the everlasting
      gospel. We have nothing to give to the world unless we give them, above
      anything and everything else, the great truth of justification by faith alone.
        “Several have written to me, inquiring if the message of justification
      by faith is the third angel’s message, and I have answered, ‘It is the third
      angel’s message in verity.’ ’’—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, April 1,
      1890. Thus, for Ellen G. White, central to our mission is the procla-
      mation of justification by faith alone, the great news that salvation
      comes only through the grace of God poured out upon undeserving sin-
      ners and not through any works on our part.
        This week we will look at the gospel in the context of the Great
      Commission.

The Week at a Glance: What role do works of charity
      have in the life of those who are disciples? What role did Jesus give
      to the Scriptures in explaining His life and death? How central is
      the gospel in the Great Commission that Jesus gave to His church?

     End-Time Drama and Discipleship
Read Matthew 25:31–46. This passage is part of Jesus’ Olivet dis-
     course given during His final week of Judean ministry. It is part
     of the last words of His final pre-Passion discussion.

How are we to understand these words in Matthew 25:31–46, espe-
     cially in the area of discipleship and witness?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       This passage conveys a truth about the mission of disciples. Jesus
     clearly indicates that part of the work of disciples involves mission to
     the poor, the sick and suffering, the imprisoned; thus, to all the needy.
     The ultimate manifestation of discipleship is revealed in how we treat
     those around us who are in need.
       “Thus Christ on the Mount of Olives pictured to His disciples the
     scene of the great judgment day. And He represented its decision as
     turning upon one point. When the nations are gathered before Him,
     there will be but two classes, and their eternal destiny will be deter-
     mined by what they have done or have neglected to do for Him in the
     person of the poor and the suffering. In that day Christ does not pres-
     ent before men the great work He has done for them in giving His life
     for their redemption. He presents the faithful work they have done for
     Him.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 637.

      The Bible does make it clear, in numerous places, that salvation
      is not earned by our works but comes solely by God’s grace.
      How, then, are we to understand what Jesus is saying? As you
      seek to answer this question, keep in mind the idea of who a true
      disciple is: someone who has surrendered himself/herself totally
      and completely to Jesus, claiming for themselves “the great
      work He [Jesus] has done for them in giving His life for their
      redemption.” How does keeping this important truth before us
      help us better understand what Jesus is saying? After all, who of
      us could feed enough poor, or clothe enough naked, to earn
      redemption?




                                                                          97

      The Commissioning in Mark
        In an earlier lesson, we looked at the Great Commission as presented
      in Matthew 28:18–20. Read those texts again; review the highlights,
      particularly the commands and the promises. Ask yourself, when
      done: “What role am I playing in the fulfillment of these words?”

Read Mark 16:14–20 and compare it with Matthew 28:18–20. What
      elements are found in one and not the other?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         After you have noted the differences, read both accounts again.
      There is an unmistakable harmony between them. The basic message
      is the same.

What is Jesus’ message to us, as found in both these accounts?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         In both accounts we are told that there was some doubt (Matt.
      28:17), some hardness of heart, on the part of the disciples. In Mark’s
      account, Jesus upbraided them for this doubt, even though the Greek
      verb there can be translated into stronger language, such as
      “reproached,” “denounced,” or even “insulted.” The point was that
      even after all this time, even after all these things, some among them
      still struggled with faith. Jesus had to deal firmly with them.
         Notice, too, that only after Jesus dealt with their hardness of heart
      did He give them their commission. Jesus knew that for them to suc-
      ceed they needed to be strong in faith. His physical presence would
      soon be gone from them, for He was to be “received up into heaven”
      (Mark 16:19). Anything they were to do for Him from then on would
      have to be done by faith alone.
         Though faith is a gift, it is a gift that needs to be cultivated. What
      things can you do on a daily basis to nurture, protect, and strengthen
      your faith?

      Discipleship and the Gospel
         Let us look at something else in Mark’s account of the Great
      Commission. In Mark 16:15, 16, Jesus says, “Go ye into all the world,
      and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is bap-
      tized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.” Thus,
      we see that at the foundation of the commission is the call to preach
      the gospel.

With that in mind, read Revelation 14:6. How do these verses help us
      understand what our work is, not just as disciples but as Seventh-
      day Adventist disciples?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        With the work of preaching the gospel so central to discipleship and
      with the making of disciples, how crucial that we understand what the
      gospel message really is. Jesus, however, right there in those verses in
      Mark, pretty much gives us the gospel. Believe it, and you shall be
      saved; reject it, and you shall be lost.

Compare what Jesus said in Mark with John 3:14–19. How does
      what John writes help us to understand what Jesus is saying in
      Mark?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         How crucial that as disciples we be rooted firmly in the gospel that
      we are called to preach. Because of sin, the world stood condemned;
      Jesus bore that condemnation, fully and completely, in Himself.
      Through this wonderful provision, anyone who believes in Him no
      longer has to face the condemnation that came through sin; instead,
      thanks to God’s unfathomable grace, that person—regardless of how
      sinful his or her past has been—is pardoned, forgiven, and clothed in
      the righteousness of Jesus. This message must be at the foundation of
      all that we preach and teach to the world.


                                                                          99

      The Commissioning in Luke
Read Luke 24:36–53, another account of Jesus appearing to His dis-
      ciples and giving them the call to preach to the world.
        In this account, as the disciples gathered, the two disciples who
      met the risen Lord on the road to Emmaus joined them and shared
      their encounter. During their discussion, Jesus joined them.

Read this account. What were the first two things that Jesus did to
      help increase the faith of the disciples?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Notice, however, that Jesus did not stop with just giving them physi-
      cal evidence, evidence that they could see and feel. No, that was only
      part of it. He then took them into the Scriptures, showing them from
      the Word of God that what had happened to Him had been predicted.

What lesson should Christ’s use of the Scriptures here teach us?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        We see an important principle here: Sure, experiences, physical
      manifestations, and miracles all have their role and can have a major
      part in giving people what they need in order to have faith in Jesus. At
      the same time, however, Scripture must be the foundation of all our
      faith. Despite the miracles, Jesus affirmed their faith, using the
      Scriptures to do it. He used the Scriptures to confirm all that had hap-
      pened to Him and buttress all that He had said to them. If Jesus
      Himself used the Scriptures to justify all that He did, how much more
      so should we?
        Christ’s words and actions here are a stinging, powerful rebuke
      against any and all attempts to weaken the crucial and foundational
      role of the Bible in the life of the church and in our work as disciples.

       There are so many forces, even within the church, that work to
       weaken our trust in the Bible. What are some of these forces,
       and how can we protect ourselves from anything that calls into
       question the authority of the Scriptures?

     “Witnesses of These Things”
       Yesterday, in looking at the Great Commission as presented in Luke,
     we saw the primacy that Jesus gave to the Scriptures, that He used
     them to justify all that had happened. He also used the Scriptures to
     give the disciples their commission to the world.

According to Jesus, what was the message of the Scriptures that
     the disciples were to take to the world? See Luke 24:45–48. How
     does this fit in with what we looked at in Tuesday’s lesson? How
     does this fit in with our understanding of the three angels’ mes-
     sages of Revelation 14?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Here again, central to the whole call to make disciples is the death
     and resurrection of Jesus, all for the remission of sins. Jesus Himself
     points not just to the events that surrounded His life and death but to
     the meaning of those events. This is what Jesus told them to preach to
     the world. What would make their testimony so powerful, too, was that
     He said to them, “ye are witnesses of these things” (Luke 24:48); that
     is, the things surrounding His death and resurrection.

How do the following texts help us to understand the meaning of
     Christ’s death and resurrection? Rom. 5:6–10; 1 Cor. 5:7; 15:3, 4;
     Gal. 1:4; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 2:22–25.
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The disciples apparently were powerful witnesses, too. What began
     in Jerusalem as primarily a Jewish affair became a worldwide move-
     ment within 50 years. Acts 1–7 show the growth in Jerusalem and
     Judea; chapters 8–12 show how persecution and other influences took
     the movement beyond to Samaria, Ethiopia, Syria, and other Gentile
     territories. Acts 13–28 show how Saul of Tarsus, the persecutor turned
     Christian, took it in ever-widening circles until it reached Rome.




                                                                       101

1            “Let the subject be made distinct and plain that it is not possible to
          effect anything in our standing before God or in the gift of God to us
          through creature merit. Should faith and works purchase the gift of sal-
          vation for anyone, then the Creator is under obligation to the creature.
          Here is an opportunity for falsehood to be accepted as truth. If any man
          can merit salvation by anything he may do, then he is in the same posi-
2         tion as the Catholic to do penance for his sins. Salvation, then, is partly
          of debt, that may be earned as wages. If man cannot, by any of his good
          works, merit salvation, then it must be wholly of grace, received by
          man as a sinner because he receives and believes in Jesus. It is wholly
          a free gift. Justification by faith is placed beyond controversy. And all
          this controversy is ended, as soon as the matter is settled that the mer-
          its of fallen man in his good works can never procure eternal life for
          him.”—Ellen G. White, Faith and Works, pp. 19, 20.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●1 How do we understand Mark 16:16? Is Jesus saying that you
           have to be baptized to be saved? In what ways does the text itself
           supply the answer? What is our understanding, as a church, of
           the meaning and importance of baptism?
           ●
           2 Think about your local church and how it fits in with the
           worldwide mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, as given
           to us in the texts for this week. What role does your church have?
           What part is it playing? How can you, working through even
           your Sabbath School class, help get your church more involved in
           the work of spreading the gospel to all nations?
           ●
           3 Why is it so important for us, as disciples, to understand the
           gospel before we can be effective witnesses for Jesus? What is your
           understanding of the gospel? Write it out in a single paragraph.
           Bring it to class and be prepared to share it with others there.
           What insights can you gain from the above Ellen G. White quote?

           ●
           4 What more can your local church do to help the poor and the
           needy in your area? What kind of commitment does your church
           have to this important aspect of being a disciple?

What Took So Long?
by PRUDENCIO TORRES
   My brother, Hipolito, accepted the Adventist faith while living in New
York City some years ago. When he returned to Puerto Rico, he shared his
faith with me and invited me to church. I was still a teenager and was not
sure how my family would feel if I visited another church. I knew they felt
there was only one church—our church.
   I visited the Adventist church occasionally and made some friends
there. But for the most part what I learned didn’t change my life. I mar-
ried, and we moved to our own home. Some Adventists lived nearby and
visited us often. We agreed to study the Bible with them, and the next year
my wife accepted Jesus and joined the Adventist Church. But I didn’t. I
attended church with her and returned tithe, but I didn’t take a stand for
God.
   Then my mother became terminally ill. My brother and I took the
Adventist pastor to visit her often. We shared Bible promises with her, and
she accepted Jesus as her Lord before she died.
   The church we attend divided itself into small groups that meet in mem-
bers’ homes. We opened our home for one small-group meeting and
invited our neighbors. The group grew to 13 members, and we decided to
start a new congregation. My father gave us a piece of land on which to
build a small chapel, and we set to work. Everyone helped when they
could, but my wife and I did most of the work or paid to have it done. The
small group grew and was organized into a company with 25 members.
   Finally, after waiting 27 years, I sealed my commitment to Christ and
was baptized. Today our congregation is an organized church with more
than fifty members. My father visits our little church occasionally, and
two other brothers and their families are attending church. One is prepar-
ing for baptism.
   What took me so long? I have no excuse. My unwillingness to make a
commitment to Christ cost a lot of years and missed opportunities to share
my faith. But God was patient and gracious to me. He waited for me, and
He has saved me. However, I wonder how my life would have been differ-
ent if I had made my decision years ago when I first knew these wonder-
ful truths.
   Mission offerings help raise up new churches in Puerto Rico and around
the world.

        LESSON            13 *March 22–28
      Patterns of
      Discipleship


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 14:14; 15:32;
      20:34; Mark 1:41; Luke 6:12, 13; 16:19–31; 17:4, 5; 18:9–14; Col.
      1:14; 1 Tim. 5:16.

Memory Text: “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead,
      cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give” (Matthew 10:8).

              uring this quarter, we have looked at Jesus, the disciple-

      D       gathering Teacher. We have looked at those He chose to follow
              Him, the training He gave, the behavior He modeled, and the
      instructions He gave. From Him we have been given all that we need
      to be disciples.
        This week recaps some of the main highlights of this quarter’s
      study. It seeks to ascertain some of the traits, themes, and practices of
      Jesus that may have positively influenced the disciples—elements that
      must form the foundation of our work as disciples, as well. Ultimately,
      the goal is to seek applications that can provide patterns for disciple-
      ship in the twenty-first century.

The Week at a Glance: What role should compassion and
      forgiveness have in the life and ministry of disciples? What model
      did Jesus give to us regarding how we should treat the marginal-
      ized, the outcasts, and those from ethnic backgrounds different
      from our own? How important is the church itself in the work of
      discipleship? What can we learn from Jesus about the centrality
      of prayer?

      Compassion and Forgiveness
         When Jesus was here, He displayed compassion, sometimes trans-
      lated pity (see Matt. 14:14, 15:32, 20:34, Mark 1:41, 6:34, Luke
      7:13). In Greek, the word most commonly translated “compassion” or
      “pity” gives the idea of someone being moved to the very depths of
      his or her being. If, in our fallen condition, with our hard, selfish
      hearts, we can be moved with pity and compassion for others, how
      much more so would the sight of suffering humanity touch the inner-
      most being of the sinless Son of God?

Look up those references listed above. What were the things that
      Jesus showed compassion over? Why is such compassion so
      important for us as disciples?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Besides compassion, Jesus showed forgiveness. Time and again the
      disciples observed Jesus forgive the sins of so many people. They saw
      how He treated Simon, the former leper, who looked down on Mary
      (Luke 7:36–50). The disciples saw Jesus’ ultimate act of forgiveness
      in His prayer for His enemies while they hung Him on the cross (Luke
      23:34). Peter, too, experienced Jesus’ forgiveness in a special way. At the
      arrest, he forsook Jesus and fled. Later at the trial, three times he denied
      knowing Jesus. Yet, Jesus forgave him and restored him to fellowship
      in the presence of his fellow disciples (John 21:9–17).

What role should forgiveness play in our experience as disciples, and
      in our work of making disciples? See Luke 17:3–5, Eph. 1:7, 4:32,
      Col. 1:14.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Our God is a compassionate God, and one result of that compassion
      was that He chose to save us from our sins, to forgive what, otherwise,
      would have led to our eternal loss. How crucial that, as disciples, we
      keep before ourselves this compassion and forgiveness; after all, what
      better motivation could we have for leading others to, and nurturing
      them in, what means so much to us?



                                                                             105

      The Ostracized and Marginalized
         Jesus’ ministry and training of His disciples took place in a highly
      stratified society. The lines were clearly drawn between men and
      women, religious hierarchy and the common people, rich and poor,
      and Pharisees and publicans. The woman’s place was in the home, and
      then only certain portions of it.

Read Luke 16:19–31. What message about class distinctions is pic-
      tured here? From this parable, what can we learn about how the
      Lord viewed the attitude and actions of the wealthy establishment?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

Read Luke 18:9–14 and answer the same questions, this time about
      how Jesus viewed the actions and attitudes of the religious estab-
      lishment.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Jesus neither followed nor advocated the status quo, because He
      obviously saw many of the problems that had arisen in it. Instead, He
      openly associated with, taught, and advocated for the marginalized
      people in His society. In the Gospels we can see the kind of people
      that Jesus worked with and for. Sure, He sought to reach the upper
      classes as well, but at the same time He ministered to Gentiles, dis-
      reputable women, lepers, publicans, demoniacs, Romans, those with
      disabilities, the blind, the poor, a whole host of those considered out-
      casts, marginalized in one way or another from society.
        Again, considering what He came to the world to do, to die for the
      sins of every human being, it makes perfect sense that while He was
      here He would minister to everyone who would be ministered 10.

       What is your attitude toward the marginalized and outcasts in
       your society? What is your church’s attitude toward them? How
       can you tell if you really care or if you are just expressing the
       expected platitudes?

     Diversity and Discrimination
       Yesterday we saw how Jesus ministered to the downtrodden, the
     outcasts of society. Today we want to focus on that a little more but
     with the emphasis more on national or ethnic diversity.
       Ethnic and national bigotry was very common in the ancient world.
     Various groups saw themselves as superior to those around them. The
     ancient Greeks, for instance, viewed non-Greeks as barbarians. All
     through ancient literature we find this kind of bigotry. Unfortunately,
     Jesus’ contemporaries were not immune to that same kind of thinking,
     no matter how exalted their religious profession.

Read Exodus 12:38; 18:1; Numbers 12:1; Ruth 1:16, 17; and Matthew
     23:15. What should these texts tell us about the ethnic diversity
     that made up the nation of Israel?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        From its beginning as a nation, Israel was never a pure stock. The
     idea of a pure lineage is a more modern conception, an offspring of
     evolutionary ideology. God has made all humanity “one blood” (Acts
     17:26); we are all offspring of Adam and Eve, our first parents. And
     through faith in Jesus, we all—regardless of color, nationality, eth-
     nicity, race, or religion—become the “sons of God” (John 1:12).
        This point cannot be overemphasized: Christ’s death on the cross,
     for every human being, should once and for all denude all disciples of
     any sense of ethnic or national superiority. More so, it should remove
     all sense of bigotry toward any group of people. Before Jesus on the
     cross, upon whom all our sin, everyone’s, fell, we all stand equal.
     More than anyone else in the world, Christ’s disciples, those who fol-
     low Him, should be purged of the kind of prejudices and ethnic ten-
     sions that seem to be inbred in every culture and society. In the end,
     there are only two classes of people: the saved and the lost. And we
     who are saved should be busy going around, as did our Master, seek-
     ing to find the lost and pointing them to the only thing that makes us
     different from them, the promise of salvation that we have claimed for
     ourselves.

      To what degree have you been tainted with the prejudices and
      bigotries inherent in your own society?




                                                                       107

      The Church
        As we have seen all through this quarter, God calls us as disciples
      to do many things: spread the gospel, minister to the outcasts and the
      needy, make disciples, and on and on. And this should be happening
      in every nation around the world. The question is: How are we sup-
      posed to do this?

How do the following texts help answer the above question? Acts
      20:28; 1 Cor. 12:14–22; Eph. 4:11–13; Col. 1:17, 18.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Jesus was indeed a disciple-gathering teacher. He used every oppor-
      tunity to call, train, educate, and nurture disciples. He was never too
      busy to help a needy soul. Disciple-training was at the center of His
      ministry.
         We believe and suggest strongly that just as the tasks of disciple-
      making, teaching, training, and nurturing were central to Jesus’ ministry,
      even so they must be central to the mission of every church in the
      twenty-first century.
         Yet, no one can do it alone. That is why there is the church. Nor is that
      task limited to pastors, Bible workers, elders, deacons, and other church
      officers. It is the task of every member; Jesus’ commission excluded no
      disciple. Christ’s words, “Go ye” (Matt. 28:19), means you.
         Some members may feel uncomfortable with this idea because they
      lack training. Yet, when Jesus called fishermen for discipleship, they
      were untrained. He had to train them. Likewise, every church must
      make provisions for the discipling of every member. Each new member
      should be placed in a discipleship class for training and nurture.
      Advanced classes for seasoned disciples must be instituted, and every
      trained disciple should be put to work for the Master.
         Before departing, Jesus gave His disciples the mission to “go and
      make disciples of all nations” (Matt. 28:19, NIV). This command has
      not changed. This gospel of the kingdom still must be preached in all
      the world before the end comes (Matt. 24:14). Unless Jesus were to
      make the stones cry out to complete the task, He has no other agents
      than His church to do the job.

       How involved are you in the work that Jesus has called us all to
       do? Or are you too busy doing your own thing? When are you
       going to make the changes you know in your heart should have
       been made long ago?

     The Prayer Factor
Read the following quote from Ellen G. White. What principles can
     we take away from this for ourselves?

        “The Majesty of heaven, while engaged in His earthly ministry,
     prayed much to His Father. He was frequently bowed all night in
     prayer. . . . The Mount of Olives was the favorite resort of the Son of
     God for His devotions. Frequently after the multitude had left Him for
     the retirement of the night, He rested not, though weary with the
     labors of the day. . . . While the city was hushed in silence, and the dis-
     ciples had returned to their homes to obtain refreshment in sleep,
     Jesus slept not. His divine pleadings were ascending to His Father
     from the Mount of Olives that His disciples might be kept from the
     evil influences which they would daily encounter in the world, and
     that His own soul might be strengthened and braced for the duties and
     trials of the coming day. All night, while His followers were sleeping,
     was their divine Teacher praying. The dew and the frost of night fell
     upon His head bowed in prayer. His example is left for His follow-
     ers.”—Ellen G. White, God’s Amazing Grace, p. 167.

Read the texts below. What were the occasions that prompted these
     prayers? What can they teach us, as disciples of Christ, about
     prayer and the centrality of prayer in our mission?

      If Jesus, the God-Man, relied so much on prayer for success
      while on earth, how much more do we, as sinful humans, need it
      for successful discipleship? How satisfied are you with your
      prayer life? What do you pray about? How much time do you
      spend praying? What changes might you need to make in your
      own prayer life?


                                                                           109

    Further Study: Read The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 345–
          348, 553–560, 658–660, 881–887, 1110; Ellen G. White, “Come Rest
          Awhile,” pp. 359–363; “A Night on the Lake,” pp. 377–379; “The
          Foreshadowing of the Cross,” p. 411; “He Was Transformed,” pp. 419–
          421; “Gethsemane,” pp. 687–693, in The Desire of Ages; “The Teacher
          Sent From God,” p. 80; “Faith and Prayer,” p. 259, in Education.

            Here are some of the practical things that our church can do in the
1
          area of discipleship:

           1.   Designate disciple-making as its primary goal.
           2.   Formulate plans and methods to accomplish the task.
           3.   Train individuals for leadership for each program.
           4.   Mobilize all members for involvement in discipleship.
           5.   Institute a program of discipleship training.
2
           6.   Ascertain the types of people living in the community sur-
                rounding the church and their needs.
           7.   Institute a bridge-building program that will break down
                barriers, then meet the needs of and forge relations with the
                community surrounding each church.
           8.   Introduce programs to use the skills of new converts, to
                incorporate them into the local church, and develop a deeper
                commitment to Christ.
3
           9.   Develop programs that will assist members, especially new
                converts, in discovering, developing, and putting to use their
                spiritual gifts.
          10.   Ensure that there are adequate programs designed for mak-
                ing and nurturing disciples.
    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 Take a prayerful look at those steps listed above. What might
           you add or embellish that would be important for a church to be
           successful at making disciples? What can you do to help see these
           steps, or some like them, implemented at your local church level?
           ●
           2 How much time do you spend in prayer for the work of the
           church as a whole? Determine to spend a certain amount of time
           each day praying for our worldwide mission. Why not have your
           Sabbath School class set aside a certain time during each class to
           pray for the work of the worldwide church?
           ●3 How can we help both the clergy and the laity better under-
           stand that the work of discipleship is the work of every member
           of the church? How can you help the local church better utilize
           the gifts and talents of members? What are the kinds of things
           that tend to get in the way of the laity being involved in the work
           of discipleship and witness?

Finding Faith in Tete
by CELIA BAIONETA
   I grew up in Mozambique, following the beliefs of the church my family
attended. We didn’t go to church every week, but we never missed
Christmas and Easter. As a teenager I had a friend, Maria, who went to
church every Saturday. She often brought friends home after church, and
they spent the afternoon singing. Watching Maria, I asked my mother why
we didn’t go to worship every week. She answered, “If you want, you can
go to church every week.”
   Maria invited me to visit her church, and my mother gave her permission.
I loved it, especially the singing and the sense of unity I found there. I loved
how they hugged and shook hands, and I appreciated that they made me, a
visitor, feel welcome. That afternoon some members of the church came to
my house to pray with me. Even my mother was impressed.
   I continued attending Maria’s church, and when I became sick and
unable to go, Maria and her friends came to pray for me.
   I joined the baptismal class to learn what the Bible teaches, and I
accepted everything. I asked my mother if I could be baptized. She agreed.
However, I still had issues to deal with. I liked playing basketball and soc-
cer, and when a game was scheduled for Sabbath I had to choose between
the church and sports. I often chose sports. Then I began skipping church
even when no games were scheduled. I started staying out late with my
friends.
   I hardly noticed that I was slipping away. But my mother noticed and
warned me that I was walking down the wrong path. I made a stronger
effort to return to the church.
   Then I met Fidelino, a dedicated Adventist young man who encouraged
me to give my life completely to God. He prayed with me and for me, and
his encouragement helped me realize what was really important in life. The
following year we were married.
   We moved to another city to live, and the next year we invited my mother
to visit for a month. She was surrounded by Adventists and couldn’t escape.
She visited church, and now she attends church near her home. The next
year my father visited. He, too, was impressed with our home and our close
circle of Adventist friends. He went home and started attending the Adventist
church. Recently he was baptized. My two younger brothers now attend
church.
   God used my friend Maria’s witness and a boy’s attention to draw me to
His love and to a church family I truly enjoy.

2008    Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

          Next quarter’s Bible study guide will center on Jesus, on who He
       was, on what He taught, on what He did—and on what He is doing
       right now. The Wonder of Jesus by Roy Adams aims to give us a
       complete picture of Jesus’ past ministry on earth, the work He does
       for us now in the sanctuary, and His second coming.

Lesson 1—Who Was Jesus?
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Not the Baptist (Matt. 3:11, 12; 16:14)
       MONDAY: Not Elijah or Jeremiah or Some Other Prophet (John
       1:1–5, 17:5)
       TUESDAY: The Fascination Continues—1 (Luke 1:1–4, 2 Pet.
       1:16–21)
       WEDNESDAY: The Fascination Continues—2 (1 Cor. 1:18–27)
       THURSDAY: Messiah, Son of God (John 17:3)
       Memory Text—Matthew                   16:13
       Sabbath Gem:        The same fundamental concerns expressed by
       the people of Jesus’ own time concerning His identity have framed
       the debate about the Son of God across the centuries, heightening
       the mystique about Him.


Lesson 2—The Mystery of His Deity
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: His Preexistence—What It Means to Us (Isa. 9:6)
       MONDAY: The Witness of the New Testament (John 8:58)

       Memory Text—John                1:1–3
       Sabbath Gem:      The preexistence of Christ is a difficult concept
       to understand. When Peter confessed Jesus as the Messiah, Christ
       told him that this knowledge came from God the Father. Only
       through Divine wisdom from God’s Word and the Holy Spirit can
       we hope to understand such mysteries of the Bible.
