    INTRODUCTION



Religion in Relationships
Life is lived in relationships. Some are deep-rooted, others
superficial; some are of short duration, others last a life-
time. Some are purely functional, others intensely personal.
We relate to all kinds of people: to a partner, to children, to relatives,
to friends and neighbors but also to the service-station attendant, to
the person with whom we share a shift at work, and to the police offi-
cer who stops us for speeding. And we relate to our pastor, to the
superintendent of the school in which we have enrolled our children,
to our employer, and, yes, to the tax collector.
  All this is true for Christians, as well as for non-Christians. The
difference between us and our non-Christian counterparts is not that
we live in multiple relationships but that there is an important extra
dimension to those relationships: our religion.
  As Seventh-day Adventists, we believe in a set of doctrines. Some
we share with other Christians; some are unique to us and help mark
us as a special people with a unique message and mission. Doctrines
are not optional, not if our faith is going to be more than a shallow
feeling or a vague awareness of some greater power or transcendent
force that somehow relates to us. Doctrines rendered into words—as
best as can be expressed within the confines of human language—
reveal how we understand the divine self-revelation of God. They help
us achieve a clearer sense of who and what God (as Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit) is and what He has done, is doing, and will ultimately do
for us as individuals and as a race. We need doctrines to grasp what
the implications of our belief in God and His plan of salvation are for
our perspective on life and for our daily conduct.
  But Christianity—and most definitely Adventist Christianity—is
more than a catalog of doctrinal statements. The Christian God is
not a distant, impersonal deity who does not get involved in the
daily grind of this world and of our existence. Instead, He is a per-
sonal God of love who has encountered us in Jesus Christ, in the
most personal way possible.
  God is a covenant God, One who goes out of His way to establish
a close relationship, One who is Love Personified, and One who
seeks for a reaction to that love—a response of worship, obedience,
and love. Once we have established a relationship with God (or,

2
more correctly, once we have allowed God to establish a relationship
with us), this affects every other relationship we may have.
   Once we have gained a glimpse of who and what God is, once we
have accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior and have welcomed the
Spirit as our Guide on our pilgrimage through life, we are able to look
at the world from a new perspective. No longer is it of prime impor-
tance whether or not the peo-
ple with whom we associate A religion that
are of the same nationality or does not permeate
ethnicity or of the same polit-
ical persuasion as we are. The daily life is dead
first question we will ask and meaningless.
about the people with whom
we come in contact is whether they already share with us the knowl-
edge of the good news!
   Religion is not work based—in other words, our standing with
God does not depend on our achievements. We live by faith through
grace. Yet, a religion that does not permeate our daily lives is a dead
and meaningless exercise (James 2:17). If our relationship with God
does not impact our relationships with fellow humans, we have
every reason to wonder whether this bond with God is a reality.
   This quarter we will study numerous passages of Scripture with
the intention of increasing our awareness of the ways by which our
 faith impacts our relationship to others—to those who are close to
 us and those who are afar. We will discuss how we can strengthen
 those relationships, even restore them if they have somehow broken
 down. We will discover that, indeed, there is more religion in rela-
 tionships than many may suspect.
    This quarter's Adult Bible Study Guide was written by Reinder
 Bruinsma, a native Dutchman and longtime church worker (includ-
 ing six years, from 1995-2001, as executive secretary of the Trans-
 European Division). He is also the author of 15 books in both
 English and Dutch. In 2001, he returned to his native Netherlands,
 where he serves as the president of the Netherlands Union. His pas-
 toral concern about practical Christianity, about how we treat others,
 comes through in every lesson this quarter.

      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Exod. 20:2-17, Isa. 1:10-
      17, 1 Corinthians 13.

Memory Text: "Dear friends, let us love one another, for love
      comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and
      knows God" (1 John 4:7, NIV).

          n today's world, many people are utterly lonely; they live without

       I  meaningful relationships, without a sense of being needed or
          loved, without a sense of true belonging. Some are married, even
      have children; yet, in their deepest self, they feel alone. Others appear
      to have an intense social life but would, nonetheless, in a moment of
      honest self-assessment, admit to desperate loneliness. Many who
      share their apartment block with dozens of others and mingle every
      day with thousands in the metro or the commuter train are incapable
      of reaching out to those around them.
        And, yet, amid all this loneliness is the biblical ideal, which is that
      we live in community with others—with family, friends, colleagues,
      authorities, fellow church members, et cetera. The question is, How
      does God want us to do it?
        This week we begin our look at the answers.

The Week at a Glance: What does the Creation account
      teach us about community? What principles should guide our
      interaction with others? What does the Bible teach us about love?
      What did Jesus mean when He talked about us hating our parents?
      What role does the Cross play in our relationship with others?

     " 'It Is Not Good for the Man to Be
     Alone' " (Gen. 2:18, NIV).
        The first two chapters of the book of Genesis give us a glimpse of
     what happened when God created our world. Though much about
     Creation remains a mystery, all the essential elements we need in
     order to build a Christian worldview are, nevertheless, revealed there,
     including the truth that God created humans to be social beings, des-
     tined to live in a community.

How does the Creation account emphasize that full human life is
     experienced in relating to other human beings? Gen. 1:28; 2:18-
     25; 4:1, 2.




       It clearly was part of God's original purpose that human beings
     would exist in relationship with others. The idea of family—of a part-
     nership between a man and a woman and of a bond between parents
     and children—was part of the original fabric of Creation. Belonging
     together in a marriage relationship, and as family, is not one option
     among many but reflects the original and unchanging design for
     human happiness. This is not to say a single person cannot live a
     happy and fulfilling life, but it underlines that, from a biblical per-
     spective, the family is the fundamental building block of a healthy
     society.
       "A family is not a spill-over from our romantic passions, nor a
     product of society's requirements that parents provide their offspring
     with bed and board, nor a little circle of people deriving emotional
     support from living together. . . . Family is rooted in the Creator's
     design for the ongoing nurture of children who bring faith and moral
     value into the next generation. To undermine, neglect, or replace it is
     to wreck the core community that makes all other community possi-
     ble."—Lewis B. Smedes, Mere Morality: What God Expects From
     Ordinary People (Grand Rapids, Mich.: W. B. Eerdmans Pub. Co.,
     1983), p. 81.

       One of the most famous lines in all English literature reads, "No
       man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the con-
       tinent, a part of the main." The point being that we are all
       involved with one another, to one degree or another. What does
       this tell us about how careful we need to be regarding the influ-
       ence we exert? Make no mistake about it: We all exert an influ-
       ence on others, either for good or for bad.

                                                                              7

     Religion Has Social Dimensions                              (Exod.
     20:2-17, Matt. 7:12).

       However much our faith rests upon our relationship to God, it can-
     not be separated from our relationship to others. We live in this world
     with other people, and our religion very clearly dictates how we are to
     relate to these other people.

       As Seventh-day Adventists, we tend to divide the Ten
     Commandments into two parts, the first four dealing with our
     relationship to God, the last six with our relationship to others.
     Read the first four commandments again (Exod. 20:2-11). How
     does our obedience, or disobedience, to even these specific com-
     mandments impact others?



       At times, Christians have so emphasized the social aspects of their
     religion that they have reduced the gospel of Christ to a horizontal
     "social gospel," which leaves little or no place for the vertical aspect
     of religion: the relationship between us and our heavenly Father
     through our Lord Jesus Christ. When that happens, our religion has
     ceased to be Christian. But, at the same time, our faith in God must
     impact also our relationships with other human beings; otherwise,
     our religion, likewise, cannot be characterized as truly Christian.

Look up the following texts. What do they tell us about the social
     aspects of our faith?

     Lev. 19:18

     Isa. 1:10-17

     Hos. 6:6

     Matt. 7:12

     James 1:27

      Summarize in a paragraph the essence of what those texts above
      are saying; then ask yourself, How well am I doing in that area?
      What changes might you need to make in order to live out the
      social dimensions of our faith better?

     Building Relationships Takes Effort
     (Matt. 5:9).

        Faith in God and reliance on His grace presuppose a commitment to
     focus on Him and His will for our lives; they demand an intentional
     turning away from what is evil and negative. They also demand a deter-
     mination to bring our lives into harmony with God's will for us.
     Likewise, harmonious relationships do not happen by accident. We
     must be intentional about building relationships. As sinners living on a
     planet filled with other sinners, we are naturally prone toward selfish-
     ness, greed, and jealousy, attributes that, if left unchecked, would
     destroy any fruitful, loving relationships we would seek to have.

How do harmonious relationships come about? I Pet. 3:11. What are
     we supposed to pursue actively? Rom. 12:18.


        The peace we are to pursue in our interaction with others is not a
     mere absence of strife or disagreement. The biblical ideal of peace is
     rooted in the Hebrew concept of shalom, which stretches far beyond
     mere tolerance and includes a deep interest in others, expressed in
     support and affirmation for those around us. Again, we must remem-
     ber that these things don't come naturally to us; what comes natural
     is greed, envy, and the desire for self-supremacy. No wonder we need
     the Lord working in our lives.

What basic rule should govern our relationship with others? 1 Cor.
     10:24. What is that text saying to us? Why is it so opposite of what
     we, in our essential nature, are?




       To look after others purely for their own good, with no selfish
     motives, is to reveal Christ, whose love for suffering humanity was
     premised on nothing selfish. He loved for love's sake. No selfish
     motive led Him to do good. On the contrary, Jesus did good, because
     He loved others and wanted the best for them. What a model, what an
     ideal for us to seek to follow!

       Contemplate the different ways Jesus revealed unselfish love
       toward others in contrast to how you relate to others. End your
       contemplation at the Cross, where Christ died to save those who
       have fallen so short of His example.

                                                                            9
         WEDNESDAY June 30


      The Basis: Agape Love                       (1 co, 13:1-13).

         The New Testament uses several distinct words that all can be trans-
      lated "love." One refers in particular to love for friends, while another
      is mainly used in the context of sexual love. There is nothing inferior
      about these kinds of love. They are meant to be a vital and enriching
      part of human life in their proper time and place. But there is one spe-
      cific term—agape—which refers to the kind of love that God has for
      us. And this is the love we also must cultivate in our lives as the foun-
      dation of all our dealings with others, a disinterested love that puts the
      good of others before ourselves, the kind of love revealed perfectly in
      the life of Christ.

In 1 Corinthians 13:1-13, the word for "love" all the way through
      comes from agape. Read the chapter over as many times as you
      can and then write out what you believe the Lord is telling you
      with these words.




From what Paul writes here, what is he saying love is? How does it
      differ from much of the world's concept of love?




       Look at some of the attributes of love as expressed in
       1 Corinthians 13. Which ones might you find the most difficult
       to reveal in your own life? Perhaps you tend toward impatience,
       toward pride, or toward evil surmising—or even all these
       things. How can you be changed? Look up John 15:5. What is
       Jesus saying here that offers us the hope that we, too, can reflect
       ugape love in our own lives?

            THURSDAY July 1


     God Always Comes First                           (Luke 14:26).

        Living as a Christian is a matter of getting our priorities right. A life
     in which we and our own interests come first is not a Christian life but
     a pagan existence. We will need to remember this constantly during
     the coming weeks as we study various interhuman relationships.

In what provocative way did Christ emphasize the need to priori-
     tize our relationships? Matt. 10:37, Luke 14:26. What do you
     believe that Jesus was telling us with these words?




        What does it mean that we are to hate our loved ones for the sake
      of Christ? "Scripture usage makes it clear that this is not 'hate' in
      the usual sense of the word. In the Bible, 'to hate,' often should be
      understood simply as a typical Oriental hyperbole meaning 'to
      love less' (see Deut. 21:15-17). . . . Whoever has personal interests
      that take precedence over loyalty to Christ and devotion to His
      service will find it impossible to meet the requirements Christ
      makes of him. At all times and under all circumstances the call of
      the kingdom must take precedence." —The SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 811, 812.

        In one sense, there seems to be almost a contradiction here: In a
     study on how we should relate to others, we bring in Jesus' statements
     that, on the surface, seem to downplay interpersonal relationships.
     Yet, that's only on the surface. The point is that in order for us truly
     to have the kind of relationship with others the Lord wants for us, we
     need to keep Him first and foremost in our lives. Only from our rela-
     tionship with Him can we then act toward others as He would have us
     do. Because of what Jesus has done for us at the Cross—by reestab-
     lishing the bond between heaven and earth—can we have a relation-
     ship with Him.

       A young woman, severely damaged by an abusive father, has
       found it all but impossible to develop long-lasting and mean-
       ingful relationships with anyone now. Why must she go to the
       Cross to begin the healing process? What would tell her she
       would find healing there?




                                                                               11

Further Study: Read from Ellen G. White, Welfare Ministry,
      pp. 29-41.
        "It is only by an unselfish interest in those in need of help that we
      can give a practical demonstration of the truths of the gospel. 'If a
      brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you
      say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwith-
      standing ye give them not those things which are needful to the body;
      what doth it profit? Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
      alone.' And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the great-
      est of these is charity.' "—Welfare Ministry, p. 32.

Discussion Questions:
    0 In today's world ethnic diversity often appears to be a source
       of hatred and conflict or seems to lead to an unhealthy kind of
       nationalism and sense of superiority. Has ethnic bias ever influ-
       enced your thinking in a negative way? How can ethnic identity
       be a positive force, both in society and in the church? Or is it
       always negative?

       0 As much as time allows, read through the Gospels and see how
       much emphasis Jesus placed on how we should relate to others.
       What do the Gospels tell us about how important this topic is for
       those who claim to be His followers?

       0 Read Ephesians 2:11-18. How do these verses help us better
       understand the closeness we can now have with the Lord, a close-
       ness that will impact how we relate to others?

Summary: Religion has social dimensions. It is important to recog-
    nize that people have been created for community and are destined to
    live in relationships with others. We must remember that serving God
    has both vertical and horizontal aspects. We do well to reflect regu-
    larly on whether we allow God to have priority in our life and whether
    all our interactions with others fit into the larger framework of our
    relationship with Him.

The Bus Ride: Part 1
by KRASIMIR KAREV
   It was a bitterly cold evening. I pulled my scarf tighter around me as I
hurried from vespers to the bus stop. I shivered against the cold and tried
to shield myself from the wind and blowing snow. I arrived at the bus stop
to find just one other person standing there, a man in his forties. He
hunched down into his jacket and barely looked up to greet me. Then we
stood silently, waiting for the bus.
   I felt an almost overpowering urge to talk to this man. I asked the man
what time it was, just to make conversation. After a few moments of chit-
chat, this stranger told me that his name was Stefan and that he intended
to commit suicide soon. I knew he was serious, for his entire body spoke
of hopelessness and unrelieved burdens.
   I asked him if he would tell me why he was so down on life. He told me
he was an engineer and had been working in a factory in town. But recently
he had lost his job when the factory laid off many workers. Although he had
two university degrees, he could not find suitable work. To make matters
worse, his wife, who was a doctor, seemed to enjoy rubbing it in that he was
not working. Her attitude discouraged him more. He felt the sting of her
reproach and knew that she did not appreciate him as a man or as a husband.
   In the dim light of the street lamp, I could see that this man was visibly
suffering as he shared his story. It was evident that he felt helpless to climb
out of his depression. But how could I help him? Soon the bus would
come, and we would part. I prayed silently that God would give me wis-
dom to say the right thing to this man.
   Within a few minutes the bus came, and we climbed aboard. It was
almost empty, and we found seats together in the back of the bus, where
 we could talk without interruption. Stefan's eyes begged for a thread of
 hope to hang on 10.
   My mind sifted through Bible stories to find one about a man who had
 undergone great difficulties. The prophet Elijah came to mind, and I began
 telling Stefan about Elijah. As I talked, I felt reassured that God had
 planted this prophet's story in my mind. It was as if the words came to me
 from nowhere, and I sensed that each word was doing its good work in this
 man's consciousness. I had no doubt that the Holy Spirit guided our con-
 versation. We spoke animatedly, and he had lots of questions. It was as if
 we were alone on the bus, totally unaware of the other passengers or of the
 snow swirling outside.

         LESSON             2       *July 3-9



      "Honor Your Father and
      Your Mother"


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Gen. 22:1-14, Exod.
      20:12, Luke 2:41-52, Eph. 6:1-3, 1 Pet. 5:5.

Memory Text: "Honour thy father and mother; (which is the
      first commandment with promise;) that it may be well with thee,
      and thou mayest live long on the earth" (Ephesians 6:2, 3).

              s Seventh-day Adventists, we point to the seventh-day Sabbath

      A       as one of our core beliefs. And rightly so. It is part of the Ten
              Commandments, which encapsulate the basic principles for
      humanity. But to " 'honor your father and your mother' " (Exod.
      20:12, NIV) is also one of the foundational principles for a healthy
      society. It is interesting to note that these two principles—keeping the
      Sabbath and honoring our parents—are singled out and mentioned
      together: " ' "Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you
      must observe my Sabbaths" ' " (Lev. 19:3, NIV).
        This week we'll take a look at just this specific concept, of how
      children, or even how adults, should relate not only to their parents
      but to those who are older, in general. Because, in almost all cases, no
      matter who we are or how old we are, we come in contact with those
      who are even older.

The Week at a Glance: What does the Bible say about
      how we should relate to older people? How do we honor our par-
      ents? Can obedience to our parents ever interfere with our obli-
      gations to God? What kind of examples does the Bible leave
      regarding parent-and-child relationships?

     Respect for "Gray Hair" (1 Pet. 5:5).
        Over the past few decades, in a large part of the world, a youth cul-
     ture has developed, teaching that the secret of successful living is to
     remain young and beautiful. Detection of a first wrinkle can cause a
     minor, or even not so minor, trauma for someone who embraces the
     ideals of the youth culture. But this youth culture goes far beyond the
     way we look. Children and young people have become important
     markets for manufacturers of clothing and sport shoes and for all
     kinds of gadgets. They are specifically targeted by the entertainment
     industry, as well as by fast-food chains. Parents are made to feel guilty
     if their offspring cannot get the latest fads or follow the latest fash-
     ions.
        Just as worrisome, if not more so, is a parallel trend: In many mod-
     ern homes in many parts of the world, the younger members of the
     family tend to set the domestic agenda and to determine the value sys-
     tem by which the home operates.

What basic rule does the apostle Peter refer to as a guiding princi-
      ple in any relationship between older and younger persons? 1 Pet.
      5:5. How was this same principle regarding the relationship
      between young and old already embedded in the Mosaic law?
      Lev. 19:32. How do we apply this principle in our dealings with
      older people?




        Showing respect, and being submissive, does not mean accepting
      everything without comment or complaint; nor must we obey every-
      thing anyone older than we are tells us to do. These principles need to
      be understood in the larger context of all God's commandments.
         At the same time, however, this principle does underline the basic
      concept that age and experience count and that respect is due those
      who are older than we are, whatever our age. Indeed, we can honor
      and respect those who are older than we are, even if we don't neces-
      sarily agree with what they say or believe.

       On a purely practical level, why does it make good sense to
       honor and respect our elders? What justification, outside the
       Bible imperatives, do we have for such an attitude?




                                                                            15

     Honoring Our Parents (Exod. 20:•12).
        How we relate to our parents is clearly an important issue. One of
     the Ten Commandments specifically addresses the parent-and-child
     relationship.

Read Exodus 20:12. How does this principle inform us about our
     relationship to our parents? For instance,

     1. What does honoring mean?


     2. Is honoring the same as being obedient? If not, how do these
     two concepts differ?


     3. Is it possible to honor parents whose lifestyles we disapprove
     of? Can children honor parents even if the parents are abusive?


       "Our obligation to our parents never ceases. Our love for them, and
     theirs for us, is not measured by years or distance, and our responsi-
     bility can never be set aside."—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home,
     p. 360.

Read Proverbs 19:26. What further light does this text shed on how
     we should relate to our parents? Does it mean children have a
     duty to support their parents materially?


       In many societies, aging parents have to rely on the material sup-
     port of their children. Often elderly parents live in the home of one of
     their adult children and form part of their extended family. In other
     countries, this is no longer the case. One pays taxes and contributes to
     social-security systems and expects to be cared for by society when
     one no longer has regular income from work or can no longer live
     independently. But, whatever the social system under which we live,
     children must continue to care for their parents; if not in material
     ways, certainly in immaterial ways. Few things are more abhorrent
     than the neglect of aging parents by children too busy to spend time
     with them.

      Why do you think the Lord placed this commandment in the
      law? What does this commandment tell us about the impor-
      tance of caring for those (not only of family) who need help?

      What About Obedience? (Eph. 6:1-3, Col. 3:20).
         Many people have a problem with authority. They want either too
      much or too little. Authoritarian people are a problem to themselves
      and to others, ruining relationships as they bully their way through
      life. Those who do not want to exert any authority and/or do not
      accept any authority are, likewise, a source of trouble. This is true in
      general but in particular in the parent-child relationship. Parental love
      does not exclude the concept of discipline and obedience, and the
      love of children to their parents finds concrete expression in accept-
      ing parental authority.

What aspect of the relationship between generations is singled out in
      Paul's list of last-day conditions? 2 Tim. 3:2.




        Paul's catalogue of elements of godlessness that will be rampant in
      "the last days" is frightening. It is significant that he mentions dis-
      obedience to parents as one of the terrible conditions of the time of
      the end. This reveals a general moral breakdown that reaches into the
      inner sanctum of the family, as well. And if the family is falling apart,
      there's little hope for society as a whole.

How does the Bible stress the importance of the acceptance of
      parental authority? Eph. 6:1, Col. 3:20.




        The obedience the Bible demands is not blind obedience, and
      respect for parental wishes cannot simply be enforced but must, to
      a significant degree, be earned. Parents may make demands, but
      these must be reasonable, consistent, and always with the best inter-
      est of the child and, most important, not contrary to other biblical
      principles.

        Do children ever reach an age when their parents may no longer
        expect respect, if not necessarily obedience, from them? If so,
        when? When the children leave the home? Or when they
        become legal adults? Can we show our parents respect and
        honor while not obeying them? If so, how?


                                                                            17

     Parents and Children: Part 1
       The Bible is, in many ways, a family history. All through its pages,
     we are shown the lives of families, often revealed in the context of
     parent-and-children relationships. Some of these relationships are
     quite healthy; others aren't. Yet, all are placed in the Bible for rea-
     sons, because all can teach us something. The culture back then was
     radically different from our culture today, but basic principles
     remain.

Look up the following texts. What can we learn from them about how
     we should or should not relate to our parents?

     Gen. 22:1-14



     Genesis 27



     Lev. 20:9



     Deut. 21:18-21



     2 Sam. 15:1-12

     Luke 2:41-52

     Parents and Children: Part 2
       Yesterday's study provided us with some powerful and dramatic exam-
     ples of parent-and-children relationships, particularly in the context of
     how children should relate to their parents. The hard question is, How do
     we apply those examples to us, today, such as those in Deuteronomy,
     where rebellious children who don't obey their parents should be taken
     out and stoned? Or what do we do with the Abraham and Isaac story
     (obeying and honoring your parents is one thing, but this . .)?

Again, keeping in mind the time and culture in which these incidents
      occurred, what universal principles can you draw from these stories
      that help us understand how we are to relate to our parents while,
      at the same time, keeping our first loyalty to the Lord?




        It is clear from some of these accounts that there can be a conflict
      between obeying parents and obeying the Lord. Read Genesis 27:8
      for one example. Or look at the situation in Matthew 8:21: What could
      be more basic and honorable than burying one's own father?

Read Ephesians 6:1. What does this say that helps us better understand
      our obligations to our parents in light of our walk with the Lord?




        Notice in Ephesians 6:1 that Paul not only tells children to obey
      their parents "in the Lord" but gives the reason why they should: "for
      this is right." And why is it right? The next verses give the reason:
      Because it is a commandment of God.

       A young woman had grown up in a home of abusive, drug-
       addicted, even violent parents whose shameful treatment of her
       as a child left the woman an emotional cripple. Eventually, she
       became a follower of Jesus. How is she supposed to honor her
       father and mother?


                                                                            19
                  FRIDAY July 9

Further Study: "Isaac believed in God. He had been taught
     implicit obedience to his father, and he loved and reverenced the God
     of his father. He could have resisted his father if he had chosen to do
     so. But after affectionately embracing his father, he submitted to be
     bound and laid upon the wood."—Ellen G. White, The Story of
     Redemption, p. 82.
        "Said one of her mother, 'I always hated my mother, and my mother
     hated me.' These words stand registered in the books of heaven to be
     opened and revealed in the day of judgment when everyone shall be
     rewarded according to his works.
       "If children think that they were treated with severity in their child-
     hood, will it help them to grow in grace and in the knowledge of
     Christ, will it make them reflect His image, to cherish a spirit of retal-
     iation and revenge against their parents, especially when they are old
     and feeble? Will not the very helplessness of the parents plead for the
     children's love? Will not the necessities of the aged father and mother
     call forth the noble feelings of the heart, and through the grace of
     Christ, shall not the parents be treated with kind attention and respect
     by their offspring? Oh, let not the heart be made as adamant as steel
     against father and mother!"—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home,
     p. 362.

Discussion Questions:
      O Read again Exodus 20:12. What qualifications, or exceptions,
      if any, does it place on the commandment to honor our mother
      and father?

      O What do you think it means to honor your parents "in the
      Lord"? How does that help us better understand what is said in
      Exodus 20:12?

Summary: In today's society, the rights of children are very much
     emphasized. And rightly so. But we should not lose sight of the fact
     that older people are also important and that they have the right to be
     respected by the youth. The commandment to "honor" our parents
     applies to the young and to the not so young. Our parents deserve our
     support and respect and, above all, our love. Families cannot function
     adequately if there is no respect for authority.

The Bus Ride: Part 2
by KRASIMIR KAREV
   I met Stefan at the bus stop on a cold evening. I could tell he was bur-
dened down with a heavy weight of care. I felt impressed to speak to him
and prayed that God would tell me what to say. On the bus ride across
the city we talked, oblivious to the cold inside the bus or the snow
swirling around outside. Little by little I saw a glimmer of hope in
Stefan's eyes.
   We talked about God's love for the sinner and about Jesus Christ, the
Savior. I could see hope begin to light his eyes. As we approached my stop,
I gave him the address of the church in the town where I lived and told him
when services were held. Then we parted.
   Two weeks later on Saturday evening, Stefan came to the church for
vespers. He had brought a chess game with him, in hopes of playing a
game of chess with me. At the end of the service I greeted him warmly and
introduced him to several men in the church whom I had asked to pray for
Stefan. He told me that after we had talked that night on the bus he had
decided to find the courage to continue living rather than commit suicide.
I asked Stefan if he could share with me what had happened in the past
two weeks. He agreed, so we went outside into the cold and talked for two
hours.
   He told me that he had learned that his wife was having an affair. He
had decided to move to a town in Bulgaria as far from his wife as pos-
sible. I asked him if I could pray for him before he left, and he agreed.
 We prayed, then I gave him my telephone number, and we parted. I did
 not know if I would ever see Stefan again, but I prayed for him every
 day.
    A few months later my telephone rang. It was Stefan. He sounded so
 happy, so well, that I hardly recognized him. He had located the Adventist
 church in his city, and the members had welcomed him and loved him. He
 had found a job and was enjoying his work. He was studying the Bible and
 seemed sincerely eager to learn more about what God had in store for him.
    And he told me of the surprise that had awaited him—he had learned
 that his great-grandmother had been an Adventist. "I have found myself1"
 he exclaimed. "I am saved!"
    Later still, I learned that Stefan had been baptized into the Adventist
 Church. God took a man at the end of his rope on a freezing night and
 warmed him with His love. He truly is able to save to the uttermost.

      Parenthood                          Joys and
      Responsibilities



         SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Ps. 127:3; Prov. 13:24;
      23:13, 14; 29:15; Eph. 6:4; Phil. 4:9.

Memory Text: "[Sons and daughters] are a heritage from the
      Lord, children a reward from Him" (Psalm 127:3, NIV).

          s it more difficult to be a parent today than it was a few decades ago?

       /  Or are people today simply more conscious of the demands of par-
          enthood than they were in the past? Has it become more difficult to
      fmd the time to be a good parent? Is it becoming more and more diffi-
      cult to lead children in the right direction, in this age of television and
      Internet, than it was when life was less hectic, when we were not bom-
      barded with fast-paced commercials and sentimental soaps?
        Also, however ideal the biblical notion of a two-parent family
      (mother and father) is, the world is not an ideal place; many other
      types of families exist. But whatever the type, the Bible offers us
      inspired principles on how to be the best parents possible.
        This week we will look at some of the key factors in responsible
      Christian parenting. The Scriptures convey a clear message: To be a
      parent is not only meant to be a great joy and honor but also an enor-
      mous responsibility.

The Week at a Glance: What is expected of a good par-
      ent? What does the Bible say about discipline? Who ultimately is
      responsible for the spiritual decision children make when they get
      older? How important is our example to our children?

     Fruit of the Womb                   (Ps. 127:3).

       The attitude of most people toward starting a family has changed
     drastically. In the past, people were usually expected to have children
     fairly soon after marriage. In many cultures, having a child before
     nine months of married life raises eyebrows or worse. On the other
     hand, not having children in the first few years after getting married
     would be a reason for wonder or pity.
       Attitudes today have greatly changed. The question for us, as a peo-
     ple who seek to follow the Lord, is What should our attitudes about
     children be?

Read the following texts. What point do they seem to be making
      about who does and does not have children? Gen. 29:31; 30:2, 22;
     1 Sam. 1:5, 6, 19, 20; 2:21; Luke 1:7, 13-25.



         These texts show that God worked miracles in order for these
      women to conceive. Yet, we must not assume that every barren
      woman is barren because God has closed her womb. Although there
      is no question that, when all is said and done, God is the Giver of life,
      we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions regarding fertility
      problems. Sin has brought physical damage to all of us, in one form
      or another. In the end, whatever our situation, we need to trust in the
      Lord. Those who do have children, however, must realize what an
      awesome responsibility they have been given.

What does the psalmist have to say on this topic? Ps. 127:3.


         In ancient biblical times, as in some cultures today, not being able
      to have children was often the cause of great shame. Having a son to
      ensure the family would not die out was of particular value, and hav-
      ing many sons would usually bring enormous prestige. Against this
      background, the statement of the psalmist that children are "a her-
      itage" or even "a reward" from the Lord becomes extra meaningful.
      But, in a more general way, the text emphasizes a truth many modern
      people are inclined to forget: God is the Giver of children. Even today,
      in an age of sexual enlightenment and fertility treatments, children
      are a divine inheritance!

       In what ways is having children parallel to the act of Creation
       as depicted in Genesis 1:26, 27? What should these parallels tell
       parents about their responsibilities toward their children?
                                                                             23
                 MONDAY July 12


      What Is Expected of a Good Parent?
      (Deus. 4:9; 6:6, 7; Eph. 6:4).

         No one ever said that raising children was easy; and all of us know
      that babies do not come into the world with instruction manuals.
         Paul reminded Timothy of the duty we have to provide for our rel-
      atives, and that, of course, applies, when we are married, first of all to
      our partners and, when we have children, also to our offspring (1 Tim.
      5:8). We are supposed to know what is good for them and to provide
      them with these good things (Matt. 7:11). But there is more to
      Christian parenting than giving children food, clothing, and shelter.

What is to be a key element in the upbringing of children? Deut. 4:9;
      6:6, 7; Ps. 78:5-8; Prov. 22:6.




Read Ephesians 6:1-4. What is this telling parents about how they
      should relate to their children?




        Ephesians 6:1-4 looks at the parent-and-child relationship from two
     perspectives: that of the parent, as well as that of the child. The child
     has the duty to obey and honor the parent, but the parent cannot treat
     a child in any manner he or she wants 10. Parents must be careful not
     to discourage their children by continuous criticism and rebuke or by
     the wrong kind of discipline. Order is essential, but unnecessary reg-
     ulations and endless petty rules may do more harm than good and
     may well "embitter" children (Col. 3:21, NIV).
       "The parent-child relationship is not one-sided. It is a feature of
     Paul's treatment of these domestic categories that the stronger have
     obligations to the weaker. The gospel introduced a fresh element into
     parental responsibility by insisting that the feelings of the child must be
     taken into consideration. In a society where the father's authority . . .
     was absolute, this represented a revolutionary concept."—The
     Expositor's Bible Commentary, Frank E. Gaebelein, gen. ed. (Grand
     Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Pub. House, 1978), vol. 11, p. 81.

      What do you think it means to refrain from provoking your
      children to wrath? If you are a parent, ask yourself how well or
      how poorly you have been following Paul's words.

     Discipline—Yes, But How?                            (Prov. 19:18).

        "Discipline" can be understood in several ways. Not only is disci-
     pline described as training expected to produce a specific character-
     istic or pattern of behavior, especially training that produces moral or
     mental improvement, but also as punishment intended to correct or
     train. This is surprisingly close to how the Bible describes discipline.
        The writer of the proverb has a lot to say about the necessity of
     timely discipline. In 19:18 he puts it in these strong words:
     "Discipline your son in his early years while there is hope. If you
     don't you will ruin his life" (TLB).

Does physical punishment have a role in disciplining a child? Prov.
     13:24; 23:13, 14; 29:15.


       Many countries have introduced legislation that forbids any corpo-
     ral punishment in schools. In some countries the law also forbids, or
     severely restricts, physical punishment of children by their parents.
     With this in mind, what can we say from a Christian perspective?
        First of all, we must not forget that discipline varies from culture to
     culture, and what is considered appropriate in one culture might not
     be in another.
        Second, we must realize that corporal punishment can easily
     become a way of releasing the frustration and pent-up anger of the
     parent or educator rather than a carefully thought-through response to
     the objectionable attitude or action of a child.
        And third, if corporal punishment ever has a place, it must be the
     exception rather than the rule.
       "Whipping may be necessary when other resorts fail, yet [the par-
     ents] should not use the rod if it is possible to avoid doing so. . . .
     Many times you will find that if you will reason with them kindly,
     they will not need to be whipped. And such method of dealing will
     lead them to have confidence in you."—Ellen G. White, Child
     Guidance, p. 250.

       How is the way in which God disciplines us as His sons and
       daughters a model for the disciplining of children by their
       earthly parents? Heb. 12:6-11. What principles can we learn
       about disciplining our children from these verses? If you are a
       parent, ask yourself, Has my corporal punishment been out of
       anger or out of the principle depicted in Hebrews?




                                                                            25

      Young People Must Decide
      for Themselves
Christian parents are challenged to do everything they can to
      urge their children to stay close to the "faith of their fathers" and
      to the church. But who, in the end, are responsible for the choices
      children make as they get older? Prov. 1:8-15.


        The disciples believed religion was something for adults, but Christ
      wanted the children also to come to Him (Matt. 19:13-15). He took
      time for them, to talk to them, and to bless them. Christian parents and
      other adult church members must be intentional in bringing children to
      Christ and must take away any barriers they can possibly dispose of.
        Of course, eventually each person, young or old, must make his or
      her own decision whether or not to become a follower of the Lord. No
      undue pressure should ever be applied. Children should not sign up
      for baptism simply because their parents are eager they do so. But this
      does not mean children should not be tactfully urged to make a choice.
      As parents, we should try in our God-given power to make the path as
      easy as possible for our children to accept the Lord.

Read Matthew 19:16-23. What does it teach about free will regarding
      salvation? Why must all parents always keep this principle in
      mind? At the same time, because our children do have free will,
      what does this tell us about how careful and tactful and loving we
      must be with our children as we seek to guide them in the right
      direction?




        We can tell our children about Jesus. We can read daily from a good
     children's Bible. We can teach them how to pray. We can take them
     each week to the children's Sabbath School. We can make sure we have
     videos in our home that are worth watching, and we can help our
     youngsters, as they are developing into teenagers, to make deliberate
     choices about the music to which they listen, the books they read, and
     the films they watch. We can sacrifice financially by providing
     Adventist education. But one of the most important aspects of
     Christian parenting is never to cease praying for our children.
     Countless are the stories of how God has answered the prayers of
     parents who talked to the Lord about their children. This is an aspect
     of parental care that never comes to an end.

             THURSDAY July 15


     Being a Role Model                     (Phil. 4:9, 2 Tim. 1:5).

Read Philippians 4:9. What is Paul saying there? What principle do
     we see in that text that can be very crucial for parents to be aware
     of as they seek to guide their children on the right spiritual path?




        It is easy for people, at least in public, to appear as fine Christians.
     You can fool some of the people, most of the time. However, the peo-
     ple you can't fool, at least for very long, are those in your own fam-
     ily, particularly your children as they grow older. They will see things
     about you no one else outside your family will see. How important,
     then, that no matter what we profess, our lives not be lived in contra-
     diction to our profession. This doesn't mean we are perfect; it means
     only that our children see the sincerity and reality of our Christian
     walk, which includes our own repentance, our own humility, our own
     willingness to apologize to them, even when we make mistakes. How
     we live impacts our children so much more than what we say or pro-
     fess to believe.

What role models did Timothy have in his youth, and how did these
      help him to shape his life? 2 Tim. 1:5. What message is here for us
      as parents, as well?




        In his book Passing on the Torch, Adventist sociologist Roger L.
      Dudley makes the following observation: "I like to think of value trans-
      mission as a huge smorgasbord where all the tempting dishes of com-
      peting values are displayed. Here the youth will eventually get to
      choose the items that are most appealing to them. And which will they
      choose? Those that are the most colorful and attractive, most delectable,
      most tasty! It is not our responsibility to force our values upon our
      young people. It is our responsibility to model our values so attractively
      that these young people cannot help seeing that they are vastly superior
      to the competition, and will freely choose them."—(Hagerstown, Md.:
      Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1986), p. 117.

       Of all the things we can do for our children, why is loving them,
       unconditionally, the way Christ loves us, the most important?


                                                                             27

Further Study: Read from Ellen G. White, Mind, Character, and
      Personality, vol. 1, pp. 131-186; Child Guidance, pp. 169-174.

        "Parents may do everything in their power to give their children
      every privilege and instruction, in order that they may give their hearts
      to God; yet the children may refuse to walk in the light and, by their
      evil course, cast unfavorable reflections upon their parents who love
      them, and whose hearts yearn after their salvation."—Child Guidance,
      p. 173.
        "Children imitate their parents; hence great care should be taken to
      give them correct models. Parents who are kind and polite at home,
      while at the same time they are firm and decided, will see the same
      traits manifested in their children. If they are upright, honest, and
      honorable, their children will be quite likely to resemble them in these
      particulars. If they reverence and worship God, their children, trained
      in the same way, will not forget to serve Him also."—Page 215.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Numerous times in the Bible, the Lord is called our Father,
       and we are called His children. What do those images teach us
       about how we, as parents (either as mother or father) should
       relate to our children? How does our heavenly Father relate to
       us? What can we learn from how He deals with us regarding how
       we should deal with our children?

           What should a parent do who realizes he or she has been a
       very poor role model for his or her child? The child is now 18. He
       or she no longer goes to church and follows a lifestyle that con-
       flicts in many ways with Seventh-day Adventist standards. How
       can the harm be undone?

Summary: As modern people, we are aware of the biological aspects
    of conception and childbirth. However, that does not take away from
    the fact that every child is a gift from God. Receiving children brings
    joy but also a heavy responsibility. Parenting has to do with teaching
    and with the transmission of values. Discipline, administered in love,
    will ever be an important aspect of parenting. But, most significant of
    all is that parents and other adults involved in the rearing of children
    live by the faith they profess and make sure they are credible role
    models.

The Shout
of Joy by            J. H. ZACHARY

   Stevanus Widjaja is the only Adventist in his family. Although his fam-
ily is Buddhist, he attended the Adventist university in Indonesia to study
English, knowing English would help him in his business plans. As grad-
uation approached, a college professor became concerned that Stevanus
had never made a decision for Christ, though he had attended weeks of
prayer and classes every day. The professor invited him to give his life to
Christ, but Stevanus held back.
   The next day the professor was surprised to see Stevanus among the
baptismal candidates. During a nightlong struggle, the young man had
surrendered to Jesus.
   And Stevanus has never turned away from Christ. Today he owns a
major importing business in Indonesia and employs 50 people. He com-
mitted using God's financial blessings to share his newfound faith with
others. He provides the finances for several major evangelistic programs
in Indonesia every year and has preached for three evangelistic series. He
praises the Lord that more than thirteen hundred persons have come to
God during the evangelistic meetings he has sponsored.
   During one meeting in the province of Kalimantan (on the island of
Borneo), Stevanus sensed the presence and power of God in the hall as he
appealed to his audience to accept Jesus as Savior. Suddenly, a little girl
shouted, "Mommy, look!" She pointed to the ceiling. Her mother tried to
hush her. After the service the child's mother asked her, "Why did you
shout during the pastor's call?"
   "I saw Jesus, Mommy. He was up there near the ceiling!"
   That night Stevanus reported that 49 persons had responded to the call
                              of Christ. "Surely Christ was present that
                              night," he says quietly.
                                Stevanus continues to preach at two evan-
                              gelistic series a year, leaving his business in
                              the hands of his employees. "I have experi-
                              enced the presence of God during these meet-
                              ings. I must share Jesus with others as often
                              as possible."

      Marriage Is Not
      Out-of-Date



         SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Gen. 2:18-25, John 2:1-
      11, Eph. 5:22-33, Heb. 13:4, 1 Pet. 3:1-7.

Memory Text: "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved
      the church and gave himself up for her" (Ephesians 5:25, NIV).

              ll through the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, the image

      A       of marriage appears, in one form or another. Sometimes the
              images are of good marriages; sometimes they are of bad
      marriages; sometimes the images depict faithfulness; sometimes they
      depict infidelity. Either way, and whether in the Old Testament or in
      the New, marriage is often used as a metaphor for the relationship
      between the Lord and His people.
        Thus, it should be clear how seriously the Lord esteems marriage.
      For Him to use it time and again as a metaphor for His relationship
      with His people should tell us marriage should be something special.
        Therefore, this week we take a look at some biblical principles
      regarding this divinely inspired institution.

The Week at a Glance: What can we learn about mar-
      riage from the Genesis account? How should a husband treat his
      wife? How does Christ's death reflect an important principle nec-
      essary for creating a good marriage?

     Marriage in Paradise
Read Genesis 2:18-25. What basic principles can we find in this
     account of the first husband/wife relationship that can help us,
     today, understand what God's ideal for marriage should be? As
     you read, ask yourself the following questions: (1) What signifi-
     cance is in the fact Eve was created out of Adam's physical body,
     as opposed to her being created from something separate?
     (2) What do Adam's words in verse 23 mean? (3) Why, when they
     saw each other naked, were they not ashamed?




        However unique the background to the story, it does show there was
     to be an intimacy between a husband and his wife that wasn't found
     anywhere else. There showed a closeness, a bond, both physical and
     spiritual, that no other person should be allowed to violate. The mar-
     riage relationship is blessed of God; it's something sacred, something
     we have been able to take from Eden, from a perfect world. How cru-
     cial, then, that we cherish it as we should.

Read Ephesians 5:22-33 and 1 Peter 3:1-7. How do both Paul and
     Peter stress the unique bond of a marriage relationship? Who,
     ultimately, is deemed the head of the home? And yet, at the same
     time, what principles should dictate how the husband should treat
     the wife?




        Though both Peter and Paul are clear about the role of husband and
      wife in marriage, notice how many times they stress that the husband
      should love the wife; in fact, Paul, in Ephesians, admonished hus-
      bands to love their wives with the kind of self-sacrificial love that
      compelled Christ to love the church. Imagine how much better our
      marriages would be if both husband and wife, in the Lord, followed
      these biblical principles.

       Dwell more on the idea of Christ's death as an example of the
       kind of self-sacrificing love husbands should have for their
       wives. What great changes could that attitude on the part of
       husbands bring to homes and marriages?


                                                                         31
                MONDAY              July 19


      Marriage—Till Death Do Us Part                                   (Matt.
      5:32, 19:9).

         Some people who have been married for just a year or two decide
      they made a mistake and go their separate ways. Others who have
      been together for thirty or more years conclude that their relationship
      has become empty and stale and get a divorce. Also, an increasing
      number of people live in common-law relationships and shy away
      from marriage.
         What is the underlying problem? Many of today's younger genera-
      tion have a problem in making long-term commitments, whether it
      comes to church membership and/or to sealing a love relationship
      with a marriage vow.

How do the words of Christ Himself indicate that marriage is a life-
      long commitment? Matt. 5:32, 19:9.


        Those are very strong words, leaving what seems like little room
     for extenuating circumstances. Indeed, the principles stated in the
     Church Manual continue to provide a solid basis for our thinking:
        "Central to God's holy plan for our world was the creation of beings
     made in His image who would multiply and replenish the earth and
     live together in purity, harmony, and happiness. He brought forth Eve
     from the side of Adam and gave her to Adam as his wife. Thus was
     marriage instituted—God the author of the institution, God the offi-
     ciator at the first marriage. . . .
        "The church adheres to this view of marriage and home without
     reservation, believing that any lowering of this high view is to that
     extent a lowering of the heavenly ideal. The belief that marriage is a
     divine institution rests upon the Holy Scriptures. Accordingly, all think-
     ing and reasoning in the perplexing field of divorce and remarriage
     must constantly be harmonized with that holy ideal revealed in Eden.
        "The church believes in the law of God; it also believes in the for-
     giving mercy of God. It believes that victory and salvation can as
     surely be found by those who have transgressed in the matter of
     divorce and remarriage as by those who have failed in any other of
     God's holy standards."—(Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald® Pub.
     Assoc., 2000), pp. 194, 195.

       Focus on the last paragraph of the Church Manual. What hope
       does that give you if you have, indeed, violated the biblical
       standard of marriage? At the same time, what should Christ's
       words above tell us about how important it is that we do every-
       thing possible to keep our marriages intact?

              TUESDAY July 20


     The Joy of Sex
Read Genesis 1:27, 28; 2:24, 25. What do they tell us about sexual-
     ity? Who originated it? Who encouraged it? Was there anything
     "dirty" about it in the context in which it is presented here?




       Through the centuries there have been Christians who have rejected
     sex as dirty, unspiritual, and sinful, even to the point that many
     believed that those who wanted to dedicate themselves to the Lord in
     a special way ought to remain celibate. Throughout church history, in
     many religious communities, sex was, at least officially, outlawed,
     even among married people.
        On the other hand, immorality has, at times, been hailed as true
     freedom, with all inhibitions set aside in the name of advanced reli-
     gious truth.
        The Christian view of sex is a balanced view. There is more to life
     than sex. But the enjoyment of our sexuality is definitely a precious
     part of life—a gift of our Creator, who made us "male and female,"
     and within the right context it can be a beautiful expression of both
     human and divine love.
        Like all God's gifts, however, it can be abused, and few gifts have
     been more greatly abused than this one. The key for the Christian is
     to understand under what circumstances the Lord wants him or her
     to benefit from and enjoy this blessing. When is sexual activity
     appropriate, and when is it not? These are important questions,
     because our world is filled with sad results of those who have mis-
     used one of God's greatest manifestations of His love for humanity.
     How like the devil to take something so wonderful and turn it into
     something that will lead to the ruin of many souls.

       All of the following texts talk, in one context or another, about
       human sexuality: Genesis 2:24; Proverbs 5:15-23; Ecclessiates
       9:9; Song of Solomon; Romans 1:26, 27; 1 Corinthians 7:5.
       From these texts and any others you find, write a paragraph for
       someone who isn't a Christian, explaining the biblical view of
       sexuality.




                                                                        33
          WEDNESDAY July 21


      When There Are Problems                             (Matt. 5:27, 28;
      Heb. 13:4).

         We live in a world full of temptations. Never should we under-
      estimate the determination of the devil to divert the followers of
      Christ from their life of discipleship; and one of the most effective
      ways of doing so is to lead them into sexual immorality. The apostle
      Paul was specifically addressing instances of immorality among
      church members when he stated: "So, if you think you are standing
      firm, be careful that you don't fall" (1 Cor. 10:12, NIV).

What principle ought to be kept in mind and to be pursued with firm
     determination by all who are married and claim to be followers of
     Christ? 1 Cor 10:13, Heb. 13:4.




         Ellen G. White makes an important point when stressing the role of
      our will in remaining faithful to a marriage vow. A determination to
      focus our mind on spiritual matters will help us when we face sexual
      temptations: "Christ presented before His disciples the far-reaching
      principles of the law of God. He taught His hearers that the law was
      transgressed by the thoughts before the evil desire was carried out in
      actual commission. We are under obligation to control our thoughts,
      and to bring them into subjection to the law of God. The noble pow-
      ers of the mind have been given to us by the Lord, that we may employ
      them in contemplating heavenly things. God has made abundant
      provision that the soul may make continual progression in the divine
      life. . . . We give our time and thought to the trivial and commonplace
      things of the world, and neglect the great interests that pertain to eter-
      nal life."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1145.
         But not all is necessarily lost when we do succumb to temptation.
      Although sin may result in consequences that can not be undone, God
      is always willing to forgive. And to forgive impure thoughts, sexual
      indiscretions, or even blatantly immoral conduct is no more difficult
      for God than to forgive a lie or an act of pride or selfishness.

       What practical steps can both men and women take in the area
       of alleviating sexual temptation, not only for themselves but to
       make sure they aren't a stumbling block to others? How do
       what we read, watch, or wear, and where we go all play a role in
       how well we deal with this problem?

      Christ Endorsed Marriage                           (John 2:1-11).

        Some of the advice given by the apostle Paul would suggest he was
     not overenthusiastic about marriage. Statements to that effect (such as
     in 1 Corinthians 7:8) should, however, be read in their context. They
     were written in response to a specific question (vs. 1), under circum-
     stances we do not know in detail. Just two chapters later, Paul claims
     the right to marry and refers to the "other apostles and the Lord's
     brothers and Cephas," who traveled together with "a believing wife"
     (1 Cor 9:5, NIV). The overall message of the Bible is undeniable:
     Marriage not only is permitted but it is a great gift, in particular, for
     believers who know the One who instituted it.

What does the prominent place given in John's Gospel to the story of
      Christ's attendance at the wedding in Cana suggest? John 2:1-11.


        It is quite significant that John includes the story of the wedding in
      Cana among the very few miracle stories he recounts. The account
      makes abundantly clear that Jesus was happy to be associated with
      this wedding feast and that, by His very presence, He underlined not
      only how good it is to have a party but that it is good when people get
      married.

How does the use of the imagery of the wedding feast further under-
      line the value and importance of marriage? Matt. 22:1-14, Rev.
      19:7-9.


        "In Biblical times a marriage involved two major events, the
      betrothal and the wedding. These were normally separated by a period
      of time during which the two individuals were considered husband
      and wife and as such were under the obligations of faithfulness. The
      wedding began with a procession to the bride's house, which was fol-
      lowed by a return to the house of the groom for the marriage feast. By
      analogy, the church, espoused to Christ by faith, now awaits the
      parousia when the heavenly groom will come for his bride and return
      to heaven for the marriage feast which lasts throughout eternity."
      —Robert H. Mounce, The Book of Revelation (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
      W B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 1977), p. 340.

       Christ gave Himself totally and unselfishly for His people; we,
       as a people, are to give ourselves totally and unselfishly to the
       Lord. How does that model of giving one's self to another reveal
       essential principles of a strong Christian marriage?


                                                                            35

Further Study: Comments on marriage and related topics by Ellen
      G. White are found in a number of different compilations. Her book
      The Adventist Home contains much relevant material. See, for exam-
      ple, Section III: "Choosing a Life Partner," pp. 43-75, and Section V:
      "From the Marriage Altar," pp. 99-127.
        "Like every other one of God's good gifts entrusted to the keeping
      of humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin; but it is the purpose
      of the gospel to restore its purity and beauty. In both the Old and the
      New Testament the marriage relation is employed to represent the ten-
      der and sacred union that exists between Christ and his people, the
      redeemed ones whom he has purchased at the cost of Calvary. 'Fear
      not,' he says; 'thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his
      name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel."Turn, 0 backslid-
      ing children, saith the Lord; for I am married unto you.' "—Ellen G.
      White, Review and Herald, December 10,1908.
        "It should henceforth be the life study of both husband and wife
      how to avoid everything that creates contention and to keep unbroken
      the marriage vows."—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 85.

Discussion Questions:
    0 If sex is to be enjoyed only within the context of marriage, how
       do those who do not have a partner, or those who have lost their
       partner, experience their sexuality? Should they simply forget
       they are sexual beings? Can one be fully male or female without
       having any sexual relationship? What does Christ's example
       offer them?

          Look at the second Ellen White quote above. What practical
       things can both the husband and wife do in order to protect the
       sanctity of their marriage vows?

Summary: Many marriages fail. As Christians we can never go along
      with a situation in which unfaithfulness, in word or thought, is con-
      doned. At the same time, a forgiving spirit can save and restore many
      a relationship that would otherwise be doomed. The Lord deems mar-
      riage as something sacred; we, as humans, should do no less.

Flee Into His Arms:
Part 1 by C                HARLOTTE ISHKANIAN
   Maryam's eyes burned from crying. Her body ached from the beating
she had received. A failure, she thought. I can't even kill myself If life isn't
worth living, why is death so hard?
   Maryam was born into a Muslim family in a Middle Eastern country.
When Maryam was born her father shouted at her mother, "Why did you
have to have a girl? Can't you do anything right?"
   Maryam feared her father and hated the abuse that she and her mother
faced. She was not permitted to invite any of the neighborhood children to
her home, for they were "filthy infidel Christians." If she even talked to a
Christian child, her father would beat her. And when she cried, her mother
simply told her to pray, pray. Maryam prayed, but her prayers were never
answered. She became convinced that no one heard her prayers. Maryam
hated her life, hated what her father was doing to the family, but she saw
no way out.
   When Maryam's father made some bad business deals and was sent to
prison for five years, Maryam found work to help her mother support the
family.
   After several years Maryam's father convinced a friend to pay for his
release from prison. He returned home and announced that Maryam would
be married to the son of his friend. When Maryam learned that her father
had agreed to give her in exchange for his freedom, she was devastated.
Once more she realized that she was only an object to her father, never a
cherished child.
   Maryam did not know the man she would marry, but she knew that he
had a terrible temper. He was powerful and rich and had great influence in
the government. Maryam did not consider this a marriage. She felt like a
slave, sold to a man for her father's freedom.
   From the beginning Maryam's husband oppressed and abused her. He
 beat her for almost any reason. Maryam lived in fear. When she learned that
 she was pregnant, she was secretly pleased, for she thought at last she would
 have someone who would love her back. But her husband's constant beat-
 ings killed the child and left Maryam badly bruised. Heartbroken, she tried
 to commit suicide. But she failed. I can't even kill myself, she thought.
    Maryam desperately wanted out, but Islamic law forbade her to get a
 divorce. And her husband would never allow her to have a passport, so she
 could not run away. Her own family would not listen to her when she tried
 to tell them her troubles. She had to get out, but how?

          LESSON              5      *July 24-30



       Friendship



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: I Samuel 20, John 15:12-
       15, 2 Cor. 6:14-18, Phil. 2:3-8.

Memory Text: "A friend loves for all times, and a brother is
      born for adversity" (Proverbs 17:17, NIV).

                any people claim to have lots of friends, though, in reality, they

      M         have only superficial links with other people and then only to
                the degree they find these links personally useful. True friend-
      ship, in contrast, does not focus on usefulness but on a personal interest
      in selected fellow human beings with whom we talk, with whom we lis-
      ten, and with whom we share our time and emotions. After all, as we'll
      see this week, friendship is one of the concepts used to describe what our
      relationship with the Lord should be; thus, friendship must be based on
      something more than a superficial need to use someone for our own ends.
        "Our affection for one another springs from our common relation to
      God. We are one family, we love one another as He loved us. When
      compared with this true, sanctified, disciplined affection, the shallow
      courtesy of the world, the meaningless expression of effusive friend-
      ship, are as chaff to the wheat."—Ellen G. White, Mind, Character,
      and Personality, vol. 1, p. 211.

The Week at a Glance: How is friendship depicted in the
      Bible? How can friendship become a negative experience? How do
      friendships reflect our relationship with God? What is the basic
      principle behind true friendship? What must be experienced in
      our hearts in order to be a true friend?

     What Is a Friend?                    (1 Samuel 20).

        While it is true we cannot always choose all our relatives, we do
     have more leeway in choosing our friends. It seems inevitable that for
     beings who are, essentially, social creatures, we will be in contact
     with those whom we deem friends. Yet, not all friendships are alike.
     Centuries ago the Greek philosopher Aristotle categorized various
     kinds of friendships based on the motives that established the rela-
     tionship between the parties. Since that time, many writers have
     expounded on this very interesting and, at times, complex phenome-
     non of friendship.
        Think about someone whom you consider or had considered a
     friend. What particular qualities identify your relationship with that
     person? Read Proverbs 18:24. How does that text reflect the qualities
     that define your experience of friendship, if at all?




       It is interesting, too, that the word translated "friend" in the last part
     of this verse in Proverbs comes from the Hebrew word for "love." In
     other contexts, that word could have been translated "lover." The point
     seems to be that a friend is indeed someone with whom you have a
     close bond, different from a mere acquaintance or co-worker.

Read the story of the friendship between Jonathan and David as
     depicted in 1 Samuel 20. What characteristics emerge from this
     account that help us understand what a friendship is? How does
     this story relate to Proverbs 18:24? How do these characteristics
     compare with what you wrote above? Also, how do Jonathan's
     actions fit in with what Paul wrote in Ephesians 6:1?




        Notice from this story how the Lord formed the center of their
     friendship. Look especially at 1 Samuel 20:14, with the phrase "the
     kindness of the Lord." We now see, though, in this whole relationship,
     a reflection of the kindness and mercy of God, manifested in the rela-
     tionship between these two men.

      Looking at the story of David and Jonathan, ask yourself about
      someone whom you consider a friend. How could you better man-
      ifest the traits of friendship as revealed in the biblical account?

                                                                               39

     Bad Company                (2 Cor 6:14-18).

        The term friend, at least in English, does not have to be of neces-
     sity something positive. Who knows how many lives have been ruined
     because of the negative influence of a friend? For instance, many
     people who struggle with some sort of substance abuse, be it alcohol
     or drugs, often trace their introduction to the substance: not from a
     shadowy figure hiding in a dark alley but from their best friend. How
     ironic and, yet, how common, when best friends turn out to be bad
     friends.
        A young man, somewhat of an outcast in school and coming from
     a cold, uncaring family, found friends who made him part of their
     close-knit circle. He soon knew they would put their lives on the line
     for him, and he felt such a sense of belonging that he would have
     risked his life for them. Sounds like a great thing, right? Sounds like
     the beauty of friendship, as depicted in Proverbs 18:24, right? Well,
     not quite, because we're talking about a young man who joined a
     youth gang heavily involved in violence, theft, and drug abuse. Thus,
     like anything, friendship, even what we might call a "good friend,"
     can be a double-edged sword.

Read 2 Corinthians 6:14-18. Notice the contrasts depicted in the
     texts. What do they tell us? Though we often apply these verses to
     marriage, what principles could help us understand the kind of
     friendships the Lord desires us to have? How should these princi-
     ples guide our friendships? At the same time, in what ways can we
     take this admonition too far? How do we balance it, for instance,
     with Matthew 5:13, 14?




       "Paul is telling the Corinthians that they cannot have compromising
     relationships with unbelievers—not that they cannot have relation-
     ships whatsoever. Relationships that cut the connection with God are
     to be completely excluded."—W. Larry Richards, The Abundant Life
     Bible Amplifier-2 Corinthians (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press®
     Publishing Association, 1998), pp. 148-150.

      How can you tell if your friendship with a nonbeliever is hurt-
      ing you spiritually? If you believe it is, what should you do?

               TUESDAY July 27


     Let This Mind Be in You (Phil. 2:3-8).
       As human beings, we are by nature selfish and egotistical: Our first
     inclination is to look out for "number one." Though some struggle
     with this problem more than others, it is the default mode for a sinful,
     fallen race. For any relationship—including friendship between self-
     ish and egotistical people—to survive, these qualities need to be sub-
     sumed. In the end, only the sanctifying power of God working on the
     heart can bring about the kind of changes needed for a true friendship.
     No wonder, as we saw in Sunday's section, the Lord was in the center
     of the relationship between David and Jonathan. What friendship will
     succeed if it's based on people looking out only for themselves?

Read Philippians 2:3, 4. What essential principle is shown there, and
     why is it so crucial for forming a true friendship?




         In so many ways, the key to a good friendship is found in the same
      principles found in a good marriage: the willingness of each member
      to put the good of the other first. This is seen in the example we have
      of Jesus, giving Himself for the good of others. Think of the kind of
      friendships we would have were we to esteem others better than our-
      selves (and were they to do the same for us) or if we looked not upon
      just our own things but upon the things of others (and they were to do
      the same for us). This was, of course, the essence of what Christ did
      when here in the flesh.
         The sad reality is so many friendships are often based on selfish
      motives (What's in this for me?); and when someone realizes there's
      no benefit for them in the relationship, the friendship cools, if not
      ends. This is nothing extraordinary; it is simply human nature. Far
      from putting the needs of others before ourselves, oftentimes we find
      jealousy and envy ruining a friendship. In his Confessions, Jean
      Jacques Rousseau wrote about how, once he became famous, many of
      his friends turned against him. Again, this isn't anything extraordi-
      nary; it's human nature unsubdued by the power of Christ working in
      our lives.

       Read Philippians 2:5-8. Here is the key to bringing about the
       kinds of changes in us that can stimulate strong friendships.
       How are your friendships? Are they defined by the texts for
       today or by jealousy, expediency, and convenience? Dwell, pray,
       and meditate on these verses in Philippians.


                                                                          41
         WEDNESDAY July 28


     How Christ Made Friends                           (Luke 19:1-10).

        The gospel shows us how Christ made friends. He took time to talk
     to people and to listen to them. He took time to eat together with oth-
     ers and to celebrate special events with them.

Read the following passages and analyze what each tells us about
     Christ's skills in interhuman relations and, in particular, in mak-
     ing friends.

     John 4:4-26: Jesus speaks and listens to the Samaritan woman.




     Luke 19:1-10: Jesus stays with Zacchaeus.




     Luke 14:1-14: Jesus accepts hospitality from a prominent Pharisee.




       In all these situations, Jesus comes to people where they are and
     mingles among them as one of them. He doesn't act too good for the
     Samaritan woman or doesn't feel too low for the chief Pharisee. Jesus
     shows Himself ready to listen, to get involved, to show a genuine
     interest in others. If we will reach out to people, listen, show empathy,
     and give others the sense that they are valued and accepted, we will be
     able to establish meaningful relationships and even friendships with
     the most unlikely people.
       This is important if we are to reach others with the gospel. How are
     unchurched, secular people ever going to listen to a sermon? How can
     they ever be persuaded to read a book about Christ? Many will be
     intrigued enough to decide they want to know more only if they have
     seen Christianity in action and actually have met a credible Christian.

      Christ, however, didn't make friends just for the sake of making
      friends. He came in contact with the lost, and He became their
      friend in order to reach them with eternal life. What about us?
      What motivates our friendship with nonbelievers? At the same
      time, if it becomes apparent that they have no interest in our
      faith, do we then just shake the dust off our feet and walk away?
      What kind of friendship is that?

42
             THURSDAY July 29


     Not Servants but Friends                        (John 15:12-15).

        No matter how ideal our friendships, people are people, and we
     should never lean totally upon them (Ps. 118:8, 9; Jer 17:5), for
     sooner or later people will fail us, just as we fail others. That's why
     our Best Friend, the One whom we can trust implicitly, must be the
     Lord, whom we can know intimately through Jesus Christ (John
     14:9). However important human friendships are, however much we
     can learn to trust in the love and dedication of others, we build upon
     a flimsy foundation when we build our faith upon anything other than
     the Rock (Matt. 7:24, 25).

Read John 15:12-15. What did Jesus call His disciples? What does it
     mean to say we are "friends" with God, as opposed to servants?
     What's the difference? What kind of relationship does He seek
     with us? What can we learn from our friendship with God that
     can help us with other friendships? At the same time, what is
     unique about our friendship with God that we can have with no
     one else? (See, for instance, vs. 14.)




        In verse 13, Jesus reveals the essence of true love and true friend-
      ship, which again comes back seeking unselfishly the best for others
      over and above ourselves. This is the highest ideal, and Jesus here
      points to His own manifestation of that ideal as His words point to the
      Cross. It's only as we have the kind of assurance, peace, and security
      that comes from knowing God, from knowing He is our Friend, from
      knowing we are accepted by Him, that we can give of ourselves and
      become the kind of friend who truly is a friend, not only with the Lord
      but with others.

       Look at John 15:13. It presents an incredibly high ideal for
       friendship. How many friends do you have for whom you would
       be willing to die? Do you have to be willing to die for someone
       in order to be called his or her friend? If not, what do you
       think Jesus is telling us with those words? What principle is He
       teaching?




                                                                          43
                  FRIDAY July 30


Further Study: "Friendship may be the only form of human social
      relationship that is sustained primarily by kindness. . . . One con-
      tinues to function as a parent, spouse, worker, and neighbor, even
      though kindness may be lacking. . . . With friendship, it is entirely dif-
      ferent. Kindness is the glue that binds friends together. If I should
      humiliate a friend, be insensitive to the feelings of a friend, cause
      unnecessary harm or hurt to a friend, or in any way treat a friend as an
      object that I use for my own pleasure and gratification, the friendship
      dissolves."—Ray S. Anderson, Living the Spiritually Balanced Life
      (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House Co., 1998), pp. 78, 79.


DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
       CO Research indicates that new Seventh-day Adventists tend to
       lose most of their old friends within approximately seven years of
       joining the church. Their former circle of friends tends to be
       replaced by others whom they have met in their new spiritual
       home. Is that a good thing, or should new members strive to
       retain their non-Adventist friends of the past? If so, why, and
       under what circumstances?

       0 The Bible presents some high ideals for friendship, including
       even the giving up of one's life for a friend. How, though, do we
       balance that out with our other relationships and obligations,
       such as to our family or to the Lord? What happens when obli-
       gations to friends clash with obligations to family or to the Lord?

       0 Euripides wrote that real friendship is shown in times of trou-
       ble; prosperity is full of friends. How does this idea compare with
       what we have studied this week about friendship?

Summary: The Bible presents some high ideals for friendship, some-
    thing that does not come naturally to the human heart. Fortunately,
    through the example and power of Jesus, we can be the kind of friends
    the Lord would have us to be.

   Maryam was desperate to get out of her abusive marriage, but with no
money, no passport, no friends, she could see no way to escape. Then she
met Samaan. He was kind and seemed to care what happened to her. He
offered to help her escape, but she hesitated to trust him. One day her
husband found Maryam talking with Samaan and threatened to kill them
if he caught them together again. Maryam had no choice. It was better
to risk death by fleeing than to face a slow death at the hands of her
husband.
    She and Samaan fled their homeland and took refuge in Europe, where
Maryam hoped her husband would never find her. They applied for asy-
lum and waited for word of their fate. Maryam knew that if they were sent
back to their homeland, they both would be killed.
    Maryam suffered frequent nightmares and depression from her years of
abuse and her uncertain future. Samaan tried to comfort her and protect
her, but often nothing helped.
    One day Maryam and a friend were walking in a store when a young
man approached them and spoke in their native language. His simple mes-
sage stunned Maryam. "Jesus loves you," he smiled as he gave the women
a pamphlet. Maryam listened as her friend peppered the young man with
questions about God.
    "Can you come to my house and tell me more?" her friend asked the
young man. He agreed. Maryam decided to join her friend as they learned
more about God. For several weeks the two women and young man spent
hours together talking about God. And little by little Maryam began to
hope that maybe there is a God who cares after all.
    Maryam shared what she was learning with Samaan, and together the
two accepted Jesus into their lives. Samaan wanted to marry Maryam, but
she could not obtain a divorce without risking their lives. At last they
 found a way, and Maryam and Samaan were married.
    "I still have problems," Maryam says, "but now I know that Jesus loves
 me and will never leave me. Samaan loves me too. Samaan's love helps me
 understand God's love. At last I have found a sense of worth, of value in
 life.
    "I can never return to my homeland, never see my mother or brothers
 again. But God is showing me that I have a huge family around the world.
 And even better, I have hope of eternity. I may never have a home on this
 earth, so all I can hope for is a home in God's mansion forever."

      Religion in the
      Workplace


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Gen. 2:15; 3:17-19; Lev.
      19:35, 36; Eccles. 9:10; Matt. 18:21; Luke 15:11-32.

Memory Text: "The man of integrity walks securely, but he who
      takes crooked paths will be found out" (Proverbs 10:9, NIV).

          n the aftermath of a ferry disaster in 1987 near Belgium, the

      I   experts faced serious problems in identifying all the victims. They
          found that one of them had a double identity; he had lived for
      years under one name in England and under another name in France.
      Just imagine how difficult it must have been for this man to keep
      those two lives, with two families and two sets of friends, in two dif-
      ferent countries, totally separate.
        This kind of situation does not, of course, occur very often. But
      in many ways people can live double or even multiple lives. That
      goes for Christians too. We must make sure not to compartmental-
      ize our life into totally different spheres, in which we are quite dif-
      ferent persons in different places. We must be the same kind of per-
      son in the workplace as we are at home or in church, operating with
      the same set of Christian values. This week we'll take a look at some
      Bible principles on how we as Christians should behave in the work-
      place.

The Week at a Glance: What happened to work after the
      Fall? What are the obligations of a Christian employer and
      employee? How should Christians give or receive discipline and
      correction?

                 SUNDAY August 1


     Work Ethic             (Gen. 2:15, 3:17-19).

Read Genesis 2:15. What does it tell us about the existence of work
     in the pre-Fall world?


       According to the Bible, work existed even in Paradise, in a perfect
     environment. Obviously, work must have been something good, some-
     thing that was an integral part of God's original plan for the human
     race. After the Fall, the concept of work continued but, no doubt, in a
     radically different environment than before.

Read Genesis 3:17-19. What does it imply about work in the post-
      Fall world?




         Cursed, sorrow, sweat, thorns, thistles—these are some of the
      words used to describe the fate that awaited humanity because of sin,
      words used even in the context of the work human beings would need
      to do in a fallen world.

Read carefully Genesis 3:17. What does it mean that God "cursed ...
      the ground" for the sake of Adam?




         "The thorn and the thistle—the difficulties and trials that make his
      life one of toil and care—were appointed for his good as a part of the
      training needful in God's plan for his uplifting from the ruin and
      degradation that sin has wrought."—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ,
      p. 9. In other words, the Lord made life more difficult for the race, not
      as punishment but as a means to help mitigate against the ravages of
      sin. This principle can be seen often, even today: Those who engage
      in honest labor usually get into less trouble than those who are idle,
      with nothing to do. There's something about the discipline and routine
      of work that, under the right circumstances, can help build character,
      a crucial task for beings steeped in sin.

       In what ways, in your own experience, have you seen the ben-
       efits and blessings that come from work?


                                                                            47
                  M 0 IN DAY August 2


      "Whatsoever Thy Hand Findeth ."
      (Eccles. 9:10).

        Whether in the poignant paintings of Vincent Van Gogh, who tried to
      capture the hardship of coal miners toiling at their task, or in some of the
      beautiful prose of Leo Tolstoy, who all but romanticized the toil of peas-
      ants in the field, human beings have sought to capture, in one way or
      another, the inescapable fact of work. With rare exceptions, most people
      have worked in one capacity or another. Many people, in fact, spend a
      great deal of their time working. The big question for Christians, then, is
      What kind of relationships should we have in the workplace?

Read Ecclesiastes 9:10. What is this text telling us that could give us
      a principle for the Christian on the job?




         One thing most of us have learned, or at least should have learned, is
      that if we profess to be Christians, people will watch us. As Christians,
      we make some pretty bold claims, claims about having a new life in
      Christ, about having a peace that passes all understanding, about striving
      for a higher moral ideal. We are witnesses, in one way or another (Isa.
      43:10, 1 Cor 4:9, 2 Cor 3:2). Thus, think for a moment: Which would
      give a better witness to your faith: if you were a hard, diligent, honest
      worker who did not only what was expected of you but perhaps even
      more, or if you were a slacker—cutting corners, trying to get away with
      as much as you could? The answer, of course, is obvious. Sure, there are
      all sorts of circumstances that can, at times, make it difficult for us to be
      good witnesses at work, but, as a rule, a Christian should be a reliable,
      honest worker doing what he or she is paid for, knowing the true reward
      is not here but in a new heaven and a new earth. In this context, Ellen
      White wrote of Christ's early years: "He was not willing to be defective,
      even in the handling of tools. He was perfect as a workman, as He was
      perfect in character. By His own example He taught that it is our duty to
      be industrious, that our work should be performed with exactness and
      thoroughness, and that such labor is honorable. . . . All should find some-
      thing to do that will be beneficial to themselves and helpful to others.
      God appointed work as a blessing, and only the diligent worker finds the
      true glory and joy of life."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 72.

       The text in Ecclesiastes and the excerpt from Ellen White pres-
       ent an ideal attitude about work. How does your attitude com-
       pare? If you're honest with yourself, what changes do you need
       to make?

               TUESDAY August 3


     Christian Values in the Workplace:
     Part 1
        Buying a secondhand car is often considered a rather hazardous
     adventure. The car may be beautifully cleaned and polished, but what
     dark secrets are hidden under the hood? Can you trust the odometer?
     It is said that one should never buy a car from, or sell a car to, a
     friend, since this may well put the friendship in jeopardy. This should
     not apply to Christians. Our business deals must be above reproach,
     whether we privately sell our car or whether we trade professionally.
     Indeed, whatever work or business we are in and whatever level at
     which we work, we should be honest, honorable, and fair, because
     that is what our God tells us to be.

Look up the following texts. What is each one saying, and what are
     their messages for Christians in the workplace? Lev. 19:35, 36;
     Prov. 10:17; Jer. 22:13; Mal. 3:5.




        Whether employer or employee, as a Christian we need to be hon-
      est and fair with either our employer or employees. The only thing
      worse than employees who abuse their work situation by being dis-
      honest are employers who are dishonest with those under their super-
      vision.

Read again Leviticus 19:35, 36. What motivation is given for honesty
      in business dealing?




        Because we are Christians, our concepts of right and wrong, good
      and evil, aren't based merely on the fluctuating whims of culture and
      time, which change from culture to culture and from time to time;
      rather, they are based on the eternal God, who never changes (James
      1:17). Thus, we should do what is right and honest, because those
      things that are right and honest are rooted in God, our Creator and
      Redeemer. We shouldn't manifest honesty, integrity, and fairness
      only when they suit us, when they work to our advantage; rather, they
      should be foundational principles that underlie all we do as
      Christians, whether at home or in the workplace.


                                                                          49
         WEDNESDAY August 4


     Christian Values in the Workplace:
     Part 2
Read Proverbs 16:32, 10:1, and 12:1 carefully and prayerfully. What
     do these texts teach us regarding the importance of discipline and
     correction?




        Whether it is the army or a school or a factory or whether we talk
     about the home or the church, discipline is essential. The issue of disci-
     pline is a coin with two sides. Most of us will, at least from time to time,
     have to discipline others: children, co-workers, or church members. We
     must learn how to do this with consistency, tact, justice, and compas-
     sion. But we must also be receptive to discipline and learn how to
     accept counsel, direction, and, if necessary, correction all in a mature
     and constructive manner. As Christians in the workplace, we must learn
     not only to give discipline and correction but to receive it, as well.

We have all through the Bible, particularly in the Gospels, exam-
     ples of Jesus either forgiving offenders (John 8:4-11) or teaching
     us the principles of forgiveness (Matt. 18:21, 22; Luke 15:11-32).
     How helpful are these texts for a Christian employer or super-
     visor who is dealing with a troublesome employee? Do these texts,
     though, imply that no discipline or correction should be adminis-
     tered, or are they, instead, teaching a principle that could, in the
     right context, be applied in the workplace?




       At the same time, a Christian employee could believe he or she has
     been treated unfairly by his or her boss. Jesus, however, expressed
     some powerful words regarding the attitude of those who are treated
     unfairly (Matt. 5:38-42).

      Look at Matthew 5:38-42. In what ways is this passage helpful for
      understanding how an employee should react to unfairness? Do
      these verses mean an employee should, therefore, accept abuse
      unconditionally, or do they teach something else? Explain your
      answer.

             THURSDAY August 5


     Seeing Potential in Others (Acts 15:36-41,
     2 Tim. 4:11).

        Unfortunately, we do not always look for the best in others. We
     often tend to see the things others cannot do rather than the things
     they could do if properly trained and challenged to do so! In our rela-
     tionships with co-workers, we need to build on one another's
     strengths rather than to focus primarily on one another's weaknesses.

What kind of people did Christ choose as His disciples? What does
     that teach us? Matt. 4:18-22, 9:9, Luke 5:1-11.


       It has often been remarked that very few of us would have chosen
     these kind of men as our closest co-workers. But Christ saw the
     potential in some uneducated fishermen, as well as in an unpopular
     tax collector, and He challenged them to follow Him and work with
     Him. They received three years of intensive training and then went out
     into the world. Jesus discovered them and recognized a potential in
     these men that few of us would have detected.

Paul had a sharp disagreement with Barnabas about John Mark's
      suitability for a leading role in the work of the church. Barnabas
      believed there was potential in John Mark, while Paul pointed to
      John Mark's weakness in the past. See Acts 15:36-41, 2 Tim. 4:11.
      What lessons are here for us (in the context of today's study)?


         When we hear a sermon on these passages, there usually is sharp
      criticism for Paul and praise for Barnabas. However, we owe it to Paul
      to put ourselves for a moment in his shoes. John Mark deserted and
      left Paul and Barnabas when they reached Pamphylia on their first
      missionary journey, even before the task was completed. It stands to
      reason that Paul did not want to run the risk that this would happen
      again.
         In our day and age, we tend to argue as Paul did. If we have a
      choice, we do not continue with someone who has let us down at a
      crucial moment. Yet, on the other hand, how many of us know people
      who never again faltered when given a second chance to prove them-
      selves? Maybe we ourselves have been such a person.

       Dwelling on the lesson for today, ask yourself, Have I too
       quickly written off someone who has failed me in the past,
       either in the workplace or in any other situation?


                                                                          51
                 FRIDAY August 6

Further Study: "If you have taken advantage in your business
     dealings, which the Lord calls injustice, this must be adjusted before
     you can be honest and righteous in the sight of God. These things
     need to be corrected by our people everywhere. . . . When you take
     up this work of readjustment and getting right with God, angels of
     heaven will cooperate with you, giving you discernment to see where
     you have viewed matters in a wrong light....
       "The Lord can not bless the men who corrupt themselves by unjust
     business dealings, either with their brethren or with worldlings. And
     those who do such things lose their spirituality; they grow cold and
     formal and selfish. They gloss over their past mistakes by theories of
     their own invention that are opposed to the principles of the Word of
     God."—Ellen G. White, This Day With God, p. 343.

Discussion Questions:
      O Putting aside the obvious things that involve outright crime
      or vice, are there certain respectable jobs that Christians, in
      good conscience, cannot do? If so, what are they, and why should
      a Christian in good conscience not do these kinds of work?

      • Suppose your boss asked you to work on Sabbath; you said
      you couldn't but knew someone else in the office who would take
      your place. Suppose, however, your boss asked you to steal or lie,
      and you said you couldn't but knew someone else in the office
      who would take your place. What, if any, is the difference
      between the two situations?

Summary: As Christians, we bring our religion with us as we enter
     the workplace. Though there are usually limits to the amount of open
     discussion about religious subjects that can take place, we must still
     operate only with Christian values. Working together with others in a
     positive spirit is high on our agenda. Absolute honesty and
     integrity—as well as love, compassion, and justice—will characterize
     our conduct. And while we seek to display these values ourselves, we
     will also try to bring out the best in others and do what we can to
     make them realize their full potential.

Turning Opposition
Into Blessing by J. H.                               ZACHARY

   The Volga Conference in Russia is a challenging field in which to work.
A lingering communist influence, a strong national church, and several
Muslim communities in the area make this a difficult area to penetrate
with the gospel. In 1999 the director of Global Mission for the conference
and two volunteers went to a town of 45,000 citizens and began scattering
seeds of faith. This town has three large national churches. The Adventists
had not been in the region long when the priests of these three churches
set out to work to oppose them.
   When the Adventists began holding evangelistic meetings in the
town, the police arrested them and took them to headquarters for ques-
tioning. But when they checked the Adventists' papers and found every-
thing in order, they had to release the trio. Later the Adventists learned
that one of the priests with close ties to the police had requested their
arrest.
   The next day while the Adventists were shopping, a gang of rough-
looking young men threatened them, "Leave our city within 24 hours, or
you will die!"
   "We are not afraid of you:' the pastor told the gang members. "We are
not breaking any laws. We will stay and hold our meetings."
   Soon posters appeared throughout the city warning the residents of the
"great danger" from the "Seventh-day Adventist sect" that had invaded
their town. "Be careful. Do not attend their meetings. Do not associate
with them," the posters warned.
   When one woman saw the poster, tears filled her eyes. "Thank God my
prayers have been answered," she exclaimed.
   The woman, an Adventist, and her husband had moved to this city a
year before. She had been praying that God would send some Adventists
 to her.
    She urged her husband to attend the meetings with her. At the close of
 the meetings, 27 persons took their stand for Christ, and a company was
 organized.
    The next year another evangelistic series was planned. The police
 chief gave them permission to hold their meetings and told them to fear
 no disturbances.
    From one community to another in this difficult area, God is spreading
 the message in unentered areas in spite of strong opposition.

      Respect for
      Authorities


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Matt. 5:13-16, 22:15-21,
      Acts 5:29, Rom. 13:1-5, 1 Pet. 2:13-15.

Memory Text: "Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the
      authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also
      because of conscience" (Romans 13:5, NIV).

              ne of the greatest questions facing the church is the issue of

      O       political involvement. How do people in the world but "not of
              the world" (John 17:14) relate to the political challenges pre-
      sented by the world? History is replete with examples of churches that
      have kept silent during times of great moral and political crises; his-
      tory, however, also bears a sad witness to what happens when
      churches take upon themselves political prerogatives that place them
      decidedly upon the side of evil.
        This week we look at the complex and often difficult question of
      how Christians are to relate to the political issues of the day. Because
      Christians exist in all sorts of political environments, we can look
      only at broad principles; in fact, the Bible gives us only broad princi-
      ples. Perhaps that's because the Lord, knowing the various and often
      delicate situations His people would be facing through the centuries,
      revealed principles broad enough to be used in any environment.

The Week at a Glance: What kind of influence should
      Christians have in society? How should Christians relate to the
      political process? Should Christians be in government? What
      principles should we follow in seeking to balance our obligations
      as citizens with our obligations to the Lord?

                 SUNDAY August 8


      Sanctified Caution                  (Matt. 5:13-16).

         Many Christians believe we should give up on the world. The world
      is so evil, so confused, and so estranged from God's original purpose
      that there is no hope of turning the situation around. Plus, the more
      we are involved with the world, the greater the chances we will
      become even more contaminated by it. Withdrawal is the only option
      for those who want to remain faithful to the Lord. This argument may
      sound plausible, but is it biblical?

What role does God expect a Christian to play in society? Matt. 5:13-16.

         Christians must do all they can to make a difference in society.
      They are called to give a more pleasant taste to the world around them
      and to provide spiritual light. As someone once said: "It is better to
      light one candle than to curse the darkness!"
         In early Adventism, the question was often asked whether it would
      be right for an Adventist Christian to go to the ballot box. Today, most
      Seventh-day Adventists do recognize that it is their privilege to cast
      their vote in democratic elections and referendums in an attempt to
      help promote an agenda that is closest to upholding kingdom values.
      How we do this, of course, isn't always easy; much depends not only
      upon our political and social environment, which can vary greatly
      from country to country, but also on what individual members believe
      regarding which agenda best upholds kingdom values. Because these
      questions can be so fraught with many potential hazards, as believers
      we should always proceed with sanctified caution when it comes to
      dealing with social and political issues.

How do you balance the verses quoted above in Matthew with texts
      such as 2 Corinthians 6:17 or James 4:4?




       The issue for most Christians isn't that we should seek to bet-
       ter whatever society we find ourselves in, but rather, How do we
       best do that in a way that doesn't compromise our witness or
       our obligations to the Lord? As with so many things, we need to
       strike a correct balance, which is not always easy. At such times,
       when these questions can have a very powerful impact for good
       or evil upon the church or upon society as a whole, members,
       more than ever, need to seek the guidance of the Lord and the
       counsel of others in how to best proceed.

                                                                           57

     Christians in Government?
       Imagine your nation is overrun by a foreign power that occupies
     your land, defeats your army, kills thousands of civilians, levels
     numerous cities, and takes many prisoners. Imagine, next, that one of
     those prisoners not only becomes a favorite of the very ruler who
     destroyed your nation but actually serves that ruler faithfully for
     many years. Most people would deem this person a traitor, would
     they not?

Who is the Bible character described above?



       The answer, of course, is Daniel (see Daniel 1; 2:48, 49), whose
     story (among those of others) raises all sorts of interesting questions
     regarding the role of faithful people who are in positions of political
     power and authority.

What other biblical hero became a powerful           political figure? Gen.
     41:41-44.


        Though, no doubt, the world of politics offers many potential pitfalls
     for any Christian, there have been those who have faithfully served in
     government positions. Indeed, even in our own church, Seventh-day
     Adventists have been involved in government. For a number of years a
     Seventh-day Adventist Christian served as the prime minister of
     Uganda. In Papua New Guinea, Seventh-day Adventists form a sizable
     percentage of the population, and, thus, it should not surprise us that
     there are many church members in high government positions. The
     same is true for several of the small island states in the Pacific. And
     even in countries where Adventists are less numerous when compared
     to the size of the population, we now find Seventh-day Adventists as
     members of Parliament or in other high positions.

      Think about this: We believe God's law is a transcript of His
      character; that is, the law He has given us reflects the kind of
      God He is. With this idea in mind, why would we be better off
      living in a nation where Christians are involved in the political
      process, the very process that originates the laws of the country?
      At the same time, what potential dangers arise from those who
      seek to use government power to promote a religious agenda?

     Obedience, Yes . . . But                  (Acts 5:29, Rom. 13:1-5).

Read Romans 13:1-5 and 1 Peter 2:13-15. What attitude toward
     political leaders do they admonish Christians to have?




Read Acts 5:29 and Romans 13:7. How do these verses help us better
     understand the texts quoted in the previous question?




        There's no question that Christians, in whatever land they are in,
     should be good citizens, obeying the laws of their country. At the
     same time, as followers of the Lord, they answer to a higher Power,
     One greater than the government, to whom they are to give all due
     honor and respect, tribute, and custom (see Rom. 13:6, 7). At the same
     time, we must not forget that Paul and Peter died at the hands of the
     very authorities they were telling their people to obey. Obviously,
     then, respect for authority and obedience to the government have their
     limits.
        Indeed, one powerful example comes from the history of the United
     States. In the nineteenth century, when the issue of slavery was divid-
     ing the Christians in the United States, Ellen G. White made it no
     secret as to where she stood.
        "When the laws of men conflict with the word and law of God, we
     are to obey the latter, whatever the consequences may be. The law of
     our land requiring us to deliver a slave to his master, we are not to
     obey; and we must abide the consequences of violating this law. The
     slave is not the property of any man. God is his rightful master, and
      man has no right to take God's workmanship into his hands, and claim
      him as his own."—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1,
      pp. 201, 202.

       Throughout the years, there have been many examples of civil
       disobedience, of people purposely violating the law of their land
       in order to bring about political change. What potential dangers
       await Christians who get involved in such action? At the same
       time, what situations might exist where their Christian duty
       demands they get involved?



                                                                         59

      Paying Taxes (Matt. 22:15-21).
         Few people, if any, like to pay high taxes. But in any modern soci-
      ety, the state must have large amounts of money to pay for the things
      a government is expected to provide: education, basic health care,
      roads, tunnels, bridges, police, armed forces, and so on. We may ques-
      tion whether the taxes should be as high as they often are, but we can-
      not question the legitimacy of being taxed.

What did both Jesus and Paul say about the legitimacy of taxation by
      the authorities? Matt. 22:15-21; Rom. 13:6, 7.


         The tax referred to in Matthew 22 was "payable into the imperial
      exchequer, imposed on every inhabitant of the country from the time
      of puberty until the age of sixty-five. It was resented by the Jews as a
      repeated reminder of the fact that they were subject to foreign power
      in their own land.
        "The attitude to the payment of taxes remained a moot issue in the
      early church. Paul finds it still necessary, nearly thirty years later than
      this, to lay down the rule for Christians. The authority of the state is
      divinely ordained, and the payment of taxes is to be made 'for the sake
      of conscience.' "—Francis Wright Beare, The Gospel According to
      Matthew (Oxford, Eng.: Basil Blackwell, 1981), p. 439.

What other principle comes into play when we deal with our taxes?
      Luke 16:10-12, 2 Cor 13:7.




       We must show honesty and integrity in all our financial dealings.
     This principle also extends to what we can receive from or must pay
     to the government. It is dishonest to claim a benefit to which we are
     not entitled, and it is just as wrong to withhold from Caesar what is
     his due.
       Of course, we may use all legitimate means to lower our taxes. But
     making false claims and defrauding the government are as much a
     dishonesty as stealing from our employer or from our neighbor. A
     Christian cannot be expected to smile when his or her taxes are higher
     than expected, but he or she can be expected to be honest.

       Suppose you have cheated on your taxes in the past. What can
       you do to make restitution?

     Promoting Christian Values
       The Seventh-day Adventist Church always has been strongly
     opposed to any interference by the state in the affairs of churches and
     other religious communities and, vice versa, the meddling by organ-
     ized religion in matters of government. Individual members may
     choose to serve their country in a high office, but the Adventist Church
     believes that, as a corporate body, it should stay away from politics.
       This does not mean, however, that the church has no interest in the
     values that are promoted in society and that it should not make its
     voice heard on moral issues that affect society. It would be wrong to
     impose some of our values on others, but it would be equally wrong
     not to present a strong witness with regard to the values we believe
     would make the world a better place in which to live. It is not always
     an easy balance to find.

What examples can we find in the Bible of faithful followers of the
     Lord who sought to bring about a change in government policy?
      Exod. 5:1-3


      Esther 7:1-7


      Dan. 2:24-27

         Besides these examples, the Bible, particularly the Old Testament,
      is filled with examples of the prophets attempting to influence gov-
      ernment policy; that is, to try to get the rulers to turn away from apos-
      tasy and to follow the Lord. Of course, the times back then were
      radically different from any we face today. Nevertheless, there's noth-
      ing wrong with Christians seeking to use their influence toward help-
      ing bring about positive moral and social changes. The difficult ques-
      tions arise, however, concerning just what changes a church should
      seek to bring about and how a church should implement these
      changes. Not everything that's sinful should be made illegal, a dis-
      tinction Christians in all ages have not always understood. Where to
      draw the line has been and still is a difficult question for the church
      to answer. Thus, as mentioned earlier, this is a topic in which sancti-
      fied caution must be used.

       What have been your own attitudes toward church involvement
       in politics? Do you tend to be an aggressive advocate of involve-
       ment, or do you think the church should shy away from these
       issues? What reasons do you have for the position you take?

                                                                            61
                   FRIDAY August 13


Further Study: "Christ's reply was no evasion, but a candid
      answer to the question. Holding in His hand the Roman coin, upon
      which were stamped the name and image of Caesar, He declared that
      since they were living under the protection of the Roman power, they
      should render to that power the support it claimed, so long as this did
      not conflict with a higher duty. But while peaceably subject to the
      laws of the land, they should at all times give their first allegiance to
      God."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 602.

Discussion Questions:
       0 Ellen White was very active in the temperance movement in
       the United States. In fact, she was so strongly in favor of banning
       alcohol (prohibition) that she encouraged people to vote for pro-
       hibition—even if the vote was held on Sabbath. " 'Shall we vote
       for prohibition?' she asked. 'Yes, to a man, everywhere,' she
       replied, 'and perhaps I shall shock some of you if I say, If neces-
       sary, vote on the Sabbath day for prohibition if you cannot at any
       other time.' "—A. L. White, Ellen G. White: The Lonely Years
       (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald Pub. Assn., 1984), vol. 1,
       p. 160. Discuss the implications of her stance in the context of
       this week's lesson.

          Is it legitimate, or even a duty, for the church to speak out on
       some moral issues, even if this may draw the church into a polit-
       ical debate?

          Though living at a time of great political corruption, Jesus
       said very little about the political issues of His day. What lessons
       can we draw from His example? What lessons should we not
       draw from that example?

Summary: Christians are citizens of the heavenly kingdom first, but
     they are most definitely also citizens of their own country and are to
     accept their part of the responsibility all citizens should share. The
     principle of rendering to Caesar what is his and to God what is God's
     gives us a broad outline from which Christians are to work in what-
     ever land they reside.

Two-Banana War
by BONNIE NORTON and TREVOR ROBINSON
   Too often it takes very little to start a war, and in the highlands of Papua
New Guinea, it took only two bananas. When two Adventist pilots flew
into an isolated village in the highlands of PNG, they discovered almost
the entire village burned to the ground. Slowly they pieced together the
story.
   About two weeks earlier two friends from the village had gone to Port
Moresby, the major city on the southern coast. One man had two bananas,
but the other man had brought nothing to eat. In the morning Friend A
awoke to discover one of his bananas was missing. Friend B denied hav-
ing taken the banana, but Friend A was not convinced. In his mind he
vowed that he would get revenge for the stolen banana.
   The night that the two men returned to their village, Friend A sneaked
out and set Friend B's hut on fire. The grass-mat sides and grass roof
erupted into a ball of flame and burned to the ground in minutes.
Thankfully, no one was killed. But Friend B knew who had done this and
he vowed revenge.
   The next night Friend B set Friend A's hut afire. Friend A called his clan
members together, and that night they set fire to all the huts that belonged
to Friend B's clan. In turn, Friend B and his clan set fire to clan A's huts.
The remaining villagers could not stand to watch the excitement, so they
took sides. Friend A's supporters set fire to Friend B's supporters' huts, and
 Friend B's supporters set fire to Friend A's supporters' huts. Soon nothing
was standing except the little Adventist church.
   Even the church seemed doomed when a man ran toward it with a burn-
 ing torch in his hand. Then suddenly the man tripped and fell. He landed
 on a sharp stick poking out of the ground. The raging villagers stopped in
 their tracks. "God is watching out for His church!" they cried. "Which one
 of us would dare set fire to God's church?"
   And so, if you fly into that village today, you will see our lone little
 Adventist church standing amidst a burned-out village. It stands as a
 reminder that amidst human frailties and passions, God stands waiting to
 change hearts and lives into the likeness of His Son.




BONNIE NORTON lives in Goroka, Papua New Guinea, with her husband, Adventist Aviation
Services pilot Bill Norton. TREVOR ROBINSON works as a nurse at Sydney Adventist Hospital
and is a missionary pilot in his free time.

         LESSON             8       *August 14-20


      Christ's Other
       Sheep



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 10:16; John 13:34,
      35; 1 Corinthians 13; 2 Pet. 1:12; Rev. 14:1-12.

Memory Text: "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep
      pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and
      there shall be one flock and one shepherd" (John 10:16, NIV).

              owever committed we should be to our message, we mustn't

      H       read more into it than is there, such as the belief that we alone
              as Seventh-day Adventists are saved. That view has not, nor
      has ever been, the official position of the Seventh-day Adventist
      Church: "We recognize those agencies that lift up Christ before men
      as a part of the divine plan for evangelization of the world, and we
      hold in high esteem Christian men and women in other communions
      who are engaged in winning souls to Christ."—General Conference
      Working Policy (1999-2000), p. 494, Policy 0 100, art. 1. The ques-
      tion for us this week is How should we relate to these other
      Christians, those who, for all we know, have been redeemed by the
      blood of Christ?

The Week at a Glance: If you don't have to be an
      Adventist to be saved, why should we seek to reach other
      Christians with our beliefs? What advantages does our faith give
      us over those who might be Christians but in another denomina-
      tion? How should we relate to other Christians?

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, August 21.

      Other Sheep
Read John 10:16. What point was Jesus making here? (Keep in mind
     to whom He was speaking.) What principle can we, today, pull from
     His words, especially in the basic context of this week's lesson?




         For any of us to proclaim dogmatically who is or is not saved is to
      play God. It is to take prerogatives that belong only to Him. The Lord
      alone knows the heart; the Lord alone can judge motives; the Lord
      alone knows those who are His. As Seventh-day Adventists, we are
      called to preach our message to the world; we are not called to pass
      judgment upon who is or is not saved.
         "God has children, many of them, in the Protestant churches, and a
      large number in the Catholic churches, who are more true to obey the
      light and to do [to] the very best of their knowledge than a large num-
      ber among Sabbathkeeping Adventists who do not walk in the
      light."—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 3, p. 386.

 What are the following texts saying that help reinforce the point the
     Lord made in John 10:16?

      Mark 9:38-40


      Acts 10:35


      2 Tim. 2:19

        The fact is that, all over the world, the Lord has His faithful people,
      those who are living in accordance with all the light they have. Our
      job, in a sense, is to give them more light, to lead them into light that
      points more directly to Jesus Christ and the events surrounding His
      return. All people, no matter of what faith, need to hear what we have
      to say. How people respond is, basically, between them and God. All
      we can do is preach, teach, and reveal to people in our lives the love
      and grace of God.

       If you don't have to be an Adventist to be saved, then what's the
       purpose of trying to evangelize? Keep in mind Revelation 14:12
       as you answer.

                                                                            65

      Present Truth
        How did you answer the last question in Sunday's study? If you
     don't have to be an Adventist to be saved, then why should we bother
     even trying to witness to Christians of other denominations? After all,
     salvation comes only from Jesus Christ and what He did for human-
     ity at the Cross; it doesn't come from joining any particular religious
     community, including our own. Thus, why bother witnessing to
     Christians in churches other than our own?

Read 2 Peter 1:12. What insights does that, though expressed in a
     context different from ours today, give us regarding our Seventh-
     day Adventist message and the need for us to spread it around the
     world?




       The fact remains that no one else is preaching what we as Seventh-
     day Adventists are preaching. And this point becomes important,
     especially in the context of the last days, when the whole world is to
     be divided into those who fit the description in Revelation 14:12 and
     those who don't.

Read Revelation 14:1-12. What's at stake here?



        As Seventh-day Adventists, we have been called to preach to every-
     one the three angels' messages of Revelation 14. Christ's other sheep
     need to know the things we know; they need to understand how the
     deep issues in the great controversy between Christ and Satan are going
     to be manifested at the close of time. We have been called to point these
     people not only to the texts that make prominent the "faith of Jesus" but
     to the "commandments of God," with the special emphasis on the
     fourth commandment. Again, because we don't know the hearts of any-
     one, we must tell everyone—"faithful Christians" in other denomina-
     tions—the present-truth message as found in Revelation 14. They need
     to know what we know, especially as we near the closing crisis.

      Read Revelation 18:4. Whom is the Lord calling out of Babylon,
      and why? How does this text help us better understand how we
      are to relate to faithful Christians of other denominations?

          TUESDAY August 17


The Adventist Difference: Part 1
  However important the issues surrounding the mark of the beast (as
depicted in Revelation 14), our message isn't just limited to warnings
about end-time persecution. There's so much we have been given that
can be a blessing in a very practical and personal way now. That's why
we must share it, even with Christians of other denominations.

  Below are some texts that are tied in with our message. Write
down some of the benefits we have, here and now, from under-
standing these important truths:

Exod. 20:8-11


Eccles. 9:10


Mal. 3:8-10


Rom. 8:34; Heb. 8:1, 2


1 Cor 6:19

  Though, of course, some of these truths are understood, to some
degree, by various Christians, we alone have them tied nicely into a
complete package. And, indeed, these special Adventist truths don't
depict mere marginal differences with other Christians. They repre-
sent important biblical concepts, and people who do not know about
them miss out on something that can make a major difference in their
Christian experience. The Adventist message helps us to know where
we are in human history. It unveils the great-controversy perspective,
which shows us the larger picture of what God is doing for our rebel-
lious planet. It tells us about the ongoing heavenly ministry of Jesus
Christ and the hope He presents for us as erring sinners.
   The Adventist message also helps us to follow through on our com-
mitment to Christ in very concrete ways: in finding physical and spir-
itual rest on God's holy day, in living a life of faithful stewardship of
all that has been entrusted to us, and in learning how to take care of
our bodies while we're still in this mortal clay.

 If asked by a Christian of another denomination how the
 Adventist faith is different from what most other evangelical
 Christians believe, what would you say?

                                                                     67
         WEDNESDAY August 18


     The Adventist Difference: Part 2
        Just because someone is a Christian doesn't mean there's no more
     truth for him or her to learn. On the contrary. Many of Paul's letters were
     written to Christians, often on the assumption that these people already
     knew the Lord and were already in the faith. Indeed, most of the New
     Testament was written to those already in the faith. Nevertheless, that
     didn't stop Paul (and the others) from giving the churches more light.

Read Romans 1:1-7, Galatians 1:1-5, Ephesians 1:1-4, 1 Thessalo-
     nians 4:13-18. How do these texts help affirm the above paragraph?




        As we relate to other Christians, we must remember: The issue isn't
     that we judge who's saved and who isn't (remember the Ellen White
     quote in Sunday's section); rather, the issue is, Do we have something
     to say, not just to the world at large but to other Christians? The
     answer, of course, is that we most definitely do.
        For instance, millions of Christians believe the dead go right to
     heaven or right to hell immediately at death. Others believe in purga-
     tory, where the dead are purged from worldliness before entering into
     heaven. Most of these people have no protection, therefore, against
     spiritualism of any kind, and who knows how many fear that right now
     some loved ones are suffering the flames of eternal torment?
       Others believe final events will unfold with a massive Mideast war,
     in which some future antichrist power will make a pact with the Jews
     in Israel, an event that will begin a seven-year tribulation period,
     before which all true Christians are taken to heaven. Most who believe
     this way have no concept as to how final events regarding Rome,
     America, and the issue of the Sabbath will unfold.
       All over the world, many Christians have no knowledge of health
     principles; thus, they eat, drink, and live like so much of the non-
     Christian world.
       Millions of others believe salvation can be found in Jesus only
     through the mediation of their church body and that they must perform
     various works in order for the merits of Christ to be applied to them.
       Most of the Christian world totally ignore not just the seventh-day
     Sabbath but the whole concept of a serious rest day. Not only do they
     miss out on the spiritual blessings of the Sabbath but they also miss
     out on the physical renewal that Sabbath keeping offers.

      What other things do we as Seventh-day Adventists teach that
      could be a blessing, even now, to other Christians?

     Love One Another
       "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one
     another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this
     shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
     another" (John 13:34, 35).

Read the above quote, the words of Jesus. How are all to know who
     are Christ's disciples? How well have His disciples followed that
     command?




        There's no question: Christians are to show their love to one
     another. Sadly, that has hardly been the case. History is filled with
     examples not just of hatred between different churches but of vio-
     lence, as well.
        Whatever the immediate context of Christ's words, we can hardly
     believe they meant we were to love only those of our own denomina-
     tion, whatever that denomination or church body happens to be. Love
     should know no denominational boundaries and certainly not be limited
     only to those who know the truth. Indeed, there's no more powerful wit-
     ness for truth than the love compelled and generated by that truth.
        Of course, loving someone isn't the same as agreeing to his or her
     beliefs; rather, it's acknowledging the value of this person in the sight
     of God and the commonality we have as followers of Jesus, however
     different our expressions might at the present time be.
        As Seventh-day Adventists, with the understanding we have been
     given of God's love for us, particularly as revealed in the context of
     present truth, we should be the most loving of all Christians. And
     that's because to whom much has been given much is expected, and
     because we have been given much, we should give much, not just to
     the world at large but to our brothers and sisters in other churches, as
     well. And nothing we can give means anything without love.

       Examine your own relationship with Christians in other
       churches. Do you look down on them? Do you see anything in
       them that you could learn from them? Do you feel a need to tell
       them what we know? Based on what we've studied this week, what
       changes, if any, in your attitude toward them should you make?

                                                                           69

Further Study: Ellen G. White has a lot to say about our atti-
     tude to other Christians. See, for instance, Evangelism, section 17,
     "Laboring for Special Classes," pp. 552-586.

       "Our ministers should seek to come near to the ministers of other
     denominations. Pray for and with these men, for whom Christ is inter-
     ceding. A solemn responsibility is theirs. As Christ's messengers, we
     should manifest a deep, earnest interest in these shepherds of the
     flock." —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 78.
       "You may have opportunity to speak in other churches. In improv-
     ing these opportunities, remember the words of the Saviour, 'Be ye
     therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.' Do not arouse the
     malignity of the enemy by making denunciatory speeches. Thus you
     will close doors against the entrance of truth. Clear-cut messages are
     to be borne. But guard against arousing antagonism. There are many
     souls to be saved. Restrain all harsh expressions. In word and deed be
     wise unto salvation, representing Christ to all with whom you come
     in contact. Let all see that your feet are shod with the preparation of
     the gospel of peace and good will to men. Wonderful are the results
     we shall see if we enter into the work imbued with the Spirit of Christ.
     Help will come in our necessity if we carry the work forward in right-
     eousness, mercy, and love. Truth will triumph, and bear away the vic-
     tory."—Ellen G. White, Evangelism, pp. 563, 564.

Discussion Questions:
      O Imagine that you are given the pulpit in another church; it
      will be your only opportunity to preach there. What would you
      say, what wouldn't you say, and why?

      • Is it wrong to worship with Christians in their church on
      Sunday, or not? Justify your answer.

Summary: All our relationships with other Christians should be
     marked by warm respect for them as brothers and sisters in the Lord.
     But, at the same time, we must also be sure of our reason for existence
     as Seventh-day Adventists, and we must be ready, when the right
     opportunity arises, to tell them the things we believe that they need to
     know. And, just as important, they need to see in our lives the reality
     of our experience with Christ, a reality that will be manifested by our
     unconditional love.

Drug Addict
Finds Jesus by J. H.Z                            ACHARY

   For ten miserable years Svetlana was a drug addict. She searched for
   For
ways to overcome her addictions, but even medical professionals could not
help her. Desperate, Svetlana prayed, "God, if You exist, please help me."
God heard her prayers, and she felt the stranglehold of drugs begin to
weaken.
   Svetlana sought out a church. She hoped to find someone there who
would talk with her, pray with her, and help her.
   But not even one person talked to her. Disappointed, she left.
   Svetlana became discouraged. Even though drugs no longer had a hold
on her, she still searched for peace.
   Eventually she turned to alcohol, and she quickly sank into another
addiction. When she contracted tuberculosis, she gave up hope and pre-
pared to die.
   One day some Adventist neighbors visited her and offered to help her.
But she had heard that Adventists were a sect, and she refused their help.
For three years she refused their offers of help and prayer. Finally, in des-
peration, she agreed to listen to them and let them pray for her. She went
to church with them.
   Svetlana was touched when the church members prayed for her by
name. After church one woman gave her a Bible and a copy of Steps to
Christ. As she read them her life began to change.
   When Svetlana went to her next doctor's appointment, the doctor found
no trace of tuberculosis. She had been healed.
   The emptiness that Svetlana had tried to fill with drugs and alcohol was
now filled with the peace of God. Her old life was transformed, and her
former friends noticed. "What has happened to you? You are like a differ-
ent person," they told her.
    Recently Svetlana was baptized. Because the nearest Adventist
church is some distance from her home, she has opened her home for
a small group of believers to meet on Sabbaths. Half of the people who
attend the services are drug addicts. These former friends have seen
the change in Svetlana and want to receive God's help in their lives, as
well.
    One of her former addict friends has accepted Jesus as Savior and now
 is drug free. "I thank God for the Adventists who did not give up on me
when I refused their help. Now Jesus is giving me the opportunity to help
 my friends find a new life also:' Svetlana testifies.

         LESSON             9      *August 21-27



      How to Relate to
      Non-Christians


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 14:6; Acts 4:12;
      Rom. 1:18-20; 2:14-16; Phil. 2:5-11; Rev. 14:6, 7.

Memory Text: "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no
      other name under heaven given to men by which we must be
      saved" (Acts 4:12, NIV).



      m         any people today no longer want to hear about absolute
                truth. The various religions, including the Christian faith,
                are seen as equally valid ways to reach the beyond. Many
      claim that, in essence, we all worship the same God—we simply have
      different historically and culturally conditioned ways of doing so.
      Everyone should be allowed to have his or her own truth. And no
      belief system should claim superiority over another.
         As Christians, of course, we reject that concept. The very nature of
      our Christianity demands we do. We maintain that the religion of
      Christ is unique and that we must continue to call people everywhere
      to become His disciples.
        The question, then, remains for us: How should we relate to those
      who are not of the Christian faith? This week we look at some broad
      principles regarding this important topic.

The Week at a Glance: Why, as Christians, must we
      reject the notion that all religions are valid? How should we treat
      non-Christians? What's the best way to witness to them? Why
      should we witness to them? To whom does the three angels' mes-
      sages go?

     Incurably Religious
       All through human history, in almost every culture, in every age,
     even in the most adverse and trying conditions, humans have had
     belief in some sort of god or gods. Through the centuries the question
     has been asked: Where does this belief come from? Was religion
     "invented" or "discovered"? Does humanity's belief in God originate
     in humanity itself, as a projection of some inner need? Has
     humankind always been religious? And if so, why so?
        As Christians, we believe that religion originated with God, who
     has revealed Himself to us in various ways, the greatest revelation
     being that of Jesus Christ coming in the flesh, where He revealed to
     us the love and self-sacrificing character of the Lord.
        Not everyone, though, has heard or known the good news of the
     love and character of our Lord. And yet, God has not forsaken these
     people, either. Remember, at the Cross, Christ died for the sins of
     the whole world (1 John 2:2); His death, by default, excluded no
     one (John 3:16); He suffered death for every person (Heb. 2:9). No
     one was left out, not even those who have never heard, nor will ever
     hear, of Christ's death, at least in this life. Why would the Lord die
     in their behalf if they weren't, somehow, offered the option of sal-
     vation?

Read Romans 1:18-20, 2:14-16. What do these texts tell us about
     those who haven't heard directly about Jesus and the salvation He
     offers? Are they still accountable to God, and, if so, why?




        Those who consciously turn their backs on God do so at their eter-
     nal risk, that's for certain. But many have always lived in darkness
     through no fault of their own. Yet, even these people have had a lim-
     ited revelation of God and, thus, will be held responsible only for
     what they knew in their deepest of hearts.

      English poet Samuel Coleridge once suggested that instead of
      locking criminals in jail, the offenders should be placed in
      nature, where, seeing the natural world's "soft influences," they
      would turn from their evil ways. However nice an idealized and
      romantic view of the natural world this is, what are its flaws?
      What are the limits of what we can know about God, truth, and
      morality from nature alone?



                                                                         73
               MONDAY August 23


     The Universal Claims
Read John 14:6. What is Jesus saying? Why would many people,
     especially in today's world, find such words so hard to accept?




       The religion of the Bible knows nothing of the notion of relativism,
     of each person seeking his or her own version of truth. There is only
     one God, one Creator, one Redeemer, one Lawgiver, and one means
     of salvation. Given the very nature of what we believe as Christians—
     that all the world is fallen into sin and that at the Cross Jesus Christ
     bore the sins of all people upon Himself—it's hard to see how there
     can be different truths for different folk. The very claims of the Bible
     regarding Creation, Redemption, sin, are universal, encompassing
     every human being. Given these claims, then, it's not realistic to
     assume that every other spiritual or religious path is valid, as long as
     those who are on these paths act from a sincere and loving heart.

Look up the following texts. What point do they make about the
     universality of the claims of the Bible? Gen. 1:1, Rom. 3:23, 5:12,
     Heb. 2:9, Rev. 20:13.




        What all this means, then, is that we, as Christians, should preach
     to non-Christians, sharing with them what we believe. If Christianity
     is true, then other religions have to be false. This doesn't mean there
     isn't some good in these faiths, and we certainly aren't in a position
     to judge the hearts of others, whatever their beliefs. Instead, because
     of the universal claims of Christianity, we must, in meekness, humil-
     ity, and love tell others the good news of a loving God who sent His
     own Son into human flesh and in that flesh ransomed the world from
     sin. The claims of the Cross included everyone; everyone, therefore,
     must be told about it.

      How do you respond to someone who makes the claim, "Well,
      your religion is just your truth; I have my own truth"? What's
      wrong with that statement?

              TUESDAY August 24


    Christ—the Only Way                        (Acts 4:12).

      It is often pointed out that other religions also have their heroes,
    just as Christianity has Christ. And, indeed, we must have great
    respect for Muhammad, who insisted—in a highly polytheistic soci-
    ety—upon the worship of one God. Who can't help respecting and
    admiring the Gautama Buddha's compassion and sensitivity to human
    suffering? And there's much good, too, in the profound teachings of
    Confucius.
      But these people do not begin to compare with Jesus Christ, not in
    who they were nor in what they accomplished, nor even claimed to
    accomplish, for the world. To suggest that Jesus and these other peo-
    ple are simply different versions of good men teaching good things is
    to pervert the basic teaching of Scripture grossly. The Bible teaches
    that Jesus is the Savior of the world. Either we accept the claim fully,
    or we reject it fully. It's hard to see, with such a claim, how there can
    be any middle ground, any compromise.

What fundamental truth must we recognize when comparing
    Christianity with other religions? Acts 4:12; see also Isa. 45:5.




       It's precisely because of the universality of what Christ has done
    that, as Christians—having now been redeemed by Jesus (Eph. 1:7,
    Col. 1:14, Heb. 9:12)—we should be motivated to tell others in order
    that they, by faith, can share in the promises of God made to them, as
    well.
      "How then should we relate to those of other religions? First of
    all, we must treat them as fellow human beings—with respect and
    honor. . . . We need to approach them with openness, ready to listen
    and learn. In our finiteness we do not have all that we need at any
    point in our experience. Different points of emphasis may help to
    strengthen our own experience. Nor should we apologize for what we
    believe or our conviction that we have truth in having Jesus Christ.
    Never should we hesitate to witness to another. But our efforts must
    always reflect humility and avoid a spirit of triumphalism or a subtle
    attitude of imperialism."—S. Kubo, The God of Relationships
    (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald® Pub. Assn., 1993), p. 138.

      How do you show respect for people and for their personal faith
      and integrity, while at the same time rejecting their beliefs? Or
      can you?


                                                                          75
         WEDNESDAY August 25


     All Things to All Men
        Though the truths of what we believe are eternal and unchanging,
     the context in which we spread those truths is always changing. The
     approach one would take with an Indian shaman wouldn't be the same
     as with a New Age German banker; the witness to a Canadian Inuit
     living in the far end of the Yukon wouldn't be the same as with a
     Singaporean business executive. Though the message is the same, the
     methods often vary.

How did the apostle Paul apply this basic principle in his ministry?
     Acts 16:1-3, 1 Cor 9:19-23. How does that explain his actions in
     Jerusalem? Acts 21:17-26. What principle of ministry do we see
     here by Paul's words and actions? Remember, too, that he is the
     same man who wrote Galatians 1:8, 9.




       "More than 2 billion of the world's population will hear the gospel
     only if cross-cultural missionaries will make themselves servants and
     become all things to them. From tribes in Africa to heavy-metal rock-
     ers in the 'jungles' of New York City, from the sophisticated profes-
     sional to the troubled teenager next door, people desperately need to
     hear the gospel in a context they can understand. Who will humble
     themselves and become incarnate as slaves for the sake of these souls?
     Who will go through the hard, risky business of contextualization so
     others may clearly hear the gospel?"—Jon Dybdahl, "Cross-Cultural
     Adaptation: How to Contextualize the Gospel," Ministry (November
     1992), p. 17.

In what perfect way was this principle of reaching people where
     they are realized in the ministry of our Savior? Phil. 2:5-11.


      Christ came to meet us where we are. He assumed human form.
      He expressed Himself in human language. He became one of us.
      If, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the church wants
      to reach the modern world with the message of Christ, it will
      have to meet people where they are and speak the language of
      the people of today and not of a century ago.

              THURSDAY August 26


     Christ's Method Alone
        We've tried to show this week a crucial point regarding the univer-
     sality of our faith; we can't be true to what we believe without believ-
     ing that these truths that offer us so much hope, offer that same hope
     to every other human being. The nature of the claims cry out for us to
     tell them to others. Indeed, that's an essential component of who we
     are as Seventh-day Adventists. It's also why, through the grace of God,
     we are in almost every country of the world.

Read Revelation 14:6, 7, the first angel's message. What does it tell
      us about whom we are to preach to?


         That's every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, which would
      include those of every faith. Our commission is set before us in no
      uncertain terms.
         At the same time, we must remember that no matter where people
      live, no matter their religious faith, no matter their beliefs, we are all the
      same, beings created in the image of God, beings who are sinners,
      beings who have basic needs. As Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we
      believe that the light that God has given us can help meet those needs
      better than anything else the world has to offer. The better we seek to
      meet those needs, the more we can reveal to the non-Christian world the
      love and character of God, and the more effective our witness will be.

Look at this quote from Ellen White: "Christ's method alone will
      give true success in reaching the people. The Saviour mingled
      with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy
      for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence.
      Then He bade them, 'Follow Me. "—The Ministry of Healing, p.
      143. Why would an approach like this be effective for whatever
      people group we were seeking to reach?


        The bottom line is that we live in a world filled with hurting, suf-
      fering people; the good news is that we worship and know the Lord,
      who cares about these people and their suffering. As Adventists, we
      can minister to them, even from our own personal sufferings, and
      point them to something better in this life, as well as to the only One
      who can give them eternal life. This is our calling; to do anything else
      would be unfaithful to that calling.

       Talk to those in your church about ways to reach out to the non-
       Christian faiths in your own community. What practical things
       could you do to make a positive impact for the Lord?
                                                                                 77
                  FRIDAY August 27


Further Study: "Even among the heathen are those who have
     cherished the spirit of kindness; before the words of life had fallen
     upon their ears, they have befriended the missionaries, even minister-
     ing to them at the peril of their own lives. Among the heathen are
     those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is never
     brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though
     ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His voice speak-
     ing to them in nature, and have done the things that the law required.
     Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts,
     and they are recognized as the children of God."—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire ofAges, p. 638.
       "There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If
     less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in per-
     sonal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are to be
     relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and bereaved comforted, the
     ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with
     those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice. Accompanied by
     the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of
     God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit."—Ellen G. White,
     Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 458.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Look at that last quote from Ellen White. How can your
       church, as a whole, better manifest those principles in your com-
       munity?

          To what extent do believers hold the eternal destiny of non-
       believers in their hands? Why did God choose to involve human
       beings in His plan of salvation?

Summary: As Christians, we do not believe that our faith is just one
     path of many that ultimately leads to God. The Bible makes it clear
     that there's only one path, and that's through Jesus. Thus, it becomes
     crucial that we witness to those of every other faith, and the most
     effective way to do that is through kind, loving, self-sacrificing serv-
     ice. That's how we are to relate to non-Christians. It's also the essence
     of who we should be as Seventh-day Adventists.

Freed by
Christ By ROMBEK SOKIRI LOGWORONG
   "Do not burn us!" the evil spirits commanded Abuk Deng as she ironed
her employer's clothes. Abuk tried to ignore the spirits and continue with
her work, but the spirits threw her to the ground and tormented her for sev-
eral minutes before finally leaving her alone.
   After the death of her husband, Abuk and her children fled to northern
Sudan to escape the ongoing civil war in the south. She left everything of
value in the village, taking only what she could fit into a small suitcase.
She carefully packed the eagle claws her husband had given her before he
died. "Take good care of them," he said, "for they will protect the family
from harm."
   Abuk and her children arrived in Khartoum, and she found work as a maid.
But soon evil spirits took possession of her and demanded sacrifices. But
because she had no regular source of income and could not buy animals for
the spirits, they made her life miserable, disturbing her at work and threaten-
ing her. Abuk feared that the spirits would make her or her children sick.
   She longed for deliverance from the spirits, and although she was not a
Christian, she let some Christians pray for her. But nothing happened.
Then an Adventist relative learned of Abuk's problem and asked the pas-
tor to pray for her. Abuk was not sure it would work, but she was willing
to try anything.
    When the pastor and church members visited Abuk, they asked her
when the spirits had begun tormenting her. Abuk mentioned the eagle
claws, and the pastor explained to her that the eagle claws symbolized the
presence of the evil spirits and must be destroyed. He asked her to get
them. As Abuk retrieved the claws from the small suitcase, she screamed
loudly and started to shout at the visitors in unknown languages. The pas-
tor and church members prayed, asking God to set Abuk free from the
power of Satan. They continued praying until Abuk stopped shouting.
    Abuk gave the pastor the eagle claws, and he destroyed them. Since then
 Abuk has been free from the evil spirits that had tormented her. Today she
 is a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Khartoum, Sudan.
 She no longer fears the evil spirits, for she has discovered the power of
 Jesus Christ to free her from physical and spiritual bondage. She knows
 the truth of the verse, "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed"

        LESSON 10 *August 28—September 3


      Loving Our
      Enemies?



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study:Jet: 31:31-34, Matt. 5:44,
      6:12, Luke 6:27-36, 23:1-34.

Memory Text: "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live
      at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18, NIV).

             ome people have or claim to have only friends and no enemies;

      S      some have no friends but only enemies. Most of us are some-
             where in the middle: We have friends, but we also do not get
      along with everybody. This may seem a simple fact of life, but, as
      Christians, we cannot simply shrug our shoulders if our relationship
      with some others is disrupted or if we harbor feelings of distrust, even
      antipathy, toward some people. Nor should it leave us indifferent if
      some people have problems with us. The Christian message of love
      has relevance for our relationship with those whom we dislike or,
      even worse, might even feel hateful toward.
         We are admonished to "turn from evil and do good" and to "seek
      peace and pursue it" in every way we can (Ps. 34:14, NIV). Though it
      is important not to forget the larger picture, this week we'll focus on
      ourselves and the way we relate to those with whom we have (shall we
      put it kindly?) unresolved issues.

The Week at a Glance: What does Christ's example on
      the cross tell us about loving our enemies? How can we love our
      enemies? Why should we do so? Why must we forgive before we
      can love?

     Jesus and His Enemies
       "Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
     they do" (Luke 23:34).

Read Luke 23:1-34, reviewing the events that lead to Christ uttering
     these incredible words. In light of all that was happening to Jesus,
     how He was being treated, how He was being spoken to, how He
     was being mocked, how He was being lied about, what powerful
     lesson can we learn from this example regarding how we treat our
     enemies?




        Unrewarded, unaccepted, reviled, mocked, tortured, Jesus has every
      reason to hate those who treated Him as they did. And yet, amid His
      own sufferings, amid His own abasement, Jesus—forgetting self—
      prays for those who would, by most standards, be deemed His ene-
      mies. What an amazing testimony to God's love! What a powerful
      rebuke to our own pride, envy, and hateful attitudes toward others!
        Some of history's cruelest and meanest characters have been able to
      manifest kindness and love to those who were kind and loving to
      them. Indeed, almost anyone can do that. But we see Jesus here living
      out a principle that reflects something greater: unconditional love,
      even to those who hate Him back. It's hard to imagine a more power-
      ful witness to the world of the character of our God and His power to
      work in our lives.
        This attitude, in a sense, reveals the essence of the Cross. "For if,
      when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
      Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life"
      (Rom. 5:10). In other words, despite our attitude toward God, He
      poured Himself out for us through the life and suffering of Jesus. And
      He did this even while we were sinners, even while we were alienated
      and estranged from Him.
         With such an example before us, how could we do anything other
      than, through God's grace, seek to manifest that same principle our-
      selves?

       Go back over Luke 23:1-34. In what similar ways have you been
       treated unfairly? How did you respond? What does your
       response, in contrast to Christ's, tell you about your own per-
       sonal need to grow in grace?

                                                                          81

      Loving Our Enemies                    (Matt. 5:44, Luke 6:27-36).

        Ghandi (1869-1948) once said, "It is easy enough to be friendly to
      one's friends. But to befriend the one who regards himself as your
      enemy is the quintessence of true religion."—Non- Violence in Peace
      and War (New York: New Directions Pub. Corp., 1965), vol. 2, sect.
      248. These words sound like an echo from the One who practiced,
      even more perfectly than Ghandi, what He preached.

What basic principle was given by Christ, which must govern our
      relationship with those who have turned against us? Matt. 5:44,
      Luke 6:27-36.


        Having grown up in Galilee, an area renowned for its political
      unrest, and living in a land under occupation by a ruthless foreign
      power, Christ knew about civil unrest, war, tyranny, and enemies.
      When He began His work and challenged the beliefs and practices
      of the religious elite of His days, He inevitably made many bitter
      enemies. But He did, indeed, love His enemies, even when He was
      brutally arrested, flogged, and nailed to a cross (Luke 23:34).

Review the following texts, which spell out in more detail what lov-
      ing our enemies implies: Proverbs 24:17, 25:21, Matthew 5:38-42,
      Ephesians 4:26.


       "We are to love our enemies with the same love that Christ mani-
     fested toward His enemies by giving His life to save them. Many
     may say, 'This is a hard commandment; for I want to keep just as far
     as I can from my enemies.' But acting in accordance with your own
     inclination would not be carrying out the principles that our Saviour
     has given. 'Do good,' He says, 'to them that hate you, and pray for
     them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. . . .' This scrip-
     ture illustrates one phase of Christian perfection. While we were yet
     enemies of God, Christ gave His life for us. We are to follow His
     example."—Ellen G. White, Medical Ministry, pp. 253, 254.

       We clearly have been told by inspiration to love our enemies.
       Now, if someone were to ask you, "How do you love your ene-
       mies?" what would you respond?

     Increase Our Faith
        For the past two days, we've looked at one of the loftiest principles
     in Scripture: love, not for those who love us back but for our enemies.
     We have not only Christ's words to that effect but His example, too,
     manifested most clearly at the Cross, unquestionably the greatest rev-
     elation of that principle ever revealed in the universe.
        It's one thing to be told what to do, to know what to do, or even to
     want to do it; it's another, however, to do it. Here, perhaps more than
     anywhere else in our lives, we need power from above.

Read Matthew 18:21, 22 and Luke 17:3-5. What question do the dis-
     ciples ask Jesus? How does He answer? How do they respond to
     His answer?




       "Lord, increase our faith." Who of us couldn't relate to their
     request? Jesus here points them to a standard they are not used to, a
     standard that goes beyond what even many of the most forgiving peo-
     ple would aspire to—which is why their response is so sensible. They
     want to do this but realize they need something more than what they
     have in themselves at the moment to be able to do it. Thus, their
     appeal to Jesus for help.
        Of course, faith is a gift (Eph. 2:8), but there's so much we can do
     to receive the gift, to multiply the gift, to strengthen the gift. Here's
     where a life of prayer, of devotion, and of meditation upon Christ all
     play a crucial role. Only as we surrender ourselves to the Lord, only
     as we reckon ourselves dead to self and sin (Rom. 6:10, 11), only as
     we allow the Lord to work in us (vs. 4), will we by God's grace be able
     to love our enemies, to pray for them, and to do good to them. Left to
     their own, our sinful, vengeful hearts will never allow us to love our
     enemies. That's why we need to surrender constantly to the Lord, and
     we can do that only by a conscious choice on our part to make such a
     surrender.

       Who are your enemies? What makes them your enemies? If
       you're not loving them, what's the first step you could take in at
       least trying to?




                                                                           83
         WEDNESDAY September 1


     The Grace of Forgiving (Jer 31:31-34, Matt 6:12).
       Before we can love our enemies, we must forgive them; and before
     we can forgive, we must first learn to accept forgiveness. This is where
     the Christian life begins: the certainty of having been accepted by God
     and the assurance of forgiveness through faith in our risen Lord.

How does the Lord's Prayer remind us that we must, in turn, be will-
     ing to forgive those who have sinned against us? Jer. 31:31-34,
     Matt. 6:12, Heb. 8:12.


        "If we really know Christ as our Savior our hearts are broken and
     cannot be hard, and we cannot refuse forgiveness. If you are refusing
     forgiveness to anybody I suggest that you have never been for-
     given. . . . Pray to God and say, 'Forgive me 0 God as I forgive others
     because of what Thou hast done for me. All I ask is that Thou shouldst
     forgive me in the same manner; not to the same degree, because all I
     do is imperfect. In the same way, as it were, as Thou hast forgiven me,
     I am forgiving others. Forgive me as I forgive them because of what the
     cross of the Lord Jesus Christ has done in my heart.' "—D. Martyn
     Lloyd-Jones, Studies in the Sermon on the Mount (Grand Rapids,
     Mich.: W B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 1960), vol. 2, pp. 75, 76.
        The author presents a crucial point. To truly forgive, we must under-
     stand how much we have been forgiven. Whatever others have done to
     us, is it worse than what our sins have done to the Lord? Hardly. The
     distance we have to cross in order to forgive others is almost nonex-
     istent in contrast to the distance Christ, the eternal God, crossed in
     order to forgive us. This is a reality we must constantly keep before us
     if we are to forgive and then to love.

How does the Cross help us understand what our forgiveness cost
     God? Isa. 53:4-6, Phil. 2:5-8.


       By dwelling on the Cross, by dwelling on the cost of our forgive-
     ness, we can, through God's grace, come to the point where we can
     learn to forgive others, even those whom we might deem, and rightly
     so, our enemies.

      Are you having trouble forgiving, much less loving, an enemy?
      Write down your understanding of what Christ suffered at the
      Cross in order to forgive you. Pray and meditate over just what
      He did in your behalf. See if it will not help open you up toward
      those who have earned your anger.

     Why Should We Love Our Enemies?
       "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
     anger" (Prov. 15:1).

Why should we love our enemies?




       If you answered the above question, Because God tells us to, you
     have given probably the best answer a Christian can give. We should
     love our enemies, because our God has told us to, and if we are
     Christians, we obey the Lord.
       But the Lord doesn't ask us to do things in a vacuum; there's usu-
     ally a practical reason for what He asks, because He loves us and
     wants what's for our good. (See Deut. 10:13.) Thus, there's an incred-
     ible amount of practical, personal good that can come not just to our
     enemies but to ourselves by learning to love those whom we deem
     enemies. Think of how much different our world would be if we
     learned to love our enemies. It would be the closest thing to heaven
     we're ever going to find on this earth, at least for now.

Read Romans 12:20, 21 and 1 Thessalonians 5:15. What is Paul say-
     ing there? How do his words fit in with the overall theme of this
     week's lesson?


       God has done so much for us. As Christians, we have so much
     reason to have hope, because we have the promise not only of all
     things working for good now but the promise of eternity in a whole
     new existence; one filled with love, peace, and prosperity, an exist-
     ence we can't even begin to comprehend now. Thus, with such a
     promise before us, we, of all people, should be able to rise above the
     common hatreds that have poisoned this planet until it's a cauldron
     of hate, violence, and revenge. What better way to be salt, to be
     light, than to love our enemies, thus bearing a powerful witness to
     the world that we have something it desperately needs, and that, of
     course, is Jesus.

        In your own situation, wherever you live, what changes would
       come about if all the Christians you knew, yourself included,
       started to love their enemies? Write out a paragraph imagining
       the changes.


                                                                         85
                  FRIDAY September 3

Further Study: Read "The Measure of Forgiveness" in Ellen G.
     White's book Christ's Object Lessons (pp. 243-251). Note in particu-
     lar the following statement:
       "Our Lord teaches that matters of difficulty between Christians are
     to be settled within the church. They should not be opened before
     those who do not fear God. If a Christian is wronged by his brother,
     let him not appeal to unbelievers in a court of justice. Let him follow
     out the instruction Christ has given. Instead of trying to avenge him-
     self, let him seek to save his brother. God will guard the interests of
     those who love and fear Him, and with confidence we may commit
     our case to Him who judges righteously."—Pages 248, 249.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Dwell more on this idea of the practical good that can come
      from loving our enemies. Discuss what this world would be like
      if this principle were to take hold of the world as quickly and as
      firmly as does the desire for revenge.

      0 Should the idea that in the end God will bring justice and
      punishment to evildoers play a role in helping us learn to love our
      enemies? Is it really love if we want God ultimately to punish
      them? How does Christ's prayer on the cross help answer that
      question?

      0 Relatives of a murder or rape victim often say they will never
      be able to forgive the person who committed that heinous crime.
      How can one help someone in dealing with this very human and
      understandable reaction?

Summary: Many of us have enemies or are regarded by others as
     their enemies. It is important to analyze our relationships and ask our-
     selves why some relationships have broken down and what can be
     done to restore them. As Christians, we are challenged to build posi-
     tive relationships, even with those we do not really like. Loving our
     enemies does not come naturally. Yet, if we realize how God always
     stands ready to forgive us, we should be prepared also to forgive "our
     debtors."

Not-So-Smart Solomon
\Vises Up by DENNIS RODRIGUES
   As a teenager Solomon was not so smart. He let his peers influence his
decisions and began smoking and taking drugs. He experimented with
every drug he could get, and often he grew weak because he was not eat-
ing. Drugs were all he cared for.
   Solomon and his friends were always together, smoking and taking
drugs. They formed a gang and often fought with other teens. Once when
he was high on drugs, he picked up a machete, ready to strike his father.
But a voice shouted to him, "Stop!" and he dropped the machete as if it
were on fire.
   "Help me, please!" he cried. His family took him to a mental hospital
for treatment. But the hospital kept him for only a few days.
   Solomon's grandmother prayed for him constantly and encouraged him
to attend church with her and let God heal him. Solomon went, and there
he felt God's love calling him. But he continued taking drugs for ten more
years. Then Solomon's grandmother and his father died. The two people
who had tried to help him were gone. Finally Solomon could run away
from God no longer. He gave up and gave his life to God. It had taken him
years to heed the voice of God.
    Solomon did not know which church to attend. He tried several before
he visited an Adventist church. There he watched the pastor baptize some-
one, and instantly he knew what he must do. He went to the pastor and
asked for baptism. The pastor reviewed the doctrines with him and bap-
tized Solomon.
    Solomon's repentance was real. He serves his church and his God with
joy and faithfulness as a deacon and an elder. Several members of his fam-
 ily have given their hearts to Christ because of his witness.
    Recently he held his own evangelistic series and led seven people to
 Jesus.
    He is trained as an accountant, but he has chosen simpler work that puts
 him in touch with people he can talk to about God. Solomon shares his
 faith on the bus, to strangers in the street. "For years I was compelled to
 take drugs; today I am by God compelled to preach," he says. He is eager
 to redeem the time he has left for God.

      Brothers and Sisters
      in the Faith



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Matt. 26:21-25; John
      10:16; 17:11; Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph. 4:3, 13; Phil. 2:2.

Memory Text: "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do
      good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of
      believers" (Galatians 6:10, NIV).

               s Seventh-day Adventists, we often refer to one another as

      A        "brother" and "sister." When overused, however, such terminol-
               ogy can, of course, easily become an empty phrase; and if used
      without care, it can, at times, create an awkwardness when nonmembers
      are around. Nonetheless, the idea that we are "brothers" and "sisters" in
      faith is something we should not lose, even if, at times, like all families,
      our relationship with our "brothers" and "sisters" faces hard challenges.
      Some of our spiritual siblings have traits we do not admire, and not every
      "brother" and "sister" always acts brotherly and sisterly toward each
      other. This is a fact of church life; we might as well get used to it.
        Thus, as most of us who are church members could understand,
      there is ample reason to devote a week on the topic of our relation-
      ships with fellow believers, especially those who can try our patience
      and mercy to their limits.

The Week at a Glance: How did Paul describe the diver-
      sity amid the unity of the church? Around what should our core
      unity rest? What things may cause disunity among us? How was
      Christ's treatment of Judas an example in how we should respond
      to those among us who treat us badly?

      One in Christ             (Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-27).

        One of the greatest challenges facing our church is the question of
      unity. The church started as a movement among North Americans
      with a predominantly Protestant background. It then moved into
      Europe and gradually also into other parts of the world, encountering
      more and more different belief systems and cultures. Today the
      church has a presence in more than two hundred countries and is
      growing fast, particularly in the non-Western world. It is not hard to
      see how there is a continuous danger of growing apart or even frag-
      menting, unless we are determined to stay together. A sustained focus
      on unity is, therefore, needed more than ever as we face the chal-
      lenges ahead. After all, how can we light the world with the glory of
      the three angels' messages if we are busy fighting among ourselves?

What is one of the favorite images of the apostle Paul to describe the
      nature of Christ's church? How does this image underline the
      essential aspect of unity? Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor 12:12-27.


         "Paul . . . makes a very effective parallel with the church collec-
      tively being compared to the parts of the human body. The compari-
      son was not original with Paul. Many ancient writers had made a sim-
      ilar point. . . . The Corinthians would therefore readily understand
      Paul's words, 'If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do
      not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part
      of the body' (1 Cor. 12:15, NIV). . . .
         "The very weakest members . . . are indispensable; and, further-
      more, the parts that we think are less honorable, we treat with special
      honor. For example, the vital organs (such as the heart, the kidneys,
      the lungs, the liver, and the stomach) are not visible, but life cannot
      exist without them."—W. Larry Richards, The Abundant Life Bible
      Amplifier-1 Corinthians (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing
      Association, 1997), pp. 216, 217.

How did the early church at its very beginning display the kind of
      unity God had intended? Acts 1:14, 2:1, 4:32.




       How's your local church doing in terms of the kind of unity
       depicted by Paul or as in those verses in Acts? If you are divided
       in certain areas, what can you yourself do to help bring about a
       change?
                                                                          89

     The Beauty of Diversity
        The McDonald's restaurant chain has tens of thousands of restaurants
     worldwide. Whether in Pakistan or in the U.S.A., in Hungary or in South
     Africa, you will fmd the golden arches. And you can be sure the prod-
     uct is always the same. The burgers will always have the same size and
     weight, and the milk shakes always come in three tastes and in the same
     size cups. Some might call this unity. But this kind of similarity has
     nothing to do with real unity; instead, this is uniformity, and there's an
     important distinction between the two. In our thinking about the unity of
     the church, we must be careful not to confuse uniformity with unity.

What are some of the characteristics of the unity that the church
     ought to display? What is emphasized, and what is not mentioned?
     John 10:16; 17:11, 21; Eph. 4:3, 13; Phil. 2:2.


        "The secret of true unity in the church and in the family is not
     diplomacy, not management, not a superhuman effort to overcome
     difficulties—though there will be much of this to do—but union with
     Christ."—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 179.
        Ellen White's words, in the context of the texts listed above, are so
     crucial to an understanding of unity. We can come from different eth-
     nic, national, religious, and economic backgrounds, but at the foot of
     the cross, we are all the same: sinners in need of God's grace.
        And yet, the hand is not the foot, the foot is not the eye, and the eye
     is not the heart; all are different—all have different compositions, dif-
     ferent functions, different roles. If the eyes demanded that the heart
     be like them, the body would soon be dead; if the heart demanded that
     the eyes be like them, the body would be blind.
        Thus, because our church is so different—composed of various
     national, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, many of which have
     clashed over these differences—our unity must be found in something
     that, while not denying these differences, transcends them. And for us
     as Adventists, that must be Jesus Christ and the common mission He
     has given to us. This side of heaven national, ethic, and political dif-
     ferences will remain; but as Adventist Christians, with a common
     Savior, a common mission, a common message, we should seek,
     through God's grace, never to allow these things to disrupt the unity
     that God seeks for His church. Admittedly, this isn't always easy. But
     if we are called to love our enemies, we certainly should be able to
     love fellow church members, should we not?

      If any ethnic, national, or political issues are dividing your
      church, what can you do to pull people to the Cross, the only
      true solution to the problem?

     The Ugliness of Division                   (Num. 16:1; 1 Cor 1:11,
     12).

       During the 2000 General Conference Session, Andrews
     University professor George R. Knight gave a thought-provoking
     speech about issues he sees as threatening the church. Among
     many other things, he said: "[If I were the devil,] I would get as
     many Adventists as possible to think tribally, nationally, and
     racially. I would make the church one big power struggle, without
     regard to mission or efficiency. Having made that statement, I has-
     ten to add that there are injustices that need to be rectified and
     complex situations that can never be made completely straight. My
     plea is that even in the most difficult and unjust situations we need
     to behave as born-again sisters and brothers, able to discuss these
     things without losing sight of the mission of the church, which
     makes the issues meaningful in the first place."—George R.
     Knight, "If I Were the Devil," Adventist Review (January 2001),
     pp. 14, 15.

There are numerous causes for disunity in the church. State, in a
     few words, what the core issues were in the conflicts mentioned in
     the following Bible passages: Numbers 16:1-3; Acts 6:1, 2; 15:1,2;
     1 Cor. 1:11-17.


       Who is in charge? Who will benefit more than others? And
     whose theology is correct? These are the most common causes
     (often in some combination) of division in a local church or in
     a denomination. The issues themselves can be quite legitimate.
     Social groups—and this includes spiritual organizations—need to
     determine how matters of leadership and authority must be dealt
     with. When an organization consists of various subgroups, there
     must be a mechanism to ensure that the interests of these groups
     are safeguarded. Real problems are not to be swept under the car-
     pet. But those who profess to follow Christ and want to imitate His
     nature will choose a strategy in which prayerful dialogue, a desire
     to understand one another, patience, tolerance, and love are the key
     concepts.

       Look at some of the problems listed in the above texts. There
       were power struggles, doctrinal differences, and ethnic ten-
       sions, even cliques. How little has changed over the centuries.
       Again, why must we all come to the Cross and be broken if these
       problems are ever to be resolved?


                                                                        91

      Servanthood Versus Power Play
        To be a servant is not our idea of success. We see success in terms
      of influence, of power, of the ability to direct and control others. It
      seems to be part of human nature to make comparisons between our-
      selves and selected others, with the desire to come out on top.

What fundamental principle did Jesus state in response to the
    request from the mother of James and John for a place of special
    prestige for her sons? Matt. 20:20-27.




          If you study the above verses carefully, you will see clearly the con-
      trast between sinful humanity and a perfect God. Here is first a
      mother, zealous for the success of her children; then there are the
      other disciples, indignant at what they must deem a power play. And
      remember, these are all followers of Christ (the mother came wor-
      shiping Jesus); yet, greed, jealousy, and selfishness are unveiled.
          All this is contrasted to Jesus, who not only spoke the principle of
      servanthood but, in a way that our finite minds can barely grasp, lived
      it.

Read Matthew 20:28. What is Jesus talking about? How did He
      express this principle in the most amazing manner?




         No question, many of the things that divide or threaten to divide the
      church would vanish were we to take seriously Christ's words about
      being a servant to others. Being great, or chief, doesn't necessarily
      have anything to do with office or prestige. Yet, it can have a lot to do
      with power, not power as the world sees it but power to change lives,
      to bring healing, to reveal to others the love and character of God. And
      this comes through influence—of being a good example and of reveal-
      ing to others the spirit of Christ. That's true power and greatness.

       It's one thing to talk about being a servant; it's another to act
       in that role. What are some practical things that you could do
       that would express the principle of servanthood in your own
       church body? How, for instance, does the foot-washing service
       represent this principle?

     Dealing With Difficult People
        Have you heard of the 20-80 principle? It suggests that 20 percent of
     the people you have to deal with produce 80 percent of the problems.
     Ask personnel directors or customer-service directors what their expe-
     rience is, and you will find them in agreement. Virtually all pastors will
     confess that a relatively small percentage of their parishioners give
     them most of their headaches. Yes, unfortunately, not all people are as
     lovable and likable as we would prefer them to be (of course, others
     might and with some justification say the same about us, as well). Some
     people provide a serious challenge to our Christian experience.

Read Mark 14:43, 44; Luke 22:3-6, 47, 48; John 18:3-7. What did
     Judas do to Jesus? Why was his act such an act of treachery?



       Few people in history have gone to their grave with such infamy as
     Judas Iscariot, who, with his betrayal of Jesus, brought upon himself
     eternal ruin. And yet, even knowing what Judas would do, Jesus still
     sought to save him.

Read Matthew 26:21-25. What happened here that showed that
     Jesus was still trying to work with Judas?




       "But Judas was not yet wholly hardened. Even after he had twice
     pledged himself to betray the Saviour, there was opportunity for
     repentance. At the Passover supper Jesus proved His divinity by
     revealing the traitor's purpose. He tenderly included Judas in the min-
     istry to the disciples. But the last appeal of love was unheeded. Then
     the case of Judas was decided, and the feet that Jesus had washed
     went forth to the betrayer's work."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
     Ages, p. 720.
        What a powerful testimony to us of how we should treat those who
     are, for better or for worse, among us. Indeed, who hasn't experienced
     personally how, sometimes, the most painful struggles we have are
     not with those whom we would deem our enemies but those whom we
     would deem otherwise our "brothers" and "sisters"? We have here an
     example from Jesus how we should respond.

       Have you been betrayed by a Judas? If so, how can you, through
       the grace of Christ, respond as Christ did?
                                                                             93
                 FRIDAY September 10

Further Study: Read the chapter "Who Is the Greatest" in Ellen
     G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 432-442.
       "In these first disciples was presented marked diversity. They were
     to be the world's teachers, and they represented widely varied types of
     character. In order successfully to carry forward the work to which
     they had been called, these men, differing in natural characteristics
     and in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling, thought,
     and action. This unity it was Christ's object to secure. To this end He
     sought to bring them into unity with Himself. The burden of His labor
     for them is expressed in His prayer to His Father, 'That they all may
     be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may
     be one in Us;' that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and
     hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.' John 17:21, 23. His constant
     prayer for them was that they might be sanctified through the truth;
     and He prayed with assurance, knowing that an Almighty decree had
     been given before the world was made. He knew that the gospel of the
     kingdom would be preached to all nations for a witness; He knew that
     truth armed with the omnipotence of the Holy Spirit would conquer
     in the battle with evil, and that the bloodstained banner would one day
     wave triumphantly over His followers."—Ellen G. White, The Acts of
     the Apostles, pp. 20, 21.

Discussion Questions:
    0 How does one determine what belongs to the unchangeable
      core of our beliefs in contrast to what are mere cultural expres-
      sions and can, therefore, be changed to fit the context of various
      groups? Why, for the sake of unity, must we be able to distinguish
      between the two concepts?

          Imagine that your local church has a membership of around
      one hundred. Most members are pleasant and easy to get along
      with. But a few are capable of destroying the atmosphere. They
      are very opinionated and have very strong convictions about
      what should and should not be done during a divine service. This
      situation clearly hampers the growth of the church. What would
      you advise?

Summary: The church must be characterized by unity rather than
     uniformity. There is beauty and richness in diversity as long as there
     is unity in Christ. Only as we all learn to surrender at the Cross can
     we have the kind of unity that Christ seeks for His people.

The Reverend Father Finds
His Home by JH
            J. H. ZACHARY
   Jeofelo was determined to have a better life than his parents, who had to
work hard to provide for their five children. He joined a Catholic youth
group in high school and eventually began assisting the priest at Mass. The
priest noticed his faithful work and urged Jeofelo to consider studying to
become a priest. Jeofelo took a test to qualify to study for the priesthood,
and he passed. He enrolled in a program to prepare him to study theology
at a university.
   Jeofelo's parents were as proud as he was when at last he was ordained
as a priest. Jeofelo liked his new title, Reverend Father. He served as priest
in several congregations.
   One day he went to the optometrist for new glasses. An attractive young
woman waited on him. Jeofelo was impressed with her professionalism
and kindness and decided to get to know her better. He learned that she
was a Seventh-day Adventist.
   Joefelo resigned his position and joined a denomination in which he
could marry and still serve as a Reverend Father.
   Jeofelo dated the young optometrist and soon proposed marriage. He
promised her that there would be no arguments over religion in their
home, that she could raise their children as Adventists. She agreed.
   One day while riding his motorcycle, Jeofelo was seriously injured in an
accident. He spent weeks in the hospital and two months at home in a
wheelchair. With nothing else to do, he picked up a book that a friend had
given him and began reading it. It was called From Sabbath to Sunday.
Jeofelo was amazed to learn that Saturday was indeed the Sabbath of the
Lord. But he refused to follow what he now knew to be the truth. He had
worked too hard to earn the "Reverend Father" title to give it up over a
theological point.
    Within a year Jeofelo was involved in another accident, and soon after,
another. Jeofelo felt that God was trying to get his attention. He opened
his Bible and read Matthew 16:26, "For what profit is it to a man if he
 gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in
 exchange for his soul?" (NKJV).
    Jeofelo could put off his decision no longer. He asked his wife to call
 her pastor and arrange for Bible studies. Within a few weeks the family
 was united in the Adventist faith.
    Jeofelo gladly laid aside his treasured title and is studying at the
 Adventist seminary in the Philippines to become a Bible teacher.

        LESSON             12 *September //-/7
       Supporting Our
       Leaders


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Ps. 51:3, 4, 10; 1 Pet. 2:9;
      Eph. 1:22, 23; Col 1:18.

Memory Text: "Speaking the truth in love, we will in all things
      grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ" (Ephesians 4: 15,
      NIV).

             o be a leader in the church is not always easy. In fact, we live in

      T      a general climate in which leadership is suspect. Leadership, in
             general, is often almost synonymous with politics, and politics
      usually has connotations of power, self-interest, and even dishonesty
      or corruption. Church leadership is not totally immune to those accu-
      sations either.
        Thus, more than ever, the church needs good leaders at all levels,
      and we must use the best possible processcs to select those leaders.
      And while we must hold them accountable for the decisions that they
      make while in power, it's even more important that we seek to support
      them in all ways possible. We owe that to them and to God.
        This week we look at the important topic of how, as Christians, we
      should relate to our church leaders.

The Week at a Glance: Does the idea that we are all
      equal before God mean that there's no need for church leader-
      ship? In what ways are we all unequal? Who is the Head of the
      church? What does the Bible teach about the necessity of church
      leaders?

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, September 18.

     All Are Equal               (1 Pet. 2:9).

       One of the great rediscoveries of the sixteenth-century Reformation
     was that all people have the same standing before God. We do not
     need other human beings as our mediators. We all have the same
     direct access to our heavenly Father (Heb. 10:19).

How is the fundamental equality in status before God underlined by
     the apostle Peter? I Pet. 2:9; see also Exod. 19:6.


         The idea of a priesthood of all believers was one of the great con-
      cerns of the Protestant Reformers. The concept recognizes that every
      church member has a spiritual ministry to perform. The ordained min-
      istry does not have a more privileged form of service than do others
      in the church body. The clergy merely performs a different service.
      All members have spiritual gifts, and all have important contributions
      to make. As a church, it's important not to forget this principle.

What other assurance is given in the Holy Scriptures that affirms our
      equal standing before God? Gal. 3:28. What is this text saying?




        "No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recog-
      nized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one
      family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came
      to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment
      of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. His love
      is so broad, so deep, so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It lifts out
      of Satan's circle the poor souls who have been deluded by his decep-
      tions. It places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne
      encircled by the rainbow of promise.
         "In Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free. All are
      brought nigh by His precious blood."—Ellen G. White, Christ's Object
      Lessons, p. 386.

       Dwell on the thoughts for today's study. Why is this principle so
       important for Christians to understand? How can it be a cure
       for one of the greatest and most dangerous of all sins: spiritual
       pride? What practical changes would you see in your own
       church were this principle put into practice?

                                                                             97
               MONDAY September 13


     We Have Different Roles
        What a paradox: We are all equal and, yet, we are not. Though we
     all have the same status before God, we do not all function in the same
     role. It is God's design that there is order, and that the church—as a
     spiritual organization—has leadership. Strong support for the princi-
     ple of "the priesthood of all believers" does not mean that leadership
     arrangements are unnecessary. From the earliest days we have evi-
     dence of God instituting leaders for His people.

       How do the following texts establish the legitimacy of leadership
     among the people of God, in Old Testament as well as in New
     Testament times?

       1. Moses                                      Exodus 3



       2. Assistance for Moses                       Exod. 18:21-27



       3. Deborah                                    Judg. 4:4



       4. David                                      1 Sam. 16:1-13



       5. The twelve disciples, or apostles          Mark 3:13-19



       6. Stephen and the other deacons              Acts 6:1-7



       7. Elders                                     Titus 1:5



     Though the Bible does not prescribe a detailed organizational
     model that is to be implemented in all times, God wants His
     people to do things in an orderly manner. Organization and
     leadership are not only legitimate but necessary, as is choosing
     the right kind of leadership.

    Even Saints Are Not Perfect                          (Ps. 51:3, 4, 10).

       Reading biographies of famous missionaries and great religious
     leaders can be extremely inspiring. Often one wonders: Would I have
     been able to demonstrate that same commitment? Would I have been
     able to persevere under such adverse circumstances? Would I have
     had the faith and spiritual strength to help and direct people? When
     we think of the history of our own church and of the energy, courage,
     and determination of many of the Adventist pioneers, we cannot help
     being impressed and inspired.

Take a good look at Hebrews 11 and list some of the great
     heroes of faith who, "by faith," were sure of what they hoped for
     and persevered in their leadership role, often despite countless
     challenges. What was the secret of their success?




       The Bible presents us with inspiring examples of faith but also
     informs us, in all honesty, that even the greatest leaders of ancient
     times were not perfect. It is not difficult to find examples of how
     great leaders made serious mistakes. Sometimes the mistakes were
     such that they could not be maintained in their role. But in many
     cases, God was willing to continue working through them.

Go back again through Hebrews 11. Pick out some of those men-
     tioned there who were, in one capacity or another, in leadership
     roles. What mistakes did these great people of faith make, despite
     their calling before God? What message do their mistakes have
     for us concerning how we should view our leaders?




       Leaders, as the rest of us, are sinners in need of grace, forgiveness,
     counsel, and encouragement. At the same time, to be a leader is a
     great privilege, and with privilege comes responsibility. Though our
     leaders aren't perfect, they are still leaders, and in that role they
     should be expected to act accordingly.

      Should church leaders be expected to adhere to a higher moral
      and spiritual standard than someone not in that role? If so, why
      so? If not, why not?

                                                                          99
          WEDNESDAY September 15

      Supporting Our Leaders
        We owe it to our leaders to support them in whatever way we can.
      As Aaron and Hur supported Moses and helped him to reach out to
      heaven, we have the sacred duty to help our leaders in their ministry
      (Exod. 17:12).

What may those who are full-time employed in the gospel ministry
      expect from the members of the church? Matt. 10:9, 10; Rom.
      16:23.




        God has arranged for a system of support for those who serve Him
      as full-time ministers so that their material needs are provided for as
      they preach the gospel and nurture the church. If all church members
      gave according to the plan that God instituted, there would be more
      than sufficient means to meet the needs of many more church workers.

What other form of support for our pastors and other leaders is just
      as essential as material support? Eph. 6:18, 19; 2 Thess. 3:1.




        "Leaders know the importance of support. It comes in many differ-
      ent forms—regular prayer, encouragement through calls, conversa-
      tions, and notes, interaction on ideas and communicating what is
      going on in the organization. Often it is as simple and straightforward
      as asking the leader, 'What can I do to help you?' "—Leith Anderson,
      A Church for the Twenty-First Century (Minneapolis, Minn.: Bethany
      House Publishers, 1992), pp. 230, 231.
         While support for leaders shouldn't be blind—that is, we do
      whatever they say we should do, no questions asked—true support
      doesn't mean we support them only when we absolutely agree with
      everything they do. Sometimes leaders might make a decision that
      someone disagrees with. Here, too, out of respect for the position
      the person is in, we should as much as possible seek to work with
      those decisions.

       How's your attitude toward your church leaders? Are you show-
       ing them the mercy Christ has shown you? What changes might
       you need to make in relating to them?

Christ Is Our Leader                    (Eph. 4:15, 2:20, 1 Pet. 2:25).

  Read the following texts. What are they all saying about Christ
and His church?

Eph. 1:22, 23


Eph. 4:15


Col. 1:18

   As we have seen this week, though we are all equal in the sight of
God, this fundamental equality does not imply that there should not
be any leaders, or even a hierarchy of leadership, among us. The bib-
lical model teaches that there is, indeed, a structure, and that the
church does have human leaders at various levels.
   At the same time, however, we (and our selected leadership) must
remember that Christ is the head of the church and that He alone is
the Source of its authority. Not only is Christ the Head of each per-
son, He is the Head of the church, in a corporate sense. As individu-
als, and even more so as leaders, we can be faithful to our calling only
to the degree that we are faithful to Christ. Only as we submit to Him
in faith, repentance, and obedience can we fulfill whatever role He
deems for us in His church.
   "It is Christ who makes the church important, not the other way
around. As his body, the church derives its significance from him. The
church is what it is because of who Jesus is, not because of who its
members are.
   "The symbol of the body also suggests subordination. As Christ's
body, the church is subject to his authority. He is 'the head over all
things for the church' (Eph. 1:22). Recognizing that Christ's authority
in the church is supreme prevents us from exaggerating the impor-
tance of any church official or organizational structure. The church
 needs organization, of course, but no organization should obscure
Christ's authority."—Richard Rice, The Reign of God (Berrien
 Springs, Mich.: Andrews University Press, 1985), p. 190.

 How can those who lead out in the local church or occupy some
 position of leadership in the conference or some other organi-
 zational unit ensure that they never lose sight of the fact that
 Christ is the ultimate Leader of the church? If you could give
 some practical advice to any of our leaders on what's the surest
 way to stay connected to Christ and allow Him to lead the
 church through them, what would you say?

                                                                    101

Further Study: "Since His ascension Christ has carried forward
      His work on the earth by chosen ambassadors, through whom He
      speaks to the children of men and ministers to their needs. The great
      Head of the church superintends His work through the instrumental-
      ity of men ordained by God to act as His representatives."—Ellen G.
      White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 360.
         "There have ever been in the church those who are constantly
      inclined toward individual independence. They seem unable to realize
      that independence of spirit is liable to lead the human agent to have
      too much confidence in himself and to trust in his own judgment
      rather than to respect the counsel and highly esteem the judgment of
      his brethren, especially of those in the offices that God has appointed
      for the leadership of His people. God has invested His church with
      special authority and power which no one can be justified in disre-
      garding and despising, for he who does this despises the voice of
      God."—Pages 163, 164.

Discussion Questions:
       O Though it's important to work with the leadership of our
       church, at what point, if ever, should a person stand up and
       openly challenge leadership? Is this ever the correct Christian
       response? If you answer Yes, what biblical or historical prece-
       dents can you cite? If you answer No, defend your position.

       O Sometimes, when our leaders fall, we tend to be harder on
       them than on others who might make the same mistakes. Why do
       you think that is so? Should it be so?

Summary: On the one hand, we must never lose sight of the fact that
      we are all, truly and fully, equals before God. Yet, it is God's purpose
      that not all have the same role. Some have a special calling to be lead-
      ers, of different kinds and at different levels. Leaders must be held
      accountable, but we must not expect them to be perfect. We owe our
      leaders our wholehearted support, in particular in our prayers. But
      both the followers and the leaders must remember always that Christ
      is the Leader of His church.

Left for Dead
by CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN

   On June 24, 2002, a runaway train crashed in Tanzania, killing hundreds
of men, women, and children. On that train were 350 Adventists, mostly
women returning home from a Women's Ministries meeting. Some 54
Adventists, mostly women, were killed.
   When the train's brakes failed, the train rolled backward, reaching
speeds of 160 miles (240 km) an hour. The two pastors aboard went from
car to car comforting and encouraging the women, who prayed and sang
during the 20-minute terror ride before the train crashed. One of these pas-
tors lost his life; the other lost his arm.
   Joyce Ager was one of the passengers. Shortly after the crash, Valentina,
Joyce's sister, learned that Joyce had died in the wreck.
   Valentina traveled to the rural crash site to identify her sister's body. She
searched the large stadium, where most of the bodies had been laid, but
she did not find her sister. Hopeful, she went to the hospital and searched
for Joyce's name on a list of patients, but she found nothing. Sadly, grimly,
she walked to a smaller makeshift morgue to search for her sister among
the dead.
   The bodies were piled on top of one another until space could be made
for them in the stadium morgue. Valentina began searching through the
bodies for the face she hoped she would not see. As she walked among the
bodies, she saw a familiar face. She touched her and found her body
warm. She felt for a pulse. Yes, she was still alive!
   She shouted and ran to find a doctor. "Come, come! My sister is in the
morgue, but she's still alive!" Joyce was carried to the hospital. She was
unconscious and suffered from multiple fractures, but she was alive.
   Joyce woke up six days later and was transferred to a hospital in the city
 of Dar es Salaam. She suffered some memory loss caused by a fractured
 skull, and it was several weeks before she could recognize those she loved.
   Joyce continues on her long road to recovery, but she thanks God and
 her sister for saving her life. She is eager to be well enough to serve Him
 as He wishes.
   No one knows why one person died and another lived in that terrible
 crash. But the Adventists most deeply affected by this tragic wreck hope
 that through their suffering God will reveal Himself to those who need to
 know Him.

        LESSON 1              3 *September 18-24
       Embracing the
      World


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Matt. 13:33; 25:31-46;
      John 17:15-17; 2 Cor. 5:19, 20; Heb. 2:9; 1 John 4:14.

Memory Text:" 'My prayer is not that you take them out of
      the world but that you protect them from the evil one.... As you
      sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world' " (John
      17:15-18, NIV).

              hose who have studied the history of the Seventh-day Adventist

      T      Church know that it took a while before the church began to
             understand the immensity of the challenge God had given her.
      At first, the small band of disappointed Advent believers saw only a
      very limited task: to encourage fellow Adventists after 1844.
      Gradually, however, they saw that God had given them a much greater
      assignment. They sought a wider audience and began to spread their
      message to Protestant America. In 1874 the horizon widened as the
      first official missionary left for Europe. By the year 1900 Adventism
      had gained a small foothold in many parts of the world and was on its
      way to what it is today: a truly global movement.
         Thus the question for us is this: How are we, as Adventist
      Christians, to relate to the world at large?

The Week at a Glance: What kind of image should we
      present to the world? How can we be in the world but not of it?
      What does the universality of Christ's death tell us about the uni-
      versality of our own mission to the world?

      Representing the King                       (Matt. 13:33, 2 Cor 5:20).

What images did Paul use to point out to the church members in
     Corinth that they are representatives of God?

      2 Cor. 2:15-17


      2 Cor 3:1-3


      2 Cor 5:20

        Our life should be such that it calls people to a decision, for or
      against the principles we espouse. For those who reject the Christ
      we serve, our witness will be an irritant or even a "smell of death"
      (2 Cor. 2:16, NIV). But for those who find Christ through us, we are
      a "fragrance of life" (vs. 16, NIV)!
        We also are pictured as ambassadors. Ambassadors are a small but
      important class of people. They go wherever they are sent to represent
      their government. Often they must venture into a culture that differs
      greatly from their own. Their work demands tact and diplomacy, as
      well as frankness and courage. Their duty is to guard jealously the
      interests and the reputations of their home country. What a fitting
      metaphor for those who represent the kingdom of heaven!

What other image is used in the Bible to illustrate the positive influ-
      ence Christians are expected to have in society? Matt. 13:33. And
      what does it mean?


        Leaven is, in general, a symbol for evil influences, carrying infection.
      In this sense Jesus used it when He spoke of the leaven of the Pharisees
      (Mark 8:15 and parallels). It also is used by analogy as a symbol for a
      wholesome influence, which spreads out, as well. The working of
      leaven in dough is not a slow, imperceptible process. At first, it is true,
      the leaven is hidden, and nothing appears to happen, but then the whole
      mass begins to swell and bubble as fermentation advances.

       The moment you identify yourself as a Christian, you are, for
       better or for worse, representing your Lord. In other words,
       whether you are good, bad, or indifferent, you are still repre-
       senting the Lord to those around you. You can never be neutral.
       Think about those whom you are around. What kind of influ-
       ence are you projecting? Where and how can you improve?

                                                                             105
                MONDAY September 20


      "In the World" but Not "of the
      World" (John 17.15-17).
        For many Christians, the church is like a club—strictly for mem-
      bers! Although they will say that they believe in witness and evangel-
      ism and want their church to grow, their deeds and their attitude speak
      a different language!

How are we to relate to the world? Are we to embrace the world and
      all that it offers? Are we to shun the world? Or is there another
      option? See John 17:15-17. What principles is Jesus expressing?


         If we want to be true followers of Christ, we will have to mix with
      the people around us. We must not spend all our time in pious medi-
      tation, thanking God that we differ from all those worldly people
      around us. The opposite is true. While we must be holy—as in being
      radically different in the way we live—we must not keep our distance
      from those who must also hear the good news. We are told to " 'Go
      into all the world' " (Mark 16:15, NIV) and, like Paul, identify with
      the people with whom we come in contact (1 Cor 9:19-23).

Why did God intervene when, after the Flood, the inhabitants of the
      world decided to build an enormous fortress that would house
      them all? Gen. 11:4, 7.


         The descendants of Noah and his sons did not want to move away
      from where they lived. They wanted to stay together. If ever there was
      a group of people with a fortress mentality, we find them in Genesis
      11. But God intervened. He did not agree with this fortress mentality
      then, and He doesn't now.
        "Babel plays itself out over and over again in the lives of congre-
      gations. A new church is formed with excitement, energy and vision.
      As the years pass, however, the church functions less to introduce
      Jesus Christ to nonbelievers than to provide a safe, secure and famil-
      iar environment to those who already believe and belong."—Stephen
      A. Rhodes, Where the Nations Meet (Downers Grove, Ill.:
      InterVarsity Press, 1998), pp. 25, 26.

       Go back and read again John 17:15-17. How does that apply in
       your own personal situation? Are you really not "of the world"?
       If you answer Yes, what justification can you give for that
       answer? How can one be truly "not of this world"?

     "Religion in Overalls" (Matt. 25:31-46).
       The title of today's study is borrowed from that of a book by
     William G. Johnsson in which the author takes a close look at the
     meaning of the Gospel of Matthew. Johnsson writes:
       "In an age that proclaims on its T-shirts, 'Only Believe' and 'I love
     you!' . . . Matthew insists that practice balances one's profession, that
     faith and love put on overalls and get their hands dirty out where the
     people are—in jail, in the slums, in the poorhouse, in the charity
     ward."—William G. Johnsson, Religion in Overalls (Nashville, Tenn.:
     Southern Publishing Association, 1977), p. 22.

What are the following texts telling us about how we are to relate to
      the world around us?

      Matt. 25:31-46


      Luke 1:52, 53

        The question is not whether followers of Christ should focus on
      preaching or helping the needy. It is not a matter of either/or but of
      and/and. Christians share in the universal responsibility of helping fel-
      low human beings who face particular challenges: hunger, thirst, illit-
      eracy, poverty, poor health conditions, imprisonment, discrimination,
      etc. Christ is our role model. He ministered to all aspects of our human
      condition—the spiritual, as well as the emotional and the physical. The
      early church clearly did not forget its social responsibility, and neither
      should we. Community-service activities, religious-liberty advocacy,
      educational programs, prison ministries, and ADRA are just a few of
      the avenues through which we can minister to people.
        "Pure and undefiled religion is not a sentiment, but the doing of
      works of mercy and love."—Ellen G. White, Welfare Ministry, p. 38.
         Serving others in these capacities, however, demands self-denial,
      just as being a Christian does. Only as we learn to surrender and die
      at the foot of the Cross will we be in a position to minister to others
      in the same way that Christ did.

       What are you doing for the poor, the needy, and the afflicted in
       your community? If the next time you see some of them and
       think of Christ's words, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one
       of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (Matt.
       25:40), why wouldn't it be so easy just to walk away and ignore
       them?


                                                                           107

      The Power of Prayer
        Intercessory prayer is a reservoir of power that should be tapped to
      an even larger extent than it is today. Prayer for ourselves, for our own
      spiritual and material needs, is essential. But prayer for others—for
      the pastors, literature evangelists and missionaries, the church's
      administrators, for the leaders of our countries and, yes, for the
      world—should rank high on our list of priorities.

If someone were to ask you to compose a 30-second prayer for the
      world, what would you pray, and why?




         Praying for fellow human beings, pleading with God on behalf of
      others, is a duty and a privilege for every Christian. And, though we
      can never be sure when and in what manner God will answer our
      prayers, there is no doubt that they do have effect. The apostle James
      states it clearly: "The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effec-
      tive" (5:16, NIV).

There are countless examples in Scripture of men and women who
      prayed for others. Read the following texts: Gen. 20:7; Num. 11:1,
      2; 1 Sam. 12:19, 23; 1 Kings 13:6-9; Ps. 122:6; Matt. 5:44; Col. 1:9;
      1 Thess. 5:25; 2 Thess. 3:1. What do they tell us about the need to
      pray for others?




        "Our intercessory prayers express a sense of solidarity with other
      human beings. We are embedded in the great fabric of humanity. What
      happens to others inevitably involves us, and what we do affects them,
      too. Furthermore, God has ways of working in the world that we can-
      not understand."—Richard Rice, The Reign of God, p. 297.

       In your experience, what impact has prayer had in your own
       life? How has it changed you? How have your prayers, as far as
       you can tell, impacted others? What evidence, if any, do you
       have that prayer does make a difference?




108
             THURSDAY September 23


     The Cross and the World
        In Matthew 28:19, Jesus gives us our calling as a church. Notice it
     is a worldwide calling. We are to go to all nations with the message
     of salvation found in Jesus Christ. We see this same basic calling,
     only in a specific end-time context, in the first angel's message (Rev.
     14:6, 7).
        Thus, God's church is to impact the whole world. And that makes
     perfect sense, because Christ's mission was for the whole world.

Look up these texts. What are they all saying about the universality
     of what Christ has done at the Cross? Isa. 53:6, 2 Cor 5:19, Heb.
     2:9, I John 2:2, 4:14.




         The point is simple: Christ's death covered every human being who
      ever lived. It was complete for the whole world. Thus, the whole
      world needs to know about Jesus and what He has done for them.
         "But the atonement for a lost world was to be full, abundant, and
      complete. Christ's offering was exceedingly abundant to reach every
      soul that God had created. It could not be restricted so as not to
      exceed the number who would accept the great Gift. All men are not
      saved; yet the plan of redemption is not a waste because it does not
      accomplish all that its liberality has provided for. There must be
      enough and to spare."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, pp. 565,
      566.
         We can't be true followers of Christ unless we are, in whatever
      capacity, seeking to let the world know about what Christ has done for
      it. Thus, we must not flee the world but must engage the world and
      make a difference by the way we live and interact with people and by
      the way in which we respond to the needs of fellow human beings, far
      and near. This, more than any other way, will open people up to hear
      what we have to say about the God who not only has created all of us
      but who has paid for all our sins. Even those living in abject igno-
      rance of Christ have had their sins paid for at the Cross, just as much
      as ours were paid for there. Thus, these people need to know what we
      know; and how can they ever learn if we—who do know about the
      Cross—don't tell them? Hence, our mission to the world.

       Not everyone, of course, is in a position to minister directly to
       those in others lands. What, though, can you, either as an indi-
       vidual or through your church, do to have a part in our world-
       wide calling?

                                                                         109
                   FRIDAY September 24

Further Study: "The suffering and destitute of all classes are our
      neighbors, and when their wants are brought to our knowledge it is our
      duty to relieve them as far as possible. A principle is brought out in
      this parable [of the good Samaritan] that it would be well for the fol-
      lowers of Christ to adopt. First meet the temporal necessities of the
      needy and relieve their physical wants and sufferings, and you will
      then find an open avenue to the heart."—Ellen G. White, Welfare
      Ministry, p. 118.
        "Every provision has been made for the salvation of the fallen race.
      All power has been given to Him who offered himself as a sacrifice
      for the redemption of every son and daughter of Adam. 'As many as
      received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even
      to them that believe on His name.' "—Ellen G. White, Review and
      Herald, Jan. 7, 1902.

Discussion Questions:
    0 We are told we are "in the world" and that we must identify
       with those we want to reach. We must understand how they think
       and must speak their language. How are we able to do this with-
       out being impacted in a negative way by some of the negative
       things they do?

       CO However important it is to meet the temporal needs of those in
       the world, we must also remember that meeting the needs of the
       world isn't the end but a means to an end. What is that end? How
       can we avoid the danger of forgetting what our true purpose here
       is?

Summary: Though we are "not of the world," we should be very
      much "in the world," making a difference and giving a better taste to
      society. True Christianity is not just a matter of having correct doc-
      trine or calling people to a faith in God. It also is a ministry to the poor
      and disenfranchised. In addition, we have the responsibility of praying
      for others, in the church and out in the world. Christ's death covered
      the whole world; our ministry must, then, be just as inclusive.

Searching for
Meaning by N                       YAMDAVAA

   Nyamdavaa lives in Mongolia. He attended a military school, where he
learned that the strongest prevail. He worked hard to strengthen his body
and focus his mind.
   After completing his training in military school, he joined some friends
to start a small business. But his life was not going as he wished. One day
he realized that he felt empty, with no sense of purpose or meaning in life.
If there were no meaning to life, what was the difference? Why not just die?
   Nyamdavaa had read the Christian Bible occasionally, and he sensed
that it held the key to meaning in life. He began searching it for answers.
An Adventist friend invited Nyamdavaa to church, and he went. There he
found meaningful worship and a group of genuinely happy people.
   He ended his relationship with his old friends who seemed to want noth-
ing but to have a good time drinking. He no longer wanted to drink and
spent much time alone, studying the Bible. His family thought he was
crazy, for he spent all his time reading and praying. Often he did not eat;
food was not important when he was searching for God.
   At one point Nyamdavaa became sick. He was too weak to get out of
bed. For two weeks he remained in bed, praying and reading the Bible. His
prayer became, "Take my life, God, and use me for Your service. Just use
me." He regained his health and was baptized a few months later.
   Nyamdavaa was invited to study at the 1000 Missionary Movement in
the Philippines. During his three months there, he experienced several
miracles of protection and providence. One exercise required him to swim
across a river, but Nyamdavaa could not swim. He prayed for God's pro-
 tection as he jumped into the water. He felt a hand holding him up, and he
 made it across.
   He returned to Mongolia to start a new church in a large city in north-
 ern Mongolia. One Friday the apartment building in which he and his roo-
 mate lived had no water. On Sabbath the water returned only to their apart-
 ment. When his neighbors learned that they had water, they asked the two
 young men for some. This provided an excellent opportunity to meet their
 neighbors and share their faith and water with them.
    Nyamdavaa and his roomate invited young people to come to their
 apartment for Bible stories and songs. These children invited more chil-
 dren and their parents. Their group has grown, and in the first year in this
 city, 45 people were baptized.

NYAMDAVAA continues to work in this city, developing the interests they have found there.
He would like to become a trained pastor or Bible worker.

2004    Bible Study Guide                        for the Fourth Quarter

          One of the great purposes of the Bible is to show us not only what
       our ends are but how we can reach those ends. Next quarter's study
       of the book of Daniel, written by Gerhard Pfandl, fulfills a unique
       role in helping us do just that. In it are impressive prophecies that,
       perhaps better than anywhere else in Scripture, help establish a firm
       and rational foundation for our faith in the One who, through the
       work of Jesus Christ, has assured us our end: eternal life in a new cre-
       ation (Isa. 66:22).

Lesson 1: "To Eat or Not to Eat—That Is the Question"

       THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
       SUNDAY: A Tale of Two Cities: Babylon and Jerusalem (Dan. 1:1).
       MONDAY: The Innocent and the Guilty (Dan. 1:2-7).
       TUESDAY: Daniel's Determination (Dan. 1:8).
       WEDNESDAY: The Test (Dan. 1:9-16).
       THURSDAY: The Reward (Dan. 1:17-20).

       MEMORY TEXT: Psalm 119:105

       SABBATH GEMS: What do Babylon and Jerusalem symbolize?
       What caused the demise of Jerusalem? Why did innocent people have
       to suffer in the onslaught? Why didn't Daniel eat the king's food?

Lesson 2: Nebuchadnezzar's Image

       THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
       SUNDAY: Nebuchadnezzar's Dilemma (Dan. 2:1-13).
       MONDAY: Daniel's Prayer Meetings (Dan. 2:14-23).
       TUESDAY: Daniel's Testimony (Dan. 2:24-30).
       WEDNESDAY: The Image and Its Interpretation (Dan. 2:28-45).
       THURSDAY: Daniel's Promotion (Dan. 2:46).

       MEMORY TEXT: Daniel 2:21

       SABBATH GEM: Using around one hundred-eighty Hebrew
       words, Daniel describes the course of history in advance and thereby
       provides comfort to God's people. This gives us the assurance that
       when the great empires of the world have run their course, God's
       kingdom, an everlasting kingdom, will follow and remain forever.

                                    And if our religion is
                                    to have any meaning
                                    at all, the relationships
                                    we have with our
                                    spouses, parents,
neighbors, and even enemies must mean everything to
us. This book shows how our faith impacts our relation-
ship to others, and how we can strengthen, even restore,
those relationships if they have broken down.
   Several authors join forces to provide a view of the
family of God that is at once refreshing and shocking.
Going beyond ideology, they provide practical examples
of how to live as citizens of God's kingdom here on
planet Earth.
