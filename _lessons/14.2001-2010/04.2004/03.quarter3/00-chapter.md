    INTRODUCTION




Isaiah
"Comfort My People"
From the time they were first uttered, the words of the
prophet Isaiah have been etched, even imbedded, into our
consciousness. They are unforgettable words, heavy laden not
only with meaning but with hope and with promise, words
like "'God with us'" (Isa. 7:14, The Living Bible). "For unto us a child is
born" (Isa. 9:6), "Every valley shall be exalted" (Isa. 40:4), and "he was
wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chas-
tisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed"
 (Isa. 53:5).
    Words create pictures, images, echoes; weak, paltry words create weak,
paltry pictures; powerful, refined, well-crafted words create powerful,
refined images and loud, crisp echoes. This, of course, explains why Isaiah's
words speak so loudly, so crisply to us—even after 27 centuries.
    In his suffering-servant poem, for instance (Isa. 52:13-53:12), Isaiah
brings a picture of the Messiah into finer resolution than anyone else does in
the Old Testament. This section alone is enough to justify his sobriquet, "the
gospel prophet."
   Plus, his prediction of Cyrus, by name, a century and a half before the
Persian king conquered Babylon (Isa. 44:28-45:6), is so stunningly specific
that some scholars have attributed much of Isaiah to a later "second Isaiah,"
a hollow creation of those unable to see past the crusty intellectual confines
of human imagination.
   With a unique blend of vivid imagery, matchless poetic rhythm and bal-
ance, Beethovenlike dramatic contrasts, and a rich weave of profound themes
that recur in a sophisticated symphonic process of ongoing elaboration and
development, Isaiah's inspired book is a worthy literary vehicle for divine
thoughts that are higher than the mundane as the heavens are higher than the
earth (see Isa. 55:9). Even in translation, which loses the evocative word
plays and alliterations of the Hebrew, the book of Isaiah has few peers in the
history of literature, either secular or sacred.
   We know his words, so eloquent, so poetic, so emotive, and powerful, but
do we know the man Isaiah and the world in which he wrote, prayed, and
prophesied? As the cruel Assyrian Empire rose to its height of power, it was
a time of crushing peril. Even worse, the people of Judah, the chosen people,
were sinking ever deeper into moral weakness. Greed and misery fought in
the streets. In their struggle for wealth or survival, some puffed the narcotic
vapors of vain euphoria while others withered in despair. Seeking to preserve
his nation's identity by taking a remnant from a state of denial and anchor-
ing them in reality, Isaiah called upon his people to behold their God, the
Holy One of Israel, the Creator of heaven and earth, the One who knew them

2
by name and who promised to redeem them from fire, but only if they would
listen . . . and obey.
    Isaiah counseled kings. When the slender thread of God's remnant line was
confined to one city doomed by Assyrian legions, it was Isaiah's prophetic
words that strengthened King Hezekiah to look for the miracle that was
Jerusalem's only hope (Isaiah 36, 37). If Jerusalem had fallen then rather than
to the Babylonians a century later, the Assyrian policy of scattering con-
quered peoples could have vaporized the national identity of Judah. Thus,
there would have been no
Jewish people from whom the         Isaiah called upon his
Messiah, the Savior of the
world, would arise.                 people to behold their
    Isaiah's God said: "Comfort     God, the One who
ye my people" (Isa. 40:1), a
comfort that pierced through a      knew them by name.
gloomy valley of desperate,
deepening shadows to a brighter, gentler world. It contained a hope that kept
the community of faith alive through some painful, even potentially faith-
destroying, times and trials.
    This quarter, we take a look at Isaiah, at his words, his times, his predica-
 ments, but mostly at his God, the God who, back then as well as today, cries
out to us, "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name;
 thou art mine" (Isa. 43:1).
    What is the message of Isaiah? What did he write back then that speaks so
 powerfully to us today? What warnings does he offer, what promises does he
 make? And what does he tell us about our God that we, today—whoever we
 are and wherever we live—need so desperately to know?
     This quarter's Bible Study Guide was written by Dr. Roy Gane, a Hebrew
 scholar and a teacher of Old Testament studies at Andrews University
 Seminary, in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Roy brings to these lessons not only
 his linguistic and historical expertise but his obvious love of the Bible and
 (even more so) of the Lord whose Holy Spirit inspired its creation. It is our
 prayerful desire that, as you study these lessons, they will rekindle your pas-
 sion for the Lord. Dr. Gane's passion for the Lord will rekindle yours, as
 well. These words reveal to us the One who, back then and even now, pro-
 claims with the same longing desire, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people"
  (Isa. 40:1).

              ost in the land of forgetfulness. If you drive in Ireland along a

       L      narrow country lane lined with hedgerows, you may find the
              way blocked by a herd of cows, ambling home after a crunchy
      meal. Even if no herdsman is with them, they will go to their owner's
      barn. They will know where, and to whom, they belong.
         If a small boy in a store gets separated from his mother and yells,
      "I've lost my mommy!" he may not know exactly where he is, or
      where his mother is, but amid a sea of mothers walking through the
      store, he will know the one mother who, alone, is his.
         Sadly, unlike those Irish cows (much less the little lost boy), the
      Judeans forgot that they belonged to the Lord, their heavenly Parent,
      and thus lost their true identity as the covenant people. "I reared chil-
      dren and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox
      knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib; but Israel does not
      know, my people do not understand" (Isa. 1:2, 3, NRSV).
         This week we'll take a look at God's work to restore His people to
      Himself.

The Week at a Glance: What was the spiritual state of
      Judah at the time Isaiah was written? Can we truly worship the
      Lord if our hearts are not right with Him? How did the choices
      the Judeans faced parallel the choices we face today?

Memory Text: "Come now, let us argue it out, says the Lord:
      though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though
      they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool" (Isaiah
      1:18, NRSV).

               SUNDAY March 28


    Hear, 0 Heavens!                  (Isa. 1:1-9).

      The book of Isaiah briefly introduces itself by identifying the
    author ("son of Amoz"), the source of his message (a "vision"), and
    his topic (Judah and its capital, Jerusalem, during the reign of four
    kings). The topic also identifies Isaiah's primary audience as the peo-
    ple of his own country during the time in which he lived. The prophet
    spoke to them concerning their own condition and destiny.
      By mentioning the kings whose reigns span the period of his
    prophetic activity, Isaiah narrows down the audience and ties the book
    to the historical, political events of a certain period. This time frame
    directs us to the accounts of 2 Kings 15-20 and 2 Chronicles 26-32.

Read Isaiah 1:2. What is the essence of the message here? What is
    the Lord saying? How has this same idea been seen all through
    sacred history? Could it be said of the Christian church today, as
    well? Explain your answer.




      Notice how Isaiah's message begins with the words "Hear, 0 heav-
    ens, and listen, 0 earth" (NRSV; compare Deut. 30:19, 31:28). The
    Lord isn't implying that heaven and earth, themselves, can hear and
    understand. Instead, He uses this imagery for emphasis.
      When an ancient Near Eastern king, such as a Hittite emperor,
    made a political treaty with a lesser ruler, he invoked his gods as wit-
    nesses to emphasize that any violation of the agreement would surely
    be noticed and punished. However, when the divine King of kings
    made a covenant with the Israelites in the days of Moses, He did not
    refer to other gods as witnesses. As the only true God, He called,
    instead, for the heavens and earth to fulfill this role (see also Deut.
    4:26).

      Read carefully Isaiah 1:1-9. Summarize on the lines below what
      the sins of Judah were. Take special note, also, of the results of
      those sins. What was Judah guilty of, and what happened
      because of her guilt? At the same time, what hope is presented
      in verse 9?




                                                                           7

     Rotten Ritualism                 (Isa. 1:10-17).

Read Isaiah 1:10. Why do you think the imagery of Sodom and
     Gomorrah is used? What point was the Lord making?




Read Isaiah 1:11-15. What is the Lord telling the people there? Why
     did He reject the worship that His people were offering Him?




       The same hands that offered sacrifices and were lifted up in prayer
     were "full of blood"; that is, guilty of violence and oppression of oth-
     ers (Isa. 1:15; 58:3, 4). By mistreating other members of the covenant
     community, the people were showing contempt for the Protector of all
     Israelites. Sins against other people were sins against the Lord.
       Of course, God Himself had instituted the ritual worship system
     (Leviticus 1-16) and designated the Jerusalem temple as the appro-
     priate place for it (1 Kings 8:10, 11). But the rituals were intended to
     function within the context of the covenant God had made with His
     people. It was God's covenant with Israel that made it possible for
     Him to dwell among them at the sanctuary/temple. So, rituals and
     prayers performed there were valid only if they expressed faithfulness
     to Him and His covenant. People who offered sacrifices without
     repenting from unjust actions toward other members of the covenant
     community were performing ritual lies. Thus, their sacrifices were not
     only invalid—they were sins! Their ritual actions said they were loyal,
     but their behavior proved that they had broken the covenant.

      Read Isaiah 1:16, 17. What is the Lord commanding that His
      people do? How do these texts, in this context, parallel what
      Jesus said in Matthew 23:23-28? What message can we find for
      ourselves, today, in these texts and in the context in which they
      are given?

               TUESDAY March 30

      The Argument of Forgiveness (Isa. 1:18).
Read Isaiah 1:18 (in various translations, if possible). After going
      over it numerous times, write what you believe the Lord is saying
      here (read a few verses beyond it to get the whole context).




        God has stated powerful evidence that the Judeans, the accused,
      are guilty of breach of contract (vss. 2-15), and He has appealed to
      them to reform (vss. 16, 17). This appeal suggests there is hope. After
      all, why urge a criminal deserving execution to change his ways?
      How could a prisoner on death row "rescue the oppressed, defend the
      orphan, plead for the widow" (NRSV)? But when God says "Come
      now, let us argue it out" (vs. 18, NRSV), we can see the Lord still
      seeking to reason with His people, still seeking to get them to repent
      and turn from their evil ways, no matter how degenerate they had
      become.
         The Lord says to them that your red sins shall become white. Why
      are sins red? Because red is the color of the "blood" (bloodguilt) that
      covers the hands of the people (vs. 15). White obviously is the color
      of purity, the absence of bloodguilt. Here, God is offering to change
      them. This is the kind of language King David used when he cried out
      to God for forgiveness for his sin of taking Bathsheba and destroying
      her husband (read Ps. 51:7, 14). In Isaiah 1:18, God's argument is an
      offer to forgive His people!

HOw does God's offer of forgiveness serve as an argument for them
    to change their ways? Compare Isaiah 1:18 to Isaiah 44:22.


        Now we see the purpose of God's sharp words of warning against
      His people. They are not to reject His people but to bring them back
      to Him. His offer of forgiveness is the mighty argument supporting
      His appeal for the people to morally purify themselves (vss. 16,
      17). His forgiveness makes it possible for them to be transformed
      by His power. Here we see the seeds of the "new covenant," proph-
      esied in Jeremiah 31:31-34, in which forgiveness is the basis of a
      new-heart relationship with God. We start off "in the red," owing a
      debt we can never repay. From the humble position of acknowledg-
      ing our need for forgiveness, we are ready to accept everything God
      has to give.


                                                                            9
        WEDNESDAY March 31


     To Eat or Be Eaten                   (Isa. 1:19-31).

Read Isaiah 1:19-31. What theme appears here that is seen all
     through the Bible?




       Notice the logical structure in Isaiah 1:19, 20: If the people choose
     to be willing and obedient to God, they will eat the good of the land
     (vs. 19). By contrast, if they refuse His offer of forgiveness and
     restoration and rebel against Him, they will be eaten by the sword (vs.
     20). The choice is theirs. These verses, then, contain a conditional
     blessing and curse.
        Isaiah 1 reiterates and applies the words of Moses recorded in
     Deuteronomy 30:19 at the time when the covenant with the nation of
     Israel was set up: "I call heaven and earth to witness against you
     today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses"
     (NRSV).

Look at those words from Moses. Notice, there is no middle ground.
     It is either life or death, blessings or curses. Why do you think
     there is only one of two choices for us? Why can't there be some
     sort of compromise?


         These words of Moses summarize the series of warnings, blessings,
     and curses that concludes the formation of the covenant in
     Deuteronomy 27-30 (compare Leviticus 26). Elements of this covenant
     include (1) the recounting of what God had done for His people,
     (2) conditions/stipulations (commandments) to be observed in order for
     the covenant to be maintained, (3) reference to witnesses, and (4) bless-
     ings and curses to warn the people what would happen if they violated
     the covenant conditions.
       It has been shown that these elements appear in the same order in
     political treaties involving non-Israelite peoples, such as the
     Hittites. So, for establishing His covenant with the Israelites, God
     used a form they would understand and that would impress upon
     them as forcibly as possible the nature and consequences of the
     mutually binding relationship into which they were choosing to
     enter. The potential benefits of the covenant were staggering, but if
     Israel broke their agreement, they would be worse off than ever.

      How, in your own Christian walk, have you experienced the
      principle of blessings and curses as seen above?

     Ominous Love Song                     (Isa. 5:1-7).

Read the song in the above verses. What is the meaning of this
   parable?


        God explains the meaning of the parable only at the end, in verse 7.
     By using a parable, He helps the people to look at themselves objec-
     tively in order to admit their true condition. God effectively uses this
     approach with King David (compare 2 Sam. 12:1-13). By calling this
     a "love song:' God reveals at the outset His motive toward His people.
     His relationship with them originates from His character, which is love
     (1 John 4:8). He expects a response of love in return. But instead of
     "grapes," He gets "wild grapes," which means, in the Hebrew, "stink-
     ing things."

What does the Lord mean when He says in Isaiah 5:4, "What more
     was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?"
     (NRSV).


       God says in the next verses: "And now I will tell you what I will do
     to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I
     will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. I will make it
     a waste" (Isa. 5:5, 6, NRSV).
       When we sin, God immediately does not cut us off from Himself by
     removing His protection and destroying us. He patiently gives us an
     opportunity to receive forgiveness (compare 2 Pet. 3:9). He does not
     cut off anyone who responds to Him. He appeals as long as there is
     hope for a response. He immediately does not take No for an answer,
     because He knows we are ignorant and deceived by sin. But if He gets
     nowhere with us, He ultimately acknowledges our choice and lets us
     remain the way we have chosen to be (compare Rev. 22:11).
        If persistently we reject God's appeals through His Spirit, we can
     eventually pass the point of no return (Matt. 12:31, 32). Turning away
     from Christ is dangerous (Heb. 6:4-6). There is only so much God
     may do, because He respects our free choice.

      Take the concept found in Isaiah 5:4, "What more could have
      been done to my vineyard ...?" and look at that in light of the
      Cross, where God offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins,
      paying with His flesh for our violation of His law. What more
      could have been done for us than what was done there? How
      does dwelling on the Cross give us assurance of salvation and
      motivate us to repent and change our ways?


                                                                           11

Further Study: In the context of Isaiah 1:4, Ellen White wrote:
     "The professed people of God had separated from God, and had lost
     their wisdom and perverted their understanding. They could not see
     afar off; for they had forgotten that they had been purged from their
     old sins. They moved restlessly and uncertainly under darkness, seek-
     ing to obliterate from their minds the memory of the freedom, assur-
     ance, and happiness of their former estate. They plunged into all kinds
     of presumptuous, foolhardy madness, placed themselves in opposi-
     tion to the providences of God, and deepened the guilt that was
     already upon them. They listened to the charges of Satan against the
     divine character, and represented God as devoid of mercy and for-
     giveness."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1137.

Discussion Questions:
      O How can we wash ourselves? What does that phrase mean?
      (see Phil. 2:12, 13).

      O How did Jesus adapt, expand, and apply the love song of the
      vineyard? Matt. 21:33-45, Mark 12:1-12, Luke 20:9-19. What les-
      sons are in there for us as Seventh-day Adventists?

      • What is the relationship between the forgiveness God offers
      and the transformation He accomplishes in our lives? Which
      comes first, transformation and then forgiveness—or forgiveness
      and then transformation? And why is it important to know which
      comes first?

      O In the Ellen White quote above, she says people placed them-
      selves in opposition to "the providences of God." What does that
      mean?

Summary: When God's people forget Him and take His blessings for
     granted, He reminds them they are accountable to their covenant with
     Him. Mercifully, He points out their condition, warns them about the
     destructive consequences of abandoning His protection, and urges
     them to allow Him to heal and cleanse them.

God's Power Is Greater
RAVEL ONATOANDRO

   The old man eyed his visitor doubtfully. "It's true," the younger man
said. "I heard the preacher say it myself. He said that God is more power-
ful than your spirit."
   Ravel sat thinking for a long time after his visitor had left. He had inher-
ited a familiar spirit from his father, who was a witch doctor. Ravel could
summon people to come to him without speaking a word. And if someone
was coming to him whom he did not want to see, he could hold out his
stick and force a person to turn away, even if the person was still a mile or
more away. Ravel never used his powers to hurt anyone; he thought his
powers were from God.
   But when the young man told him that the Adventist preacher said his
powers were from the devil, Ravel decided to attend the preacher's meet-
ings and learn for himself where his powers came from.
   Ravel attended every meeting and talked to the pastor about the previ-
ous night's sermon. Soon Ravel was convinced that his power was not
from God, but from the devil. He invited the pastor to come to his house
and burn his fetishes. The powers Ravel had used were strong, but he knew
that God was stronger. He prayed that God would overpower the demons
and send them away, then invited the Holy Spirit to enter his home and
bless him.
   Word spread quickly throughout the area that Ravel had given up his
fetishes and become an Adventist. He had served the spirits for more than
50 years, but from that day on, he determined to serve only God. "I want
to make up for the time I lived in darkness," Ravel said simply. The testi-
mony of this illiterate, former witch doctor has been a powerful influence
 in the village where he lives. When Ravel first attended the evangelistic
                              meetings, there were no Adventists in his vil-
                              lage. Today there are about thirty-five mem-
                              bers in the church. Ravel prays that God will
                              use the time he has left to lead others out of
                              darkness and into God's bright and powerful
                              light.

      Crisis of
      Leadership



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

                  hen asked by one of his disciples about the ingredients of good

      W           government, Confucius answered: " 'Sufficient food, suffi-
                  cient weapons, and the confidence of the common people.'
         " 'But,' asked the disciple, 'suppose you had no choice but to dis-
      pense with one of those three, which would you forego?'
         " 'Weapons,' said Confucius.
         "His disciple persisted: 'Suppose you were then forced to dispense
      with one of the two that are left, which would you forego?'
         "Replied Confucius, 'Food. For from of old, hunger has been the lot
      of all men, but a people that no longer trusts its rulers is lost indeed.' "

         People do, indeed, want strong, trustworthy leadership. When a
      soldier signed up for a second term of duty, he was asked why. "I
      tried civilian life," he said, "but nobody is in charge out there." This
      week we will look at Judah's crisis of leadership and the sad results
      that followed.

The Week at a Glance: What spiritual dangers come
      with success? What prepared Isaiah for his ministry? How do we
      understand the idea that God "hardens" people's hearts?

Memory Text: "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the
      Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe
      filled the temple" (Isaiah 6:1, NRSV).

                SUNDAY April 4


     The King Is Dead. Long Live the King!
Isaiah 6:1 talks about the death of King Uzziah. Read 2 Chronicles
     26 and then answer this question: What is the significance of King
     Uzziah's death?


        Different perspectives can be given regarding the death of this king.
        1.Although Uzziah's reign was long and prosperous, "when he had
     become strong he grew proud, to his destruction" and attempted to
     offer incense in the temple (2 Chron. 26:16, NRSV). When the priests
     rightly stopped him because he was not authorized as a priestly
     descendant of Aaron (vs. 18), the king became angry. At this moment,
     when the king refused reproof, the Lord immediately struck him with
     leprosy, which he had "to the day of his death, and being leprous lived
     in a separate house, for he was excluded from the house of the Lord"
     (vs. 21, NRSV). How ironic that Isaiah saw a vision of the pure,
     immortal, divine King in His house/temple in the very year the
     impure human king died.
        2. There is a striking contrast between Uzziah and Isaiah. Uzziah
     reached for holiness presumptuously, for the wrong reason (pride),
     and, instead, became ritually impure so that he was cut off from holi-
     ness. Isaiah, on the other hand, allowed God's holiness to reach him.
     He humbly admitted his weakness and yearned for moral purity,
     which he received (Isa. 6:5-7, NRSV). Like the tax collector in Jesus'
     parable, he went away justified: " Tor all who exalt themselves will
     be humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted' " (Luke
     18:14, NRSV).
        3. There is a striking similarity between Uzziah's leprous body and
     the moral condition of his people: " . . . there is no soundness in it,
     but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds" (Isa. 1:6, NRSV).
        4. The death of Uzziah in about 740 B.C. marks a major crisis in the
      leadership of God's people. The death of any absolute ruler makes the
      country vulnerable during a transition of power. But Judah was in spe-
      cial danger, because Tiglath-pileser III had ascended the throne of
      Assyria a few years before, in 745 B.c., and immediately went on a
      warpath that made his nation an invincible superpower and threatened
      the independent existence of all nations in the Near East. In this time
      of crisis, God encouraged Isaiah by showing the prophet He was still
      in control.

       Read carefully 2 Chronicles 26:16. In what ways does each one
       of us face that potential for the same thing? How can reflecting
       upon the Cross protect us from that pitfall?



                                                                          15
                MONDAY April 5


     "Holy, Holy, Holy" (Isa. 6:1-4).
        Notice what was happening here in the first four verses of Isaiah 6.
     The king dies during great political turmoil (the Assyrians are on the
     warpath); it could have been, for Isaiah, a fearful time when he was
     not sure who was in control.
        And then—what happens? While taken in vision, Isaiah gazes upon
     the blazing glory of God upon His throne, hears the antiphony of
     shining seraphim ("burning ones") calling out the words "holy, holy,
     holy," feels the resultant seismic shaking of the floor beneath him, and
     peers through swirling smoke as it fills the temple. It must have been
     a stunning experience for the prophet. Surely Isaiah now knows who
     is in control, despite outward events.

Where is the Lord in this vision (see Isa. 6:1)? Why would the Lord
     make an appearance to Isaiah here, as opposed to anywhere else?
     See Exod. 25:8, 40:34-38.




        In Ezekiel 1; Daniel 7:9, 10; Revelation 4-5; the prophets Ezekiel,
     Daniel, and John are in exile when they receive their visions. Like
     Isaiah, they need special comfort and encouragement that God is still
     in charge, as their world is falling apart (Daniel and Ezekiel are cap-
     tives in a pagan nation that had destroyed their own, and John is exiled
     to a lonely island by a hostile political power). No doubt, these visions
     helped give them what they needed in order to stay faithful, even dur-
     ing a crisis situation.
        John's description of God's temple in heaven is especially close to
     what Isaiah saw. See Revelation 4:8, where four living creatures, each
     of which has six wings, also sing "Holy, holy, holy" (compare Isa.
     6:2, 3).
        The transcendent holiness of God, emphasized in Isaiah's vision, is
     a basic aspect of his message. God is a holy God, and He demands
     holiness from His people, a holiness He will give to them if only they
     would repent, turn from their evil ways, and submit to Him in faith
     and in obedience.

       All of us have been in discouraging situations, where from out-
      ward appearances all seemed lost. Even if you didn't get a
      vision of the "glory of the Lord," as did Isaiah, recount the ways
      in which the Lord was able to sustain you and your faith dur-
      ing this crisis. What have you learned from these experiences
      that you could share with others?

               TUESDAY April 6


     New Personality                (Isa. 6:5-7).

       At the sanctuary/temple, only the high priest could approach the
     presence of God in the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement and
     with a protective smokescreen of incense, or he would die (Lev. 16:2,
     12, 13). Isaiah saw the Lord, even though he was not the high priest,
     and, unlike Uzziah, he was not burning incense! The temple filled
     with smoke (Isa. 6:4), reminding us of the cloud in which God's glory
     appeared on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:2). Awestruck and think-
     ing he was finished (compare Exod. 33:20; Judg. 6:22, 23), Isaiah
     cried out with an acknowledgment of his sin and the sin of his people
     (Isa. 6:5), reminiscent of the high priest's confession on the Day of
     Atonement (Lev. 16:21). Having experienced the worship of God
     from the lips of heavenly beings, Isaiah realized the inadequacy of
     worship offered by the lips of mortal, faulty human beings.

Why did the seraph use a live, or burning, coal from the altar to
     cleanse Isaiah's lips? Isa 6:6, 7.


        The seraph explained that through touching the prophet's lips his
     guilt and sin were removed (vs. 7). The sin is not specified, but it need
     not be limited to wrong speech, because lips signify not only speech
     but also the entire person who utters it. Having received moral purifi-
     cation, Isaiah was now able to offer pure praise to God.
        Fire is an agent of purification, because it burns away impurity
     (compare Num. 31:23). But the seraph used a coal from the special,
     holy fire of the altar, which God Himself had lighted and which was
     kept perpetually burning there (Lev. 6:12). So, the seraph made Isaiah
     holy, as well as pure. There is more. In worship at the sanctuary, or
     temple, the main reason for taking a coal from the altar was to light
     incense. Compare Leviticus 16:12, 13, where the high priest is to take
     a censer full of coals from the altar and use it to light incense. But in
     Isaiah 6, the seraph applies the coal to Isaiah, rather than to incense.
     Whereas Uzziah wanted to offer incense, Isaiah became like incense!
     Just as holy fire lights incense to fill God's house with holy fragrance,
     it lights up the prophet to spread a holy message. It is no accident that
     in the next verses of Isaiah 6 (vss. 8 and following), God sends Isaiah
     out to His people.

       Read prayerfully Isaiah's response (vs. 5) to his vision of God.
       How do we see in it an expression of the basic problem of a
       sinful people existing in a universe created by a " 'Holy, holy,
       holy' " (vs. 3, NRSV) God? Why was Christ on the cross the
       only possible answer to this problem? What happened at the
       Cross that solved this problem?

                                                                           17
         WEDNESDAY April 7


      Royal Commission                    (Isa. 6:8).

"Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and
      who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me" (Isa. 6:8).

        Having been purified, Isaiah immediately responded to God's call
     for a representative whom He could send out on His behalf. In New
     Testament terms, Isaiah would have been called an apostle; that is, one
     who is sent.
        Interestingly enough, the book of Isaiah does not begin, as do some
     other prophetic books, with the prophet describing his prophetic call
     (compare Jer 1:4-10, Ezekiel 1-3). In other words, he must have
     already been called to be a prophet, even before the events of chapter
     6. The Bible does show that a divine encounter can encourage a
     prophet even after the ministry began (Moses: Exodus 34; Elijah:
     1 Kings 19). In contrast to other examples, too, God tells people they
     are to be prophets; in Isaiah 6, the prophet volunteers for a special
     mission. It appears that chapters 1-5 of Isaiah represent conditions at
     the time when Isaiah was first called, after which God jump-started
     his ministry by encouraging him at the temple and reconfirming his
     commission as God's prophetic spokesman.

God encouraged Isaiah at His temple. Is there evidence elsewhere in
     the Bible that God's sanctuary is a place of encouragement?
     Psalm 73 (see vs. 17), Heb. 4:14-16, 10:19-23, Revelation 5. What
     do these texts tell us?



       Not only does God's sanctuary throb with awesome power; it is a
     place where weak and faulty people such as ourselves can find refuge.
     We can be reassured by knowing that God is working to rescue us
     through Christ, our High Priest.
       John also saw Christ represented as a sacrificial lamb that had just
     been slaughtered, its throat slit (Rev. 5:6). This was not a pretty sight.
     The description makes the point that although Christ was raised from
     the dead and has ascended to heaven, He continually carries the Cross
     event with Him. He is still lifted up in order to draw all people to
     Himself at His altar.

      How have you found encouragement by entering God's heavenly
      temple, by faith, in prayer? Hebrews 4:16 invites you to boldly
      approach God's throne to "receive mercy and find grace to help
      in time of need" (NRSV). If someone were to ask you how you
      have found grace and mercy in your time of need, what would
      your response be?

             THURSDAY April 8


     Appalling Appeal                  (Isa. 6:9-13).

When God recommissioned Isaiah, why did He give the prophet such
     a strange message to take to His people (Isa. 6:9, 10)?


       God does not want any to perish (2 Pet. 3:9), which explains why
     He sent Isaiah to the people of Judah—and Jesus to the world. God's
     desire is not to destroy but to save eternally. But while some people
     respond positively to His appeals, others become firmer in their
     resistance. Nevertheless, God keeps on appealing to them in order to
     give them more and more opportunities to repent. Yet, the more they
     resist, the harder they become. So in that sense, what God does to
     them results in the hardening of their hearts, even though He would
     rather that these actions soften them. God's love toward us is unchang-
     ing; our individual response to His love is the crucial variable.
       The role of a minister, such as Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or
     even Christ, is to keep on appealing, even if people reject the mes-
     sage. God said to Ezekiel: "Whether they hear or refuse to hear (for
     they are a rebellious house), they shall know that there has been a
     prophet among them" (Ezek. 2:5, NRSV). God's role and that of His
     servants is to give people a fair choice, so that they will have adequate
     warning (compare Ezek. 3:16-21), even if they end up choosing
     destruction and exile (Isa. 6:11-13).

With these ideas in mind, how do we understand God's role in hard-
      ening Pharaoh's heart?


        In Exodus 4:21, God says, " 'but I will harden his heart' " (NRSV).
      This is the first of nine times in which God said He would harden
      Pharaoh's heart. But there were also nine times when Pharaoh hard-
      ened his own heart (for example, see Exod. 8:15, 32; 9:34).
        Clearly Pharaoh possessed some kind of free will, or he would not
      have been able to harden his own heart. But the fact that God also hard-
      ened Pharaoh's heart indicates that God initiated the circumstances to
      which Pharaoh reacted when he made his choices, choices to reject the
      signs God had given him. Had Pharaoh been open to those signs, his
      heart would have been softened, not hardened, by them.

       Have you, in your own experience with the Lord, ever felt a
       hardening of your heart to the Holy Spirit? Think through what
       caused it. If you didn't find that concept frightening then (after
       all, that's part of what having a hard heart is all about), how do
       you view it now? What is the way of escape? See 1 Cor 10:13.


                                                                           19
                   FRIDAY April 9

Further Study: "Iniquitous practices had become so prevalent
      among all classes that the few who remained true to God were often
      tempted to lose heart and to give way to discouragement and despair.
      It seemed as if God's purpose for Israel were about to fail and that the
      rebellious nation was to suffer a fate similar to that of Sodom and
      Gomorrah.
         "In the face of such conditions it is not surprising that when, dur-
      ing the last year of Uzziah's reign, Isaiah was called to bear to Judah
      God's messages of warning and reproof, he shrank from the responsi-
      bility. He well knew that he would encounter obstinate resistance. As
      he realized his own inability to meet the situation and thought of the
      stubbornness and unbelief of the people for whom he was to labor, his
      task seemed hopeless. Should he in despair relinquish his mission and
      leave Judah undisturbed to their idolatry? Were the gods of Nineveh
      to rule the earth in defiance of the God of heaven?"—Ellen G. White,
      Prophets and Kings, pp. 306, 307.

Discussion Questions:
    0 If a skeptic or an atheist were to challenge you with the ques-
       tion, "How can you show that your God is in charge?" what
       would you answer?

       • If God is in charge, why do innocent people suffer? Does
       Isaiah 1:19, 20 mean that in the present life only good things are
       supposed to happen to God's faithful people and only bad things
       happen to those who rebel? Compare Job 1, 2; Psalm 37; Psalm
       73. Can we reconcile our understanding of God's character with
       the bad that happens to people? Do we need to?

       • In Isaiah 6, why are there so many connections to the Day of
       Atonement? Consider the fact that on this yearly judgment day,
       God purified His people by cleansing sin from loyal ones (Lev.
       16:30) and purging out the disloyal (Lev. 23:29, 30).

Summary: At a time of national insecurity, when the weakness of
     human leadership was painfully obvious, Isaiah was given a grand
     vision of the supreme Leader of the universe. Petrified by inadequacy
     but purified and empowered by mercy, Isaiah was ready to go forth as
     God's ambassador into a hostile world.

New Life
for Starlight
  J. H. ZACHARY


   The vast American Southwest desert stretches stark and beautiful to the
horizon. Hidden among the desert foliage stand the homes of Native
Americans. The troubles that plague these families are as powerful as the
rocky buttes that shadow their dwellings—alcoholism, poverty, prison.
   The smile on *Starlight's face barely masked the sorrow that lay just
below the surface, boiling forth in frustrated and uncontrolled anger that
got her into trouble at school. When other children experimented with
drugs, Starlight joined them. She had stepped onto a path that spiraled
downward into a life of despair and failure. But her concerned parents
learned about Holbrook Indian School in Arizona and determined to find
a way to send her there. Starlight arrived at the school carrying a small
parcel of clothes and heavy emotional baggage.
   She arrived at Holbrook without a knowledge of Jesus, but God began
to work in her life immediately.
   "I have learned a lot here," she says. "I learned that Satan is controlling
my life when I do bad things. Sin is all the bad things we do—things that
Satan wants us to do. Even stealing a little piece of candy is a sin. If I
know that what I am tempted to do is bad, that is guilt, and guilt is a sign
from God that He doesn't want me to do it.
   "At my other school I used to get into trouble a lot, but I can see how I
have changed since I came to Holbrook. I like Bible class, and I think that
it is the most important class.
   "Here at Holbrook, I have learned how to pray. I never thought I woald
become a Christian, but I have accepted Jesus as my personal Savior. I
 don't use bad words anymore, and I don't talk back to teachers. I used to
 do drugs too, but not anymore. God made all this happen with His won-
 derful power over Satan. He has mighty power!"
    Starlight has made the most important decision of her life at
 Holbrook—to follow Jesus. Holbrook Indian School has many challenges,
 but Starlight's testimony, along with those of other students, fills the staff
 with courage to continue working to rescue these children from destruc-
 tion at the hands of Satan.

      When Your World Is
      Falling Apart



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

              ne Sabbath, Connie and Roy drove into their driveway after

      O       church. A bantam hen flew frantically across the yard in front
              of them. Something was wrong. The pet birds were supposed
      to be safely in their pen but had gotten out. Quick investigation
      showed a tragedy in progress. Beethoven, the neighbor's small dog,
      also had escaped her yard and was down by the pond with Daisy in her
      mouth. Daisy was a beautiful laying hen with fluffy white tail feath-
      ers. Connie rescued Daisy, but it was too late. Her precious pet, now
      with a mangled neck, soon died in Connie's arms. She sat down in the
      yard, holding the dead bird, and wailed.
         Another pet was deeply disturbed. A tall, white duck by the name of
      Waddlesworth saw Connie holding Daisy and seemed to have
      assumed she had killed her. So, for the next few weeks, whenever
      Waddlesworth saw Connie, he would viciously attack her, pinching
      her painfully with his strong bill. Sometimes it is hard to sort out who
      your friends and enemies are.
         This week we'll look at a king of Judah who also had this problem
      as we seek to understand why he made the wrong choices he did.

The Week at a Glance: What threats was Judah facing,
      and why? How did King Ahaz respond to those threats, and why?
      What great thing did the Lord promise to do for him, if only he
      would show faith? What does it mean that "God is with us"?

Memory Text: "If you do not stand firm in faith, you shall not
      stand at all" (Isaiah 7:9, NRSV).

      Danger From the North                        Usu. 7:1-9).

What terrifying crisis did King Ahaz face early in his reign? 2 Kings
      15:37, 38; 16:5, 6; Isa. 7:1, 2.




         The kingdoms of northern Israel (Ephraim) and Syria (Aram)
      ganged up on the smaller country of Judah, to the south. This hap-
      pened when Judah was weakened by attacks from the Edomites and
      Philistines. In the past, Judah had fought with Israel, but an alliance
      between Israel and Syria was an overwhelming peril. It appears Israel
      and Syria wanted to force Judah to participate with them in a coali-
      tion against the mighty power of Tiglath-pileser III, of Assyria (called
      "Pul" in 2 Kings 15:19), who continued to threaten them with his
      expanding empire. Israel and Syria had put aside their longstanding
      struggle against each other in view of a greater danger. If they could
      conquer Judah and install a puppet ruler there (Isa. 7:5, 6), they could
      use its resources and manpower.

What was Ahaz's solution when his world was falling apart? 2 Kings
      16:7-9, 2 Chron. 28:16.




         Rather than recognize that God was the only Friend who could res-
      cue him and his country, Ahaz tried to make a friend out of Tiglath-
      pileser III, the enemy of his enemies. The Assyrian king happily com-
      plied with his request for aid against Syria and Israel. Not only did
      Tiglath-pileser receive a rich bribe from Ahaz, he also gained a good
      excuse to take Syria, which he promptly did (2 Kings 16:9). The
      power of the Syrian-Israelite alliance was broken. In the short run, it
      appeared that Ahaz had saved Judah.
         This action on Ahaz's part, however, should not come as a surprise.
      He had been one of the worst kings Judah had up to that point. (See
      2 Kings 16:3, 4; 2 Chron. 28:2-4.)

       When we read about what Ahaz was like, it is understandable
       why he reacted to danger as he did. What lesson is here for us
       on a personal level? If we're not obeying the Lord now, what
       makes us think we'll have the faith to trust Him when real tri-
       als come? (See James 2:22, Jer. 12:5.)

                                                                            23
               MONDAY April 12


      Attempted Interception                     (Isa. 7:3-9).

       While Ahaz was weighing his political options to meet the threat
     from Israel and Syria, God knew some things he did not. For one
     thing, it was God who had allowed trouble to come upon him in order
     to discipline him and bring him to his senses (2 Chron. 28:5, 19).
     Moreover, although appealing to Tiglath-pileser for help seemed log-
     ical and attractive from a human standpoint, God knew it would bring
     the Davidic kingdom of Judah under foreign control from which she
     could never recover.
       The stakes were staggeringly high. So the Lord sent Isaiah to inter-
     cept the king (apparently as he was inspecting Jerusalem's water sup-
     ply in preparation for a siege) in order to dissuade him from contact-
     ing the Assyrian leader.

Why did the Lord tell Isaiah to take his son, Shear-jashub, with him
     (Isa. 7:3)?


        Ahaz would be startled when Isaiah greeted him and introduced his
     son, named "A Remnant Shall Return." Remnant of whom? Shall
     return from what? Because the boy's father was a prophet, the name
     sounded like an ominous message from God about people going into
     captivity. Or was it about returning to God in the sense of repenting
     (the verb "return" also carries the meaning of repentance)? The mes-
     sage from God to Ahaz was: It means what you make it mean! Turn
     from your sins or go into captivity, and from captivity a remnant will
     return. The decision is yours!

HOw did God's message address the king's situation? Vss. 4-9.


        The threat from Syria and Israel would pass and Judah would be
     spared. Powers that looked to Ahaz like huge, fiery volcanoes were in
     God's sight only "two smoldering stumps of firebrands" (vs. 4,
     NRSV). There was no need for Ahaz to appeal to Assyria for help.
        But in order to make the right decision, Ahaz needed to trust the
     Lord and His promises. He needed to believe in order to be estab-
     lished (vs. 9). The words for "believe" and "be established" are from
     the same Hebrew root, from which come also the word for "truth"
     (that which is reliable) and the word "Amen" (affirming that which is
     true/reliable). Ahaz needed to be sure in order to be made sure; he
     needed to rely in order to be reliable.

      Look at that last section of Isaiah 7:9. Why are faith and belief
      so important in order to be "established"? Established in what?

                TUESDAY April 13


     Another Chance                  (Isa. 7:10-13).

       Ahaz did not respond to Isaiah's call for faith. So, God mercifully
     gave the king another chance, telling him to ask for a sign that was
     "deep as Sheol or high as heaven" (vs. 11, NRSV). Here is one of the
     greatest invitations to faith ever given to a human being. Unlike lot-
     teries or sweepstakes, this invitation did not carry restrictions in fine
     print. God did not even limit His offer to the half of His kingdom as
     human rulers did when their subjects reached the upper limit of their
     generosity (compare Esther 5:6, 7:2, Mark 6:23). He stood ready to
     empty all heaven and earth for a wicked king if only he would believe!
     Ahaz could have asked for a mountain of gold, as a sign, or soldiers
     as numerous as grains of sand by the Mediterranean.

Why did Ahaz respond in the way he did (vs. 12)?

       At first glance, Ahaz's answer seems pious and respectful. He
     would not put God to the test, as the Israelites had centuries before,
     during their wilderness wanderings (Exod. 17:2, Deut. 6:16). But the
     difference was that God invited the king to put Him to the test (com-
     pare Mal. 3:10). To take Him up on His overwhelmingly generous gift
     would please Him, not test His patience. But Ahaz was not even will-
     ing to allow God to help him to believe. He barred and bolted the door
     of his heart to shut out faith.

Read Isaiah 7:13. What is Isaiah saying here?

         Isaiah pointed out that by refusing to put God to the test, outwardly
      to avoid wearying God, he, in fact, wearied God. But the most trou-
      bling aspect of this verse is the fact that here Isaiah refers to "my
      God," by clear contrast to verse 11, where earlier the prophet asked
      the king to ask a sign of the Lord "your God." When Ahaz refused the
      divine offer, he rejected the Lord from being his God. The Lord was
      the God of Isaiah, but not of Ahaz.

       What does this day's study teach us about God's forbearance
       and willingness to bring all of us to salvation? What also does it
       tell us about the blindness and hardness of the human heart
       when not surrendered completely to the Lord? In the end, even
       if God had given Ahaz any sign that he had wanted, do you
       think Ahaz still would have believed? Explain your answer.




                                                                            25
         WEDNESDAY April 14


     Sign of a Son             (Isa. 7:14).

       An offer of a sign as "deep as Sheol or high as heaven" (vs. 11,
     NRSV) did not move Ahaz. So, when God says He Himself will come
     up with a sign (vs. 14), we expect it to have breathtaking dimensions
     that only the divine imagination could devise (compare Isa. 55:9,
     1 Cor 2:9).
        Surprise! The sign is a son. But how could a young woman bearing
     a child and calling him "Immanuel" be a sign of biblical proportions?

Who is the woman, and who is her Child?

       Nowhere does the Old Testament point out a fulfillment of this
     important sign, as it had done for the signs given to other people, such
     as Gideon (Judg. 6:36-40). So, here are some of the possible fulfill-
     ments, based on the Old Testament alone:
       1. Because the word for "young woman" refers to a young woman
     of marriageable age, many assume she is a married woman living in
     Jerusalem, perhaps the wife of Isaiah. Isaiah 8:3 does record the birth
     of a son to Isaiah by "the prophetess" (referring to his wife, whose
     prophetic messages consisted, at least, of her children; compare Isa.
     7:3, 8:18). However, her son was named Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Isa.
     8:1-4), not Immanuel. Nevertheless, the signs of the two boys are
     similar in that before they reach the stage at which they can choose
     good or evil, Syria and northern Israel would be devastated (Isa.
     7:16, 8: 4).
       2. Some suggest that Immanuel is Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, the next
     king. But nowhere is the name Immanuel applied to him.
       3. Because Immanuel is somewhat mysterious and his name, com-
     monly translated "God with us" refers to God's presence, He could be
     the same as the special Son prophesied in Isaiah 9 and 11. If so, His
     exalted description as divine (Isa. 9:6) and "the root of Jesse" (11:10,
     NRSV) surpasses anything ascribed to good King Hezekiah.
       4. A natural birth for an unmarried woman of marriageable age
     would result in an illegitimate child through promiscuity (see Deut.
     22:20, 21). Why would such a child be a sign to inspire faith?
       In contrast, the New Testament identifies Jesus as Immanuel (Matt.
     1:21-23), born miraculously and with purity to an unmarried but
     betrothed virgin. "When the fullness of time had come, God sent his
     Son, born of a woman" (Gal. 4:4, NRSV), to give us the presence of
     God with us.

      Dwell on the reality of Christ's coming into humanity. What
      kind of comfort can that reality give us amid what seems like a
      cold, fearsome, and uncaring world?
26
            THURSDAY April 15


     "God Is with Us"!                 (Isa. 7:14).

       Like the name of Isaiah's children (Shear-jashub, "a remnant shall
     return," and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, which means "swift is booty,
     speedy is prey"), the name of Immanuel has a meaning. It is literally
     "with us God." But the commonly accepted translation "God with us"
     misses something important. As with other Hebrew names of this
     kind that lack verbs, the verb "to be" must be supplied, because it is
     not expressed in Hebrew. So, Immanuel must be translated "God is
     with us" (compare the same words in Isa. 8:10) just as the name
     "Jesus" (Greek, and short for Hebrew Yehoshua, or Joshua) means
     "The Lord is salvation," with the verb again being supplied (compare
     Isaiah, which means, "salvation of the Lord").
       But the name "Immanuel" is not just an abstract description; it is an
     assertion of a promise that is fulfilled now: "God is with us"!

What is the significance of the promise that God is with us?


       There is no stronger assurance and comfort. "God does not prom-
     ise that His people will not endure hardship and pain, but He prom-
     ises to be with them. The psalmist says: 'Even though I walk through
     the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me; your rod and
     your staff—they comfort me' (Ps. 23:4).
       "God says: 'When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
     and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk
     through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume
     you' (Isa. 43:2). Where was the Lord when the Babylonians threw
     Daniel's three friends into the fire? With them (Dan. 3:23-25). And
     where was the Lord during the time of Jacob's trouble when he wres-
     tled until daybreak? In Jacob's arms, as close as he could get (Gen.
     32:24-30).
        "Even when the Lord does not appear in physical form on earth, He
     goes through the experiences of His people with them. Where was the
     Lord when the mob condemned Stephen? 'Standing at the right hand
     of God' (Acts 7:55). But when Jesus ascended to heaven, He 'sat
     down at the right hand of the Majesty on high' (Heb. 1:3). Why did
      He stand when Stephen was in trouble, about to be stoned to death?
      As Morris Venden has said, 'Jesus wasn't going to take that sitting
      down!' "—Roy Gane, God's Faulty Heroes (Hagerstown, Md.:
      Review and Heralds' Pub. Assn., 1996), p. 66.

       Even though we have the promise that "God is with us," what
       difference does that make if we still face terrible trials and suf-
       fering? What good does the knowledge of His presence, then, do
       for us? Explain your answer.

                                                                         27
                   FRIDAY April 16

Further Study: " 'His name shall be called Immanuel, . . . 'God
      with us.' The light of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen 'in
      the face of Jesus Christ.' From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus
      Christ was one with the Father; He was 'the image of God,' the image
      of His greatness and majesty, 'the outshining of His glory.' It was to
      manifest this glory that He came to our world. To this sin-darkened
      earth He came to reveal the light of God's love,—to be 'God with us.'
      Therefore it was prophesied of Him, 'His name shall be called
      Immanuel.' "—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 19.
        "Well would it have been for the kingdom of Judah had Ahaz
      received this message as from heaven. But choosing to lean on the
      arm of flesh, he sought help from the heathen. In desperation he sent
      word to Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria: 'I am thy servant and thy son:
      come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of
      the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.' 2 Kings 16:7.
      The request was accompanied by a rich present from the king's treas-
      ure and from the temple storehouse."—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
      Kings, p. 329.

Discussion Questions:
    0 When you are in the process of making a decision, is it appro-
       priate to ask God for a sign? What dangers are possibly inherent
       in doing something like that?

       0 It is good to have human assistance, but how do you recognize
       its limits?

       0 Russian author Leo Tolstoy once wrote to a friend that "Once
       a man has realized that death is the end of everything, then there
       is nothing worse than life either." How does our knowledge that
       "God is with us" answer such a statement?

Summary: God brought faithless King Ahaz to circumstances in
      which he had to make a difficult decision: To believe or not to believe,
      this is the question. Even though the Lord offered him any sign that
      his imagination could devise, Ahaz even refused to allow God to
      demonstrate a reason why he should believe. As his "friend," he chose
      instead the king of Assyria.

A Difficult Life
HANNAH Z

   Nine-year-old Prakash lay shivering and helpless on his sleeping mat.
Silent tears traced patterns on his sallow cheeks. At last he burst out, "Ama
[Mama], help me!"
   His mother rose slowly from her own mat and crept silently through the
darkness to where her young son lay. "Son, I don't know what to do." Her
own voice sounded tired. It had been two years since her son ran and
played with the other boys. Finding a match, she lit a candle and sat beside
her son until he fell into a troubled sleep. Why was life so cruel? Prakash's
mother wondered. But let it be, she decided. Perhaps in the next existence
we will have a better life.
   Eventually Prakash regained some measure of health, but the mysteri-
ous sickness had stunted his growth and kept him from attending school.
Uneducated and small for his age, Prakash could not find steady work, so
he farmed to help support his family.
   Then Prakash learned that some Christians lived in a nearby village.
"Perhaps you should become a Christian," a friend advised. "Maybe they
can help you get well." It was illegal to convert to Christianity in Prakash's
country, so he crossed the border and sought Christians to share the news
of Christ with him. At age 25, Prakash was baptized. He returned home a
believer. Prakash and some friends began meeting quietly in their own vil-
 lage. But the police discovered the small group of Christians and burst into
 their meeting place. They confiscated their Bibles and arrested the men.
 For months while Prakash languished in prison, his wife struggled to pro-
 vide food for herself and their child.
   Eventually Prakash was released, but tragedy struck again when his wife
 died of cancer, and he was faced with the task of raising a young boy alone.
   Prakash lost his little garden plot when the local land was sold to large
 tea plantations. His small physique kept him from working in the new
 plantations. Prakash suffered deprivation as well as loneliness, but his
 faith remained strong.
    One day Prakash met a widow named Maile who was thirsting to learn
 about Christianity. Soon after she gave her life to Christ, the couple mar-
 ried. It is still difficult to be a Christian in their homeland, but the couple
 share their faith with family and friends who will listen.
    Pray for Prakash and the people in his country, where Christians often
 are persecuted and freedom to worship is not guaranteed.

      The Hard                 Way



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

              t a burning building in New York City's Harlem, a blind girl

      A       was perched on the fourth-floor window. The firemen had
              become desperate. They couldn't fit the ladder truck between
      the buildings, and they couldn't get her to jump into a net, which she,
      of course, couldn't see.
         "Finally her father arrived and shouted through the bull horn that
      there was a net and that she was to jump on his command. The girl
      jumped and was so completely relaxed that she did not break a bone
      or even strain a muscle in the four-story fall. Because she trusted her
      father completely, when she heard her father's voice she did what he
      said was best."—Edited by Michael P. Green, 1500 Illustrations for
      Biblical Preaching, p. 135.
         In the same way, God provided powerful evidence that He wanted
      the best for His children, but they rejected the gently flowing way He
      first presented His concern to them; thus, He had to speak to them
      with a roar and a flood instead.
         What lessons can we, today, learn from their mistakes?

      ern kingdom? What was the result of Ahaz's alliance with the
      Assyrians? Yet even amid all this calamity and suffering, what hope
      did the Lord offer? What does it mean to love and to fear God?
      What does the Word say to us about the dangers of spiritualism?

     Prophecy Fulfilled                   (Isa. 7:14-16).

       In Isaiah 7:14-16, Immanuel is a sign linked to the dilemma of
     Ahaz: Before the child Immanuel would be old enough to decide
     between different kinds of food, "the land before whose two kings you
     are in dread will be deserted" (vs. 16, NRSV). This refers to the land
     and kings of Syria and northern Israel (compare vss. 1, 2, 4-9) and
     reiterates God's promise that their power would soon be extinguished.

Why does Isaiah mention " 'curds and honey' " (NRSV) that the boy
     would have to eat? Isa. 7:15.


       The crops and fields of Judah would be destroyed by the Assyrians
     (vss. 23-25). So the people, including the Old Testament Immanuel,
     whoever he was (vss. 14, 15), would be forced to return to the diet of
     nomads (vss. 21, 22). But while they would be poor, they would have
     enough on which to survive.

When was the prophecy regarding Syria and northern Israel ful-
      filled? 2 Kings 15:29, 30; 16:7-9; 1 Chron. 5:6, 26.


         This prophecy of Isaiah was given about 734 B.c. In response to the
      bribe of Ahaz, Tiglath-pileser III did what he probably would have done
      anyway: He smashed the northern coalition, conquered the Galilee and
      Transjordanian regions of northern Israel, deported some of the popu-
      lation, and turned the territories into Assyrian provinces (734-733 B.c.).
      The remainder of Israel was saved when Hoshea, after murdering King
      Pekah, surrendered and paid tribute. In 733 and 732 B.C. Tiglath-pileser
      conquered Damascus, the capital of Syria. Then he carved Syria into
      Assyrian provinces. So, by 732, within about two years of Isaiah's pre-
      diction, Syria and Israel had been conclusively defeated, and it was all
      over for the two kings who had threatened Ahaz.
         Then, King Hoshea of Israel committed political suicide by rebelling
      against Assyria. The Assyrians took the capital city of Samaria in 722
      B.C. and deported thousands of Israelites to Mesopotamia and Media,
      where they eventually were absorbed into the local populations and lost
      their identity. God had predicted what would happen to the enemies of
      Judah, but His point to Ahaz was that this would happen anyway, with-
      out any need to rely on Assyria.

       Think, if you were living in the northern kingdom while all this
       was happening, how easy it would be to lose faith. What can we
       do to keep our faith intact, so that when tomorrow's calamities
       come we can stay firm? See 1 Pet. 1:13-25.
                                                                             31

     Foreseen Consequences                       (Isa. 7:17-25).

Read the above verses. What is the Lord saying that will happen to
     the land? Why should we not be surprised at this outcome?




        For Ahaz, the man of fear rather than faith, the good news from God
     was that Syria and Israel would be wiped out. The bad news was that
     Assyria, the ally and "friend" he had chosen to help him, would turn
     out to be a far more dangerous foe than Syria and Israel had been. By
     turning down deliverance offered freely by God, Ahaz was guaranteed
     defeat. If Ahaz thought his world was falling apart before, things were
     going to get far worse!
        "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to put confidence in
     princes" (Ps. 118:9, NRSV). How could Ahaz trust that Tiglath-pileser
     III would be satisfied with taking the countries to the north and
     respect Judah? Assyrian writings, such as annals of the Assyrian kings
     themselves, testify to the fact that their desire for power was insa-
     tiable.

Read 2 Kings 16:10-18 and 2 Chronicles 28:20-25. What was hap-
     pening to Ahaz? What spiritual principle do we see unfolding
     here? Why should we not be surprised at his actions?




      2 Chronicles 28:20-23 powerfully sums up what happened when
     Ahaz asked for help from Assyria rather than relying on the Lord.

      Our natural tendency is to trust in what we can see, feel, taste,
      touch—the things of the world. Yet, as we know, the things of the
      world vanish. Look at 2 Corinthians 4:18. What is the text say-
      ing to us? How can we apply what it is saying to our own lives?
      And what difference will it make for us if we do?

     What's in a Name?                    (Isa. 8:1-10).

        Can you imagine playing a ball game with Isaiah's second boy? By
     the time you could say "Maher-shalal-hash-baz, throw me the ball!" it
     would be too late. But even longer than his name is its meaning: "swift
     is booty, speedy is prey" or "speed the spoil, hasten the plunder."

The message of the name clearly relates to rapid conquest, but
     who conquers whom? Isa. 8:4.


       Isaiah 8:1-10 reinforces the message of chapter 7. Before a child
     could reach a certain stage, spoils of war from the capitals of Syria
     and northern Israel would be taken by Assyria. Furthermore, because
     Judah had refused God's message of assurance, represented by the
     gently flowing waters of the Shiloah stream in Jerusalem, it would be
     overwhelmed by the mighty power of Assyria, represented by flood-
     ing from the great Euphrates River.
        Because Ahaz turned to Assyria, the names of Isaiah's sons referred
     to Judah, as well as to northern Israel: "swift is booty, speedy is prey,"
     but also "a remnant shall return." Why was there still hope? Because
     although Assyria would fill Immanuel's land (Isa. 8:8), they still had
     the promise that "God is with us" (vs. 10). Indeed, what we see here
     is a theme that permeates the entire book of Isaiah, which is that
     though there would be judgments on God's enemies in Judah and on
     other nations, delivered in the form of military disasters, suffering,
     and exile, the Lord would be with the faithful survivors of His people
     and restore them to their land.

Why does Isaiah tell us he legally recorded the child's name and had
      marital relations with his wife ("the prophetess")? Isa. 8:1-3.


        The timing of this son served as a significant sign. As with the sign
      of Immanuel, from the time the son was conceived and born until the
      time Assyria defeated Syria and Israel would be less time than it
      would take for the boy to reach an early developmental stage, in this
      case learning to call for his father or mother (vs. 4). When Isaiah
      legally recorded the boy's name before his conception, he made the
      child and his name a public prophecy that could be tested by subse-
      quent events.

       Despite repeated mistakes on the part of His professed people,
       the Lord still was willing to save them. How can we take this
       principle and apply it to ourselves, personally, especially when
       we fail and fall in our own spiritual life?

                                                                            33
         WEDNESDAY April 21


     Nothing to Fear When We Fear God
     Himself (Isa. 8:11-15).
        In his first inaugural address, American President Franklin D.
     Roosevelt told a nation disheartened by the Great Depression: "The
     only thing we have to fear is fear itself."—U.S. Capitol, Washington,
     D.C., (March 4, 1933). Isaiah's message to depressed people is simi-
     lar: "We have nothing to fear when we fear God Himself."
       God warned Isaiah not to fear what his people feared, but to fear
     Him (Isa. 8:12, 13). This is an important theme in Scripture. For
     example, in Revelation 14:6-12, three angels proclaim a worldwide
     message: Fear God and give glory to Him, rather than fearing and giv-
     ing glory to the earthly beast power described in chapter 13.

How do you understand the idea of "fearing" God? What does that
     mean, especially in light of the command that we love God, as well
     (Matt. 22:37)?


       True fear of God means that you recognize Him as the ultimate
     Power in the universe. Such fear overcomes any other fear. If He is for
     you, nobody else can touch you without His permission. If He is
     against you because you have rebelled against Him, you can run, but
     you can't hide!

Doesn't the idea that we should fear God contradict 1 John 4:18:
     "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear
     has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached
     perfection in love" (NRSV)?


        There are different kinds of fear. If someone with awesome power
     is your friend, with whom you share mutual love, you do not fear that
     person in the sense you think he or she will hurt you. But you have a
     kind of fear in the sense that you know and respect the power of that
     person and the boundaries of your relationship.

      As Christians we aren't to love the things of the world, the
      things that people of the world love (1 John 2:15). Thinking,
      then, along parallel lines, as Christians, are there things the
      world fears that we as Christians shouldn't fear? If so, what are
      they, and why shouldn't we fear them? At the same time, what
      things does the world not fear that we, as Christians, should?
      See, for instance, Matt. 10:28; Jer 10:2, 3.

     Gloom of the Ungrateful Living Dead
     (Isa. 8:16-22).

Read the above passage. What is it talking about? What has this to
     do with King Ahaz? Summarize the ideas.




        Ahaz was deeply involved in pagan religion (2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-
      15; 2 Chron. 28:2-4, 23-25), which was heavily interconnected with
      the occult (compare Deut. 32:17, NRSV—" 'They sacrificed to
      demons . . "; 1 Cor 10:20). Various aspects of modern witchcraft
      have striking parallels in ancient Near Eastern rituals, as witnessed by
      ancient writings outside the Bible. Indeed, even many of today's New
      Age practices are simply contemporary manifestations of these
      ancient occult practices.
        Isaiah's description of despair resulting from reliance on spirits
      other than the Lord (Isa. 8:21, 22) fits Ahaz well (compare 2 Chron.
      28:22, 23). Isaiah foretells of people becoming enraged and cursing
      their king (Isa. 8:21). This would warn Ahaz that his people would
      curse him for leading them into the occult. In fact, when Ahaz died,
      an exception was made regarding his burial due to lack of respect for
      him: "They did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel"
      (2 Chron. 28:27, NRSV).

What do these texts say about the occult? Lev. 20:27, Deut. 18:9-14.

        Separation from the occult is a matter of loyalty to God. First
      Chronicles 10:13, 14 applies this principle to the case of King Saul:
      "So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in
      that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had con-
      sulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from
      the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom
      over to David son of Jesse" (NRSV).

        Look around at your own life, at the influences around you. In
       what subtle ways are you exposed to the principles behind the
       occult and various manifestations of spiritualism? And even if
       you can't totally avoid them, what can you do to minimize their
       influence upon you, or your family?

                                                                           35
                  FRIDAY April 23

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, "Can Our Dead Speak to
      Us?", The Great Controversy, pp. 551-562.

         "In the days of the Hebrews there was a class of people who
      claimed, as do the spiritualists of today, to hold communication with
      the dead. But the "familiar spirits," as these visitants from other
      worlds were called, are declared by the Bible to be 'the spirits of dev-
      ils.' (Compare Numbers 25:1-3; Psalm 106:28; 1 Corinthians 10:20;
      Revelation 16:14.) The work of dealing with familiar spirits was pro-
      nounced an abomination to the Lord, and was solemnly forbidden
      under penalty of death. Leviticus 19:31; 20:27. The very name of
      witchcraft is now held in contempt. The claim that men can hold inter-
      course with evil spirits is regarded as a fable of the Dark Ages. But
      spiritualism, which numbers its converts by hundreds of thousands,
      yea, by millions, which has made its way into scientific circles, which
      has invaded churches, and has found favor in legislative bodies, and
      even in the courts of kings—this mammoth deception is but a revival,
      in a new disguise, of the witchcraft condemned and prohibited of
      old."—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 556.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Discuss the issue of spiritualism as it appears in movies, books,
       TV, and popular culture. If nothing can be done to stop it, how
       can we alert others to the dangers of what, for so many people,
       seem like harmless distractions, nothing more? Why is a proper
       understanding of the state of the dead so important in being pro-
       tected against these deceptions?

       0 Read Isaiah 8:20. Prayerfully, rephrase it in your own words.
       Let different people in the class read their versions aloud. What
       is the Lord telling us here?

       0 Dwell more on this idea of loving and fearing God at the same
       time. In what ways does our love stem from that fear? Or does
       our fear stem from our love? Discuss.

Summary: Through Isaiah's actions and family, as well as his words,
    God reinforced the message of warning and hope: The only safe
    course is to trust that God knows what He is doing. He has both the
    love and the power to guide, protect, and provide for those who let
    Him. For those who turn to other powers, there is only gloom.

Best Friends
in Christ
ELIZABETH KIANGI and BEATA NAMBUNDUNGA


   Elizabeth and Beata have been friends since their teen years. While in
boarding school in Namibia, the girls often prayed together. But after
graduation they traveled abroad to study, and both wandered away from
God.
   Elizabeth: I met my husband while studying abroad. He came from an
Adventist home, but he had wandered away from God, so we seldom
attended church. But when he returned to Namibia, he renewed his rela-
tionship with God. When I returned to Namibia, I began attending the
Adventist church with my husband and felt comfortable there, but he
never pushed me to attend church and said he wanted me to find God on
my own. Before long I joined the baptismal class.
   When Beata returned home, we quickly renewed our friendship. I was
excited about God and wanted to share what I was learning with Beata. I
invited her to church, and she came, mostly to please me.
   One day she asked me not to talk to her about God for awhile, to give
her time to sort out her thoughts about God. I agreed not to talk to Beata
about God, but I did not stop praying for her. I asked our women's prayer
group to pray for my friend.
    Beata: I tried several different churches, but none of them satisfied me.
I needed God, but I did not know how to find that close walk with Him
that my heart craved. Finally I called Elizabeth and asked if I could return
to church with her. When I walked into the church, I realized I was home.
 I did not know that Elizabeth and her friends had been praying for me; I
                                       only knew that the emptiness I had
                                       felt for months was at last gone.
                                           I am happy in God. I invite my
                                        friends and my family to worship, and
                                       when I get excited and try to push
                                        them, Elizabeth just smiles, and I
                                        remember to be patient. After all, it
                                        took a year to let God fill the hole in
                                        my heart. I will just keep inviting oth-
                                        ers to try Jesus and let God take care
                                        of the timing.

      Noble Prince
      of Peace




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

               r. Robert Oppenheimer, who supervised the creation of the

      D        first atomic bomb, appeared before a Congressional
               Committee [in the United States]. They inquired of him if
      there were any defense against the weapon. 'Certainly,' the great
      physicist replied.
        " 'And that is—'
        "Dr. Oppenheimer looked over the hushed, expectant audience and
      said softly 'Peace.' "—Compiled by Paul Lee Tan, Encyclopedia of
      7,700 Illustrations: Signs of the Times (Rockville, Md.: Assurance
      Publishers, 1988), p. 989.
         Peace is an elusive dream for the human race. In 1895 Alfred Nobel,
      the inventor of dynamite, provided for a trust to establish a prize for indi-
      viduals who make an outstanding contribution to peace (Paul Lee Tan,
      p. 988, adapted). In recent years, however, even some winners of the
      Nobel Peace Prize have been involved in violent conflict. This week
      we'll read about the only One who can bring true, and everlasting, peace.

The Week at a Glance: Who is the Child prophesied of
      in Isaiah 9? What kind of deliverance would He bring? How are
      both of Christ's comings presented in Isaiah 11?

Memory Text: "For a child has been born for us, a son given to
      us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named
      Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
      Peace" (Isaiah 9:6, NRSV).

     End of Gloom for Galilee                        (Isa. 9:1-5).

Why does Isaiah 9:1 begin with a word ("But"/"Nevertheless") that
    indicates a contrast to what precedes it?



       Isaiah 8:21, 22 describes the hopeless condition of those who turn
     to the occult rather than to the true God: Wherever they look, they
     will "see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they
     will be thrust into thick darkness" (vs. 22, NRSV). By contrast, there
     will come a time when "there will be no gloom for those who were
     in anguish" (Isa. 9:1, NRSV). The people of the Galilee region are
     singled out here as receiving the special blessing of "a great light"
     (vs. 2, NRSV). The nation will be multiplied and rejoice because God
     will have broken "the rod of their oppressor" (vs. 4, NRSV).
        The region of Lake Galilee is depicted here because it was among
     the first territories of Israel to be conquered. In response to Ahaz's
     request for aid, Tiglath-pileser III took the Galilee and Transjordanian
     regions of northern Israel, carried some of the people captive, and
     turned the territories into Assyrian provinces (2 Kings 15:29). So,
     Isaiah's message is that the first to be conquered would be the first to
     see deliverance.

Who does God use to deliver His people? Isa. 9:6, 7.


When and how was the prophecy of Isaiah 9:1-5 fulfilled? Matt.
  4:12-25.


        Not by accident, Jesus' early ministry was in the Galilee region,
      where He gave hope by announcing the good news of God's kingdom
      and by healing people, including delivering demoniacs from bondage
      to the occult (vs. 24).
          Here we see a perfect example of how the Bible takes events that
      happened in Old Testament times and uses them to prefigure things
      that will happen in New Testament times. The Lord mixes images
      from one era with those of another, such as in Matthew 24, where
      Jesus mingles the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, with the end of
      the world.

       If someone were to ask you, What has Jesus delivered you from,
       what would you answer? What personal testimony can you give
       regarding the power of Christ in your life?


                                                                           39
                 MONDAY April 26


      A Child for Us               (Isa. 9:6, 7).

         Here is the third special birth in the book of Isaiah, following men-
      tion of the births of Immanuel and Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

What is special about the Child found in these verses? Isaiah 9:6, 7.

        Notice that this Deliverer has several names/epithets that describe
      Him in various ways. In the ancient Near East, kings and deities had
      multiple names to show their greatness.
        He is "wonderful," just as the divine Angel of the Lord described
      His own name to Samson's father as " 'wonderful' " (Judg. 13:18,
      RSV,- the same Hebrew root) and then ascended toward heaven in the
      sacrificial flame on Manoah's altar (vs. 20), thereby prefiguring His
      offering of Himself more than 1,000 years later.
        He is referred to as divine ("Mighty God") and the eternal Creator
      ("Everlasting Father"; see Luke 3:38: ". . . Adam, son of God,"
      NRSV).
        He is a King of the dynasty of David; His kingdom of peace will be
      eternal.

Given these attributes, who alone could this Child be? See Luke 2:8-14.

         Some have attempted to identify him with King Hezekiah, but the
      description far surpasses any ordinary human being. Only one Person
      fits: Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God and Creator (John 1:1-3, 14;
      Col. 1:5-17; 2:9; Heb. 1:2), who was born to us in order to save us and
      give us peace. He has received all authority in heaven and on earth, and
      He is with us always (Matt. 28:18-20). While retaining His divinity, He
      has also become human for all time, ever able to sympathize with our
      weaknesses (Heb. 4:15). "Unto us a child is born" . . . forever!
         "When Christ came to our world, Satan was on the ground, and dis-
      puted every inch of advance in His path from the manger to Calvary.
      Satan had accused God of requiring self-denial of the angels, when
      He knew nothing of what it meant Himself, and when He would not
      Himself make any self-sacrifice for others. This was the accusation
      that Satan made against God in heaven; and after the evil one was
      expelled from heaven, he continually charged the Lord with exacting
      service which He would not render Himself. Christ came to the world
      to meet these false accusations, and to reveal the Father."—Ellen G.
      White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 406, 407.

       What does this quote tell us about the character of God?

     The Rod of God's Anger                          (Isa. 9:8-10:34).

       This section explains Isaiah 9:1-5, which predicts deliverance for
     the gloomy, anguished people who had trusted in the occult and fallen
     prey to military conquest and oppression: "the rod of their oppressor,
     you have broken as on the day of Midian" (vs. 4, NRSV).

Read through the sufferings of God's people as shown in the above
     texts. Compare the curses in Leviticus 26:14-39. Why did God
     punish His people in stages rather than all at once? What does
     this indicate about His character and goals?


        If God had wanted to destroy His people, He could have given them
     up to the Assyrians right away. But He is patient, "not wanting any to
     perish, but all to come to repentance" (2 Pet. 3:9, NRSV). As in the
     period of the "judges," God let the people of Judah and Israel experi-
     ence some results of their folly, so they could understand what they
     were doing and have a chance to make a better choice. When they per-
     sisted in evil and hardened their hearts against Him and the appeals
     He sent through His messengers, He further withdrew His protection.
     But they continued to rebel. This cycle was repeated in a downward
     spiral until there was nothing more God could do.

Read through Isaiah 9:8-10:2. What sins are the people guilty of?
     Against whom have they committed them? Who is guilty among
     them?




        What we see here, as seen all through the Bible, is the reality of free
      will. God made humans free (He had to; otherwise, they could never
      truly love Him), and freedom involves the option to do wrong.
      Though time and again God seeks to woo us by revealing His love and
      character, He will also allow us to face the fruit of our wrong deci-
      sions; i.e., pain, suffering, fear, turmoil, and so forth, all in order to
      help us realize just what turning away from Him leads 10. Yet, even
      then, how often these things don't make people put away sin and come
      to the Lord. Free will is wonderful; we couldn't be human without it.
      Woe to those, however, who use it wrongly.

       How has God used suffering in your own life to turn you away
       from a wrong course?


                                                                             41

     Root and Branch in One                        (Isaiah 11).

Who is the "shoot" that comes out "from the stump of Jesse" (NRSV)
     in Isaiah 11:1? See also Zech. 3:8, 6:12.


       Isaiah 11:1 picks up on the imagery of a felled tree in 10:33, 34.
     The "stump of Jesse" represents the idea that the dynasty of David
     (son of Jesse) would lose its power (Dan. 4:10-17, 20-26). But there
     would arise a "shoot/branch" from the apparently doomed "stump";
     that is, a ruler descended from David.

Why is the new Davidic ruler also called the "root of Jesse" (Isa.
     11:10)? What sense does this make? Rev. 22:16.


       The description fits only Jesus Christ, who is both "the root and the
     descendant of David" (Rev. 22:16, NRSV). Christ came from the line
     of David (Luke 3:23-31), who was descended from Adam, who was
     the "son of God" (Luke 3:38), in the sense that Christ created him
     (compare John 1:1-3, 14). So, Christ was David's ancestor, as well as
     his descendant!

In what ways does the new Davidic ruler reverse the evil effects
     of sin and apostasy? Isaiah 11.


        He thinks and acts in harmony with the Lord, judges fairly, punishes
     the wicked, and brings peace. He will bring back, restore, and unite a
     faithful remnant of Israel and Judah (compare Isa. 10:20-22). There
     will be a strong, united monarchy as in the days of King David, who
     defeated the Philistines and others. But the new ruler will be greater
     than David in that He will restore peace even to the essence of cre-
     ation itself: Predators will no longer be carnivorous, and they will
     coexist in tranquility with their former prey (Isa. 11:6-9).
        In Isaiah 11, both comings of Jesus are presented as one picture.
     They are tied together, because they are two parts of a whole, like the
     two sides of a plane. The plan of salvation, to be completed, requires
     both comings: the First, which already happened; and the Second,
     which we await as the consummation of all our hopes as Christians.

      What did Christ accomplish at the First Coming that gives us
      such assurance about the Second Coming? What sense did the
      First Coming have if it doesn't result in the Second?

     "You Comforted Me" (Isa. 12:1-6).
       Isaiah 12 is a short psalm (song) of praise to God for His merciful
     and powerful comfort. The psalm, put in the mouth of a member of
     the restored remnant, compares the promised deliverance to that of
     the Hebrews in the Exodus from Egypt (see Isa. 11:16); it is like the
     song of Moses and the Israelites when they were saved from
     Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea (see Exodus 15).

Compare this song in Isaiah 12 to Revelation 15:2-4, the song of
      Moses and of the Lamb. What are they both praising God for?


        Isaiah 12:2 comes close to identifying the coming Deliverer as
      Jesus. It says that "God is my salvation" and "he has become my sal-
      vation" (NRSV). The name Jesus means "The Lord is Salvation"
      (compare Matt. 1:21).

What is the significance of the idea, contained in the name of Jesus,
      that the Lord is salvation?


         Not only does the Lord bestow salvation (Isa. 12:2); He Himself is
      salvation. The Presence of the Holy One of Israel in our midst (vs. 6)
      is everything to us. God is with us! Not only did Jesus do miracles;
      He "became flesh and lived among us" (John 1:14, NRSV, emphasis
      supplied). Not only did He bear our sins on the cross; He became sin
      for us (2 Cor. 5:21). Not only does He make peace; He is our peace
      (Eph. 2:14).
         No wonder "the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples"
      (Isa. 11:10, NRSV). When He is lifted up on the cross, He draws all
      people to Himself (John 12:32, 33)! A remnant shall return to the
      "mighty God" (Isa. 10:21, NRSV), who is the Child born for us, the
      "Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6)!

       Dwell more on this idea that Jesus is our salvation. Read
       Romans 3:24. It says that redemption is in Jesus; redemption is
       something that happened in Him, and it is through God's grace
       and mercy that we can have an eternal share in that redemp-
       tion, as well. In other words, that redemption that was in Him
       can become ours by faith, and not by works, because no works
       we do are good enough to redeem us. Only the works that
       Christ did, which He credits to us by faith, can bring redemp-
       tion. How does this truth give you hope and assurance of salva-
       tion, especially when you feel overwhelmed by your own sense
       of unworthiness?

                                                                          43
                 FRIDAY April 30


Further Study: "The heart of the human father yearns over his
     son. He looks into the face of his little child, and trembles at the
     thought of life's peril. He longs to shield his dear one from Satan's
     power, to hold him back from temptation and conflict. To meet a bit-
     terer conflict and a more fearful risk, God gave His only-begotten
     Son, that the path of life might be made sure for our little ones.
     `Herein is love.' Wonder, 0 heavens! and be astonished, 0 earth!"
     —Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 49.
       "Christ was the one who consented to meet the conditions neces-
     sary for man's salvation. No angel, no man, was sufficient for the
     great work to be wrought. The Son of man alone must be lifted up; for
     only an infinite nature could undertake the redemptive process. Christ
     consented to connect himself with the disloyal and sinful, to partake
     of the nature of man, to give his own blood, and to make his soul an
     offering for sin. In the counsels of heaven, the guilt of man was meas-
     ured, the wrath for sin was estimated, and yet Christ announced his
     decision that he would take upon himself the responsibility of meet-
     ing the conditions whereby hope should be extended to a fallen
     race."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, March 5, 1896.

Discussion Question:
      As we saw in Isaiah 11, the Lord presented in one picture both
      comings of Christ. This can help explain, at least somewhat, why
      some of the Jews didn't accept Christ at His first coming,
      because they expected Him to do the things that will happen only
      at the Second Coming. What does this tell us about how impor-
      tant it is that we have a proper understanding of the nature of
      Christ's advent? How can false views, for instance, of His second
      coming set people up for Satan's great end-time deception? See
      Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, chap. 39.

Summary: In the days of Isaiah, whose name means "Salvation of the
     Lord," God promised salvation for the remnant of His people from the
     oppression that was coming upon them as a result of national apos-
     tasy. This prophecy of hope finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus,
     whose name means "The Lord is Salvation."

Challenger
Joins Adventists
WINNIE MJEMA

   Emmanuel Nanyaro was an active lay member of a charismatic church
in Tanzania. For years he believed that Adventists were legalists who
denied the power of the Holy Spirit. He offered as proof their inability to
speak in tongues. But Brother Emmanuel was a dedicated Christian, open
to new truth.
   One day he decided to visit an Adventist church in an attempt to under-
stand what Adventists believe. He started toward the church on the cam-
pus of Tanzania Adventist College with a list of questions that perplexed
him: Do Adventists believe in Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit?
Why do Adventists talk more about a day of worship than about Jesus?
Does God still recognize the Sabbath? Can you prove that the Sabbath is
Saturday? What do Adventists believe about the commandments of Jesus
such as, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart"?
   The speaker that day did not know that a challenger sat in the audience
with his list of questions, but God knew. The speaker's sermon centered
on the power of the Holy Spirit. In the course of his sermon, the preacher
answered all of Brother Emmanuel's questions.
   At the end of the church service, Brother Emmanuel asked for permis-
sion to say something to the congregation. The deacon in charge was
impressed to grant the testimony, and Brother Emmanuel walked to the
 front. He told the church that he had come to challenge Adventists and
 their beliefs, but that God had answered his questions and put down his
 challenges. All of his objections to Adventist beliefs and more had been
                              answered that day. He indicated a desire to
                              join the Adventist Church.
                                 Brother Emmanuel was baptized some time
                              later, and today this man who came to chal-
                              lenge Adventists is now challenging his fel-
                              low charismatic believers to examine what
                              they believe in light of what Adventists teach.
                              Already Brother Emmanuel has raised up a
                              new congregation of believers.

         LESSON             6      *May 1-7



      Playing God




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

              fter a minister had preached a searching sermon on pride, a

      A       woman who had heard the sermon waited upon him and told
              him that she was in much distress of mind, and that she would
      like to confess a great sin. The minister asked her what the sin was.
         "She answered, 'The sin of pride, for I sat for an hour before my
      mirror some days ago admiring my beauty.'
         " 'Oh,' responded the minister, 'that was not a sin of pride—that
      was a sin of imagination!' "—C. E. MaCartney, compiled by Paul Lee
      Tan, p. 1100.
         Ever since sin was born in the heart of a mighty angel, pride has not
      respected the boundaries of reality (in angels or people). Nowhere is
      this problem seen worse than in those who harbor spiritual pride, a
      rather sorry trait in beings so corrupted that their salvation can be
      found only in the works of another in their behalf.
         This week, among other things, we'll take a look at the origin of
      pride and self-exaltation, the two truly original sins.

The Week at a Glance: What will be the fate of Babylon?
      Why is sin punished so harshly? What caused Lucifer's downfall?
      What is the key element that distinguishes true religion from false
      religion? Does God really destroy the wicked?

Memory Text: "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, so
      that he might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited;
      let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (Isaiah 25:9, NRSV).

     Doom on the Nations                    (Isaiah 13).

       Isaiah 13:1 contains a new designation that names Isaiah as the
     author (compare 1:1, 2:1); it seems, also, to begin a new section of
     his book. Chapters 13-23 contain oracles of judgment against various
     nations. Let's take a look.

Why do the prophecies against the nations begin with Babylon?

       Isaiah 10:5-34 had already announced judgment against Assyria,
     which posed the greatest danger in Isaiah's day. While Isaiah 14:24-
     27 briefly reiterates the Lord's plan to break Assyria, chapters 13-23
     deal mainly with other threats, Babylon being the most important.
       Endowed with a rich and ancient cultural, religious, and political
     legacy, Babylon later emerged as the superpower that conquered and
     exiled Judah. But from the human perspective of Isaiah's time, it
     would not have been readily apparent that Babylon would threaten
     God's people. During much of Isaiah's ministry, Assyria dominated
     Babylon. From 728 B.C., when Tiglath-pileser III took Babylon and
     was proclaimed king of Babylon under the throne name Pulu (or Pul;
     see 2 Kings 15:19, 1 Chron. 5:26), Assyrian kings retook Babylon
     several times (710 B.c., 702 B.c., 689 B.C., and 648 B.c.). Babylon,
     however, eventually would become the great superpower in the
     region, the power that would destroy the Judean kingdom.

       Read through Isaiah 13. Notice how strong the language is.
       Why does a loving God do these things, or allow these things to
       happen? Certainly some innocent people will suffer, as well,
       wouldn't they (see vs. 16)? How do we understand this action
       by God? What should these texts, and all the texts in the Bible
       that talk about God's anger and wrath against sin and evil, tell
       us about the egregious nature of sin and evil? Isn't the mere
       fact that a God of love would respond this way enough evidence
       to show us just how bad sin is? We have to remember that this
       is Jesus speaking these warnings through Isaiah, the same
       Jesus who forgave, healed, pled, and admonished sinners to
       repent. How, in your own mind, have you come to understand
       this aspect of a loving God's character? Ask yourself this ques-
       tion, as well: Could not this wrath actually stem from His love?
       If so, how so? Or, look at it from another perspective, that of
       the Cross, where Jesus Himself, bearing the sins of the world,
       suffered worse than anyone else ever has suffered, even those
       "innocents" who suffered because of the sins of the nation.
       How does the suffering of Christ on the cross help answer these
       difficult questions?
                                                                        47
                MONDAY May 3


     The Late Great City of Babylon (Isa. 13:2-22).
       In 626 B.C. the Chaldean Nabopolassar restored Babylonian glory
     by making himself king in Babylon, beginning the Neo-Babylonian
     dynasty, and participating (with Media) in the defeat of Assyria. His
     son, Nebuchadnezzar II, was the king who conquered and exiled
     Judah.

How did the city of Babylon finally end?

        In 539 B.C., when Cyrus the Persian captured Babylon for the Medo-
     Persian Empire (see Daniel 5), the city lost its independence forever.
     In 482 B.C. Xerxes I brutally suppressed a revolt of Babylon against
     Persian rule. He removed the statue of Marduk, the chief god, and
     apparently damaged some fortifications and temples.
        Alexander the Great took Babylon from the Persians in 331 B.c.
     without a fight. In spite of his short-lived dream to make Babylon his
     eastern capital, the city declined over several centuries. By 198 A.D.
     the Roman, Septimus Severus, found Babylon completely deserted.
     So, the great city came to an end through abandonment. Today some
     Iraqi villagers live on parts of the ancient site, but they have not rebuilt
     the city as such.
        The doom of Babylon, described in Isaiah 13, liberates the descen-
     dants of Jacob, who have been oppressed by Babylon (Isa. 14:1-3).
     The event that accomplished this was the conquest of Babylon by
     Cyrus in 539 B.c. Although he did not destroy the city, this was the
     beginning of the end for Babylon, and it never threatened God's peo-
     ple again.
        Isaiah 13 dramatizes the fall of Babylon as a divine judgment. The
     warriors who take the city are God's agents (vss. 2-5). The time of
     judgment is called "the day of the Lord" (vss. 6, 9), and God's anger
     is so powerful it affects the stars, sun, moon, heavens, and earth
     (vss. 10, 13).
        Compare Judges 5, where the song of Deborah and Barak describes
     the Lord as going forth with quaking of the earth and rain from the
     heavens (vs. 4). Verses 20, 21 depict the elements of nature, including
     stars, as fighting against the foreign oppressor.

      Imagine someone living in Babylon at the height of its glory
      reading these words of Isaiah 13, particularly verses 19-22. How
      foolish and impossible they would have seemed! What other
      prophecies, yet unfulfilled, seem foolish and impossible to us
      now? Why would we be foolish, however, to dismiss them as
      impossible?

     Fall of the Mountain "King" (Isaiah 14).
       In response to the fall of Babylon (Isaiah 13), which frees God's
     people (Isa. 14:1-3), Isaiah 14:4-23 utters a figurative taunt (see also
     Mic. 2:4, Hab. 2:6) against the king of Babylon. It is poetic, not meant
     to be literal, obviously, as it portrays dead kings greeting their new
     colleague in the realm of death (vss. 9, 10), where maggots and
     worms are his bedding (vs. 11). This is, simply, the Lord's dramatic
     way of telling the haughty king that he shall be brought low, as other
     proud monarchs before him—it is not a commentary on the state of
     the dead!

How could Isaiah 14:12-14 apply to a king of Babylon?

       Babylonian kings did not suffer from lack of self-esteem (Daniel
     4-5). But aspiring to "be like the most High" (Isa. 14:14) would be
     beyond even the most inflated ego. While kings claimed strong con-
     nections with the gods, they were subservient to them. This was dra-
     matically demonstrated every year on the fifth day of the Babylonian
     New Year Festival, in which the king was required to remove his royal
     insignia before approaching the statue of Marduk so his kingship
     could be reaffirmed. The idea of displacing even a lesser god would
     be crazy and suicidal.
        As in Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28 identifies heaven-daring arrogance with
     the ruler of a city. Here also, the description goes beyond that of an
     earthly monarch, and God's crosshairs come into sharper focus: The
     proud potentate was in the Garden of Eden, an anointed, covering, or
     guardian cherub on God's holy mountain, perfect from the day he was
     created until sin was found in him, cast out by God, and who will even-
     tually be destroyed with fire (Ezek. 28:12-18). Applied to any human
     being, the specific terms of this rhetoric are so figurative as to be
     meaningless. But Revelation 12:7-9 does tell of a mighty being who
     was cast out of heaven with his angels: "Satan, the deceiver of the
     whole world" (vs. 9, NRSV), who deceived Eve in Eden (Genesis 3).
        Satan has a proud imagination: ". . . you have said, 'I am a god; I
     sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are but a
     mortal, and no god" (Ezek. 28:2, NRSV). His death will prove he is no
     god. Unlike Christ, Satan will perish in the heart of a sea of fire (Rev.
      20:10), never to haunt the universe again.

       Compare Isaiah 14:13, 14 with Matthew 11:29, John 13:5, and
       Philippians 2:5-8. What does this contrast tell us about the
       character of God as opposed to the character of Satan? What
       does this contrast tell us about how the Lord views pride, arro-
       gance, and the desire for self-supremacy?

                                                                           49

      Heaven's Gate              (Isaiah 13-14).

        In Isaiah 14 a taunt against Satan, the fallen "Day Star [in KM;
     "Lucifer'7, son of Dawn" (Isa. 14:12, NRSV) is blended into a taunt
     against the king of Babylon. Why? Compare Revelation 12:1-9, where
     a dragon identified as Satan (vs. 9) tries to destroy a Child as soon as
     it is born. In verse 5 the Child clearly is Christ. But it was King Herod
     who tried to kill Jesus as a young child (Matthew 2). The dragon is
     both Satan and the Roman power represented by Herod, because Satan
     works through human agents. Similarly, he was the power behind the
     king of Babylon and the prince of Tyre.

Why does "Babylon" later refer to Rome (1 Pet. 5:13) and to an evil
    power in Revelation (Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21)?


        Like literal Babylon, Rome and the Babylon of Revelation are
     proud, ruthless powers that oppress God's people. See especially
     Revelation 17:6, for it is "drunk with the blood of the saints" (NRSV).
     They rebel against God, an idea implied in the name Babylon itself. In
     the Babylonian language, the name is bab ili, which means: "the gate
     of god(s)," referring to the place of access to the divine realm.
     Compare Genesis 11, where people built the Tower of Babel
     (Babylon) so that by their own power they could rise to the divine
     level of immunity from any accountability to God.
        When Jacob awoke from a dream in which he saw a ladder con-
     necting heaven and earth, he exclaimed: "This is none other than the
     house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" (Gen. 28:17, NRSV).
     Notice that the "house of God" is "the gate of heaven"; that is, the way
     of access to the divine realm. Jacob named the place Bethel, which
     means "house of God."
        The "gate of heaven" at Bethel and the "gate of god(s)" at Babylon
     were opposite ways to reach the divine realm. Jacob's ladder origi-
     nated in heaven, revealed from above by God. But Babylon, with its
     towers and ziggurat temples, was built by human beings from the
     ground up. These opposite ways represent contrasting paths to salva-
     tion: divinely initiated grace versus human works. All true rehg,on is
     based on the humble Bethel model: "For by grace you have been
     saved through faith" (Eph. 2:8, 9, NRSV). All false "religion," includ-
     ing legalism and "secular" humanism, is based on the proud Babylon
     model. For the contrast between the two approaches, see Jesus' para-
     ble of the Pharisee and the publican (Luke 18:9-14).

      Even after a few years in a Zen monastery, songwriter Leonard
      Cohen said, "I'm not saved." In the context of today's study,
      define his problem and solution.

       Final Triumph of Zion                         (Isaiah 24-27).

        Following oracles against individual nations in Isaiah 13-23, chap-
      ters 24-27 describe on a worldwide scale the climactic defeat of
      God's enemies and the deliverance of His people.

Why does Isaiah's description of the desolation of the earth (Isaiah 24)
      look like John's description of events connected with 1,000 years
      that follow Christ's second coming (Revelation 20)?


         As in Isaiah 13-14, aspects of literal Babylon apply to later powers,
      and the "king of Babylon" represents fusion of human rulers with the
      mastermind behind them, Satan himself. So, a message that Babylon
      is fallen (Isa. 21:9) can be repeated at a later time (Rev. 14:8, 18:2),
      and Satan is finally destroyed after Christ's second coming (Rev.
      20:10). While the destruction of literal Babylon was a judgment "day
      of the Lord" (Isa. 13:6, 9), another "great and terrible day of the
      Lord" (Joel 2:31, Mal. 4:5, compare Zeph. 1: 7) is on the way.
         Similarly, in Isaiah 24 the prophet's vision reaches through condi-
      tions with which he is familiar to the time when "the moon will be
      abashed, and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign on
      Mount Zion and in Jerusalem" (vs. 23, NRSV). Isaiah undoubtedly
      thought the vision applied to the Jerusalem he knew, but the book of
      Revelation explains that it will actually be fulfilled in the New
      Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2): "And the city has no need of sun or moon to
      shine on it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb"
      (vs. 23, NRSV).

Does God really destroy the wicked?

         Look at Isaiah 28:21, where God's work of destruction is His
      strange "deed" (NRSV). It is strange for Him, because He doesn't
      want to do it, but it is, nevertheless, a deed, or an act. It is true that sin
      carries the seeds of self-destruction (James 1:15). But because God
      has ultimate power over life and death, and He determines the time,
      place, and manner of final destruction (Revelation 20), it is pointless
      to argue that He ultimately terminates the curse of sin in a passive
      way, by simply allowing cause and effect to take its natural course.

        What we see in chapters 24-27 of Isaiah is what we see reflected
        in the entire Bible, which is, that in the end, no matter the suf-
        fering, pain, and desolation now, God and goodness will triumph
        over evil. What, then, is the only thing we can do if we, ourselves,
        want to be part of that final victory? Prov. 3:5-7, Rom. 10:9.

                                                                                 51
                   FRIDAY May 7

Further Study: "Is it by conditions that we receive salvation?
      Never by conditions that we come to Christ. And if we come to Christ,
      then what is the condition? The condition is that by living faith we lay
      hold wholly and entirely upon the merits of the blood of a crucified
      and risen Saviour. When we do that, then we work the works of right-
      eousness. But when God is calling the sinner in our world, and invit-
      ing him, there is no condition there; He draws by the invitation of
      Christ, and it is not, Now you have got to respond in order to come to
      God. The sinner comes, and as he comes and views Christ elevated
      upon that cross of Calvary, which God impresses upon his mind, there
      is a love beyond anything that is imagined that he has taken hold
      of."—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 6, p. 32.


Discussion Questions:
    0 Look at the above quote from Ellen White; read it in the con-
       text of Wednesday's study. What is she telling us there? Notice in
       her statement both elements of the Christian walk: faith and
       then works. How does she differentiate between them?

       0 Why are pride and arrogance such dangerous sins? Why are
       they so hard to put away? Can it be because by their very nature
       they blind people to their need to put them away? After all, if you
       are proud, you think you are OK, and if you think you are OK,
       why bother changing? How can dwelling upon the Cross, and
       what it represents (the only means of saving any person), be a
       powerful cure for pride and arrogance in anyone?

       4 Does Isaiah see hope for people of other nations? See, for
       example, Isa. 25:3, 6; 26:9 (compare Rev. 19:9).

Summary: Isaiah saw that following Assyria, Babylon would con-
    quer Judah. But he also saw that in spite of superhuman rulers of the
    darkness of this world (Eph. 6:12) working through God's human ene-
    mies and presuming to play God, the Lord would decisively prevail
    and bring eternal peace to our troubled planet.

Jesus Paid My
Karma
  J. H. Zachary

   Pornsuang was enjoying a good life in Thailand. She had a loving hus-
band and three children. Pornsuang faithfully prayed at the Buddhist tem-
ple, trying to build up good karma (merit) for the next life. Then tragedy
struck; her husband died. In her deep sorrow Pornsuang wondered what
the future would hold for her and her children.
   Pornsuang's neighbor, Chim, was a Christian. Chim invited Pornsuang
and her children to visit her. Pornsuang was impressed by the kindness and
unselfish love of Chim and her family.
   As Chim shared her knowledge of the living God, Pornsuang was
amazed to learn that Chim's God forgives the sins of His people and wants
them to live with Him forever. Why, He was at that moment preparing a
home in heaven for those who love Him! What joy filled Pornsuang's heart
as Chim explained that with Jesus there is no evil karma to face in the next
life. Pornsuang hardly dared to believe in this wonderful God. For the first
time in her life she could look to the future with hope.
   She struggled to understand why the great God of creation would offer
His own Son to die for her. How could anyone pay the price for her evil
karma? Thoughts of the wonderful Christian God filled her heart with
 hope, joy, and an amazing peace.
   At Chim's suggestion Pornsuang sent her son to the Adventist academy
 in Bangkok. Pornsuang met one of the teachers and asked if he would
 teach her more about the Bible. In time Pornsuang was baptized.
   After her husband's death, Pornsuang often took long walks alone. But
 now she says, "I do not walk alone anymore, for God is with me."
                               Pornsuang testifies, "In all my life I have
                               never had the peace that I now have in Jesus.
                                 "The Bible says 'delight yourself in the
                               Lord and He will give you the desires of your
                               heart,' " Pornsuang says. "My desire is to see
                               my family share the joy I have in Him, and to
                               be with me in heaven. God really helps me
                               each day. I thank You, God. I thank You,
                               Jesus."

      Defeat of the                        Assyrians



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

               gaunt man walks barefoot with his two sons. Another family

      A        has loaded all their belongings onto an oxcart pulled by ema-
               ciated oxen. A man leads the oxen while two women sit on the
      cart. Less fortunate people have no cart, so they carry their posses-
      sions on their shoulders. Soldiers are everywhere. A battering ram
      smashes into the city gate. Archers on top of the ram shoot at defend-
      ers on the walls. Hectic carnage reigns supreme.
         Fast forward. A king sits grandly on his throne, receiving booty and
      captives. Some captives approach him with hands upraised, pleading
      for mercy. Others kneel or crouch. Above the king the words appear:
      " `Sennacherib, king of the world, king of Assyria, . . . sat in a . . . throne
      and the booty of the city Lachish passed in review before him.' "—John
      Malcolm Russell, The Writing on the Wall (Winona Lake: Indiana:
      Eisenbrauns, 1999), p. 138.
         These pictures, which once adorned the walls of Sennacherib's
      "Palace Without a Rival," are now in the British Museum, and what a
      story they tell about the plight of God's professed people.

The Week at a Glance: How hopeless did the situation in
      Judah appear? How did the Assyrians try to undermine the
      morale of the people in Judah? How did Hezekiah respond? What
      happened to him during prosperity?

Memory Text: " '0 Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who are
      enthroned above the cherubim, you are God, you alone, of all the
      kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth' " (Isaiah
      37:16, NRSV).

     Strings Attached                 (Isa. 36:1).

What happened to Judah? 2 Kings 18:13, 2 Chron. 32:1, Isa. 36:1.

       When faithless Ahaz died and his faithful son Hezekiah succeeded
     him, Hezekiah inherited a kingdom that had lost full independence.
     Having purchased Assyrian aid against the alliance of Syria and
     northern Israel, Judah was forced to continue paying "protection
     money" in the form of tribute to Assyria (see 2 Chron. 28:16-21).
     When the Assyrian king Sargon II died on a distant battlefield and
     was succeeded by Sennacherib in 705 B.C., Assyria appeared vulner-
     able. Evidence from Assyrian and biblical texts reveals that Hezekiah
     seized this opportunity to rebel (compare 2 Kings 18:7), taking
     aggressive action as the ringleader of an anti-Assyrian revolt among
     the small nations in his region.
        Unfortunately for him, Hezekiah had underestimated the resilience
     of Assyria's might. In 701 B.c., when Sennacherib had subdued other
     parts of his empire, he lashed out against Syria-Palestine with devas-
     tating force and ravaged Judah.

How did Hezekiah prepare for a confrontation with Assyria? 2 Chron.
      32:1-8.


         When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib intended to take Jerusalem,
      the capital city, he made extensive preparations for a confrontation
      with Assyria. He strengthened his fortifications, further equipped and
      organized his army, and increased the security of Jerusalem's water
      supply (see also 2 Kings 20:20, 2 Chron. 32:30). The remarkable
      Siloam water tunnel, commemorated by an inscription telling how it
      was constructed, almost certainly dates to Hezekiah's preparation for
      a potential siege.
         Just as important as military and organizational leadership,
      Hezekiah provided spiritual leadership as he sought to boost the
      morale of his people at this frightening time. He encouraged them by
      saying: " 'Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or dis-
      mayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him;
      for there is one greater with us than with him. With him is an arm of
      flesh; but with us is the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our bat-
       tles' " (2 Chron. 32:7, 8, NRSV).

       If Hezekiah trusted the Lord so much, why did he put forth so
       much effort on his own? Did his works negate his faith? See
       Philippians 2:12, 13 on cooperating with God, who provides the
       power that is truly effective.

                                                                           57

     Propaganda             (Isa. 36:2-20).

        The rulers of Assyria were not only brutal, they were intelligent.
     Their goal was wealth and power, not simply destruction (compare
     Isa. 10:13, 14). Why use resources to take a city by force if you can
     persuade its inhabitants to surrender? So, while he was engaged in the
     siege of Lachish, Sennacherib sent his rabshakeh, a kind of high offi-
     cer, to take Jerusalem by propaganda.

What arguments did the rabshakeh use to intimidate Judah? Isa.
     36:2-20; see also 2 Kings 18:17-35, 2 Chron. 32:9-19.


        The rabshakeh made some rather powerful arguments. You cannot
     trust Egypt to help you because she is weak and unreliable. You can-
     not depend on the Lord to help you because Hezekiah has offended
     Him by removing His high places and altars throughout Judah, telling
     the people to worship at one altar in Jerusalem. In fact, the Lord is on
     Assyria's side and told Sennacherib to destroy Judah. You don't even
     have enough trained men to handle 2,000 horses.
        To avoid a siege in which you have nothing to eat and drink, give up
     now and you will be treated well. Hezekiah cannot save you, and
     because the gods of all the other countries conquered by Assyria have
     not saved them, you can be sure that your God will not save you either.

Was the rabshakeh telling the truth?

        Because there was much truth in what he was saying, his arguments
     were persuasive. Backing him up were two unspoken arguments.
     First, he had just come from Lachish, only 30 miles away, where the
     Assyrians were showing what happened to a strongly fortified city
     that dared resist them. Second, he had a powerful contingent of the
     Assyrian army with him (Isa. 36:2). Knowing the fate of armies and
     cities elsewhere (including Samaria, the capital of northern Israel:
     2 Kings 18:9, 10) that had succumbed to Assyria, no Judahite would
     have reason to doubt that from a human point of view Jerusalem was
     doomed (compare Isa. 10:8-11). The rabshakeh was also right in say-
     ing that Hezekiah had destroyed various places of sacrifice in order to
     centralize worship at the temple in Jerusalem (2 Kings 18:4, 2 Chron.
     31:1). But had this reform offended the Lord, who was the only hope
     His people had left? Would He, and could He, save them? It was up
     to God to answer this question!

      Have you ever been in a "similar" situation, where, from a
      human standpoint, all seemed lost? What's your only recourse?

     Shaken but Not Forsaken                         (Isa. 36:21-37:20).

How did the clever oratory of the rabshakeh affect Hezekiah and his
     officials? 2 Kings 18:37-19:4, Isa. 36:21-37:4.


      Shaken to the core and mourning in distress, Hezekiah turned to
     God, humbly seeking the intercession of Isaiah, the very prophet
     whose counsel his father had ignored.

How did God encourage Hezekiah? Isa. 37:5-7.




        The message was brief, but it was enough! God was on the side of
      His people! Isaiah predicted that Sennacherib would hear a rumor that
      would distract him from his attack on Judah. This was immediately
      fulfilled.
        Temporarily frustrated, but by no means giving up for long,
      Sennacherib sent Hezekiah a threatening message: " 'Do not let your
      God on whom you rely deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will
      not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. . . . Have the gods
      of the nations delivered them . . .?' " (Isa. 37:10, 12, NRSV; see also
      2 Chron. 32:17).
        This time Hezekiah went straight to the temple and spread the mes-
      sage out before the Lord of hosts, "enthroned above the cherubim"
      (Isa. 37:14-16, NRSV).

How did Hezekiah's prayer identify what was at stake in Jerusalem's
      crisis? Isa. 37:15-20.


        Sennacherib had pointedly attacked Hezekiah's strongest defense:
      faith in his God. Rather than buckling under, Hezekiah appealed to
      God to demonstrate who He is, "so that all the kingdoms of the earth
      may know that you alone are the Lord" (Isa. 37:20).

       Read prayerfully Hezekiah's prayer (Isa. 37:15-20). What aspects
       of God does he focus on? What principle do we see in this prayer
       that can give us encouragement and strength to stay faithful in
       our own personal crises?

      The Rest of the Story                    (Isa. 37:21-38).

        According to Sennacherib, as reported in his annals, he took forty-
      six fortified towns, besieged Jerusalem, and made Hezekiah the Jew,
      "a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage."
      —James B. Pritchard, editor, Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to
      the Old Testament (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University
      Press, 1955), p. 288. But in spite of his penchant for propaganda as an
      extension of his monumental ego, neither in text nor in pictures does
      he claim to have taken Jerusalem. From a human point of view, this
      omission is amazing, given the inexorable power of Sennacherib and
      the fact that Hezekiah led a revolt against him. Rebels against Assyria
      had short life expectancies and gruesome deaths.
        Scholars admit that even if we did not have the biblical record, we
      would be compelled to admit that a miracle must have taken place.
      The fact that Sennacherib lined the walls of his "Palace Without a
      Rival" with reliefs (carved pictures) vividly depicting his successful
      siege of Lachish appears to be due to his need for a face-saving
      device. But for the grace of God, these pictures would have shown
      Jerusalem instead! Sennacherib did not tell the rest of the story, but
      the Bible does.

What is the rest of the story? Isa. 37:21-37.


         In response to Hezekiah's prayer of total faith, God sent him a mes-
      sage of total assurance for Judah that boils over with molten fury
      against the proud Assyrian king who had dared slap the divine King
      of kings in the face (Isa. 37:23). Then God promptly fulfilled His
      promise to defend Jerusalem (2 Kings 19:35-37; 2 Chron. 32:21, 22;
      Isa. 37:36-38).
         A big crisis calls for a big miracle, and big it was! The body count
      was high: 185,000. So Sennacherib had no choice but to go home,
      where he met his own death (compare Isaiah's prediction in 37:7 to
      vs. 38).
         If Sennacherib had conquered Jerusalem, he would have deported
      the population in such a way that Judah would have lost its identity, as
      northern Israel did. From one perspective, then, there would have
      been no Jewish people to whom the Messiah could be born. Their
      story would have ended right there. But God kept hope alive.

       What do you say to someone who, not yet believing in the Bible,
       or the God of the Bible, asks this question: Was it fair that these
       Assyrian soldiers, who just happened to be born where they
       were, should die en masse like this? How do you, personally,
       understand the Lord's actions here?

     In Sickness and in Wealth                        (Isaiah 38, 39).

        The events of Isaiah 38 and 39 (2 Kings 20) took place very close
     to the time God delivered Hezekiah from Sennacherib, even though
     the deliverance, as depicted in Isaiah 37 (see also 2 Kings 19) had not
     yet occurred. Indeed, Isaiah 38:5, 6 and 2 Kings 20:6 show that they
     still faced the Assyrian threat.
        "Satan was determined to bring about both the death of Hezekiah
     and the fall of Jerusalem, reasoning no doubt that if Hezekiah were
     out of the way, his efforts at reform would cease and the fall of
     Jerusalem could be the more readily accomplished."—The SDA Bible
     Commentary, vol. 4, p. 240.

What does the above quote tell us about how important good leader-
     ship is for God's people?


What sign does the Lord give Hezekiah to confirm his faith? 2 Kings
      20:8-10, Isa. 38:6-8.


        By rejecting signs offered by God (Isaiah 7), Ahaz had started the
      course of events that led to trouble with Assyria. But now Hezekiah
      had asked for a sign (2 Kings 20:8), so God strengthened him to meet
      the crisis his father had brought upon Judah. Indeed, reversing the
      shadow on the sundial of Ahaz was possible only through a miracle.
        The Babylonians studied movements of heavenly bodies and
      recorded them accurately. Thus, they would have noticed the sun's
      strange behavior and wondered what it meant. The fact that King
      Merodach-baladan sent envoys at this time is no accident. The
      Babylonians had learned of the connection between Hezekiah's
      recovery and the miraculous sign.
         Now we know why God chose this particular sign. Just as He later
      used the star of Bethlehem to bring wise men from the East, he used
      a solar shift to bring messengers from Babylon. This was a unique
      opportunity for them to learn about the true God. Merodach-baladan
      spent his entire career trying to win lasting independence from
      Assyria. He needed powerful allies, which explains his motivation for
      contacting Hezekiah. If the sun itself moved at Hezekiah's request,
      what could he do to Assyria?

       How did Hezekiah lose an incredible opportunity to glorify God
       and point the Babylonians to Him? What was the result? Isaiah
       39. Hezekiah, who should have been witnessing to them about
       the Lord, pointed, instead, to his own "glory." What is the les-
       son for us?

                                                                          61
                 FRIDAY May 14

Further Study: "Only by the direct interposition of God could the
     shadow on the sundial be made to turn back ten degrees; and this was
     to be the sign to Hezekiah that the Lord had heard his prayer.
     Accordingly, 'the prophet cried unto the Lord: and He brought the
     shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial
     of Ahaz.' Verses 8-11."—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 342.
       "The visit of these messengers from the ruler of a faraway land gave
     Hezekiah an opportunity to extol the living God. How easy it would
     have been for him to tell them of God, the upholder of all created
     things, through whose favor his own life had been spared when all
     other hope had fled! . . .
       "But pride and vanity took possession of Hezekiah's heart, and in
     self-exaltation he laid open to covetous eyes the treasures with which
     God had enriched His people. The king 'showed them the house of his
     precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the pre-
     cious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found
     in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his domin-
     ion, that Hezekiah showed them not.' Isaiah 39:2. Not to glorify God
     did he do this, but to exalt himself in the eyes of the foreign
     princes."—Pages 344, 345.

Discussion Questions:
    O How is Satan like the Assyrian rabshakeh? Does he tell the
      truth when he says that you have sinned (Zech. 3:1)? How does
      God respond? See Zech. 3:2-5. What is our only hope against
      these accusations? Rom. 8:1.

      ©Does Satan stop his accusations when you are forgiven? See
      Rev. 12:10. After you are forgiven, when Satan goes on saying
      that you belong to him because of your sin, what is the nature of
      his accusation? See Deut. 19:16-21 (law of a lying, malicious wit-
      ness).

Summary: In response to the cry of a faithful king, God saved His
     people and showed who He is: the omnipotent King of Israel who con-
     trols the destiny of earth; not only does He destroy those who attempt
     to destroy His people, He also provides opportunities for others to
     become His people, no matter how "Babylonian."

          Part 1
          DIOSDADO FERNANDEZ

            I hated my name, which means God-given, until God gave me my life
          back.
            I live in Cuba, and although my mother claimed to be a Christian, I grew
          up not believing in God. Then in 1996 I learned that I had rectal cancer.
          The doctors operated; then they began radiation treatments. But the treat-
          ments did more harm than good, and I was in incredible pain. Doctors
          gave me morphine for the pain, but I became afraid to even eat. I lost
          weight, and paralysis was slowly setting in. The doctors gave me little
          hope that I would survive.
             While I was still in the hospital, a fire in the hospital set off a severe
          asthma attack. I coughed so hard that I tore out my stitches and fell to the
          floor. When nurses rescued me, I could not breathe.
             X-rays showed that the fire had damaged my lungs, but worse, I also had
          lung cancer from heavy smoking over the years. Doctors operated to repair
          my torn stitches, but they stopped midway through surgery, thinking I was
          dead.
             I awoke to see a beautiful city and a bright, shining being. I felt peace-
          ful and well, and I began to talk to the beautiful being. Doctors heard me
          and stared in disbelief, thinking I had died. They quickly completed the
          surgery and took me to recovery.
             Just hours after surgery I felt better than I had felt in months—years,
          even. I got out of bed and walked, where just a day before I was paralyzed
          and could not walk. It was as if superhuman strength poured through my
          body. A hospital worker asked my son, a doctor, if I was a believer, and he
          told the man that my only loves in life were women, tobacco, and alcohol.
          Then the worker told my son I had been quoting Scripture to them, though
          I had never read the Bible. And when breakfast came I ate hungrily for the
          first time in months.
             Clearly God was working wonders, miracles in my life, though I did not
          yet know Him.
                                                                [Continued next week]

      "Comfort My People"




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

                 orld War II ended in 1945 while a Japanese soldier named

      W          Shoichi Yokoi hid in the jungle on the island of Guam.
                 Leaflets dropped from U.S. planes proclaimed peace, but
      Yokoi thought it a trick. A loyal, patriotic soldier of the emperor, he
      vowed never to surrender. He had no contact with civilization and
      lived on what he could find in the jungle.
         In 1972, 27 years after the end of World War II, hunters came
      across Yokoi while he was fishing, and he only then learned that the
      message of peace had been true. While the rest of his people had been
      enjoying peace for decades, Yokoi had been enduring decades of pri-
      vation and stress.—Roy Gane, Altar Call (Berrien Spring, Mich.:
      Diadem, 1999), p. 304, adapted.
         Many centuries earlier, through the prophet Isaiah, God announced
      that the time of His peoples' stress and suffering was really over:
      "Comfort, 0 comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to
      Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her
      penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for
      all her sins" (Isa. 40:1, 2). Let's take a look at what this means.

The Week at a Glance: With what promise does Isaiah
      40 begin? What good news is revealed in this chapter? How does
      the New Testament apply Isaiah 40? Why is idolatry such a sin
      against God?

Memory Text: "Get you up to a high mountain, 0 Zion, herald
      of good tidings; lift up your voice with strength, 0 Jerusalem,
      herald of good tidings, lift it up, do not fear; say to the cities of
      Judah, 'Here is your God!' " (Isaiah 40:9, NRSV).

                 SUNDAY May 16


     Comfort for the Future                       (Isa. 40:1, 2).

In Isaiah 40:1, 2 God comforts His people. Their time of punishment
      has finally ended. What punishment is that?


        There are many answers to this question. There was the punishment
     administered by Assyria, the rod of God's anger (Isaiah 10), from
     which God delivered Judah by destroying Sennacherib's army in 701
     B.c. (Isaiah 37). There was the punishment administered by Babylon,
     which would carry away goods and people from Judah because
     Hezekiah had displayed his wealth to the messengers from Merodach-
     baladan (Isaiah 39). And there was the punishment administered by
     one of the other nations against which Isaiah wrote messages (Isaiah
     14-23).
        Meanwhile, though "Assyria" and "Assyrian(s)" are mentioned 43
     times from Isaiah 7:17 to 38:6, this nation appears only once in the
     rest of Isaiah, where chapter 52:4 refers to past oppression by Egypt
     and then by "the Assyrian." In the latter part of Isaiah, deliverance
     from exile in Babylon is mentioned (Isa. 43:14; 47:1; 48:14, 20), and
     it is Cyrus, the Persian who conquered Babylon in 539 B.C., who is to
     free the exiles of Judah (Isa. 44:28, 45:1, 45:13).
        Isaiah 1-39 emphasize events leading up to deliverance from the
     Assyrians in 701 B.C., but at the beginning of chapter 40, the book
     leaps ahead a century and a half to the end of Babylon, in 539 B.C.,
     and the return of the Jews shortly thereafter.

Is the theme of return from Babylon linked with anything earlier in
       Isaiah? If so, how?


         Isaiah 39 serves as a transition to the following chapters by pre-
      dicting a Babylonian captivity, at least for some of Hezekiah's descen-
      dants (vss. 6, 7). Furthermore, the oracles of Isaiah 13, 14, and 21 pre-
      dict the fall of Babylon and the liberty this would bring to God's peo-
      ple: "But the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and will again
      choose Israel, and will set them in their own land. . . . When the Lord
      has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service
      with which you were made to serve, you will take up this taunt against
      the king of Babylon" (Isa. 14:1, 3, NRSV). Notice the close connec-
      tion with Isaiah 40:1, 2, where God promises His people there is an
      end to their suffering.

       What do Bible promises about the end of suffering mean to you
       now, amid your present suffering? What good would our faith
       be without those promises?

                                                                            65
                 MONDAY May 17


      Presence, Word, and Roadwork (Isa. 40:3-8).
How do God's people receive comfort? Isa. 40:1-8.

         An unnamed herald announces that God is coming to reveal His
      glory (vss. 3-5). Another voice proclaims that although humans are
      transient like foliage, "the word of our God will stand forever" (vs. 8).
         After the exile, God's people gain back what they had received at
      Mt. Sinai and then rejected through the apostasy for which they were
      punished: God's Presence and His Word. These are the basic ingredi-
      ents of God's covenant with Israel, which were enshrined at His sanc-
      tuary in their midst (Exod. 25:8, 16). Because they had violated His
      Word, God had abandoned His temple (Ezekiel 9-11), but He is com-
      ing back. His Presence and His eternally dependable Word bring com-
      fort, deliverance, and hope.

What preparation is necessary for the Lord's coming? Isa. 40:3-5.

        It is not fitting for a king to be jolted by a rough road. So his com-
     ing is preceded by roadwork. The more so for the King of kings! His
     coming, apparently from the east, where He has been in exile with His
     people as a sanctuary to them (Ezek. 11:16), would require major
     rearrangement of the terrain. Construction of a literal, level super-
     highway through the rugged hills east of Jerusalem would be daunting,
     even with dynamite and bulldozers. God is the only One who can do
     the work: It is He who turns "the rough places into level ground" (Isa.
     42:16, NRSV). But He doesn't need a literal road for transportation,
     because He has an airborne chariot of cherubim (Ezekiel 1, 9-11).
        The New Testament explicitly applies Isaiah's prophecy to the spiri-
     tual roadwork accomplished through the preaching of John the Baptist
     (Matt. 3:3). His message was: " 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
     has come near' " (vs. 2, NRSV) and the baptism that he performed was
     "of repentance for the forgiveness of sins" (Mark 1:4, NRSV). So, the
     roadwork was repentance, willingness to turn away from sin, in order
     to receive the comfort of God's forgiveness and presence.
        Jeremiah 31:31-34 proclaimed the same spiritual message in plenty
     of time for the exiles of Judah to understand the spiritual nature of
     roadwork for God. In this passage, the Lord promises a fresh start to
     those who are willing: a "new covenant" in which He puts His law in
     their hearts and pledges to be their God. They know Him and His
     character, because He has forgiven them.

       Read carefully Isaiah 40:6-8. What hope can you, who fades
       away as does the grass, derive from what the verses say?

                TUESDAY May 18


      The Birth of Evangelism                       (Isa. 40:9-11).

What kind of event is described in Isaiah 40:9-11?

         Later in Isaiah there appears a male herald with good news for
      Jerusalem (41:27, 52:7). But in Isaiah 40:9 the herald to proclaim
      " 'Here is your God!' " (NRSV) from a mountain is a female, a fact
      brought out in the Hebrew.
         In Psalm 68, David praises God because He "gives the desolate a
      home to live in; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity" (vs. 6,
      NRSV). Though these words here apply to the Exodus from Egyptian
      bondage, Isaiah uses the same ideas with reference to proclamation of
      a second "Exodus"—the return from Babylonian captivity.

Is there also a later application of Isaiah's prophecy? If so, what is it?


         The New Testament applies Isaiah 40:3-5 to John the Baptist, who
      prepared the way for Christ, the eternal Word who became the Lord's
      presence in flesh among His people (John 1:14).
         Even earlier than John, others spoke about the good news of His
      coming. Among the first of these were the elderly Simeon and Anna,
      who met baby Jesus when He was dedicated at the temple (Luke 2:25-
      38). Like Isaiah's heralds, they were male and female. Simeon was
      looking forward to the consolation/comfort of Israel in the form of the
      Messiah (Luke 2:25, 26).
         In light of Isaiah's prophecy, it does not appear coincidental that
      Anna, a prophetess, was the very first to announce publicly at the
      temple mountain to the people of Jerusalem that the Lord had come:
      "At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak
      about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of
      Jerusalem" (Luke 2:38, NRSV). This was the birth of Christian evan-
      gelism as we know it: proclamation of the gospel, the good news,
      that Jesus Christ has come to bring salvation. Later, Christ entrusted
      to another woman, Mary Magdalene, the first tidings of His tri-
      umphant resurrection (John 20:17, 18), which ensured that His
      gospel mission to Planet Earth was accomplished. Flesh is like
      grass, but the divine Word who became flesh is eternal (compare
       Isa. 40:6-8)!

        Look at Isaiah 40:11. What kind of imagery is presented here?
        Write out for yourself a paragraph on how you, personally, have
        experienced shepherding by the Lord. Why is it good to recount
        in your mind the way the Lord has led you?


                                                                          67
         WEDNESDAY May 19


     Merciful Creator                 (Isa. 40:12-31).

How does Isaiah 40 develop the themes of God's mercy and power?

        Throughout this chapter, God's mercy and power are interwoven (see
     below) and even blended together, because they are both necessary in
     order for God to save His people. He wants to save them, because He
     is merciful; He is able to save them, because He is powerful.

       Mercy (vss. 1-5): comfort, coming of the Lord to deliver.
       Power (vss. 3-8): glory, permanence versus human weakness.
       Mercy (vss. 9-11): good news of deliverance, Shepherd of His
                           people.
       Power (vss. 12-26): incomparable Creator.
       Mercy (vss. 27-31): as Creator, gives power to the faint.

        Having introduced God's might in terms of His glory and perma-
     nence (vss. 3-8), Isaiah elaborates on His power and superior wisdom,
     which make earth and earthlings appear puny (vss. 12-17). Here
     Isaiah's style, with rhetorical questions and vivid analogies referring
     to the earth and its parts, sounds like God's answer to Job (Job 38-41).

What is the answer to Isaiah's rhetorical question: "To whom then
     will you liken God" (Isa. 40:18)?


        For Isaiah, as for Job, the answer goes without saying: no one. God
     is incomparable. But Isaiah picks up on his question and refers to the
     answer that many ancient people implied by their actions, which is
     that God is like an idol (vss. 19, 20).
        To this notion Isaiah responds. Already it looks foolish to use an
     idol as a likeness of God, but just to be sure people get the point, he
     elaborates on God's uniqueness and brings in the unanswerable argu-
     ment that He is the holy Creator (vss. 21-26).

How does verse 27 reveal the attitude of the people addressed by
     Isaiah's message? How are we guilty of having the same?


       The purpose of God's message is to comfort people who need it!
     Like Job, their suffering had made them confused and discouraged
     concerning His character.

      Why is the truth about God as Creator so important to under-
      stand? How does the Sabbath, help reinforce this point?

     The Problem With Idolatry                          (Isa. 40:19, 20).

       Idolatry destroys a unique, intimate relationship with God by
     replacing Him with something else (Exod. 20:4, 5; Isa. 42:8). So,
     prophets refer to idolatry as spiritual "adultery" (Jer 3:6-9, Ezek.
     16:15-19).

Read Isaiah 41:29. How does Isaiah characterize idols? How do you
     understand what he is saying there about them? Why is that such
     an accurate a depiction of any idol, no matter what it is?




        Ancient idolators believed they worshiped powerful divine beings
     through images or symbols of them. Worship of an idol representing
     another god breaks the first commandment: "You shall have no other
     gods before me" (Exod. 20:3, NRSV). But if an idol is intended to rep-
     resent the true God, as the golden calf was (Exod. 32:4, 5), the Lord
     rejects it as a likeness of Himself, for nobody knows how to depict
     Him (Deut. 4:15-19), and nothing can represent His incomparable
     glory and greatness. Thus, an idol itself functions as another god, and
     worshiping it breaks the first and second commandments.
        God's people don't need idols, because they have His real Shekinah
     presence with them in His sanctuary. To worship an idol is to replace
     and, therefore, deny His real presence.
        Also, an idol not only fails to represent the Lord but it represents
     really nothing, because all those other gods have no existence (Isa.
      44:6). As in Isaiah, Psalm 115:8 is clear: those who make idols "are
     like them; so are all who trust in them" (NRSV).

What kinds of idolatry do we, as a church today, face? Does idolatry
      appear in more subtle forms in the church today? If so, how?


         We know from ancient writings that idolatry was attractive, because
      it was about materialism: Using modes of worship people could relate
      to, idolaters honored forces they believed could give them fertility
      and prosperity. It was self-help religion. Sound familiar?
         Just before the Lord comes again, with His way prepared by the
      roadwork of a final Elijah message of reconciliation (Malachi 4), the
      choice will be the same as in the days of Isaiah: Will you worship the
      Creator, or will you worship something else (Revelation 13-14)? For,
      in the end, we always worship something.


                                                                            69

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, "Behold Your God!" in
      Prophets and Kings, pp. 311-321.

         "In Isaiah's day the spiritual understanding of mankind was dark
      through misapprehension of God. Long had Satan sought to lead men
      to look upon their Creator as the author of sin and suffering and death.
      Those whom he had thus deceived, imagined that God was hard and
      exacting. They regarded Him as watching to denounce and condemn,
      unwilling to receive the sinner so long as there was a legal excuse for
      not helping him. The law of love by which heaven is ruled had been
      misrepresented by the archdeceiver as a restriction upon men's happi-
      ness, a burdensome yoke from which they should be glad to escape.
      He declared that its precepts could not be obeyed and that the penal-
      ties of transgression were bestowed arbitrarily."—Ellen G. White,
      Prophets and Kings, p. 311.
         "Many who bear the name of Christians are serving other gods
      besides the Lord. Our Creator demands our supreme devotion, our
      first allegiance. Anything which tends to abate our love for God, or to
      interfere with the service due Him, becomes thereby an idol."—Ellen
      G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 1011.

Part 2
DIOSDADA FERNANDEZ

   My recovery from cancer surgery was so rapid that doctors were
amazed. Just hours after my final surgery, I was out of bed visiting other
patients. Soon doctors could find no reason to keep me longer.
   When Christians had come to visit me in the hospital, I had made fun of
them. But when my Christian niece came to see me, I was thrilled. She
brought me a Bible, and I begged her to stay to help me understand it. I
wanted so much to find out what God had to say about what had happened
to me.
   My niece stayed for three days to help me begin my journey to God. We
spent hours talking about God and His Word. I asked her how to become
a Christian, and she prayed with me while I accepted Jesus as my Savior.
Then I asked forgiveness of all the Christians whom I had ridiculed while
in the hospital.
   I made a promise to God that I would tell others what He had done for
me wherever I had a chance. So I began walking to churches throughout
central Cuba giving my testimony to all who would listen. But I still did
not have a church home of my own. Always there seemed to be something
about the churches I visited that did not seem quite right.
   Then an Adventist man invited me to come to his church to give my tes-
timony. In that little Adventist church I found something different, some-
 thing special. The members' humility and love touched me deeply. As I lis-
 tened to the sermon I sensed that I had found the true church, the one that
 followed all of God's teachings. After the service I asked the pastor how I
 could make this church my home. Before long I was baptized.
                                God has given me a ministry among the
                             sick, and I rejoice to know that God is using
                             me as His vehicle to pray for people who were
                             then healed. I cannot thank God enough for
                             all He has done for me. He healed me, saved
                             me, and sent me out to share my blessings
                             with others.
                                And my name, Diosdada? Now I under-
                              stand why my mother chose that name. For
                              God has given me everything!

      To Serve
      and to Save




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

          n northern Iraq, near an old Christian monastery, lie small holes

      /   in the ground where hermits stayed for decades without coming
          out, in order to better focus on God.
        In the steamy slums of Calcutta, Mother Teresa had a different
      approach to focusing on God. "Jesus comes to meet us," she said. "To
      welcome him, let us go to meet him.
        "He comes to us in the hungry, the naked, the lonely, the alcoholic,
      the drug addict, the prostitute, the street beggars. . . .
        "If we reject them, if we do not go out to meet them, we reject Jesus
      himself."—Mother Teresa: In My Own Words, compiled by Jose Luis
      Gonzalez-Balado (New York: Gramercy Books, 1996), p. 29.
        Isaiah spoke of a servant of the Lord with a similar mission of
      mercy: "a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick
      he will not quench; . . . to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out
      the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in dark-
      ness" (Isa. 42:3, 7, NRSV). Who is this Servant, and what does He
      accomplish?

The Week at a Glance: How is Christ prefigured in
      Isaiah? Why is Cyrus deemed a "Messiah"? How are the first and
      second comings of Jesus meshed in some of these prophecies? What
      does Isaiah teach us about God's power to predict the future?

Memory Text: "Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my cho-
      sen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he
      will bring forth justice to the nations" (Isaiah 42:1, NRSV).

      Servant Nation                (Isaiah 41).

In Isaiah 41:8 God speaks of "Israel, my servant," and in 42:1 he intro-
      duces "my servant." Who is this servant?




        Is it Israel/Jacob, the ancestor of the Israelites? The nation of Israel?
      The Messiah/Christ, identified in the New Testament as Jesus?
        There are two kinds of references to servants of God woven through
      Isaiah 41-53. One servant is named "Israel" or "Jacob," as in 41:8;
      44:1, 2, 21; 45:4; 48:20. Because God addresses Israel/Jacob in the
      present, it is clear he represents the nation descended from him. This
      is confirmed by the fact that redemption for the Lord's "servant
      Jacob" is accomplished at the time when he is to go out from Babylon
      (Isa. 48:20).
         In other instances, such as Isaiah 42:1, 50:10, 52:13, 53:11, God's
      servant is not named. When he is first mentioned in Isaiah 42:1, his
      identity is not immediately apparent. However, as Isaiah develops his
      profile in later passages, it becomes clear that he is an individual who
      restores the tribes of Jacob (Israel) to God (Isa. 49:5, 6) and dies sac-
      rificially on behalf of sinners (Isa. 52:13-53:12; see also 49:5, 6).
      Therefore he cannot be the same as the nation. So it is clear that Isaiah
      speaks of two servants of God. One is corporate (the nation) and the
      other is individual.

What is the role of the servant nation? Isa. 41:8-20.

         God assures Israel that the nation is still the servant of the Lord:
      " 'I have chosen you and not cast you off' " (Isa. 41:9, NRSV). Then
      God gives to Israel one of the most magnificent promises in the Bible:
      " 'Do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God;
      I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my vic-
      torious right hand' " (vs. 10, NRSV). Here and in the following verses
      one of the basic roles of Israel is to trust the true God to save them (as
      King Ahaz did not) rather than to trust in other gods and their images
      as other nations do (Isa. 41:7, 21-24, 28, 29).

        Notice how in Isaiah 41:14, the Lord calls the nation a worm.
        What point is He making? Look at the whole text to get a bet-
        ter answer. What should this teach us, as well, about our need
        to depend totally upon the Lord?


                                                                               73

      Unnamed Individual Servant                            (Isa. 42:1-7).

What is the role and character of God's unnamed servant, whom
      God chooses and on whom He puts His spirit? Isa. 42:1-7.

        Choose the best answer or combination of answers:
        1. He provides justice for the nations.
        2. He accomplishes his goals quietly and gently, but successfully.
        3. He is a teacher.
        4. He serves as a covenant between God and the people.
        5. He gives light/hope by healing blindness and liberating prisoners.
        6. All of the above.

How does the role and character of this servant compare with that of
      the shoot from the stump of Jesse, on whom the spirit of the Lord
      also rests (Isaiah 11)?


        As in Isaiah 42, the Davidic ruler of chapter 11 acts in harmony
      with God, providing justice and deliverance for the oppressed, as well
      as wisdom and knowledge of God. We found that this shoot and root
      of Jesse is the Messiah, the divine child of Isaiah 9:6, 7, who also
      brings "peace for the throne of David and his kingdom" with "justice
      and with righteousness" (vs. 7, NRSV). The servant in Isaiah 42 is,
      obviously, the Messiah.

How does the New Testament identify the servant of Isaiah 42:1-7,
      who provides justice? Matt. 12:15-21.


        Matthew 12 quotes from Isaiah 42 and applies it to the quiet heal-
     ing ministry of Jesus, God's beloved Son, in whom He delights (Isa.
     42:1; Matt. 3:16, 17; 17:5). It is He whose ministry reestablishes
     God's covenant connection with His people (Isa. 42:6, Dan. 9:27).
        Jesus and His disciples gained justice for people by delivering them
     from suffering, ignorance of God, and bondage to evil spirits, caused
     by Satan's oppression (Luke 10:19). Then Jesus died to ratify the
     "new covenant" (Matt. 26:28) and to gain justice for the world by
     casting out Satan, the foreigner who had usurped the position of
     " 'ruler of this world' " (John 12:31-33).

       Look at Isaiah 42:1-4, the depiction of Christ. Spend some time
       dwelling on the life of Jesus. What specific characteristics of His
       ministry so aptly fulfilled this prophecy? What lessons can we
       learn about how we should be ministering to others, as well?

                TUESDAY May 25


     Persian "Messiah" (Isa. 44:26-45:6).
What stunning prediction appears in Isaiah 44:26-45:6?


       Isaiah's ministry lasted from about 745 B.C. to about 685 B.c. After
     mentioning a conqueror from the east and from the north (Isa. 41:2, 3,
     25) and implying that this was to be good news for Jerusalem (vs. 27),
     Isaiah accurately predicted Cyrus by name and described his activities.
     He did come from north and east of Babylon to conquer it in 539 B.c.;
     he did serve God by releasing the Jews from their Babylonian exile;
     and he did authorize the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem (com-
     pare Ezra 1).
        Put this prediction into perspective. Since there are about 146 years
     from the time of Isaiah's death to the fall of Babylon, his prophecy
     was a century and a half ahead of its time. Because the actions of
     Cyrus are well attested from a variety of ancient sources, including
     Babylonian chronicles, his own report in the "Cyrus Cylinder," and the
     Bible (2 Chron. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1; Daniel 5; 6:28; 10:1), the accuracy
     of Isaiah's prophecy is beyond dispute. This confirms the faith of peo-
     ple who believe that true prophets receive accurate predictions from
     God, who knows the future far in advance.

Why does God call Cyrus His "anointed" (Isa. 45:1)?


        The Hebrew word for "anointed" here is the word from which we get
      the word "Messiah." Elsewhere in the Old Testament, this word could
      refer to an anointed high priest (Lev. 4:3, 5, 16; 6:22), an anointed
      Israelite king (1 Sam. 16:6; 24:6, 10; 2 Sam. 22:51), or the Messiah, a
      future ideal Davidic king and deliverer (Ps. 2:2; Dan. 9:25, 26). From
      Isaiah's perspective, Cyrus was a future king, sent by God to deliver His
      people. But he was an unusual messiah, because he was non-Israelite.
      He would do some things the Messiah would do, such as defeat God's
      enemies and release His captive people, but he could not be the same
      as the Messiah, because he was not descended from David.
         By predicting Cyrus, God proved His unique divinity by demonstrat-
      ing that He alone knows the future (Isa. 41:4, 21-23, 26-28; 44:26). He
      also reached out to Cyrus: "I will give you the treasures of darkness and
      riches hidden in secret places, so that you may know that it is I, the
       Lord, the God of Israel, who call you by your name" (Isa. 45:3, NRSV).

       Think about some other Bible prophecies that have come to pass
       as predicted (such as all the kingdoms of Daniel 2 except the last,
       Daniel 7, or regarding the time of Christ in Daniel 9:24-27).
       What kind of hope do these prophecies offer us as individuals?

                                                                            75
         WEDNESDAY May 26


      Hope in Advance
        The fact that Isaiah accurately predicted Cyrus by name disturbs
     people who do not believe that prophets receive predictions from God.
     To cope, they accept the theory that a "second Isaiah," another
     prophet living in the time of Cyrus, wrote Isaiah 40-66. Thus, the
     book of Isaiah is "sawn in two," the same fate traditionally understood
     to have befallen the prophet himself (compare Heb. 11:37).
        There is, however, no historical witness to the existence of a second
     "Isaiah." If he did exist, it would be strange for the Bible not to men-
     tion him, because his message is profoundly important, and his liter-
     ary artistry is phenomenal. Not even the oldest Bible manuscript, the
     Isaiah scroll from Qumran, has any break between Isaiah 39 and 40
     that would indicate a transition to the work of a new author.
        Isaiah's basic message is consistent throughout his book: Trust the
     true God, including His messianic Deliverer, rather than other powers.
     Scholars rightly emphasize the shift in focus from the Assyrian period
     in Isaiah 1-39 to the Babylonian period in chapters 40 and following.
     But we have found that Isaiah 13-14 and 39 already envisage a
     Babylonian captivity. It is true Isaiah 1-39 emphasizes judgment and
     40-66 emphasizes consolation. But in the earlier chapters, divine
     comfort and assurance is abundant also, and later passages, such as
     Isaiah 42:18-25, 43:22-28, 48:1-11, speak of God's judgments on
     Judah for forsaking Him. In fact, Isaiah's predictions of future com-
     fort imply suffering in the meantime.

Though the nation did face terrible calamity because of their sins,
     some people among them did not give up hope. They clung to
     God's promises, such as found in Leviticus 26:40-45. Read the
     texts carefully. Put yourself in the place of those Hebrews who are
     alive after the nation's defeat by Babylon. What hope could you
     find in these words?




      Read once more through Leviticus 26:40-45. What spiritual
      principle do you see at work in those verses? What is the Lord
      saying to them there? How does the same principle work in our
      own lives?

             THURSDAY May 27


     A Feeling and a Suffering Servant
     (Isa. 49:1-12).

Who is God's servant in Isaiah 49:1-12?

        God calls and names him before he is born, makes his mouth like a
     sword, and will be glorified in him. God uses the servant to bring the
     nation of Israel back to Himself to be a light of salvation to all the
     world, to be a covenant, and to release prisoners. There is plenty of
     overlap between this description and that of Isaiah 42, where we iden-
     tified the servant as the Messiah. The New Testament finds the ser-
     vant's attributes in Jesus Christ, in both comings: Matt. 1:21; John
     8:12, 9:5, 17:1-5, Rev. 1:16, 2:16, 19:15.

If this servant is the Messiah, why does God call Him "Israel"
      here (Isa. 49:3)?


        Earlier we found that in this section of Isaiah, God's servant
     "Israel/Jacob" refers to the nation. But here the name "Israel" (with-
     out a parallel reference to "Jacob") clearly applies to the individual
     servant, who restores the nation to God (Isa. 49:5). The individual
     servant has become the ideal embodiment or representative of the
     nation, whose failure has compromised its use of the name "Israel"
     (Isa. 48:1).

What new element appears here? Isa. 49:4, 7.

        Here is the first intimation of the difficulty involved in the servant's
      task. He laments, " 'I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength
      for nothing and vanity' " (vs. 4, NRSV), an idea echoed in Daniel 9:26:
      "an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing" (NRSV). But
      he clings to faith: " 'Yet surely my cause is with the Lord, and my
      reward with my God' " (Isa. 49:4, NRSV). Isaiah 49:7 is startling. The
      servant is "deeply despised, abhorred by the nations, the slave of
      rulers," but God says to him: " 'Kings shall see and stand up, princes,
      and they shall prostrate themselves, because of the Lord, who is faith-
      ful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you' " (NRSV).

       Look back at Christ's ministry. Right up until the end, didn't
       He have reasons for discouragement? Yet, He stayed faithful,
       despite outward appearances. How are we to do the same—
       despite outward appearances?

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White's description of Jesus' heal-
      ing and teaching ministry in "At Capernaum," The Desire of Ages,
      pp. 252-261.

        "In the work of soul-winning, great tact and wisdom are needed.
      The Saviour never suppressed the truth, but He uttered it always in
      love. In His intercourse with others, He exercised the greatest tact, and
      He was always kind and thoughtful. He was never rude, never need-
      lessly spoke a severe word, never gave unnecessary pain to a sensitive
      soul. He did not censure human weakness. He fearlessly denounced
      hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His voice as He
      uttered His scathing rebukes. He never made truth cruel, but ever
      manifested a deep tenderness for humanity. Every soul was precious
      in His sight. He bore Himself with divine dignity; yet He bowed with
      the tenderest compassion and regard to every member of the family of
      God. He saw in all, souls whom it was His mission to save."—Ellen
      G. White, Gospel Workers, p. 117.

Discussion Questions:
    0 As a class, read over what Ellen White wrote above about how
       Christ ministered to others. Discuss the principles there and then
       as a class discuss how well your local church, corporately, reflects
       those principles.

           Do you know a "bruised reed" or "dimly burning wick" (Isa.
       42:3)? How can you help this person without "breaking" or
       "quenching" him or her? In what ways can you point this person
       to the Lord? What would you tell him or her, in a practical sense,
       to do, in order to receive healing and help?

       e  The argument for different authors of Isaiah originated from
       the premise that people cannot tell the future the way Isaiah did.
       What is the fundamental problem with this argument, and why,
       as Christians, must we reject its premise outright?

Summary: Deliverance requires a Deliverer. God's servant nation
    would be delivered by two deliverers: Cyrus, who would set the cap-
    tives free from Babylonian exile, and an unnamed Servant, whose
    identity as the Messiah is progressively revealed. This Servant would
    restore justice and bring back the community of survivors to God.

Searching
for Souls
J. H. ZACHARY

   Dr. M— is a dentist living in a Muslim region. He wanted a more mean-
ingful relationship with Allah, God, and decided to study about Jesus, who
is mentioned in the Koran. He studied the Bible with a Protestant minis-
ter, but he was puzzled. Why do Christians eat pork? he wondered. After
all, both the Bible and the Koran forbid eating unclean meats. And why do
they reject the Sabbath? Dr. M— wondered if there were any believers in
Jesus who followed all the Bible teachings.
   One day he learned about a church that kept the Bible Sabbath. He made
an appointment to visit with the church pastor. "I have been a Muslim all
my life," Dr. M— said. "Now I believe that Jesus is the Messiah. I want to
worship Allah as the Bible teaches, but it seems that Christians do not fol-
low the Bible. Now I have learned that your church follows the Sabbath
that is taught in the Bible, and your members avoid unclean foods. I want
to learn more about your beliefs."
   The pastor gladly agreed to study the Bible with Dr. M—, and a year
later the former Muslim dentist decided to join the Adventist church.
   In his clinic, Dr. M— began to share his testimony with his clients. He
asks God to work on their hearts as he works on their teeth. So far the Lord
 has blessed him with over 170 professions of faith.
   One evening Dr. M— invited the pastor to go with him on a special boat
trip. When the pastor arrived at the dock, he found the boat crowded with
more than one hundred fifty people. The boat made its way down river to
 a hidden cove, and there by the moon's dim light, 60 people were baptized
 in the cold river. The baptism had to be kept secret, because it is against
 the law to change religions in the country where Dr. M—works. Following
 the baptism, the group enjoyed a simple breakfast; and as the sun rose, the
 happy group reboarded the boat and started for home.
    Throughout the Muslim world doors of interest in Jesus are opening.
 Some countries are easier to enter than others, but every Muslim needs to
 hear that Jesus is the Messiah. Pray for Dr. M— and others who have
 accepted the gospel and are sharing it with their Muslim friends.

        LESSON 10 *May 29—June 4


      Doing the
      Unthinkable



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

             ough Fook, a Chinese Christian, was moved with compassion

      L      for those of his compatriots who had become slaves in African
             mines. He wanted to give them the hope of the gospel, but
      how could he have access to them? His solution was to sell himself
      for a term of five years as a slave. He was transported to Demerara,
      where he toiled in the mines and told his fellow workers about
      Jesus.
         Lough Fook died, but not until 200 people were liberated from
      hopelessness by accepting Jesus as their Savior.
        Talk about self-sacrifice for the good of others. What an example!
         By doing the unthinkable, that is, humbly "taking the form of a
      slave" (Phil. 2:7, NRSV), Jesus, too, had reached the unreachable—
      you and I and all the world steeped and lost in the abyss of sin.
        This week we'll see this incredible event prophesied hundreds of
      years before it happened.

The Week at a Glance: How does Isaiah prepare us for
      what's coming in regard to the death of Jesus? How is Jesus pre-
      sented in these verses? What's the key theme in Isaiah 53? How is
      the idea of substitutionary atonement presented there?

Memory Text: "But he was wounded for our transgressions,
      crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that
      made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5,
      NRSV).

     Isaiah's Testing Truth                    (Isa. 50:4-10).

       If Isaiah intended to convey only information, he would have laid
     out all the details regarding the Messiah at once. But in order to teach,
     persuade, and give his audience an encounter with the Servant of the
     Lord, he develops a rich fabric of recurring themes in symphonic
     fashion. He unfolds God's message in steps so that each aspect can be
     grasped in relation to the rest of the picture. Isaiah is an artist whose
     canvas is the soul of his listener.

Read Isaiah 50:4-10. Summarize what these verses are saying. How
     do you see Jesus in there?


        We found in Isaiah 49:7 that God's servant is despised, abhorred,
     and "the slave of rulers" (NRSV) but that "Kings shall see and stand
     up, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves" (NRSV). Here in
     chapter 50 we learn that the valley is deeper for the gentle Teacher
     whose words sustain the weary (vs. 4): His path to vindication leads
     through physical abuse (vs. 6).
        This abuse sounds bad to those of us in modern Western cultures.
     But in an ancient Near Eastern culture, honor was a life and death
     matter for a person and his or her group. If you insulted and mis-
     treated someone like this, you better be well protected: If given half a
     chance, the victim and/or his or her clan would surely retaliate.
        King David attacked and conquered the country of Ammon
     (2 Samuel 1-12) because its king had merely "seized David's envoys,
     shaved off half the beard of each, cut off their garments in the middle
     at their hips, and sent them away" (2 Sam. 10:4, NRSV). But in Isaiah
     50 people strike the servant, painfully pluck out hairs from his beard,
     and spit at him. What makes these actions an international, intercos-
     mic incident is that the victim is the envoy of the divine King of kings.
     In fact, by comparing Isaiah 9:6, 7 and 11:1-16 with other "servant"
      passages, we find that the servant is the King, the mighty Deliverer!
      But with all His power and honor, for some unthinkable reason, He
      does not save Himself! This is so strange that people didn't believe it.
      At Jesus' cross, leaders mocked him: " 'He saved others; let him save
      himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!' "(Luke 23:35,
      NRSV); " 'Let him come down from the cross now, and we will
      believe in him' " (Matt. 27:42, NRSV).

       Read through Isaiah 50:4-10. Write down the spiritual princi-
       ples depicted here that should be applied to our own lives. Look
       at yourself in light of the list you make. In what areas could you
       do better? If discouraged, then read on for the rest of the week.


                                                                            81
                MONDAY May 31


      The Suffering Servant Poem                         (Isa. 52 : 13-53: 12).

        Isaiah 52:13-53:12, known as the "Suffering Servant Poem," con-
     firms Isaiah's reputation as "the gospel prophet." In harmony with the
     excellence of the gospel, the poem towers above other literature.
        Though breathtakingly short, every phrase is packed with profound
     meaning that reveals the core of God's unthinkable quest to save a
     race steeped and lost in sin.
        This is not the "milk" of Isaiah's word. He has prepared his audi-
     ence by developing the Messianic theme from the early part of his
     book. Following the overall course of the Messiah's life on earth, the
     prophet started with His conception and birth (Isa. 7:14), introduced
     His identity as a divine Davidic king (Isa. 9:6, 7), and elaborated on
     His work of restoration for Israel (Isa. 11:1-16) and quiet ministry of
     liberation from injustice and suffering (Isa. 42:1-7). Then Isaiah
     revealed that the Messiah's grand drama includes the contrast of
     tragedy before exaltation (Isa. 49:1-12, 50:6-10). Now the Suffering
     Servant Poem plumbs the depths of the tragedy.

Go back over those sections listed in the above paragraph. Review
     what they tell us about the Messiah, Jesus. How do they help pre-
     pare us for what's coming in Isaiah 52 and 53? Or do they simply
     make what happens in Isaiah 52 and 53 more striking?


        Isaiah 52:13-53:1 introduce the poem with a preview containing a
     stunning contrast: The Servant will prosper and be exalted, but His
     appearance will be marred beyond recognition. Who can believe it?
        Verses 2 and 3 begin a painful descent from the Servant's origin and
     ordinary appearance to His sorrow and rejection. Verses 4-6 pause to
     explain that His suffering is our punishment, which He bears to heal
     us. Verses 7-9 continue the innocent Servant's descent to the grave.
        In verses 10-12, the Servant ascends to the exalted reward foreseen
     at the beginning of the poem starting in Isaiah 52:13, with the added
     insight that His sacrifice to save others is the will of God.
        Compare the "valley" shape of Philippians 2:5-11, where Jesus
     begins in the form of God but descends by emptying Himself to take
     on the bondage of human form, humbling Himself down to death, and
     the lowest of all deaths: death on a cross. Therefore, God highly exalts
     Him so that everyone should acknowledge Him as Lord (compare Isa.
     49:7).

      Read Isaiah 52:13-53:12. Write down everything the poem says
      that Jesus has done for us. Dwell on what those actions in our
      behalf mean to us.

               TUESDAY June 1


     Who Has Believed?                    (Isa. 52:13-53:12).

        In Isaiah 52:13 God's Servant is highly exalted, but without warn-
     ing, the next verse describes His appearance as so disfigured He can-
     not be recognized as one of the "sons of men." The New Testament
     describes the factors that marred Jesus' appearance, including scourg-
     ing, a crown of thorns, crucifixion, but, above all, bearing the sin of
     the human race. Sin was never intended to be natural for humans;
     bearing it made the "Son of Man" appear inhuman.
        Compare the story of Job, who suddenly plummeted from a posi-
     tion of great wealth, honor, and power to a miserable wretch sitting
     among ashes on the ground and scraping his painful sores with a pot-
     sherd (Job 1-2). The contrast was so great that not even Job's friends
     recognized him at first (Job 2:12). The question is: Why does Job suf-
     fer? Why must God's Messiah suffer? Neither deserves it. Both are
     innocent. Why, then, the suffering?

Read through the text for today and write down the places where the
      theme of the innocent suffering for the guilty appears. What is the
      essential message there for us?




         Look at the questions in Isaiah 53:1. These questions emphasize the
      challenge of believing the unbelievable (compare John 12:37-41) and
      warn us to sit down for the rest of the story. But the questions also
      imply an appeal. In this context, the parallel between the two ques-
      tions implies that the Lord's arm/power of salvation (compare Isa.
      52:10) is revealed to those who believe the report. Do you want to
      experience God's saving power? Then believe the report.

       Look carefully at Isaiah 53:6. What is the specific message
       there? What is that text saying to you, personally, that should
       give you hope despite your past sins and failures?




                                                                          83
         WEDNESDAY June 2


     The Unreachable Is Us!                       (Isa. 53:3-9).

        Like a vulnerable plant, apparently of no special value, and
     despised (Isa. 53:2, 3)—that's the depiction we are given here of the
     Suffering Servant. Isaiah has quickly brought us through innocent
     youth to the brink of the abyss. Even with the background provided
     earlier, we are not prepared in the sense that we are resigned to the
     Servant's fate. To the contrary! Isaiah has taught us to cherish the
     Child born to us, the supreme Prince of Peace. Others despise Him,
     but we know who He really is.
        As someone has said: "We have met the enemy and they are us."
     The Servant is not the first to be despised, rejected, or a man of suf-
     fering. King David was all those when he fled from his son, Absalom
     (2 Sam. 15:30). But the suffering borne by this servant is not His own
     and does not result from His own sin. Nor does He bear it merely for
     another individual; "the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all"
     (Isa. 53:6, NRSV).
        The answer to the question "Why?" is Isaiah's testing truth:
     Because of God's love, His Messiah would choose to suffer. But why?
     Isaiah drives the "golden spike" to complete the unthinkable truth: He
     would choose to suffer in order to reach the unreachable, and the
     unreachable is us!
        Those who do not understand regard the servant as "struck down by
     God" (Isa. 53:4, NRSV). Just as Job's friends thought his sin must
     have caused his suffering, and just as Jesus' disciples asked Him
     " 'who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?' "
     (John 9:2, NRSV), those who saw Jesus on the cross assumed the
     worst. Didn't Moses say that "anyone hung on a tree is under God's
     curse" (Deut. 21:23; compare Num. 25:4)?
        Yet, all this was God's will (Isa. 53:10). Why? Because "Christ
     redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us"
     (Gal. 3:13, NRSV). Because God "made him to be sin who knew no
     sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God" (2 Cor
     5:21). "Imagine that! In a sense, Christ became sin! He bore every
     evil passion and selfish.degradation of the billions of people who have
     ever inhabited our planet. With that overwhelming deluge of misery
     collected upon Him and identified with Him as if He were the per-
     sonification of all evil, He gave Himself up for destruction in order to
     wipe out all sin and all of its consequences."—Roy Gane, Altar Call,
     p. 77, author's emphasis.

      The punishment for the sins of the whole world—every sin, by
      every sinner—fell upon Christ at the Cross, at once, as the only
      means to save us! What does this tell us about how bad sin is that
      such a price had to be paid? What does it tell us about God's love
      that He would do this for us, even at such a great cost?

84
             THURSDAY June 3


       A Transforming Reparation Offering
      (Isa. 53:10-12).

What does it mean that the Servant's life is "an offering for sin" (vs.
      10, NRSV)?


         The Hebrew word refers to a "guilt/reparation offering" (Lev
      5:14-6:7, 7:1-7), which could atone for deliberate wrongs against
      other people (Lev. 6:2, 3). Such sins were singled out by Isaiah
      (Isaiah 1-3; 10:1, 2; 58). Also, the sinner must restore to the wronged
      person that which was taken, plus a penalty, before offering the sac-
      rifice to receive forgiveness from God (Lev. 6:4-7; compare Matt.
      5:23, 24). In a case of inadvertent misuse of something that belongs
      to God, the reparation goes to Him (Lev. 5:16).
         Now we can understand Isaiah 40:2, where God comforts His
      exiled people by telling them they have paid enough reparation for
      their sins.
         But following the reparation, there must be a sacrifice. Here it is in
      Isaiah 53: God's Servant, instead of a ram, is led like a sheep to the
      slaughter (Isa. 53:7) on behalf of people who have gone astray (vs. 6).
         Although "cut off from the land of the living" (vs. 8, NRSV;• com-
      pare Dan. 9:26), completely consumed in the sacrifice that kindles
      the flame of hope for us, the Servant comes forth from death, the land
      of no return, to receive exaltation, see His "offspring," and prolong
      his days (Isa. 53:10-12).

Look up each of the following verses. How does each one reflect the
      same basic message as Isaiah 53?

      Ps. 32:1, 2

      Rom. 5:8

      Gal. 2:16

      Phil. 3:9

      Heb. 2:9

       1 Pet. 2:24

        If someone were to ask you to summarize in a single paragraph
        the good news of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, what would you write?

                                                                             85
                   FRIDAY June 4

Further Study: "What a price has been paid for us! Behold the
      cross, and the Victim uplifted upon it. Look at those hands, pierced
      with the cruel nails. Look at His feet, fastened with spikes to the tree.
      Christ bore our sins in His own body. That suffering, that agony, is the
      price of your redemption."—Ellen G. White, God's Amazing Grace,
      p. 172.
         "Christ bore our sins in His own body on the tree. . . . What must
      sin be, if no finite being could make atonement? What must its curse
      be if Deity alone could exhaust it? The cross of Christ testifies to
      every man that the penalty of sin is death. . . . Oh, must there be some
      strong bewitching power which holds the moral senses, steeling them
      against the impressions of the Spirit of God?"—Ellen G. White, Our
      High Calling, p. 44.
         "The law of God's government was to be magnified by the death of
      God's only-begotten Son. Christ bore the guilt of the sins of the world.
      Our sufficiency is found only in the incarnation and death of the Son
      of God. He could suffer, because [He was] sustained by divinity. He
      could endure, because He was without one taint of disloyalty or sin.
      Christ triumphed in man's behalf in thus bearing the justice of pun-
      ishment. He secured eternal life to men, while He exalted the law, and
      made it honorable."—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1,
      p. 302.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Verses 7-9 of Isaiah 53 descend to the depths of the abyss: the
       Servant's death and burial. How many aspects of these verses
       were fulfilled at the end of Jesus' life? Matt. 26:57-27:60, Mark
       14:53-15:46, Luke 22:54-23:53, John 18:12-19:42.

          Look at the last quote above by Ellen White about Christ's
       death magnifying the law. What does she mean by that? How do
       we understand His death as proof of the perpetuity of the law?

Summary: Having told about the birth, identity, and career of God's
     Deliverer, Isaiah finally reveals the supreme tragedy that gives us
     hope: To reach, save, and heal lost people, including us, God's Servant
     voluntarily bears our suffering and punishment.

Peace Beyond
Understanding
IVANKA GEORGIEVA
   A close friend of mine teaches in the same village I do in Bulgaria. My
friend was not a Christian, and she was undergoing great troubles. Her
boyfriend died in an accident, and nothing would console her. One day she
called me and sobbed, "I cannot stand to live any longer. I am going to end
my life!" I feared for her, because I knew this was not an empty threat. I
begged her to give God a chance, to open the Bible I had given her and
read it.
   "Come on," she wept, "give me a break with this Bible thing! Don't you
understand? I'm dying inside. I can't stand it any longer!"
   We live far from each other, and I could not get to her quickly. But I
knew that God could be beside her in an instant. I knelt and begged God
for my friend's life. After awhile the phone rang. It was my friend, but I
hardly recognized her voice. "You know, I must be crazy," she said. "A lit-
tle while after I hung up, I picked up that Bible you gave me and started
to read it. Suddenly such a peace flooded my heart that I was sure I must
be losing my mind."
   We talked for several more minutes, and I told her, "The peace you feel
is the peace of God. It is so overwhelming that we cannot understand it.
God is reaching out to you, asking you to give Him a chance to make your
life meaningful."
   Often I had invited my friend to attend church, but she would not come
regularly. However, after this experience she often asked me to take her to
                              church. She began studying the Bible and
                              eventually surrendered her life to God.
                                 People who don't know God don't realize
                              that God's peace can be theirs just for the ask-
                              ing. My friend's experience is a living example
                              of the difference God can make in a person's
                              life, a difference people cannot understand un-
                              til they experience it for themselves.

        LESSON 1 1 *June 5-11


      Waging Love




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

               Jewish cantor (worship leader) and his wife who lived in

      A        Lincoln, Nebraska, began receiving threatening and obscene
               phone calls. They discovered the calls came from a leader of
      an American hate group, the Ku Klux Klan. Knowing his identity,
      they could have turned him in to the police. But they decided on a
      more radical approach. When they learned that he was crippled, they
      showed up at his door with dinner! He was utterly flabbergasted. His
      hatred melted before their love. The couple kept visiting him, and the
      friendship grew. He even thought of becoming Jewish!
         "Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to
      undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break
      every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry . . .?" (Isa.
      58:6, 7, NRSV). Ironically, the couple in Lincoln kept such a fast by
      sharing their feast with a hungry oppressor, thereby setting him free
      from his own bonds of unjust prejudice! Let's learn more about this
      important spiritual principle as depicted by the prophet Isaiah.

The Week at a Glance: What did salvation cost? Why
      was the Lord unhappy with His people's worship? How does the
      Lord expect us to treat the poor and needy among us? What is
      true religion all about? What are the blessings that come to those
      who give of themselves for others?

Memory Text: "If you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy
      the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness
      and your gloom be like the noonday" (Isaiah 58:10, NRSV).

     Buy Something Free?                        (Isa. 55:1-7).

Read this text: "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and
     you that have no money, come, buy and eat!" (Isa. 55:1, NRSV).
     What contradiction do you see there?


       Suppose you took food and stood on the street in a big city and
     announced to the hungry and homeless there: "Yo, you who have no
     money, come, buy and eat!" But how can they buy if they have no
     money?
        However, if you add the words, as Isaiah did: "without money and
     without price" (vs. 1, NRSV), the point becomes clearer. Isaiah appeals
     to people to accept forgiveness (vs. 7) freely. Yet, the word buy empha-
     sizes that what God offers people to meet their needs and desires is
     valuable, so receiving it requires a transaction (transfer of something
     of worth). God freely offers forgiveness within the framework of a
     restored covenant relation with His people, but not because it was free
     for Him: He bought it at the terrible, blood-drenched price of His own
     Servant. Though free, it came with a terrible cost to Himself.

What was the price for our salvation? See 1 Pet. 1:18, 19.

HOw does Isaiah's approach to salvation compare with that of the
    New Testament? Eph. 2:8, 9.




         Isaiah encapsulates the gospel in the Old Testament, which is the
      same as the gospel in the New Testament. There was no "old-covenant"
      salvation by works, to be superseded by "new-covenant" salvation by
      grace. Ever since God's promise of a Deliverer to Adam and Eve (Gen.
      3:15), there has been only one way to salvation: by grace through faith
      (Eph. 2:8); "the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"
      (Rom. 6:23, NRSV). From the ancient Gilgamesh, who did heroic
      exploits in a vain search for eternal life, to modern actors who believe
      in reincarnation, people have tried all different routes to salvation, but
      all are fruitless. This is why they need to know about Jesus and what He
      has accomplished for them at the Cross.

       Salvation is free, in that there's nothing we can do to earn it.
       Our works can never be good enough to save us. Yet, at the same
       time, it can cost us everything. What does that mean? See, for
       instance, Matt. 10:39, Luke 9:23, 14:26, Phil. 3:8.

                                                                              89
                MONDAY June 7


      High Thoughts and Ways                         (Isa. 55:6-13).

Why does God say His thoughts and ways are higher than ours, "as
      the heavens are higher than the earth" (vss. 8, 9, NRSV)? What do
      you think that means?




        There's no question that the God who created a universe in which
      even some of the simplest things contain mysteries that our minds
      cannot begin to fathom is a God whose ways are beyond what we can
      ever begin to fully grasp. This knowledge of His infinite superiority
      should, therefore, make it easier for us to humbly receive His help.
      See Isa. 57:15.

Read Isaiah 55:6-9. What is the context in which the Lord talks about
      how His ways and thoughts are higher than what we can imagine?
      What is He saying He does that is so hard for us to grasp?


        Of all the great mysteries of the universe, no doubt the greatest one
     of all is the plan of salvation, a mystery we can barely begin to under-
     stand. (See Eph. 6:19.) That the Creator of the universe would stoop
     to clothe Himself in humanity, live a life of toil and suffering, only to
     die then in our behalf, a sacrifice for sin, all in order that He could
     pardon us and show mercy to us is a truth that will, for all the ages of
     eternity, thrill the hearts of God's created beings.
       "The theme of redemption is one that angels desire to look into; it
     will be the science and the song of the redeemed throughout the
     ceaseless ages of eternity. Is it not worthy of careful thought and study
     now? . . .
       "The subject is inexhaustible. The study of the incarnation of
     Christ, His atoning sacrifice, and mediatorial work will employ the
     mind of the diligent student as long as time shall last; and looking to
     heaven with its unnumbered years, he will exclaim, 'Great is the mys-
     tery of godliness.—Ellen G. White, My Lift Today, p. 360.

      Look at the bad things you have done: the people whom you
      have hurt, the unkind words you have spoken, the ways in which
      you have disappointed others, not to mention yourself. And yet,
      through Jesus, you can be forgiven all these things and stand,
      right now, perfect and righteous in the sight of God. If that isn't
      a mystery, what is?

     Fast Friends             (Isa. 58:1-8).

What is the "fast" referred to in verse 3?

       This must be the fast of the Day of Atonement, the only fast com-
     manded by God (Lev. 16:29, 31; 23:27-32). This is confirmed in
     Isaiah 58:3 by the parallel expression "humble ourselves" (NRSV),
     which follows the terminology of Leviticus. Humbling oneself
     referred to various forms of self-denial, including fasting (compare
     Ps. 35:13; Dan. 10:2, 3, 12).
        The Day of Atonement setting explains God's command to "Lift up
     your voice like a trumpet!" (Isa. 58:1, NRSV). This kind of ram's horn
     trumpet, called a shofar, was to be blown as a memorial or reminder
     ten days before the Day of Atonement (Lev. 23:24). Furthermore,
     every fiftieth year, on the Day of Atonement, it was to announce the
     beginning of the Jubilee year of freedom (Lev. 25:9, 10; compare Isa.
     27:13).

Read Isaiah 58:3-7. What is the Lord complaining to them about?
      What was wrong with their "fast"?




        It seems the people were expecting the Lord to congratulate them
      for their "piety." Of course, they had it all backwards. Practicing self-
      denial on the Day of Atonement was to express their gratitude and
      loyalty to Him on the day the high priest went before God to cleanse
      the sanctuary and thereby cleanse them from sins for which they had
      already been forgiven (Levitus 16; compare chapter 4). Their acts
      should have been done in thankfulness and gratitude to the God who
      saved them in the day of judgment, not in order to get God's approval
      for their "piety" and "devotion." After all, it was the sins of the peo-
      ple that had defiled God's sanctuary. It had to be cleansed with blood
      that was shed because of what they had done.

       One of the crucial lessons that comes from these texts regards
       the difference between being religious and truly being a fol-
       lower of Christ. How do we see the difference there? How do we,
       as individuals, face the same danger as those presented here,
       which is believing that our religious rituals somehow show we
       are really following the Lord as He asks us to?

                                                                            91
         WEDNESDAY June 9


      Fast Fight          (Isa. 58:1-12).

        Ten days after trumpet blasts have reminded God's people that the
      Lord is acclaimed as their King and, on the very Day of Atonement
      when their humility through self-denial is to affirm their loyalty to
      Him as King, the prophet lifts up his voice like a trumpet to declare
      that they are rebelling against Him (Isa. 58:1).

Read through Isaiah 58:6-12. What are acts that God considers true
     acts of self-denial? After all, what's harder—to skip a few meals
     or to use your own time and money to feed the homeless in your
     town? What is the principle to be seen behind these acts? How do
     these acts compose true religion?




        Anyone can be religious; anyone can go through religious rituals,
     even the right rituals, at the right time, with all the right formulas. But
     that alone is not what the Lord wants. Look at the life of Jesus.
     However faithful He was to the religious rituals of His time, the
     gospel writers focused so much more on His acts of mercy, healing,
     feeding, and forgiveness to those in need than on His faithfulness to
     ritual.
        The Lord seeks a church, a people, who will preach truth to the
     world. But what is going to better attract people to the truth as it is in
     Jesus: strict adherence to dietary laws or a willingness to help the
     hungry? Strict rest on the Sabbath or a willingness to spend your own
     time and energy helping those who are in need?

Read Matthew 25:40 and James 1:27. What do they tell us?




      Look at the blessings in Isaiah 58 that God says will come to
      those who seek to minister to the less fortunate. What do you
      think the Lord is saying to us here? Are these promises of
      supernatural intervention for our lives if we do these things?
      Or, perhaps, is He telling us of the natural blessing we receive
      by giving of ourselves to others as opposed to being selfish,
      greedy, and self-absorbed? Explain your answer.

     A Time for Us              (Isa. 58:13, 14).

Why does Isaiah discuss the Sabbath in Isaiah 58:13, 14? What con-
     nection does this have with the Day of Atonement setting of the
     earlier verses?


       The yearly Day of Atonement was a Sabbath day. This special cer-
     emonial Sabbath was like the weekly Sabbath in that all work of any
     kind was prohibited (Lev. 23:27-32). Therefore, as recognized by
     early Seventh-day Adventists, the rule that the Day of Atonement
     period of rest lasted from evening to evening (Lev. 23:32) informs us
     that the same must be true of the weekly Sabbath. Similarly, although
     the primary context of Isaiah 58:13, 14 is the ceremonial Day of
     Atonement Sabbath, its message also applies to the weekly Sabbath.

Read Isaiah 58:13. What kind of day is the Sabbath supposed to be?
      How can we make our Sabbath experience like the one depicted
      here? Also, when you think about what the Sabbath represents,
      why should it be the kind of day described in this text?




        Isaiah 58 deals with three main themes: self-denial, social kind-
      ness, and the Sabbath.
        What are the connections between them?
        First, all three involve concentration upon God, His priorities, and
      recognition of dependence upon Him. Second, by doing all three,
      humans pursue holiness by emulating God (see Lev. 19:2), who, in the
      form of Christ, humbled Himself (Phil. 2:8), who demonstrates self-
      sacrificing kindness (John 3:16), and who ceased from labor on the
      Sabbath at the end of the Creation week (Gen. 2:2, 3; Exod. 20:11).

       Look at these other ties between the themes of self-denial, social
       kindness, and the Sabbath, as depicted in Isaiah 58: Sabbath
       freedom from weekly toil is kind to people because it lets them
       be refreshed (Exod. 23:12, Mark 2:27); Jesus showed that kind
       acts are appropriate on the Sabbath (Mark 3:1-5, John 5:1-17);
       true Sabbath keeping brings joy (Isa. 58:14), as does helping
       others (vss. 10, 11). What must change in your own life in order
       to experience these blessings yourself?




                                                                         93
                  FRIDAY June 11

Further Study: "No one can practice real benevolence without
     self-denial. Only by a life of simplicity, self-denial, and close econ-
     omy is it possible for us to accomplish the work appointed us as
     Christ's representatives. Pride and worldly ambition must be put out
     of our hearts. In all our work the principle of unselfishness revealed
     in Christ's life is to be carried out. Upon the walls of our homes, the
     pictures, the furnishings, we are to read, 'Bring the poor that are cast
     out to thy house.' On our wardrobes we are to see written, as with the
     finger of God, 'Clothe the naked.' In the dining room, on the table
     laden with abundant food, we should see traced, 'Is it not to deal thy
     bread to the hungry?' Isaiah 58:7."—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of
     Healing, p. 206.

Discussion Questions:
      O Look at the question Isaiah asked the people of his time:
      "Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and
      your labor for that which does not satisfy?" (1sa. 55:2, NRSV).
      Ask yourself, in what ways, if any, are we doing the same thing,
      laboring for that which does not satisfy? Why is it so easy to get
      caught up in that very trap?

      O If self-denial, social kindness, and the Sabbath were impor-
      tant on the day of atonement in Isaiah's day, are they just as
      important in the end-time Day of Atonement (Dan. 8:14), during
      which God's Jubilee trumpet will signal ultimate freedom at the
      second coming of Christ (1 Cor. 15:52; compare Lev. 25:9, 10)?
      Explain your answer.

      • Open up a discussion on the question of Sabbath keeping.
      What do you think Isaiah means when he says we should turn
      away from doing our own pleasure on the Sabbath, and yet at the
      same time call it a "delight" (Isa. 58:13)? How can we do both?
      Keep in mind the context of the complete text of Isaiah 58.

Summary: In Isaiah 55 and 58, the prophet appeals to his people to
     give up their thoughts and ways and return to God, whose ideal for
     their happiness is so much higher than their own. God mercifully par-
     dons and then insists that the pardoned be merciful, in harmony with
     the spirit of the Day of Atonement and the Sabbath, because the gift
     of God's forgiveness transforms the heart if it is truly received.

Soldier for Christ
DANSON KILONZO

  Army life in Kenya is tough. We beat people and even killed some peo-
ple during civil disturbances.
   When I was stationed in eastern Kenya, some students and teachers
from the Adventist university held meetings near our base. One speaker
said that if Jesus were living on earth today, He would be an Adventist.
This intrigued me, and I began asking questions and reading the Bible to
find out why this church was different.
   Three of us on our base decided to attend the Adventist church, but we
were supposed to work on Saturdays. When the commander saw us leav-
ing the base one Saturday, he became angry and forbade us to leave the
base. So we met to pray together under a mango tree every Sabbath.
   My cousin came to visit me. He was an Adventist, but he did not know
I was interested in religion. He was surprised to find me reading the Bible.
When I told him that my friends and I met under a mango tree to pray
because the commanding officer would not allow us to leave the base to
attend church, he offered to help. He wrote a letter for me to take to the
commander, asking to release me from military duty so I could attend
school at the Adventist university. The commander agreed, provided no
fighting broke out during that time.
   I traveled to the university, and there I learned more about Jesus. I
learned what it meant to keep the Sabbath and the importance of putting
away unhealthful habits. After I was baptized I wrote to my commander
and requested that I be discharged from military duty.
   I went to visit my parents, and they saw the difference in my life. They
listened as I shared my new faith. My mother was first to become an
Adventist, and one by one my brothers and sisters joined as well. Finally
my father saw the beauty of following Jesus and joined the church.
                                 I love my Jesus! Every chance I have I
                              return to the military base where I once
                              served and testify to the soldiers about what
                              Jesus has done in my life. Many of them are
                               now following Jesus. What a wonderful life
                               God has given me!

      SABBATH AFTERNOON
              ut your iniquities have separated between you and your God,

      B       and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
              For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
      iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered per-
      verseness. None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they
      trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth
      iniquity . . . . The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord
      hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
      me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,
      and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the
      acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to
      comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to
      give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the gar-
      ment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
      trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glo-
      rified" (Isa. 59:2-4, 61:1-3).
         This week we look at how the Lord planned to take His people from
      one spiritual place to another.

The Week at a Glance: How does sin separate us from
      God? What is the only basis of redemption? What was God's plan
      for the Hebrew nation? How was Jesus revealed in Isaiah 61:1-3?
      How do we understand God's vengeance?

Memory Text: "Nations shall come to your light, and kings to
  the brightness of your dawn" (Isaiah 60:3, NRSV).

     The Effects of Sin                 (Isaiah 59).

       In Isaiah 58:3 the people asked God: " 'Why do we fast, but you do
     not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?' " (NRSV).
       In contrast, Isaiah 59:1 implies another question, something like:
     "Why do we call for the Lord's hand to save us, but He does not? Why
     do we cry to Him, but He does not hear?" Isaiah answers that God is
     able to save and hear (vs. 1). His failure to do either is, however,
     another matter entirely.

Read Isaiah 59:2. What message is being given here that answers the
      question in verse 1?




        God chooses to "ignore" His people, not because that is His desire,
      but because, as Isaiah reveals, "your iniquities have been barriers
      between you and your God" (vs. 2, NRSV). Here is one of the clearest
      statements in the Bible regarding the effect of sin on the divine-
      human relationship. Isaiah spends the rest of chapter 59 elaborating
      on this point, which is seen all through human history: Sin can destroy
      our relationship with the Lord and thus lead to our eternal ruin—not
      because sin drives God away from us, but that it drives us away from
      God.

Read Genesis 3:8. How does this example reveal the principle
      expressed in the above paragraph?




        Sin is primarily a rejection of God, a turning away from Him. The
      sin act actually feeds upon itself in that not only is the act a turning
      away from God but the result of the act causes the sinner to turn away
      even more from the Lord. Sin separates us from God, not because
      God wouldn't reach out to the sinner (indeed, the whole Bible is
      almost nothing but the account of God reaching out to save sinners)
      but because sin causes us to reject His divine overtures to us. That is
      why it is so important that we tolerate no sin in our lives.

       In what ways have you experienced the phenomenon of sin
       causing a separation from God? What, in your own experience,
       is the only solution to the problem?

                                                                           97

      Who Is Forgiven?
        Isaiah 59 presents a startling picture of the problem of sin.
     Fortunately, the Bible also presents the hope of redemption.
        To begin, the first question is, How many of us have sinned? The
     Bible is unequivocal: All of us have. Redemption, therefore, cannot be
     based on lack of sin; it must be based on forgiveness (Jer. 31:34). Paul
     agrees. All have sinned (Rom. 3:9-20, 23), so there can be no distinc-
     tion on that basis (Rom. 3:22). Those who are justified can be judged
     as just, only because they receive by faith the gift of God's righteous-
     ness through the sacrifice of Christ.

Read Romans 3:21-24. What are those texts telling us about how we
     are saved? What hope should they give us in the judgment?


        Most people think the question in the judgment is: Who has sinned?
     But that is not a question that needs to be asked, because everyone has
     sinned. Instead, the question is: Who is forgiven? God is just when He
     justifies "the one who has faith in Jesus" (Rom. 3:26, NRSV). The
     deciding factor in the judgment is, Who has received and continues to
     receive forgiveness by having faith in Jesus?
       Now, it is true we are judged by works, but not in the sense that
     works save us. If so, then faith is made void (Rom. 4:14). Instead, our
     works reveal whether we truly have been saved (James 2:18).

Why can't works save us, either now or in the judgment? See Rom.
     3:20, 23.


        It is too late for good works, or obedience to the law, to redeem any-
     one. The purpose of the law in a sinful world isn't to save but to point
     out sin. Instead, "faith working through love" (Gal. 5:6, NRSV), love
     that is poured into the heart by God's Spirit (Rom. 5:5), demonstrates
     that a person has living faith in Jesus (compare James 2:26).
        Works are an outward expression, the human manifestation of a
     saving faith. Hence, a true Christian experience is one in which faith
     is expressed in a daily commitment to the Lord that is revealed by
     obedience to the law. In the judgment, God uses works as evidence for
     His creatures, who cannot read thoughts of faith as He can. But for the
     converted person, only works following conversion, when the life is
     empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit, are relevant in the judg-
     ment. The preconversion life of sin has already been washed away by
     the blood of the Lamb (see Romans 6).

      Universal Appeal                (Isa. 60:1, 2).

What is Isaiah 60:1, 2 talking about? What principle is at work there
      that's seen all through the Bible? What hope does it offer?


         In these two verses, we are given a picture of God's deliverance of
      His people, following the exile, expressed with the imagery of God
      creating light out of darkness and pointing forward to an ultimate ful-
      fillment in salvation through Christ.

In verse 3, to whose light do nations and kings come?
         In Hebrew this person is feminine singular (see also vss. 1, 2). It
      must be "Zion," personified as a woman, who is mentioned near the
      end of the previous chapter (Isa. 59:20). So the people of the earth,
      who are covered in darkness, will come to Zion. They will be drawn
      by the light of God's glory that has arisen over her (Isa. 60:2). "Zion
      is summoned to enter into the light that is hers and then to observe
      and react to the nations as they gather to the same light."—J. Alec
      Motyer, p. 494. Notice that although Zion is Jerusalem, the emphasis
      is more on the people than on the physical location of the city.
         The rest of Isaiah 60 develops the theme introduced in verses 1-3:
      The people of the world are drawn to Jerusalem, which is blessed
      because of God's glorious presence there.

How does this prophecy compare with God's covenant promise to
      Abraham? Gen. 12:2, 3. Are they not saying the same thing?


         God had a universal purpose when He chose Abraham and his
      descendants: Through Abraham all families of the earth would be
      blessed (Gen. 12:3, 18:18, 22:18). So, God's covenant with Abraham
      was ultimately intended to be a covenant with all humankind through
      Abraham. He and his descendants would be God's channel of revela-
      tion to the world.
         Isaiah sought to bring his people back to their ancient, universal
      destiny. As the representatives of the true God, they were responsible
      not only for themselves but for the world. They should welcome for-
      eigners who seek God (compare Isa. 56:3-8), for His temple "shall be
      called a house of prayer for all peoples" (Isa. 56:7, NRSV).

       In this context, how do you understand the role of the Seventh-
       day Adventist Church, or your role in that church?



                                                                          99
          WEDNESDAY June 16


      "The Year of the Lord's Favor" (Isaiah 61).
Who is speaking in Isaiah 61:1?


         The Spirit of God is on this anointed person, which means that he
      is a messiah or the Messiah. He is to "bring good news to the
      oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
      captives, and release to the prisoners" (vs. 1, NRSV). Who does that
      sound like? Compare Isaiah 42:1-7, where God's Servant is described
      in very similar terms.
         Isaiah 61:2 talks about the "acceptable year of the Lord." The
      Messiah, who is anointed as the Davidic King and Deliverer, pro-
      claims a special year of divine favor at the time when He proclaims
      liberty. Compare Leviticus 25:10, where God commands the Israelites
      to proclaim liberty in the holy fiftieth year: "It shall be a jubilee for
      you: you shall return, every one of you, to your property and every
      one of you to your family" (NRSV). This means that persons who had
      been forced to sell their ancestral land or to become servants in order
      to survive hard times (vss. 25-55) would reclaim their land and free-
      dom. Because the jubilee year began with the blowing of a trumpet on
      the Day of Atonement (vs. 9), we have mentioned this passage before
      in connection with Isaiah 58.
         While "the year of the Lord's favor" (NRSV) in Isaiah 61:2 is a kind
      of jubilee year, it is not simply an observance of Leviticus 25. This
      year is announced by the Messiah, the King, when He reveals Himself
      through a ministry of liberation and restoration. This is similar to
      some ancient Mesopotamian kings who promoted social kindness by
      proclaiming release from debts during early years of their reigns. The
      Messiah's ministry goes far beyond the scope of the Leviticus 25 law.
      Not only does He "proclaim liberty to the captives," He also binds up
      the brokenhearted, comforts those who mourn, and brings about their
      restoration (Isa. 61:1-11). Furthermore, in addition to "the year of the
      Lord's favor," he proclaims "the day of vengeance of our God" (vs. 2,
      NRSV).

       When was Isaiah's prophecy fulfilled? Luke 4:16-21. How did
       Jesus' ministry accomplish this? We, of course, are not Jesus,
       but we are to represent Him to the world. Also, ask yourself this
       important question: What are the things the Messiah does, as
       expressed in Isaiah 61:1-3, that we, in our limited capacities,
       should be doing, as well? And what are some of the practical
       ways in which we can do these things?

             THURSDAY June 17


     "The Day of Vengeance of Our God"
      (Isa. 61:2, NRSV).

Amidst all the good news, why does the Messiah, as depicted in Isaiah
      61, proclaim God's vengeance? When is this prophecy fulfilled?


        When in Nazareth, Jesus, the Messiah, read Isaiah 61 as far as " 'to
      proclaim the year of the Lord's favor' " (vs. 2; Luke 4:19). Then he
      stopped and said: " 'Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your
      hearing' " (Luke 4:21, NRSV). So, He deliberately and specifically
      avoided reading the next words in the same verse: "the day of
      vengeance of our God" (Isa. 61:2, NRSV). While His ministry of
      good news, liberty, and comfort was beginning to set captives free
      from Satan's tyranny, the day of vengeance was not yet to come. In
      Matthew 24 (compare Mark 13, Luke 21) He predicted to His disci-
      ples that divine judgments would come in the future.
         Indeed, in Isaiah 61 the day of God's vengeance is the "great and
      terrible day of the Lord" (Joel 2.31, NRSV; Mal. 4:5), to be fulfilled
      when Christ will come again to liberate planet Earth from injustice by
      defeating His enemies and setting the oppressed remnant of His peo-
      ple free (Revelation 19; compare Dan. 2:44, 45). So although Christ
      announced the beginning of "the year of the Lord's favor," its culmi-
      nation is at His second coming.

How do you reconcile the notion of a loving God with a God who also
      promises vengeance? Are the ideas incompatible? Or, do you
      understand vengeance as a manifestation of that love? If so, how
      so? Explain your answer.


         Though Jesus has told us to turn the cheek (Matt. 5:39), in other
      places He is very clear that justice and punishment will be meted out
      (Matt. 8:12). Though Paul tells us not to "render evil for evil" (1 Thess.
      5 : 15), he also says that when the Lord is revealed from heaven, He will
      with flaming fire take "vengeance on them that know not God"
      (2 Thess. 1:8).
         The difference, of course, is that the Lord in His infinite wisdom
      and mercy can alone bring justice and vengeance in a completely fair
      manner. Human justice, human vengeance, comes with all the faults,
      frailties, and inconsistencies of humanity. God's justice, of course,
      will come with none of those limitations.

         How do we understand the link between God's love for us and
       the warnings of vengeance?


                                                                            101

         "Jesus stood before the people as a living expositor of the prophe-
      cies concerning Himself. Explaining the words He had read, He spoke
      of the Messiah as a reliever of the oppressed, a liberator of captives, a
      healer of the afflicted, restoring sight to the blind, and revealing to the
      world the light of truth. His impressive manner and the wonderful
      import of His words thrilled the hearers with a power they had never
      felt before. The tide of divine influence broke every barrier down; like
      Moses, they beheld the Invisible. As their hearts were moved upon by
      the Holy Spirit, they responded with fervent amens and praises to the
      Lord."—The Desire of Ages, p. 237.
         "The day of God's vengeance cometh—the day of the fierceness of
      His wrath. Who will abide the day of His coming? Men have hardened
      their hearts against the Spirit of God, but the arrows of His wrath will
      pierce where the arrows of conviction could not. God will not far
      hence arise to deal with the sinner. Will the false shepherd shield the
      transgressor in that day? Can he be excused who went with the multi-
      tude in the path of disobedience? Will popularity or numbers make
      any guiltless? These are questions which the careless and indifferent
      should consider and settle for themselves."—Ellen G. White, Faith
      and Works, p. 33.

Discussion Question:
       A Seventh-day Adventist pastor thoughtfully stated that his
       number one problem in ministry is the exclusiveness of church
       members who do not want others to join them. How can
       "Christians" take the love, hope, and good news of Christ's king-
       dom to all the world so others can have an opportunity to be
       saved before the end comes (Matt. 24:14) when they do not even
       want to accept people who go out of their way to show up in their
       church?

Summary: God purifies an unjust society by removing the rebels and
      by restoring the remnant who turn from the sins that have separated
      them from Him. Due to the blessings of God's presence, people from
      other nations are drawn to God and His people, so that they also can
      enjoy the time of God's favor that is proclaimed and delivered by the
      Messiah.

Air Force Major
Joins God's Army
CHARLOTTE ISHKANIAN

   Major Andrew Babentsov joined the Ukrainian Air Force and quickly
moved through its ranks, becoming a pilot, an officer, and finally a flight
commander. While on a leave to visit his parents, Andrew accepted an
invitation to attend some evangelistic meetings. He went out of curiosity
and found the topics compelling. He made friends with the pastor and
spent hours discussing the Bible and Bible prophecy with him. But before
all his questions were answered, Andrew had to return to his military unit.
He wanted to maintain contact with Adventists, but he could not find an
Adventist church near his base. Even so, he tried to follow the biblical
principles he had learned during those short visits home.
   During duty in Yugoslavia for the United Nations, Andrew often saw
God's hand of mercy and protection over him. He made a covenant to fol-
low Christ in baptism. While preparing for baptism, he became convicted
of the importance of Sabbath keeping.
   After his baptism he wrote a letter to his commanding officer explain-
ing his faith and asking to be released from the military. The commander
refused, but released Andrew from work assignments on the Sabbath.
   Andrew's integrity won him much respect, and when he began studying
the Bible with other officers at the base, he was well received. He also
shared literature and books with those who showed an interest.
   Andrew wanted to share his faith with people in the town near his mil-
                              itary base, so he began selling literature in his
                              free time. He met some Adventists who had
                              moved to the town to help establish a church
                              and began working with them. Again he
                              wrote a letter requesting release from his
                              duties, so he could work full time for God.
                              The commanders did not want to lose
                              Andrew and offered him more privileges to
                              entice him to remain in the air force.
                                 But God was calling Andrew into higher
                              service, and at last he received approval to
                              resign from the military so he could become
                              a leader in God's army instead.

      Rebirth of
      Planet Earth



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

              ne day, a 12-year-old boy, having just read a book on astron-
              omy, refused to go to school. His mother, hysterical, took the
              child to the family doctor, who asked, "Billy, what's the mat-
      ter? Why don't you want to study or go to school any more?"
         "Because, Doctor," he said, "I read in this astronomy book that one
      day the sun is going to burn out and all life on earth will vanish. I don't
      see any reason to do anything if, in the end, everything will die out."
         The mother, hysterical, shouted, "It's not your business! It's not
      your business!"
         The doctor, after calming down the mother, turned to the little boy,
      smiled, and said, "But, Billy, you don't need to worry, because by the
      time this happens, we'll all be long dead, anyway."
         Of course, that's part of the problem: In the end, we're all dead, any-
      way.
         Fortunately, our existence doesn't have to end in death. On the con-
      trary, we have been offered life, eternal life, in a world made new.

The Week at a Glance: What final hope does Isaiah pres-
      ent us? How can Gentiles become priests and Levites? How does

Memory Text: "For I am about to create new heavens and a
      new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come to
      mind" (Isaiah 65:17, NRSV).

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, June 26.

     New Heavens and a New Earth                                   (Isa. 65:17-25).

Read Isaiah 65:17-25. What kind of restoration does the Lord prom-
     ise here?


       God promises a new creation, beginning with the words: "For I am
     about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things shall
     not be remembered or come to mind" (Isa. 65:17, NRSV). In this
     remarkable prophecy, the Lord promises to "create Jerusalem as a joy,
     and its people as a delight" (vs. 18, NRSV). In the city there will be
     no more weeping (vs. 19). People normally will live considerably
     longer than a century before they die (vs. 20). Their work and children
     will remain for them to enjoy (vss. 21-23). God will answer them even
     before they call (vs. 24).

However nice, why is it not a complete picture of our final restora-
      tion, our final hope?


         Thus far we have a picture of tranquil long lives in the Promised
      Land. But even though people live longer, they still die. Where is the
      radical transformation of nature we expect with the creation of "new
      heavens" and a "new earth"? The next verse tells us: "The wolf and
      the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but
      the serpent—its food shall be dust! They shall not hurt or destroy on
      all my holy mountain, says the Lord" (vs. 25, NRSV).
         For carnivores such as lions to become vegetarian requires far more
      than a vegetarian cooking class. It requires a re-creation to restore the
      world to its ideal state, as it was before sin in Eden introduced death.
         What we have here in Isaiah 65 is God presenting the creation of
      "new heavens" and a "new earth" as a process, series of steps, that
      begins with the re-creation of Jerusalem. Compare Isaiah 11, where
      the Messiah would bring justice (vss. 1-5). Then, eventually, there will
      be peace on God's worldwide "holy mountain"; the imagery used in
      Isaiah 11 is similar to what's found in Isaiah 65: "The wolf shall live
      with the lamb . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox . . ." (Isa. 11:6,
       7, NRSV). Although the Lord's "holy mountain" would begin with Mt.
      Zion at Jerusalem, it was only a precursor, a symbol, of what God
      promises to do, ultimately, in a new world with His redeemed people.

       Suppose instead of living 60,70,90, or even 100 years, most peo-
       ple lived a million years or more. Why, still, would the funda-
       mental problem of humanity not be solved? Why is eternal life
       the only answer to our deepest human needs?


                                                                                105
                   MONDAY June 21


      Divine "Magnet" (Isa. 66:1-19).
Read Isaiah 66:1-19. Keeping in mind the time in which Isaiah
      wrote, what is the basic message he is giving here?




        Through the prophet, God reiterates the appeal and warning that
      permeates the book: God will save and restore the humble, who trem-
      ble at His word (vss. 2, 5). As in Isaiah 40:1, He will comfort them
      (vs. 13). But He will destroy those who rebel against Him. These
      include hypocrites of ritual, whose sacrifices He rejects (Isa. 66:3, 4;
      compare Isa. 1:10-15), as well as those who hate and reject His faith-
      ful ones (Isa. 66:5). They also include those who practice pagan
      abominations (vs. 17) like those practiced at the temple in Jerusalem
      (Ezek. 8:7-12).

Look at Isaiah 66:3. What is this text saying? What spiritual princi-
      ples are being revealed here? How might the same idea be
      expressed, but in the context of contemporary Christianity and
      worship?




How does God serve as a magnet to draw the nations to Himself? Isa.
      66:18, 19.


         Following the destruction of His enemies (vss. 14-17), God reveals
      His glory so that He becomes a magnet to draw people to Jerusalem
      (compare Isa. 2:2-4). He sets a "sign" among them, which is not spec-
      ified here but apparently refers to the sign last mentioned by Isaiah:
      God gives His people joy and peace and restores their land (Isa.
      55:13). When He reveals His glory by restoring His people after
      destruction, this is a sign of His restored favor, just as He gave Noah
      the sign of the rainbow after the Flood (Gen. 9:13-17).

       Read Isaiah 66:5. What does it mean to tremble at His word?
       Why does the Lord want us to tremble at His word? If you
       don't, what might that say about the condition of your heart?

What is the meaning of survivors' bringing people from the nations
     as an offering to the Lord? Isa. 66:19, 20.


       God sends survivors of His destruction out to the ends of the earth,
     to people who do not know about God, "and they shall declare my
     glory among the nations" (vs. 19, NRSV). This is one the clearest Old
     Testament statements of the theme of missionary outreach. In other
     words, not only are people to be drawn to the Hebrew nation but some
     of the Hebrew people will go to other nations and teach them about
     the true God—a paradigm that is explicit in the New Testament.
     Though there was Jewish missionary outreach between the time of
     return from exile and the time of Christ (Matt. 23:15), the early
     Christians spread the gospel rapidly and on a massive scale (Col.
     1:23).
        Just as the Israelites brought grain offerings to the Lord at His tem-
     ple, so the missionaries would bring an offering to Him. But their
     offering would be "all your kindred from all the nations" (Isa. 66:20,
     NRSV). Just as grain offerings were gifts to God that were not slaugh-
     tered, the converts brought to the Lord would be presented to Him as
     "living sacrifices" (compare Rom. 12:1). For the idea that people
     could be presented as a kind of offering to God, compare the much
     earlier dedication of Levites "as an elevation offering from the
     Israelites, that they may do the service of the Lord" (Num. 8:11,
      NRSV).

What is the significance of God's promise to "take some of them as
      priests and as Levites" (Isa. 66:21, NRSV)?


         The "them" in verse 21 refers to "your kindred from all the nations"
      (NRSV) in the previous verse. These are Gentiles, some of whom God
      would choose as worship leaders, along with the priests and Levites.
      This is a revolutionary change. God previously had authorized only
      descendants of Aaron to serve as priests and only other members of the
      tribe of Levi to assist them. Gentiles could not literally become
      descendants of Aaron or Levi, but God would authorize some to serve
      in these capacities, which had previously been forbidden to most Jews.

       Read 1 Peter 2:9, 10. To whom is Peter writing? What is he say-
       ing? What message does he have for each of us, as members of
       a "holy nation" today? Are we doing any better than the origi-
       nal people (Exod. 19:6)?

                                                                          107

      Community of Faith (Isa. 66:21).
        The Israelites were "a priestly kingdom and a holy nation" (Exod.
      19:6, NRSV) with special priests set apart to represent them as wor-
      ship leaders. But in the future, some Gentiles would become worship
      leaders (Isa. 66:21).

How would this change affect the renewed community of faith? See
    Matt. 28:19, Acts 26:20, Gal. 3:28, Col. 3:11, 1 Tim. 3:16.




        In God's "new world order," Gentiles would not only join God's peo-
      ple, they would be equal partners with Jews in a combined community
      of faith that would be a "royal priesthood." Therefore, the distinction
      between Jews and Gentiles would become functionally irrelevant.

When was this prophecy of Isaiah fulfilled?

         Paul, the missionary to the Gentiles, proclaimed: "There is no
      longer Jew or Greek . . . for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. And if
      you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs accord-
      ing to the promise" (Gal. 3:28, 29, NRSV).
         Becoming heirs of the promise and therefore an exalted "royal
      priesthood" was not a mandate for smug elitism but a commission to
      join the Jews in proclaiming "the mighty acts of him who called you
      out of darkness into his marvelous light" (2 Pet. 2:9, NRSV; compare
      Isa. 66:19).
         The elevation of Gentiles did not entitle Jews to grumble that God
      was unfair in giving them the same reward. Nor did it entitle Gentiles
      to treat their Jewish brothers and sisters with disrespect any more than
      workers hired late in the day should look down on those hired earlier
      (compare Matt. 20:1-16). The Jews had first been "entrusted with the
      oracles of God" (Rom. 3:2, NRSV) as God's channel of revelation.
      Paul wrote to Gentiles: "But if some of the branches were broken off,
      and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in their place to share the
      rich root of the olive tree, do not boast over the branches" (Rom.
      11:17, 18, NRSV).

       Why, in light of the Cross, in light of the gospel commission, is
       any kind of spiritual or ethnic or even political elitism so abhor-
       rent in the sight of God? Look closely at yourself; are you har-
       boring any sense of spiritual or ethnic superiority? If so, repent!

     So Shall Your Seed and Your Name
     Remain (Isa. 66:22-24).
        One of the most wonderful promises in Isaiah is found in Isaiah
     66:22. Read it carefully. In the new heavens and the new earth, our
     seed and our name shall remain—forever. No more blotting out, or
     cutting off, or grafting in, plucking up, or uprooting. We have here a
     promise of eternal life in a world made new—a world without sin,
     without death, without suffering, a new heaven and a new earth, the
     final and complete fulfillment of our Christian faith, the consumma-
     tion of what Christ had accomplished for us at the Cross.

Why are there new moons along with Sabbaths in the depiction of the
     new heavens and the new earth as presented in Isaiah 66:23?


        Though there are a number of different ways to look at this diffi-
      cult text, one approach is this: God created the Sabbath before the
      sacrificial system existed (Gen. 2:2, 3). So, although Sabbaths were
      honored by the ritual system, they are not dependent upon it. Thus,
      they continue uninterrupted throughout the restoration period, on into
      the new earth. There is no indication in the Bible that new moons
      were legitimate days of worship apart from the sacrificial system. But
      perhaps there will be worship days (but not necessarily rest days like
      weekly Sabbaths) in the new earth, possibly in connection with the
      monthly cycle of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2).
        Whatever specific meaning Isaiah 66:23, the crucial point seems to
      be that God's people will be worshiping Him throughout all eternity.

Why does Isaiah end with the negative picture of saved people look-
     ing at the corpses of rebels destroyed by God (vs. 24)?


         As a graphic warning to the people of his day, Isaiah encapsulates the
      contrast between faithful survivors of the Babylonian destruction and
      rebels, who would be destroyed. This is not everlasting torment: The
      rebels are dead, killed by "fire," a destruction that was not quenched
      until it did its job so that the re-creation of Jerusalem could begin.
         Isaiah's warning points forward to an ultimate fulfillment prophe-
      sied by the book of Revelation: Destruction of sinners, Satan, and
      death in a lake of fire (Revelation 20), after which there will be " 'a
      new heaven and a new earth,' " a holy " 'new Jerusalem,' " and no
      more weeping or pain, " 'for the first things have passed away"' (Rev.
      21:1-4, NRSV; compare Isa. 65:17-19), a new existence, with eternal
      life for all who are redeemed from the earth.

                                                                           109

Further Study: On the final cleansing of planet Earth from sin,
      read Ellen G. White, "The Controversy Ended," in The Great
      Controversy, pp. 662-678.

         "And the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still
      more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is pro-
      gressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more
      men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His charac-
      ter. As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and the
      amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the hearts
      of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion, and with more rap-
      turous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand times ten
      thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to swell the
      mighty chorus of praise.
         " 'And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
      under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,
      heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto
      Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.'
      Revelation 5:13.
         "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The
      entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats
      through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and
      light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From
      the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inani-
      mate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is
      love."—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 678.

Discussion Questions:
       0 Why is the promise of eternal life in a new heaven and a new
       earth so basic to our Christian belief? What good would our faith
       be without that promise?

       0 Read 2 Peter 3:10-14. How do these verses reflect the same
       idea presented in Isaiah 66?

Summary: Isaiah presents a vision of staggering scope. Not-only
      would God purge and restore His community of faith; He would
      enlarge its borders to encompass all nations. Ultimately the re-
      creation of His community would lead to the re-creation of planet
      Earth, where His presence would be the ultimate comfort of His peo-
      ple.

A Woman's Work
J. H. ZACHARY

   Pretti Sangam and his wife, Sharda, are the only Christians in their vil-
lage in India. Everyone else is either Hindu or Muslim. Pretti earns his liv-
ing by doing odd jobs.
   Sharda wanted to share the joy and hope she had found in Jesus with the
other women in her village. She began visiting from home to home, offer-
ing to read a few verses from the Bible. Several women invited her to
come back. She prayed that the Holy Spirit would touch their hearts. For
the first time in their lives these Hindu and Muslim women listened to the
Word of God. Sharda began giving Bible studies to the women who
requested them.
   However, three families rejected her efforts. "If you do not stop this
work we will burn down your house," they threatened. Instead of asking
God for protection, Pretti and Sharda asked God to touch the hearts of
these families. God honored their prayer, and in time all the families who
had resisted her efforts for the women had agreed to study the Bible with
her.
   During a recent festival of baptism, Sharda and Pretti brought 32 per-
sons to be baptized. One of them was Sharda's sister-in-law, Palandi. She
testified, "My religion did not meet my heart needs. I was impressed by
Sharda's loving prayers. When she took me to the Adventist church, I felt
the presence of God." Palandi is now sharing her faith with her extended
 family. Her powerful testimony is reaching their hearts. She prays that all
20 family members will soon begin studying the Bible.
   The group of new believers in the village is already too large to fit into
 Pretti's tiny home. When the weather is good they sit on the ground as
 Sharda teaches them from the Bible. The Southern Asia Division has pur-
                                chased land, and The Quiet Hour is helping
                                build a chapel for them. Sharda and Pretti con-
                                tinue evangelizing. Currently they are study-
                                ing with 60 interested neighbors in 15 fami-
                                lies.
                                   While Sharda visits homes in her village,
                                Pretti goes to a neighboring village to give
                                Bible studies. They do this work as volunteers
                                because they love the Lord. Their goal is to
                                lead at least 100 persons to Christ and to plant
                                a church in a second village this year.
                                J. H. ZACHARY is coordinator of international evangel-
                                ism for The Quiet Hour.

2004 Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter

         This quarter's Bible Study Guide, Religion in Relationships, by
      Reinder Bruinsma, will guide us in a study of numerous passages of
      Scripture, with the intention of increasing our awareness of the ways
      by which our faith impacts our relationship to others—to those who
      are close to us and those who are afar. We will discuss how we can
      strengthen those relationships, even restore them if they have some-
      how broken down. We will discover that, indeed, there is more reli-
      gion in relationships than many may suspect.

Lesson 1—Created for Community
      The Week at a Glance:
      SUNDAY: "'It is Not Good for the Man to Be Aone,'" (Gen. 2:18, NIV).
      MONDAY: Religion Has Social Dimensions (Exod. 20:2-17, Matt. 7:12).
      TUESDAY: Building Relationships Takes Effort (Matt. 5:9).
      WEDNESDAY: The Basis (1 Cor 13:1-13).
      THURSDAY: God Always Comes First (Luke 14:26).

      Memory Text-1 John 4:7, NN

      Sabbath Gem: And, yet, amid all this loneliness is the bibli-
      cal ideal, which is that we live in community with others—with fam-
      ily, friends, colleagues, authorities, fellow church members, et
      cetera. The question is, How does God want us to do it?

Lesson 2—"Honor Your Father and Your Mother"
      The Week at a Glance:
      SUNDAY: Respect for "Gray Hair" (1 Pet. 5:5).
      MONDAY: Honoring Our Parents (Exod. 20:12).
      TUESDAY: What About Obedience (Eph. 6:1-3, Col. 3:20).
      WEDNESDAY: Parents and Children: Part 1.
      THURSDAY: Parents and Children: Part 2.

      Memory Text —Isaiah 6:1, NRSV.

      Sabbath Gem: This week we'll take a look at how children, or even
      how adults, should relate not only to their parents but to those who are
      older, in general. Because, in almost all cases, no matter who we are or
      how old we are, we come in contact with those who are even older.

        Lessons for the Visually Impaired The regular Adult Sabbath School
        Bible Study Guide is available free each month in braille and on audiocassette to
        sight-impaired and physically handicapped persons who cannot read normal ink print.

Book of Isaiah
by Gerald Wheeler



    ome regard Isaiah as the

S   book of the Bible that most
    predicts the coming of Jesus
as Messiah. Still others see it as
a source of end-time scenarios.
But Isaiah is all this and more. In
Man of Sorrows you'll explore
how this story of warfare in the tiny country of Judah mirrors a larger
struggle between good and evil—a war between supernatural powers.
You'll constantly encounter individuals and events that seem merely
human and earthly—till suddenly the surface of our reality rips away
to reveal something vaster and more important.

You'll discover a God who reaches out not only to Israel but to the
surrounding Gentiles as well. A loving Creator who has the power to
redeem all people, win the battle with evil, and establish a kingdom
that brings all nations everlasting peace and joy.
