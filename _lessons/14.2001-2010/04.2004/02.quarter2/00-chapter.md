    INTRODUCTION



John:
The Beloved Gospel
Inspiration has left us with four distinct versions of the life
of Jesus, those found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
commonly known as the four Gospels.
We might think that one version of the gospel story would be enough,
as long as it were inspired by God. But the Holy Spirit provided us
with four versions, each with its own unique perspective on the life,
ministry, teaching, and sacrifice of Christ. The greatness of Jesus is
such that no single inspired writer fully could communicate it; hence,
there's more than one account. As Ellen White so succinctly expresses
it: The gospel story was given "through different writers, each having
his own individuality, though going over the same history."—Selected
Messages, book 1, p. 21. One, simply, wasn't enough to do it justice.
   By using different accounts, God meets a variety of readers where
they are. Each Gospel writer "has an experience of his own, and this
diversity broadens and deepens the knowledge that is brought out to
meet the necessities of varied minds."—Page 22. In the past century,
some literature has taken up the approach of recounting the same
story from different perspectives, a move that was deemed new,
innovative, and progressive at the time. How interesting that our
Lord did the same thing nineteen centuries earlier.
   In film and biography (such as the book The Desire of Ages, by
Ellen G. White), many have sought to share a combined picture of
the life of Jesus, based on all four Gospels. These efforts have been
a great blessing. People of varied backgrounds and ways of thinking
will gain a richer experience with Jesus as they interact with the vari-
ety of emphases provided for us in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Much is to be gained, however, by focusing on the unique perspec-
tives of the individual Gospel writers. Under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, each writer put his own unique perspective on the life
and teachings of Jesus. This quarter we look at John's.
   John's often has been called "the beloved Gospel." Its author is
repeatedly called "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23-25,
19:26, 20:2, 21:20-24). His book, therefore, was written by one who
was especially intimate with Jesus, in the same way that Jesus was


2
intimate with His Father (compare John 1:18 with 13:23). Out of
this deeper understanding came a Gospel that probes the depths of
Jesus' character and mission in a way that its other three counter-
parts do not.
   Also, unlike Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Fourth Gospel seems
uniquely designed to speak directly to a generation who had no
access to anyone in physical contact with Jesus. Every generation
since has faced this same
problem, so John speaks John's Gospel answers
directly to us in a way the
other Gospels do not. His
                                 the question: How can
Gospel was designed, I have a relationship
therefore, to answer what
may be the most crucial
                                 with Someone I cannot
question of contemporary see, hear, or touch?
Christian faith: How can I
have a living relationship with Someone I cannot see, hear, or
touch?
   The dual focus of this quarter's Bible Study Guide, therefore, is on
 the unique picture of Jesus provided in the beloved Gospel and on
 the steps that the Gospel provides toward a deeper and more genuine
 relationship with Jesus. John, with his own unique stamp on the
 Gospel, has provided a powerful source of encouragement, hope,
 and faith for the millions who have learned to love our Lord through
 what the inspired disciple has placed in it.
   John Paulien, the author of this quarter's Bible Study Guide, is chair
 of the New Testament Studies department at Andrews University
 Seminary and a recognized expert in the writings of John. Thus, we
 are privileged to have his insights this quarter as we—who have never
 met Jesus in the flesh—study the account of someone who did and
 who shares his life-changing experience with us.
   May it change our experience, as well.

      The Unique Purpose
      of John's Gospel




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: Luke 1:1-4, John 15:1-8,
      17:20, 20:24-31, 21:20-25.

Memory Text: "Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen
      me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet
      have believed' " (John 20:29, NIV).

Key Thought: The Gospel of John tells us that the absence of
      physical contact with Jesus is no disadvantage to those seeking a
      relationship with Him today. Jesus' word is as powerful as His
      touch.

              ave you ever wished you could have known Jesus in the flesh,

      H       as His disciples did? Have you ever wished He lived at your
              house? Wouldn't it be great to take your problems directly to
      Him, face to face? To go to Him and share what's on your heart and
      then see Him go to His knees and pray earnestly to His Father for you?
      Wouldn't it be easier to have a relationship with Jesus if He lived,
      breathed, walked, and talked at your house?
        But that privilege has not been ours. Yet, the good news is that the
      Gospel of John helps assure us that we don't need physical contact with
      Jesus in order to have a relationship with Him. We don't need physical
      contact to obtain all the blessings He is willing and able to give. John
      even recalls Jesus telling His disciples " 'It is for your good that I am
      going away' " (John 16:7, NIV). Through the presence of the Spirit, the
      work of Jesus is enhanced by His absence (John 14:12).
        This week we take our first look at this good news.

     How the Gospels Were Written                              (Luke 1:1-4).

Were Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John the only accounts of the life of
     Jesus ever expressed? Did others, perhaps even in writing,
     recount the life of Christ? Luke 1:1.


Describe the process by which Luke's Gospel (and presumably
      John's, as well) came into existence. Luke 1:2, 3.




        From what Luke tells us, "many" individuals had already under-
      taken to tell the story of Christ. The stories about Jesus and His say-
      ings were remembered and handed down by "eyewitnesses and serv-
      ants of the word" (Luke 1:2, NIV). The word translated "servants"
      seems to have been a technical term in the ancient world for profes-
      sional memorizers who would make it a point to record significant
      sayings in their minds for future use. It should not surprise us that
      such individuals might be chosen to memorize the sermons, parables,
      and deeds of Jesus in order to repeat what the Lord said and did.
        The stories and sayings of Jesus were passed along by word of
      mouth for many years after His ascension to heaven. Luke, inspired
      by the Holy Spirit, apparently had talked with eyewitnesses and those
      who had memorized the sayings and stories of Jesus. Guided by the
      Spirit, he then selected those sayings and stories that enabled him to
      put together an "orderly account." The final result is the Gospel of
       Luke as we know it today.

Read John 21:25. What does it tell us about the limits of all the
      Gospels?


        John's point is that most of the Jesus story had to be left out of his
      Gospel. Each of the four Gospels offers selections of the sayings and
      deeds of Jesus that fit that particular writer's purpose. "It is seldom
      that two persons will view and express truth in the very same way.
      Each dwells on particular points which his constitution and education
      have fitted him to appreciate."—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages,
      book 1, p. 22.

       Look at the Ellen White quote, particularly in the context of
       today's study. What does this tell us about the need to give oth-
       ers some flexibility in their understanding of truth?

                                                                               7
                MONDAY December 29

     Selecting With a Purpose
Read John 20:30,31. Why did John say he wrote what he did about
     the life of Jesus? In what ways does the whole Bible reflect that
     same purpose?


        Jesus' ministry from His baptism to His ascension covered about
     three and a half years (1,260 days!). Out of all the things Jesus said
     and did during that time, John records incidents that occurred on a
     total of only 29 days. And in most cases, even these accounts cover
     only a small fraction of what Jesus may have said and done on those
     days. More than ninety-seven percent of Jesus' ministry is left out of
     John's Gospel. Led by the Holy Spirit, John chose what was needed to
     achieve his stated purpose: to convince us to believe in order that we
     may have eternal life.
       Notice for whom John wrote his Gospel. It is for "you" (plural in
     the original). John wrote so that "you" might believe and that "you"
     might have life. With the word "you", he clearly had his readers in
     mind. But which readers? All of them? Or was there a special focus
     to this "you" group?

What story provides the lead-in for John's statement of purpose?
     John 20:24-28.




        Thomas clearly feels that his faith depends on a hands-on experi-
     ence with a physical Jesus. Once he had seen Jesus, he had no prob-
     lem believing. In John 20:24-31, Thomas represents all the disciples,
     the first generation, those who had seen and touched Jesus.
        Jesus' statement in verse 29, on the other hand, indicates that there
     is a special blessing reserved for those who believe without seeing.
     Evidently seeing and contact are not crucial to the development of
     faith; in fact, they even may hinder it. Verse 29 pronounces a blessing
     on later generations who have been denied hands-on contact with
     Jesus and yet believe anyway. We are of those later generations, those
     who have had no physical contact with Jesus nor with anyone who
     knew Him in the flesh.

      Look up 2 Corinthians 4:18. How does this fit in with today's
      study? What message is there for us today, who have not seen
      Jesus in the flesh?
               TUESDAY December 30


     The Occasion of the Gospel                           (John 21).

       According to John 21, Jesus employs a threefold sequence of
     question and response to confront Peter about his three denials in
     the high priest's courtyard a short while before (vss. 15-19). Not
     only does Peter need to work through his sense of guilt and failure
     for denying Jesus, but this confrontation probably also gives him the
     opportunity to regain the confidence of his fellow disciples. Later,
     as Jesus and Peter walk along the beach, an incident occurs that may
     have had a large impact on John.

Who does Peter notice is following him and Jesus along the beach?
     John 21:20, 24. See also John 13:23-25.


What does Peter ask Jesus about that disciple? John 21:21.

         Jesus has just explained to Peter the circumstances that would one
      day surround his death. Peter is curious about whether his experience
      would be similar to that of the beloved disciple, the one who wrote the
      Gospel of John (vs. 24). Jesus evades the question with a cryptic "If I
      should prefer that he remain alive until I come, what business is that
      of yours?" (principal contributor's translation).
         Jesus' cryptic comment was misunderstood in the years that fol-
      lowed. People came to believe that the beloved disciple, John, would
      live to see the second coming of Jesus. As disciple after disciple died,
      many became excited over the "obvious" nearness of Jesus' return. As
      John entered old age and began to approach death, a crisis of confi-
      dence loomed: Would John's death make Jesus appear to be a false
      prophet? After all, didn't Jesus say that John would be alive at His
      return?
         Some believe that at this decisive moment, in which the church
      faced a crisis, the Lord moved upon John to leave the legacy of a writ-
      ten gospel, one that would correct the unfounded rumor regarding the
      timing of John's death in relationship to the Second Coming. His
      Gospel would provide what the next generation of Christians needed
      to survive his passing. His Gospel would teach us all how to have a
      living relationship with Someone you cannot see, hear, or touch.

       Read again what Jesus told Peter in John 21:22. He never says
       that John would not die, though that meaning is what some
       have read into the text itself. In what ways are we in danger of
       doing the same thing; that is, reading into texts what is not
       there?


                                                                            9
        WEDNESDAY December 31


     Second Generation
       In a number of different ways, the Gospel of John expresses an
     interest in the second generation of Christians.
       In the Fourth Gospel, the disciples usually are not gathered directly
     by Jesus but through the invitation of someone else who knows Jesus.
     Perhaps this is meant to symbolize how most of the world will come
     to first know Jesus, not through personal contact with Him but
     through the witness of another.

Look up the following texts. How do they express the idea that we
     don't have to see Jesus in the flesh to first learn about Him?

     John 1:40-42



     John 13:20



       Today, of course, people learn about Jesus through the witness of
     others who first tell them about Jesus and, as in the first example
     above, "lead" them to Him. How crucial, then, that we as professed
     followers of Christ, as those whom God has chosen to spread the truth
     to others, be prepared to do just that.
       In John 17 Jesus prays for Himself first of all and then for His dis-
     ciples (vss. 1-19). After this He turns to the second generation, and
     beyond. His prayer is not for His disciples alone but for " 'those who
     will believe in me through their message' " (vs. 20, NIV). Most peo-
     ple throughout history have gained a relationship with Jesus not
     through personal contact but through the writings of those who had
     such contact. Jesus prayed that the Written Word would be the means
     of uniting all believers, those who had seen Him and those who had
     not (vss. 21-23).

      Prayerfully read through Christ's prayer in John 17 (specifically
      verses 11-19), which He offered in behalf of His disciples. What
      are the key points He is praying for? On the lines below, write a
      summary of what Jesus wanted for His followers. What message
      is in there for us, today, as well?

            THURSDAY January 1


     His Word is as Good as His Touch
According to Luke 4:40, what does Jesus do whenever He heals
     people? (See Matt. 9:29, 30; 20.•34; Mark 1:29-31; 9:25-27; Luke
     7:14, 15; 13:13 for further examples.)


By way of contrast, how does Jesus accomplish His mira-
     cles in the Gospel of John? John 4:46-54. (See also 2:1-11, 5:1-15,
     and 11:1-44 for further examples.)


        Jesus uses touch in about half the miracles recorded in Matthew,
     Mark, and Luke. By way of contrast, in John's Gospel, Jesus is rarely
     described as using touch in order to accomplish His miracles.
        Why the difference?
        Perhaps the Spirit moved upon John to select stories in which there
     is an absence of touching or in which the distance between Jesus and
     the healed person is emphasized (in John 4:46-54 Jesus is 16 miles
     away from the individual He heals at the time of the healing), all in
     order to help express the point that one doesn't need immediate phys-
     ical contact with the Lord in order to be blessed, or even healed, by
     Him. These accounts, where there is no touching, are consistent with
     John's theme that Jesus' word is as good as His touch. This is espe-
     cially good news for those, such as we, who can have the assurance
     that although Jesus isn't here in the flesh, He still can be close to us
     in all our trials and sorrows, whatever they happen to be. Through
     these accounts John shows us that heaven is, indeed, closer to earth
     than we might, on sight alone, believe.

Most miracles in the Gospel of John (but not all) came as a result of
     Jesus' words, as opposed to His touch. List the command phrases
     used in each of the following accounts: John 2:7, 4:50, 5:8, 9:7,
     11:43.


        What comes through in these scenes is the power of Jesus' words to
      overcome barriers of space. Distance is no problem for the Lord, who
      created the universe. Jesus' word is as powerful close at hand as at a
      distance. Though now manifested to us through the printed page,
      Christ's Word still retains the power to save and heal. It is through His
      Word that He ministers to the needs of later generations.

       Instead of Jesus in the flesh, we have His Word, the Bible. Why,
       then, is study of the Word crucial in forming a close relationship
       with Him? Without the Bible, what could we know about Jesus?

                                                                            11
                  FRIDAY January 2

Further Study: Note Ellen White's comments on the process of
     how the Bible was written (Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 15-23).
        Regarding faith in Jesus' word versus faith in what we can see and
     touch, Ellen White comments (in the context of John 4:46-54): "The
     nobleman wanted to see the fulfillment of his prayer before he should
     believe; but he had to accept the word of Jesus that his request was
     heard and the blessing granted. This lesson we also have to learn. Not
     because we see or feel that God hears us are we to believe. We are to
     trust in His promises."—The Desire ofAges, p. 200.

Discussion Questions:
    CO Read again 2 Corinthians 4:18 along with Hebrews 11:1. Why
      must our ultimate hope be in things we do not see, at least
      directly? Is there anything we, now, can see that will last forever,
      or will everything we now see ultimately, as it now exists, be
      destroyed?

      o How could different writers portray Jesus from different per-
      spectives? Do these different perspectives make you more or less
      likely to accept their accounts as truthful? If all accounts said the
      same thing, would that not tend to make us think they merely
      were copying one another as opposed to telling the story of Jesus
      as they, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, understood or
      even remembered it? Explain your position.

        What does the gist of this week's lesson tell us about the
      importance of witnessing in the mission of the church?


Summary: We often struggle with the issue of how to have a living
     relationship with Someone we cannot see, hear, or touch. We imagine
     that faith came more easily to those who walked and talked with Jesus
     back in New Testament times. But the Gospel of John tells us that
     Jesus' word, as ministered in the Gospel, is as powerful as His touch.
     Through the Spirit and the Word, we may know Jesus even more inti-
     mately than the disciples did.

A Question
of Honor by PA                      ULINE TANOH


   Pauline went to work in a factory in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, in western
Africa. The factory operated on Saturdays, so Pauline asked for permis-
sion to have Sabbaths off. After awhile, her supervisor grew weary of her
requests. Pauline decided to speak to the personnel director about her
dilemma. Before she went, she fasted and prayed for three days.
   She went to his office and explained her problem. He told her, "Life is
a choice. You must choose which you wish to keep and which you will toss
away, your work or your religion. I attend church, but sometimes I have to
work on Sunday. I work first, then I go to confess to my priest."
   Pauline explained that no priest or pastor could give permission to break
the Sabbath, because God established it. "It is written in the Bible that we
are to work six days and rest the seventh day. If we wish to honor God, we
must do it His way."
   The personnel director slammed his hand down on the desk and shouted,
"Are you trying to teach me the Bible? Get out!"
   Pauline walked out and closed the door. She stood there and prayed,
"Lord, the person who shouts at me is shouting at You. Your will be done."
   Later a colleague asked, "Did he give you your Sabbath off?"
   Pauline answered simply, "God created the Sabbath; he cannot take it
from me."
   The next day was the Sabbath. When the personnel director saw that
Pauline's position was empty, he asked, "Where is she?"
   Her colleagues told him, "Since she was hired, she has not worked on
Saturday, for it is her Sabbath."
   "OK," the boss said. "On Monday she will lose her job."
                               But when Pauline came to work on Monday,
                             she learned that the personnel director had
                             been fired. When a colleague asked her what
                             she thought, she responded, "God is sending
                             this man away because he refused to honor
                             God's Sabbath. The Lord had the final say in
                             the matter."
                               Shortly after the personnel director left, the
                             factory was closed on Sabbaths.

         LESSON            2       *January 3-9



      Jesus Is
      the      Best


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 1.1-18.
Memory Text: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling
      among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only,
      who came from the Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:14,
      NIV).

Key Thought: At the beginning of his Gospel, John describes
      Jesus as the Word who was God from eternity yet who became
      flesh. Thus, He alone is worthy of our worship.

          esus is the ultimate revelation of God. John 1:1-18 functions as a

      J   prologue to the story of Jesus in the Gospel. It tells an amazing
          story. The King of the universe, the eternal Creator, became a
      human being. The One who walked this earth, who became sweaty,
      tired, and hungry, was intimate with God before the world began,
      because He Himself was one with God. Although He became part of
      the human race and was subject to human limitations, He was the One
      who created the human race and the world in which it lived. The
      Creator came to serve the creation, even to the point of death. The
      prologue to John, therefore, interprets everything that happens in the
      Gospel in the light of the larger perspective of eternity.
         The Creator Himself came down and walked among us, spoke our
      language, and showed us in human terms what God is like. Through
      the Fourth Gospel, we escape from a narrow world of limited percep-
      tion into the vast universe of ultimate reality, a view that revelation
      alone can offer.

     The Word as Eternal God (John 1:1, 2).
The prologue to the Gospel of John (John 1:1-18) is beautifully
     structured in the style of Hebrew poetry, which often uses paral-
     lel words and ideas. The simple, yet majestic, grandeur of the lan-
     guage is a fitting complement to the awesome magnificence of the
     ideas expressed in this section of the Gospel.

How far back in time does "the Word" go? John I : I . What does the
     phrase "in the beginning" refer to? Why would John want to link
     these two concepts? (See also John 1:3.)


       The concept of "the Word" would have been readily recognizable to
     the ancient Greeks, whether or not they ever had heard of Jesus. For
     centuries the Greeks had conceived that a divine figure they called
     "the Word" (logos in Greek) was the Creator and Sustainer of the uni-
     verse, the Source of reason and intelligence, and the Mediator between
     the great God and the creation. In applying the term Logos to Jesus,
     John was appealing to the Greeks in terms they could understand.

What kind of relationship did the Word have with the Father? John
      1:1, 2, 18.


Is the Word fully God or in some sort of subordinate position?
      John 1:1.


        The first words of the Gospel combine "in the beginning" (from the
      Creation story of Gen. 1:1) with a verb that expresses continuous
      existence in past time. At the very beginning, at the point when
      Creation began, the Word was already in continuous existence. He is,
      therefore, eternal.
        But the eternity of the Word is not based on some kind of pre-
      creation origin in the Father; Jesus was not created by the Father.
      Instead, from eternity, Jesus, the Word, was distinct from the Father
      (called "God" in John 1:1 but "Father" in verse 18) but in no sense
      inferior. "What God was, the Word was" is the brilliantly accurate
      translation of The New English Bible. The intimate relationship
      between the Word and the Father was an intimacy of equals. We are
      not dealing with "Gods" here; there is full unity in the Godhead at the
      same time that there is intimate relationship among the personalities
      of the Godhead. (See quotations in Friday's section.)



                                                                          15
                MONDAY January 5


     Creator and Sustainer (John 1:3-5).
How does John make it clear that the preexistent Word was not a cre-
     ated being? John 1:3.


        This text is so devastatingly clear that one denomination was forced
     to change the wording of their own Bible translation (adding the word
     other—"all other things were made by him") in order to maintain
     their beliefs. The clear intention of this text as it reads is to assert that
     everyone and everything in all creation was made by "the Word." He
     is the Source of everything created. If "not a single thing" was made
     apart from His action, then He is not the result of an act of creation.
     As John 1:1 points out, before any creation took place, the Word was
     already in continuous existence.
        This teaching may seem academic or irrelevant, but it is extremely
     important to Christian faith. It establishes the incredible value that
     God placed on us at the Cross. The Person who died there was not just
     another part of God's creation, such as the sun, the moon, or angels;
     if He were, the sacrifice would not have the same kind of value it does
     with Jesus as Creator.
        This, then, is no minor sacrifice. At the Cross our value is estab-
     lished in infinite terms: The infinite Son of God died in order to save
     us; that's how important we are in the sight of God. This fact is the
     truest and most stable basis for self-worth.

Read Hebrews 1:2 and Colossians 1:16,17. In what ways do they say
     the same thing as what John says regarding the role of Christ as
     our Creator?


       " 'His name shall be called Immanuel . . . God with us.' The light
     of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen 'in the face of Jesus
     Christ.' From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with
     the Father; He was 'the image of God,' the image of His greatness
     and majesty, 'the outshining of His glory.' It was to manifest this
     glory that He came to our world. To this sin-darkened earth He came
     to reveal the light of God's love—to be 'God with us.' There-
     fore it was prophesied of Him, 'His name shall be called Immanuel.' "
     —Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges. p. 19.

      Meditate on what the full deity of Christ means for us, that God
      Himself died for our sins. Why does that give us so much hope,
      as compared to a view of the universe in which there is no God
      or caring Creator?

     Rejection and Reception (John 1:4-13).
What other function does the Word perform? John 1:4, 5.

       In the original Creation, the Word was the Author of physical light.
     He is the One who uses light (the rays of the sun) as part of the
     process of plant production that sustains physical life on this earth.
     But the author of our Gospel has more than physical light and life in
     mind here. He's talking about light in the spiritual sense, as well.

Read John 1:10. Summarize, in your own words, the gist of what that
     text means.


        Without the Word, there would be no rain, no sunshine, no air, no
     life. The amazing reality is, however, that when the Creator and
     Sustainer of the universe appeared on earth, He was unknown and
     unrecognized as such. Even His "very own" rejected the One who
     gave them life. In light of these verses, the actions of so many people
     toward Jesus in the Gospel of John, including His disciples (John
     12:16, 14:6-9), are foolish and tragic.
        Yet, the message of this prologue is not all dark.

On what basis is it possible to become children of God? John
      1:12, 13? How much human effort is involved?


        In the original language of John 1:12, it is the one who "received" (a
      point in past time) Him and who "believes" (continuous action) in His
      name who gains the right to become a child of God. This language points
      to two aspects of becoming right with God. There is the initial point of
      reception, and there is the ongoing relationship of believing. There is no
      "once saved always saved" here. Being a child of God has a beginning,
      but it is also a process that continues as long as a Christian lives.
         This "new birth," however, is not achieved by human effort; it is as
      much a miracle as the original act of creation. And just as the original
      act of creation must be sustained by the continual miracle of the Word's
      watchcare (vss. 4, 5), so the relationship of the child of God with Jesus
      involves ongoing belief resulting in an ongoing miracle of spiritual life
      (vss. 12, 13).

       In verse 12, John says that those who receive Him become sons
       of God. Why do some receive Him and some do not? What role
       does free choice have in the answer? What role does free choice
       have in the continuation of our spiritual life, as well?

                                                                            17
         WEDNESDAY January 7


     The Humanity of Jesus (John 1:1, 2, 14).
       Compare John 1:1, 2 with what is said in verse 14. While verses
     1-5 focus on the divine preexistence of the Word, verse 14 turns to His
     nature and status as One who walked on earth as a part of human his-
     tory. These texts express an incredible paradox. A man of a particular
     ethnic background, living at a particular time in history, subject to
     human frailty, turns out to be the divine Word, who created the entire
     universe.

             Eternal (John 1:1)                Earthly (John 1:14)

                   "was"                           "among us"
                "was God"                           "became"
                "with God"                       "became flesh"


        The language here is simple yet profound. In John 1:1 the Word
     "was." The Greek tense implies continuous past existence. He always
     "was." But verse 14 tells us that at a point in time the Word "became"
     flesh. The word translated "became" in verse 14 is the same as the one
     translated "made" in verse 3. When the Word became flesh, it was an
     act of creation, something added to His ongoing, eternal nature.
     Though He "was" God, He also "became" flesh. In the process, the
     Word went from being "with God" to being "with us." The entire
     Gospel of John becomes an expression of Jesus' humanity while He
     was here on earth. One struggles here to express truth that is simply
     stated in John 1 yet is so profound that "the whole world would not
     have room for the books" that could be written about it (John 21:25,
     NIV). In simple language John has articulated the full range of both
     the Word's divine and human natures. He is the God-man. He is from
     heaven yet of earth. He always was, yet He also became. He was eter-
     nal, yet He also has a created existence.
        Because He is fully God, Jesus could reveal what God is like in the
     highest sense. Because He became fully human, that revelation is
     accessible to us at a level we can grasp and follow. " 'Anyone who has
     seen me has seen the Father' " (John 14:9, NIV). In the Gospel of
     John, this difficult but glorious truth is revealed in the prologue but
     also brought home to our hearts by the Spirit (John 16:13-15).

      If possible, obtain some facts on the size of the visible universe.
      After reading those figures, dwell on the texts and the study for
      today. How does this help you begin to understand the incredi-
      ble love that God has for us?

            THURSDAY January 8


     The Greatest Revelation                       (John 1:14-18).

What did the Word do in order that His glory            might be seen on
     earth? John 1:14.


       The phrase "made his dwelling" translates from the Greek word for
     "pitch one's tent" to mean a reminder of the tabernacle in the wilder-
     ness (Exod. 25:8, 9). The glory of Jesus that the disciples saw recalls
     the glory of God's presence in that tabernacle (Exod. 40:34, 35).
     Things become even more interesting when we discover that in
     Hebrew the word "to dwell" (shachan) and the word for God's glory
     in the sanctuary (shechinah) come from the same root.
       The Old Testament sanctuary was a marvelous source of grace and
     blessing and continues to instruct us today. But when the Word
     became flesh, the Old Testament sanctuary was eclipsed by an even
     greater Source of grace and blessing (John 1:16). Jesus is a better rev-
     elation of God than even the sanctuary, because in Jesus, God dwelt
     directly in human flesh, and "we" could behold what was before hid-
     den behind curtains.

What did John the Baptist have to say about the Word? John 1:15.
     What was he referring to when he said that Jesus came "before"
     him when, in fact, he had been born before Jesus? See Luke I.


        In Jesus' day the two greatest human figures were John the Baptist
     and Moses. John was revered by many as a contemporary prophet,
     Moses as the great deliverer of Israel and giver of the Law.
        But the prologue makes clear that Jesus is no ordinary human
     being. He is greater than the greatest men known to the people of the
     time. He was the best, because He was God made flesh. In His person
     it became possible for human beings to know what God was like. He
     came to reveal a world far beyond the ability of our senses to know
     and comprehend.
        Moses was a man given an incredible revelation of God (Exod.
     33:19-23), and yet, even he was allowed to see God only briefly and
     from the back. In contrast, the Word came to earth as One who had
     been in continual residence "at the Father's side"—the Greek implies
     continual close communion with God.

       Think of the infinite humiliation the incarnation of Christ
       required. How does that rebuke, in the most powerful way,
       human pride and arrogance? In light of the truth about Christ
       and the Incarnation, why are these such horrendous sins?


                                                                           19
                  FRIDAY January 9


Further Study: "Christ was God essentially, and in the highest
      sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over all, blessed
      forevermore.
        "The Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from eter-
      nity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father."—Ellen G. White, in
      Review and Herald, April 5, 1906.
        "In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived."—Ellen G. White,
      The Desire ofAges, p. 530.
        "The only way in which the fallen race could be restored was
      through the gift of His Son, equal with Himself, possessing the attrib-
      utes of God. Though so highly exalted, Christ consented to assume
      human nature, that He might work in behalf of man and reconcile to
      God His disloyal subject."—Ellen G. White, in Review and Herald,
      November 8, 1892.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Why did John begin his Gospel with thoughts about Creation,
       and even before Creation, when all the other Gospels begin with
       either the birth of Jesus or His adult ministry? What theological
       point was he making?

          As we saw this week, John uses sanctuary imagery in referring
       to Christ (John 1:14). And though the earthly-sanctuary service
       was ended after Christ's death, what role did the sanctuary have
       that is so important in helping us understand just what Christ
       did for us when He was in the flesh and also what He is doing for
       us now as our High Priest?

          How would you answer someone who rejects the Deity or pre-
       existence of Christ on scientific or logical grounds?


Summary: John 1:1-18 tells us that the King of the universe, the
    eternal Creator, chose to become a human being. In simple yet
    profound terms, John expresses the full contrast between the
    divine and human natures of Jesus. No being in the universe is
    more divine than Jesus, nor is any more human. In His person He
    combines everything we need to become children of God. The rest
    of the Gospel will unpack how this can take place in our lives

The Difference
Jesus Makes
by J. H. ZACHARY
   Yohana was a farmer living in Rwanda. In the forest near his home live
the Twa people, pygmies, who are descendants of the original inhabitants
of Rwanda. Today their numbers have dwindled to just a few thousand.
These people do not farm, but move from place to place searching for
food. When there is not enough food, they steal from the farmers. They
earn a small wage making pottery for neighboring tribes.
   Yohana learned that there were no Christians among the Twa in his area.
He had a burden to reach them for Christ. For days he prayed for these
neighbors who live hidden in the dense forests.
   One day Yohana met a Twa man. Yohana invited him to church, but the
man told him, "I cannot come to church because I do not have clothing."
Yohana and another elder gave the man a shirt and trousers, and two weeks
later the man appeared in church. The Holy Spirit touched his heart, and
he responded to the call to accept Jesus as his personal Savior.
   Yohana and a friend visited the new believer in his jungle home. "Why
have you come here?" the surprised villagers asked.
   Yohana replied, "We have learned that Jesus is coming soon to give peo-
ple a new life in a wonderful place in the sky. We want you to come with
 us." The loving friendship of Yohana and his friend touched their hearts.
 As a result of the testimony of the converted tribesman, 14 Twa visited
 Yohana's church the next Sabbath.
    The Holy Spirit spoke to these searchers, and they began studying the
 Bible with the Adventist men. As they studied God's eternal truths, they
 accepted Christ's invitation to "follow Me."
    The government moved the Twa to a new location. Yohana helped them
 find Adventist believers in their new area, and he continues to visit them
 regularly. He is looking forward to their baptism.
    The rest of the Twa are seeing the difference that Christ makes in the
 lives of the 15 Twa believers. They are changing the way they live. They
 no longer steal from the farmers; friendships are replacing former hostil-
 ity. The power of the gospel is changing the entire community. Even
 Yohana's fellow villagers are amazed at how dramatically this group of
 Twa has changed.
    Seeing how God has changed him and those for whom he has labored,
 Yohana became a literature evangelist, so he can sell gospel literature and
 seek for more souls to lead to Christ.

       Something
      Better



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 2:1-22.
Memory Text: "And Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple,
      and I will raise it again in three days' " (John 2:19, NIV).

Key Thought: No matter where we choose to look in order to
      find life, Jesus offers something better: better wine, a better tem-
      ple, even a better birth!

         n John 1:1-18 we saw that Jesus was the best revelation of God

      I  possible. He was there with God from the beginning (vss. 1, 2). He
         created the whole universe, placed life in it, and keeps it going
      (vss. 3-5). In His flesh He embodied the very glory of God (vs. 14).
      He came to us direct from face-to-face intimacy with God (vs. 18).
        The passages in this week's lesson are a natural extension of the
      prologue to John's Gospel. If Jesus is the best, He is naturally better
      than all substitutes. Thus, it's unfortunate that people have developed
      many substitutes for Jesus. They seek to find life by accumulating an
      abundance of possessions. Others seek life in performance and worldly
      success. Still others seek life in the esteem of the rich, the brilliant, the
      beautiful, or the famous. Many, despairing in the failure of these,
      drown life in drugs, alcohol, and addictive games and habits. Some
      pursue various mystical religions. But no matter which path people
      may choose, Jesus offers something better than what they
      possibly could have apart from Him.

     Living Parables (John 2:1-22).
        At first glance there seems to be little spiritual food in this section
     of the Gospel. There is a simple story about a wedding, during which
     the drink runs out before the end of the feast. Jesus rescues a couple
     and their caterer from embarrassment. Then Jesus drives some ani-
     mals and money changers out of the temple. The stories are well
     known and offer no surprises. There are few "quotable quotes" that
     cry out for memorization. Are these stories a digression from the spir-
     itual theology of the Gospel, or is there something deeper going on?
        Also, an interesting feature of the beloved Gospel is the absence of
     parables (see Friday's section). Because parables were a major basis
     for Jesus' teaching, their absence is remarkable. Instead, under the
     guidance of the Holy Spirit, John took actual events from Jesus' min-
     istry and portrayed them as living parables. Beneath the surface of
     each historical account, the Lord has placed a deeper meaning that
     teaches us something special about Jesus.
        And, as the first miracle in the Gospel, the wedding-of-Cana story
     is the first of these living parables.

Read through the story of the wedding feast (vss. 1-11). What do you
      think the importance of this account is?




How would you characterize the interaction between Jesus and His
      mother? John 2:4, 5.




        While ancient parallels suggest that Jesus was not speaking disre-
      spectfully to His mother, He clearly differed with her on this occa-
      sion. "There was danger that Mary would regard her relationship to
      Jesus as giving her a special claim upon Him, and the right, in some
      degree, to direct Him in His mission. . . . As Son of the Most High,
      and Saviour of the world, no earthly ties must hold Him from His mis-
      sion, or influence His conduct. He must stand free to do the will of
      God. . . . The claims of God are paramount even to the ties of human
      relationship."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 147.

       As believers, how do we balance out the commandment to
       honor our parents when it conflicts with our duty to God?

                                                                             23
                   MONDAY January 12


      From Water to Wine (John 2:1-11).
With what activity was the water that Jesus used associated?
      John 2:6.


         An interesting point lies just below the surface of this brief Bible
      study. Changing water into wine symbolized something bigger than a
      mere physical miracle. The water was not just any water; it was water
      set aside by the Jews for ceremonial washings. The wine was not just
      any wine, it was "the best."
         John uses this story as a gentle criticism of a major alternative to
      the faith of Jesus. Religious people of Jesus' day were obsessed with
      washing rituals (see also Matt. 15:1, 2). Washing is good. On a prac-
      tical level, it is sanitary. As a religious expression, it can remind you
      to think about God. Water is necessary for life; without it, we could
      not exist, just as, without God, we could not exist, either.
          But Jesus replaces the water of ceremonial washings with some-
      thing better, the tasty juice of the grape.

According to these texts, what does wine symbolize? Matt.
      26:27-29, Mark 14:23-25, Luke 22:17-20.


What do these texts tell us about how important blood is to the whole
      plan of salvation?

      Lev. 17:11

      Col. 1:14

      Heb. 10:19

        The first miracle Jesus does, then, is to turn water into wine, and
      wine is a symbol of His shed blood, the blood that would be poured
      out for the sins of the world, the only means of salvation. Though
      inspiration does not tell us why this was the first miracle recorded,
      perhaps it was because the Lord wanted right away to present the idea
      of Christ's blood. What we see here, then, however faintly, are sym-
      bols and an image of what is to come.

       If someone were to ask you to explain the meaning of Christ's
       shed blood and what it meant to you, what would you say?

                TUESDAY January 13


      Foretaste of the Cross
When Jesus says " 'My time has not yet come' " (John 2:4, NIV), what
      does He mean by "my time"? John 7:30, 8:20.


       The Greek word translated "time" in all these texts is actually the
      word for "hour." "Mine hour is not yet come." This hour, of course,
      was the "hour" of His arrest and crucifixion.

What does Jesus reveal by His first miracle? John 2:11.

What is meant by the "glory" of Jesus in the Gospel of John? John
      12:23-25, 32, 33.




         The glory of Jesus and the "hour" of Jesus point to the same thing
      in the Gospel of John. The hour of His suffering and death is the very
      occasion in which Jesus is glorified. The Cross is the ultimate mani-
      festation of Jesus' self-sacrificing divine character. The Cross is the
      place where the character of God is most clearly revealed. Here we
      see the glory of God in its fullest manifestation.
         The wedding story, therefore, contains a number of indirect refer-
      ences to Jesus' death and resurrection. The wedding took place "on
      the third day," a reference to Jesus' resurrection (see Matt. 16:21;
      Luke 24:7, 21, 46; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor 15:4). Jesus turns water into
      wine, a symbol of His blood (Luke 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25, 26).
      References to both Jesus' "time" and His "glory" are pointers to the
      Cross. And the only two times in the Gospel that Jesus is described as
      speaking to His mother, He calls her "woman": in the wedding story
      here (John 2:4) and later at the cross (John 19:25-27).
         In a special way, therefore, this charming wedding story is a "living
       parable" of the Cross and of the glory of God's character that would
      be manifested there. The sign Jesus performs at the wedding feast of
      Cana is a foretaste of the ultimate sign He performs in submitting to
       suffering and death. In John 2:11 the disciples' response to that sign
       foreshadowed not only their future response to the Cross (John 20:8,
       24-29) but also the response of all who would come to believe in Jesus
       through their word (John 17:20; 20:30, 31).

       How would you explain to a nonbeliever how God's glory was
       revealed by the Cross?

                                                                           25
         WEDNESDAY January 14


      Cleansing the Temple (John 2:13-22).
Read over the account of Jesus in the temple as expressed by John in
      John 2:13-22. Then answer these questions:

     • When does Jesus go to the temple? What is the meaning of that
     special time? See Exod. 12:24-27.




     • How does Jesus respond to those who challenge His authority
     (John 2:19), and how does that answer fit in with the true mean-
     ing of the Passover service? See 1 Cor. 5:7.




     • Read John 2:21. Why is Christ's body compared to the temple?
     See Exod. 25:8, 9; vss. 17-22; John 1:14.




        The animals being sold in the temple courts were available for sac-
     rifices, making the "marketplace" a genuine and needed service to
     long-distance travelers. The money exchanging was necessary,
     because the temple did business only in a unique temple currency.
        While other sources suggest that there was a lot of deception and
     corruption involved in the temple-court sales, that doesn't seem to be
     the issue here in John. The problem here is that the activity, though
     meeting a legitimate need, was located in a place that should have
     been devoted exclusively to teaching, worship, and prayer.
        Thus, what we see here, in this companion story of the wedding at
     Cana, is the twin theme of "something better," as well as a foretaste of
     the Cross. The temple was good, it was ordained by God; yet, Jesus is
     here offering something even better than the temple: His body. The
     meaning of the Cross transcends all other expressions of religion.

      Think again about the selling of the animals for sacrifice.
      Though itself not bad, it was the context in which it was hap-
      pening that made it bad. In what ways can things in our own
      life, not bad in and of themselves, nevertheless be harmful
      because of the context in which they appear?

26
              THURSDAY January 15


     The Meaning of the Cross (John 2:21, 22; Gal.
     6:14).

        In John's account of the cleansing of the temple, he uses the story,
     as he did with the wedding of Cana, as a parable of the Cross. Not
     only is the Cross superior to the waters of religious ritual, it is supe-
     rior even to the temple in Jerusalem, which, outside of Christ Himself
     in the flesh, was the greatest manifestation of true religion.

Where does Paul, like John, find "glory"? Gal. 6:14. What is Paul
    saying in that verse? In what ways should we have the same expe-
    rience as he did?

         In John 2:1-22, we see good things getting in the way of the best. It
      is no different today. Everyone seeks meaning and a sense of value
      out of life, but few seek it in Jesus. Instead, people try to find "life"
      by accumulating things, by performing in ways, including religious
      performance, that bring praise, and by developing relationships with
      admired people.
         Possessions, performance, and people are good things. They are
      part of the spice of life, but they are not life itself. No matter how
      many possessions you may have, they are never enough. And those
      you have rust, rot, break, crash, or become hopelessly scratched up.
      Athletes become broken and frail, beauty queens grow old and wrin-
      kled, and teachers become mindless and forgetful. Loved ones some-
      times leave you, disrespect you, divorce you, and/or die when you are
      least prepared. Life is frightfully insecure if based on such good
      things as possessions, performance, and relationships with other peo-
      ple.
         To those jaded by a desperate search for life, John offers something
      better: the Cross. The Cross tells us there is a God who knows every-
      thing we have ever done yet loves and values us so much that He gave
       His life for us. "At the foot of the cross, remembering that for one sin-
       ner Christ would have laid down His life, you may estimate the value
      of a soul."—Ellen G. White, Christ's Object Lessons, p. 196. "The
       hand that sustains the worlds in space . . . is the hand that was nailed
       to the cross for me."—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles,
       p. 472. This insight is the source for an incomparable sense of per-
       sonal worth and satisfaction, no matter the circumstances of daily life.

       Though, as Christians, we know these truths, why do we still
       allow ourselves to become caught up in earthly things that can-
       not ultimately satisfy our needs? See Rom. 3:10-20. What is the
       only way out of that trap? See Gal. 6:14.


                                                                             27
                  FRIDAY January 16

Further Study: For those who have not made an in-depth study of
     the Gospel of John, the absence of parables in the Gospel comes as
     quite a surprise. There are only two sayings of Jesus that even come
     close to being classified as parables: the account of the Good
     Shepherd (John 10:1-21) and the description of the vine and the
     branches (John 15:1-8). But neither of these sayings is called a para-
     ble, and they differ from the pattern of Jesus' parables found in the
     other three Gospels. Rather than telling a specific story, they are gen-
     eral illustrations of a point. It is interesting to compare these two say-
     ings with the many parables found in Matthew 13 or Mark 4.
        "The gift of Christ to the marriage feast was a symbol. The water
     represented baptism into His death; the wine, the shedding of His
     blood for the sins of the world. The water to fill the jars was brought
     by human hands, but the word of Christ alone could impart to it life-
     giving virtue. So with the rites which point to the Saviour's death. It
     is only by the power of Christ, working through faith, that they have
     efficacy to nourish the soul."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     pp. 148, 149.

Discussion Question:
      No matter who we are, how much money we have, how great our
      health, how high our status, death is the inevitable end. Anything
      that doesn't answer the problem of death is, ultimately, unsatis-
      factory. Why, then, can Christ alone be the only satisfactory
      answer to this, the greatest of all human problems?


Summary: The beloved disciple tells two stories about Jesus in such
     a way that they become living parables that teach deep insights about
     Jesus. The main point is that Jesus is better than all human substitutes
     for what He offers. Jesus replaces the beautiful rituals of a religiosity
     that leave people short of the fullness of life that He offers. At the
     heart of what Jesus offers is the Cross. If I am that valuable to God,
     then it doesn't matter whether I'm rich or poor, great or small, famous
     or ordinary, and it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of me. I am
     worth the whole universe to Christ.

Behind Every Door
Part 1
TARS MASYUK

  While studying at Zaoksky Theological Seminary in Russia, Tars
Masyuk discovered the blessings of literature evangelism. He joined other
students who spent a summer selling books in a Siberian city.
   Alcohol and drugs are major health issues there, and one-third of the
residents are addicts. Again and again women cried, "Help me. My son is
a drug addict; my husband is an alcoholic."
   Tars was tired and wanted to quit for the day. But a storm raged outside,
so he knocked on the next door. A woman opened the door, and Tars intro-
duced himself and his purpose. The woman invited him into the kitchen.
Tars learned that she was a nurse in a hospital detox unit. She believed in
God but did not attend church.
   The woman's husband came in, and Tars showed them several books on
health and the Bible. The set cost $15, three weeks' pay, and Tars was sure
they could not afford it. But the couple said if he would bring the books in
three weeks, they would have the money.
   Three weeks later Tars returned with the books. When they finally
answered the door, it was apparent the couple had been drinking. His heart
fell, thinking that these people had spent on alcohol the money for the
books.
   "I've brought your books," he said as cheerfully as he could. The cou-
ple sat down at the table and scanned the books. Then the wife went to the
cupboard and pulled out the money. "We wish you would stay and tell us
more about what you believe," they requested. Tars stayed, and the three
talked for a long time.
   Later Tars gave the couple's name to the local elder of the tiny church in
that city. The church had only eight members, and the pastor had 10
                            churches, all 35 to 200 miles (50 to 300 km)
                            from one another. In a follow-up evangelistic
                            series, 21 people were baptized in spite of
                            opposition from the dominant church. Many
                            others are studying with the church members.
                            Tars prays that many will find Christ through
                            the ministry of the students at Zaoksky.

                             TARS MASYUK    (left) has recently completed his studies at
                              Zaoksky Theological Seminary in Russia.

      Grace Is
      All-Inclusive



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 2:23-4:42.
Memory Text: " 'For God so loved the world that He gave His
      one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish
      but have eternal life' " (John 3:16, NIV).

Key Thought: The grace of God manifested on the cross plays
      no favorites. "Whoever believes" will find life in Jesus Christ.

               race is all-inclusive. In John, chapters 3 and 4, we encounter

      G       a pair of living parables in the stories about Nicodemus and
              about the Samaritan woman. Jesus encounters two individu-
      als who are as opposite as can be. Differing in race, religion, reputa-
      tion, gender, wealth, location, and behavior, both encounter Jesus
      away from the crowds. Both find the encounter bewildering and life
      changing.
         In these two stories we see a living parable that unfolds the prom-
      ise of John 3:16, perhaps the most beloved text in the Bible. God
      loved the world so much that He gave His beloved Son in order that
      "whosoever" believes might not perish but have eternal life. In
      Nicodemus and in the Samaritan woman, we see the opposite
      extremes of that "whosoever" illustrated. God does not play favorites
      (see Acts 10:34, 35). No matter who you are, no matter what you have
      done, no matter what your pedigree, no matter how others treat you,
      Jesus exhibits a glorious lack of prejudice. He is truly the "Savior of
      the world" (John 4:42, NIV).

                 SUNDAY January 18


     When Miracles Aren't Enough                             (John 2:23-25).

On what grounds did many people at the Passover Feast come to
     have "faith" in Jesus? John 2:23.


       Words such as faith can be used in more than one way in the Gospel
     of John. Faith can refer to the saving faith in Jesus that the disciples
     gained after He turned the water into wine at Cana (John 2:11). The
     same disciples attained an even deeper and more lasting faith after the
     Cross (vs. 22) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (John 7:39).
       But there is another type of faith that is in view in John 2:23-25 and
     other places: inadequate or superficial faith that is based upon mira-
     cles but does not result in a saving relationship with Jesus. In John
     2:23-25 Jesus sees right through some followers' profession of faith
     and discerns their real motives.

As a result of His miracles, many people came to believe in Jesus.
     Are miracles alone, however, enough for someone to have a saving
     faith in Him? See also Luke 16:31. Explain your answer.


       People sometimes think that if they could see miracles, they would
     have more faith. But miracles are no cure for superficial faith; they
     even can get in the way of true faith, hindering us from perceiving the
     deeper aspects of a relationship with Jesus.
       Even with all the miracles Jesus had performed throughout His
     ministry, many still refused to accept Him, and many turned away
     when they saw that He wasn't going to do everything they expected
     Him to do. (See John 6:51-66 and Ellen G. White, "The Crisis in
     Galilee," in The Desire of Ages.) What this should tell us is that while
     a personal experience with Jesus is crucial for a saving faith, faith
     needs to go beyond mere experience; it needs to be rooted and
     grounded in a living knowledge of who we are, what our condition is,
     and what Christ has done in order to spare us from the fate that our
     condition would otherwise bring to us.

       Look at your walk with the Lord. On what is it based?
       Miracles, experience, reason, emotion? Is your faith grounded
       in a reality deeper than mere emotions or experience alone?
       Write out a paragraph describing why you believe what you do.

     He Came by Night (John 3:1-21).
       In the Gospel of John, the narratives become living parables of the
     spiritual realities offered in Jesus. In Nicodemus ("a witness of the
     scene when Jesus drove out the buyers and the sellers"—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire ofAges, p. 168), we see a living example of a per-
     son who, though a highly esteemed religious leader, had inadequate
     faith.

On what basis does Nicodemus consider Jesus a teacher who has
     come from God? John 3:2. See also John 2:23-25.


        When Nicodemus says "We know," he represents those in the pre-
     vious passage (John 2:23-25) who saw what Jesus did in the temple
     but came to have inadequate faith as a result. "His [Nicodemus's]
     words were designed to express and to invite confidence; but they
     really expressed unbelief."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
     p. 168.
        The Greek word for "night" in this verse comes in a form that
     emphasizes not so much the dark part of the day as the quality of
     darkness, the darkness in Nicodemus's soul at the time he comes to
     Jesus. He has seen what Jesus did in the temple, but he doesn't per-
     ceive the real truth about Jesus, that He is the Word made flesh.

Read John 3:3-10, Christ's immediate response to Nicodemus. Why
     does Nicodemus's response reveal just how little this religious
     leader knew of crucial spiritual truth?


       This story shows Jesus reading the heart of another human being
     (see John 2:25). Nicodemus cannot hide his spiritual ignorance behind
     the veneer of religiosity, of forms and customs, at least not from Jesus.
       In the Nicodemus story, John continues the themes emphasized in
     chapter 2. Jesus replaces Nicodemus's religious ideas with the truth
     about the new birth, with the Cross as the ground for everything that
     Jesus offers. The kingdom of God is entered not by physical birth but
     by a personal decision that everyone, even a leader of the Jews, such
     as Nicodemus, has to make.

      We might be very religious, faithful in all the forms and tradi-
      tions of our faith, but according to today's study, what is the one
      thing we must have? Ask yourself which category you fall in10. If
      it is not the right one, what must happen for you to be changed?

               TUESDAY January 20


     The New Birth (John 3:3-8).
       The name Nicodemus means "leader of the people." He was
     undoubtedly a pious man, an example of the best that Judaism could
     offer. As a Pharisee, he took the Scriptures and his faith seriously. He
     no doubt would have made a good neighbor. Jesus' response to this
     good man, this faithful and godly man, is, therefore, somewhat sur-
     prising.

What do even "good" and pious people need in order to enter the king-
      dom of God? John 3:3, 5. What do you understand this to mean?


        If Nicodemus had been part of the delegation of Pharisees who
      questioned John the Baptist (John 1:24-28), he would have been
      aware of John's claim that baptism by water heralded the coming of
      the One greater than John—of the Messiah. As good and pious as
      Nicodemus was, he needed a new birth that could come only from the
      Messiah through baptism and the work of the Holy Spirit.
        Water and Spirit are closely related in Jesus' teaching (John 4:10-
      14, 23, 24; 7:37-39). And the concept of being "born from above" is
      related to the ministry of John in John 3:22-36. So Jesus' statement
      here suggests the need for a double baptism, an outward one by water
      and an inward one by the Holy Spirit.

Read again what Jesus says to Nicodemus. In what ways do His
      words show us the utter futility of saving ourselves and our entire
      dependence upon God for salvation? See also Isa. 25:9, Titus 3:5,
      Heb. 9:12.


        Though we saw in Sunday's section how experience alone (such as
      witnessing miracles) isn't enough for a saving faith, Christ's words to
      Nicodemus show at the same time just how crucial experience is to
      the Christian. A new birth is, indeed, nothing if not an experience.
      Jesus is telling Nicodemus, and us, that a knowledge of forms, cus-
      toms, even correct doctrine, isn't enough. We must experience, per-
      sonally, His saving power in our lives.

       If someone asks you, Have you been born again? what would
       you answer? And if the answer is Yes, what grounds do you have
       for saying so?




                                                                          33
         WEDNESDAY January 21


     She Came by Day (John 4:1-42).
Read over the entire account of Jesus with the woman at the well and
     then answer these questions:

     • How does the woman at the well react to Jesus at first? John 4:9,
     11, 12.


     • What makes the woman believe that Jesus is a prophet? John
     4:17-19, 29.


       Put yourself in the place of this woman: Here is this stranger, some-
     one from a rival religion, in fact, who quickly reveals that He knows
     some of her darkest, most personal secrets. No wonder she had a
     change of attitude! Thus, it is not the physical presence of Jesus that
     convinces the woman that He is the Messiah (His physical appearance
     apparently meant nothing to her)—it is His word. Here, again, John
     underlines the theme that Jesus' word is as good as His touch.

Read carefully John 4:21-24. What point is Jesus making to her?
     What is He seeking to lead her toward?


        John 4:23, 24 recalls the cleansing of the temple in chapter 2. Jesus
     has come to earth to restore the proper worship of God. A localized
     temple favors one people over another; worship in spirit, however, is
     universal. It is not tied to any geographical place or particular people.
     Jesus brings out that the location of worship is not nearly as important
     as the attitude of the worshiper. It is not so much where we worship as
     whom we worship.
       In the story of the Samaritan woman, John continues the themes of
     chapters 2 and 3. For one thing, Jesus knows all about the Samaritan
     woman. He reads her heart and her history, as He did with Nicodemus.
     This knowledge gives her the confidence to proclaim Him. In return,
     Jesus replaces the worship of the Samaritans with a more adequate
     faith based on Spirit and truth.

      Notice something not explicit in this story: Jesus exposes the
      woman's darkest sins, and yet when she leaves, she tries to get
      others to come to Jesus. Why did she not keep quiet about this
      Man who could do her much harm? What does her attitude
      about Jesus tell us about how Jesus must have treated her,
      despite her sin? What lessons are here for us in how we deal
      with sinners?

             THURSDAY January 22


     The Attraction of Opposites.
As a result of the woman's testimony and of their own encounter
     with Jesus, what do the Samaritans come to believe about Jesus?
     John 4:42. Also, what was it about Jesus that causes them to
     believe?


       " 'Savior of the world' " means that salvation is no longer bound by
     ethnic or geographic considerations. In Jesus all peoples, including
     despised groups such as the Samaritans, can claim the fullness of
     God's favor. For the scorned and rejected, this kind of salvation comes
     as a great and welcome surprise. To those who oppress and exclude,
     this great salvation comes as the shattering of a world in which every-
     one knows his or her "place."

What are all these texts telling us? Acts 10:28, 17:26, Col. 3:11,
      1 John 2:2.


         It is said that in relationships opposites attract. The stories about
      Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman portray these two in stark con-
      trast to each other. Nicodemus is a man, the Samaritan a woman. He
      is a Jew, a Pharisee no less, she a lowly Samaritan. He comes by night;
      she comes at noon. He is rich (John 19:39); she is poor (or she would
      not have been fetching her own water in the heat of the day). He is
      highly educated ("the" teacher of Israel [John 3:10]); she is, as a
      woman in first-century Palestine, probably illiterate. He is pious (a
      Pharisee), she an adulteress. He is highly respected; she is (probably)
      despised and rejected, even by her own Samaritan neighbors. He has
      a great name, known from ancient writings outside the Bible; she is
      anonymous. He lives in the holy city, Jerusalem; she lives in Sychar,
      (which means "drunkenness"). He is open to believe yet slow to
      accept; she is suspicious at first yet quick to embrace Jesus when she
      realizes who He is.
         In these two stories, we see a living parable of John 3:16. God sent
      His Son so that "whoever believes" might have eternal life. In these
       two individuals we see the opposite extremes of that "whoever." No
       matter who you are, your station in life, or your sinful condition, you
       are welcome to receive Him. He is truly the "Savior of the world"
       (John 4:42 NIV). See the quotation in Friday's section.

       Considering what we have studied today, why is racism so offen-
       sive in the sight of God?



                                                                           35
                   FRIDAY January 23


Further Study: "Jesus had begun to break down the partition wall
      between Jew and Gentile, and to preach salvation to the world.
      Though He was a Jew, He mingled freely with the Samaritans, setting
      at nought the Pharisaic customs of His nation. In the face of their prej-
      udices He accepted the hospitality of this despised people. He slept
      under their roofs, ate with them at their tables—partaking of the food
      prepared and served by their hands—taught in their streets, and
      treated them with the utmost kindness and courtesy. . . .
         "Those who call themselves His followers may despise and shun the
      outcast ones; but no circumstance of birth or nationality, no condition
      of life, can turn away His love from the children of men. To every soul,
      however sinful, Jesus says, If thou hadst asked of Me, I would have
      given thee living water.
         "The gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and presented
      only to a select few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if they accept
      it. The message is to be given to all."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
      Ages, pp. 193, 194.

Discussion Questions:
    0 How can we gain a clearer insight into the deceitfulness of our
       own hearts? In what type of setting are you most willing to con-
       fess your mistakes to others? How can the church help to create
       such settings?

       e To what degree is it possible for Christians today to have the
       kind of discernment of others' thoughts, motivations, and feel-
       ings that Jesus had? If we can't, what should that fact tell us
       about why we need to be very careful not to judge the hearts of
       others?

Summary: The penetrating gaze of Jesus changes everything. Self-
     assured people become uncertain. Despised people find new life.
     Comfortable churches learn to shun business as usual. The Spirit
     blows where it wills. So it should not be surprising that when
     Christians become more like Jesus they shake things up too. As was
     the case also for Jesus, this "shaking" will not be greeted everywhere
     with joy. Both inside and outside the church, many prefer the com-
     fortable security of a life that is undisturbed by the troublesome wind
     of the Spirit. These oppose the freedom of the Spirit with every fiber
     of their being.

Behind Every Door
Part 2
TARS MASYUK

    Tars was tired; he had just one more apartment to visit in the building,
but one look at the door and he was tempted to skip it. Then he reminded
himself of his promise to visit every apartment.
    Tars raised his hand to knock on the aging and broken door. Surely the
person living here spends their meager earnings on things other than his
or her home, he thought.
    A man answered the knock and opened the door. He hesitated before he
let Tars come in, saying his apartment was untidy. And it was. Plastic bags
filled with empty alcohol bottles littered the floor. Tars decided that the
man must collect empty vodka bottles to earn money for his own alcohol.
    Tars wondered what he should say to the man. "Do you believe in God?"
he asked.
    The man answered, "Yes, somewhere in my heart I believe in God, but I
do not think there is anything that can help me in my situation."
    Tars shared stories of others whose lives God had rescued from drugs,
alcohol, and other vices. He assured the man that Christ can change his
heart, too. Tars sensed that the man wanted his life to change but was not
sure it was possible. Tars showed the man Steps to Christ and told him that
of all the books he had, this one was the most powerful and could show
him how much God wanted him as His child. The man was interested, and
when Tars told him the book was $1, the man began searching for money.
He dug into his pockets, into the couch, every place he had ever left
money, until he found enough to buy the book.
    Tars knew that to buy this book the man would go hungry, but the man
wanted the book. "Now I have no money for bread," he said, handing the
money to Tars.
    "Take out a few rubles for bread, and I will make up the amount myself,"
Tars answered. The man agreed and began asking many questions about
religion. Tars hesitated, then showed him The Great Controversy, and said
 it would answer many of his questions.
    The man wanted that book too, but had no money. "I know!" he said. "I
 will collect enough bottles to buy this book, too!" And he did.
    The names of everyone who bought literature or showed an interest in
 religion were given to the local church to visit. Great harvests will be
 reaped as people turn their hearts to God instead of alcohol.

TARS MASYUK   recently graduated from Zaokckv Theological Seminary.

           LESSON           5       *January 24-30


      The Struggle to
      Be Real



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 4:43-54.
Memory Text: "Jesus replied, 'You may go. Your son will live.'
      The man took Jesus at his word and departed" (John 4:50, NIV).

Key Thought: When we encounter Jesus, He challenges us to re-
      evaluate everything in our lives, even our own self-understanding.

          n this lesson we encounter a man whose faith in Jesus is sufficient

       I  to propel him to journey 16 miles uphill in order to find Jesus and
          ask Him to heal his son. If we had observed him, we would have
      called him a man of faith. Yet, Jesus labels the man's faith as the kind
      that's merely seeking after miraculous signs and wonders. Jesus
      exposes his faith as something other than what it seemed to be.
        The human heart is deceptive by nature (Jer 17:9). Even at our best
      we sometimes deceive ourselves and others. But John tells the story
      of One who not only sees past our image building to the true need of
      the soul but helps us to a fuller and deeper knowledge of both self and
      God through His Word.
        In this lesson we will examine a living parable of the One whose
      word is as good as His touch. In the process, we will gain a deeper
      insight into a more authentic Christian faith.

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, January 31.

                 SUNDAY January 25


     No Honor at Home (John 4:43-45).
       This passage forms the transition between the story about the
     woman of Samaria and the story about a royal official in Galilee who
     approaches Jesus in behalf of his son. It is a startling passage in
     which, at first glance, two separate assertions seem to contradict each
     other.

What saying does Jesus have in mind as He approaches His home
     province? John 4:43, 44. What do you think that means?


How do the Galileans react upon Jesus' arrival, and why? John 4:45.

        As Jesus approaches Galilee, He is mindful that "a prophet has no
      honor in his own country"; yet, the Galileans welcome Jesus. In the
      original language, the word then occurs at the beginning of verse 45,
      suggesting that verse 45 is somehow the natural result of verse 44, "A
      prophet has no honor in his own country. When Jesus arrived in
      Galilee, therefore, the Galileans welcomed Him!" The welcome of the
      Galileans is somehow "without honor" to Jesus.

Read carefully John 4:45, as well as John 2:23-25. How do these
      verses explain what is happening here?




         The welcoming response of the Galileans is just like that of the
      Judeans, who showed faith in Jesus because they had seen miracles
      and signs. The Galileans thought they were welcoming Jesus in a pos-
      itive way. But enthusiasm for Jesus that is based on miracles only is
      no honor. The Galileans prove to be a people who are awed by mira-
      cles and spectacular works but who are slow to believe in Jesus'
      words. Their excitement about Jesus is based more on selfishness
      than on faith in who He was.

       In probably all of us, there are some selfish motives in our faith
       (after all, Why do we want salvation, if not to gain something for
       ourselves?). Must our motives always be pure in our walk with
       the Lord? Can the Lord still work with those whose motives
       might not be exactly what they should be?



                                                                          39
                 MONDAY January 26


      It Is Hard to Be Real (John 4:46-49).
        As is so often the case in John's Gospel, this new story functions as
      an acted parable, demonstrating the truth of the earlier statement. The
      problematic, Galilean welcome of Jesus (John 4:43-45) is illustrated
      with a story about a royal official who believes in Jesus yet struggles
      in his expression of that faith.

What problem does the royal official bring to Jesus, and what does
      he want Jesus to do? John 4:47, 49.


Where did both Jesus and the royal official live? John 2:12, 4:46.

        Jesus and the royal official had probably spent some time as
      neighbors in a very small town (Capernaum was little more than one
      hundred meters across). The man's combination of faith and doubts
      well illustrates a prophet's difficulty in finding honor at home.

What does Jesus say in response to the royal official's first request?
      John 4:48. What did Jesus mean by this statement? Was not part
      of the problem the fact that they saw signs and wonders and yet
      still did not have true faith?


         Jesus' initial response indicates that the man, like Nicodemus
      before him, was an example of inadequate faith. It seems that the
      Galileans on the whole welcomed Jesus outwardly but did not really
      believe in Him (John 4:43-45). The miracles Jesus performed actually
      may have become stumbling blocks to the people on their way to a
      true appreciation of Jesus.
         A Galilean himself, the royal official is confronted by the reality of
      his partial, inadequate faith. He is not relying on the word of Jesus but
      requires physical evidence before he would believe. He is startled to
      discover that he could not hide his unbelief from Jesus (remember the
      theme of John 2:23-25: Jesus knows!). Realizing that he might lose
      all on account of unbelief, he finally throws himself at the feet of
      Jesus in desperation.

       What are some helpful ways of dealing with doubt? Is doubt
       always a negative thing, or can it sometimes play a positive role
       in a Christian's experience? Why?

                TUESDAY'           January 27


      The Path to Faith (John 4:50-54).
What does Jesus say in response to the man's second and more des-
     perate request, and how does the royal official react? John 4:50.


        "The nobleman left the Saviour's presence with a peace and joy he
      had never known before. Not only did he believe that his son would
      be restored, but with strong confidence he trusted in Christ as the
      Redeemer."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, pp. 198, 199.
         The shocking word that Jesus speaks to the man is that He does not
      need to travel to Capernaum; Jesus can heal at a great distance. This
      is a living parable of the Gospel's message to the second generation
      of Christians that Jesus' word is as good as His touch. He does not
      need to be present physically to meet any need.
         The second statement of Jesus is the final piece that brings faith to
      the royal official. He grasps the word of Christ, and he believes. But
      belief brings with it a test. Would he act on that newfound faith?
      Would he head home believing that his son will live, or would he con-
      tinue to beg Jesus to come to his home and heal his son with a touch?
      His actions demonstrate his newfound faith.

What do these texts say about the relationship between faith and
    works? Isa. 58:1-12, John 15:5, James 2:22.


         It was about one o'clock in the afternoon when the royal official
      encountered Jesus. If he had hurried downhill (Cana is some six hun-
      dred meters higher than Capernaum, twenty-five kilometers away), he
      could have made it back to Capernaum that night (see Ellen G. White,
      The Desire ofAges, p. 199). One would think that he would have hur-
      ried home to find out whether his son were, in fact, healed. Instead,
      the fact that the servants were sent out to look for him the day after he
      met Jesus indicates that he took his time heading home, stopping
      somewhere for the night. The man not only headed home at Jesus'
      command; he did so in a manner that indicated he had fully accepted
      Jesus' word. The evidence of faith is action. If the only reason to
      hurry was worry about his son, his deliberate journey was the living
      expression of his confidence in Jesus' word.

       Though we are not saved by works, how do works manifest and
       express our faith? In your own experience, how have works
       strengthened your faith in the Lord? What is it about good
       works that strengthens faith? Also, in your experience, how do

     The Solution to Life's Problems                               (Rom.
     10:17, Hebrews 11).

According to Paul, how does faith come to a person? Rom. 10:17.


        Faith came to the royal official by hearing Jesus' word from His
     own mouth. For the second generation of Christians, faith comes when
     the word of Christ is grasped in written form or in the oral presenta-
     tions of those who bring that Written Word to us.
        Under the surface of the story in John 4 lies the divine solution to
     life's problems. The story begins with a point of need. The royal offi-
     cial's son lay dying. When the official heard that Jesus was accessible,
     he did not linger at home hoping that something good might happen;
     he brought his problem directly to Jesus. He assumed that if Jesus
     accompanied him back to Capernaum, His touch would banish the ill-
     ness that threatened the life of his son.
        Instead, Jesus speaks the shocking word that He does not need to
     travel to Capernaum; He can heal at a great distance. His word is as
     good as His touch. The man not only takes Jesus at His word; his
     actions from that time on are a bodily demonstration of his faith in
     Jesus' word.

Read Hebrews 11. How does this chapter fit in with these issues
     regarding the exercise of faith?


        How can we apply this faith lesson to our problems today? Four
     steps seem to emerge: (1) Acknowledge the problem. This is not as
     simple as it sounds but will be discussed further in the next day's
     study. (2) Take your problem to Jesus in prayer. (3) Receive the word
     that your need has been met. The words of Jesus to us are found in the
     Bible. If we want to hear those words, we need to know the Word. That
     is why continual Bible study is important. (4) Speak and act out God's
     answer. It is not enough simply to hear the Word. The Word becomes
     real to us when we act on it and when we tell others about our faith.
     Genuine belief results in corresponding action.
        But what if we are like the royal official? What if our belief is mixed
     with unbelief? What if we have doubts? This story suggests that the
     doubts need to be confronted with words of faith and action. Take God
     at His word. Do what the Bible says, and faith will come.

      Why is the actual practice and exercise of faith so important for
      maintaining faith?

      Steps to Authenticity
What is the natural condition of the human heart? Jer. 17:9. What is
      Laodicea's fundamental problem? Rev. 3:17. How do these two
      factors work together against us?


         "Like a flash of light, the Saviour's words to the nobleman laid bare
      his heart. He saw that his motives in seeking Jesus were selfish. His
      vacillating faith appeared to him in its true character."—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 198.
         The royal official did not know the depths of his unbelief until con-
      fronted directly by Jesus. We, too, are often unaware of our sinfulness
      and unbelief. We are like Laodicea, the church in Revelation whose
      self-concept is not confirmed by reality (Rev 3:17). How can you
      bring a problem to Jesus when your heart is deceiving you, when you
      do not even know that you have a problem?
         The most effective path to true authenticity before God is a devo-
      tional encounter with Him.
         1. Through Bible study we discover that God works with real people
      who make mistakes, such as David and Peter and Nicodemus. We do
      not have to be afraid to confess sins and problems to Him; He already
      knows them. And we find out that He does not give up on people who
      make mistakes. So, we gain the courage to get real with God.
          2. Through prayer we seek to be real with God. God prefers that we
      be totally honest with Him in prayer. Jesus certainly was. "Why have
      You forsaken Me?" If Jesus could be that honest with God, it cannot
      be a sin for us! The Lord wants to hear our deepest needs, our deep-
      est feelings, yes—even our anger.
          3. Through journaling (a spiritual diary) we can bring both our
      Bible study and our prayers into sharp focus. The writing process
      draws out depths of self-understanding that often go untapped with-
       out it. The writing process can help us develop a deeper understand-
       ing of our need for God in specific areas of life.
          4. Accountability to others can enhance our accountability to God.
       Authentic Christians usually can point to specific people who under-
       stand and love them yet can share frankly regarding the quality of
       their behavior.
          Through exercises such as the ones above, we can gain a more
       accurate awareness of the barriers we set up against God in our lives.

       If we know our own hearts are corrupt, if we know our own
       motives are not pure, if we know we are sinners to the core, why
       must we place our whole hope only in what Christ did for us at
       the Cross? See Rom. 5:8, Col. 1:14, 1 Tim. 1:15, 2:6.


                                                                           43

Further Study: Many people are troubled by the idea of account-
     ability. They suggest that we should take everything to God in prayer
     (Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 119). While Ellen White makes
     statements that support such a concept, she also underlines the impor-
     tance of being accountable to other Christians.
       "It is your duty to counsel with your brethren. This may touch your
     pride, but the humility of a mind taught by the Holy Spirit will listen
     to counsel, and will banish all self-confidence."—Ellen G. White,
     Testimonies to Ministers, p. 315.
       "When men's hearts are softened and subdued by the constraining
     influence of the Holy Spirit, they will give heed to counsel; but when
     they turn from admonition until their hearts become hardened, the
     Lord permits them to be led by other influences."—Ellen G. White,
     Prophets and Kings, p. 425.
       "There are souls perplexed with doubt, burdened with infirmities,
     weak in faith, and unable to grasp the Unseen; but a friend whom they
     can see, coming to them in Christ's stead, can be a connecting link to
     fasten their trembling faith upon Christ."—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, p. 297.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Read Hebrews 11:6. Why is it impossible, without faith, to
      please God? What does that mean, to "please God"?

      0 How does the attitude of the Galileans toward Christ compare
      with that of the Samaritans in the same chapter? What lessons
      should that comparison have for us?

      0 If faith is a gift from God (Eph. 2:8), why is the exercise of
      faith so important? Why does the Lord not just keep renewing
      the gift, regardless of what we do?


Summary: Jesus returns to Galilee and finds a people who express
     faith in Him that is based on His ability to do miracles. Using the
     example of the royal official, the author of the Gospel both exposes
     the emptiness of such faith and points the way to true faith. Through
     the words of Jesus, we gain a more authentic understanding of our
     own sinfulness and of the barriers we erect to avoid intimacy with
     God. But when faith is actively expressed in words and actions, it
     enables us to take hold of the solutions to life's problems that God
     offers to us through His Word.

From Disappointment
to Discovery
by J. H. ZACHARY
   Anna has four daughters. Violeta, the youngest, was engaged to marry
a young man, but his parents refused to permit the marriage because the
couple were of different faiths. Distressed, and with time on her hands,
Violeta decided to study the teachings of different churches. She found a
Bible and began to read. Often she stayed up until midnight, and many
times her mother heard her weeping.
   One day Violeta received an invitation to attend an evangelistic meet-
ing. She did not know what church was conducting the meeting, but she
went and was thrilled that the speaker based his message upon the Bible.
   Violeta offered to tell her mother what the Bible teachers were saying,
but her mother refused to listen, for she wanted to follow only what her
own church taught. But one day Anna happened to hear Violeta reading
aloud from the Bible. As she listened, Anna felt something tugging at her
heart. She realized that she was not following the Bible.
   Anna found an old Bible and began reading it. She realized that it was
the same as the Bible her daughter was reading. Anna began reading from
it every day, searching for God.
   Violeta began attending the Seventh-day Adventist church. Anna
allowed her to go, thinking that going to any church was better than going
to the discos. Violeta often talked to her mother about what she was learn-
 ing in church. While Anna would not attend the meetings, she did listen
as Violeta told her what the pastor had said.
   Through Violeta's testimony, Anna heard the truths of the Bible that
 had been hidden from her for so long. She decided to follow the truth and
                               began attending the Adventist church with
                               her daughter, even though her husband
                               opposed her. Finally he agreed to attend a
                               series of meetings with Anna and Violeta,
                               and he was baptized. Anna's other three
                               daughters are also studying the Bible in
                               preparation for baptism.

         LESSON             6      *January 31—February 6


      Putting the Past Behind You




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 5.
Memory Text: "Later Jesus found him at the temple and said
      to him, 'See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse
      may happen to you' " (John 5:14, NIV).

Key Thought: Jesus is not satisfied to heal only physically or
      spiritually. He wants to restore the entire person. Genuine faith
      involves every part of life: mental, physical, emotional, and spirit-
      ual.

              ew life in Christ includes "putting the past behind you." In

      N       John 5 we read a story about a man who had sunk as low as a
              human being could go and still be alive. Paralyzed in body,
      sin-stricken in mind and heart, he doesn't even appeal to Jesus for
      healing. Jesus chooses to make the man a Sabbath-day example of His
      awesome power to bring life to those as good as dead. Not only does
      He restore the man physically, He challenges the man to cooperate in
      extending that healing to his whole person.
         When confronted by the religious leaders regarding His "desecra-
      tion" of the Sabbath, Jesus reveals the Godlike nature of His action.
      In healing the man at the pool on the Sabbath, Jesus offers stunning
      testimony with regard to His divine origin and mission. He is more
      than just a man, more than even a Messiah; He is the creative Life-
      Giver Himself. So, the story of the healing at the Pool of Bethesda
      becomes another living parable of the divine Creator who became
      flesh and dwelt among us.

                 SUNDAY February 1


      The Pool of Bethesda (John 5:1-4).

Read the first four verses of John 5. In what ways is this scene sym-
      bolic of fallen humanity? What is the condition of these people,
      and where are they looking for help?




         The name Bethesda may be interpreted as "House of Mercy," so
      Jesus shows mercy at the place where people looked for mercy. The
      Pool of Bethesda was located just north of the temple complex. The
      pool was fed by an intermittent stream, which may explain the trou-
      bling of the waters from time to time.

What happens at the pool? John 5:3, 4.

        Your answer to this question may depend on the version of the Bible
      you use. In English, many older translations, such as the King James
      Version, state that an angel of the Lord stirred up the healing waters,
      but the more ancient biblical manuscripts leave out that element of the
      story (hence, no verse 4 in many translations). Although Ellen White
      generally used the King James Bible, she apparently rejected the
      implication that angels were involved in the troubling of the waters.
        "At certain seasons the waters of this pool were agitated, and it was
      commonly believed that this was the result of supernatural power, and
      that whoever first after the troubling of the pool stepped into the
      waters, would be healed of whatever disease he had."—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 201 (emphasis supplied). If the tradi-
      tional reading were to prove correct, it certainly would be a strange
      thing for God to arrange a healing mechanism in which the least sick
      are favored over the truly needy. In direct contrast, Jesus enters a
      place of merciless mercy and picks out the least-likely candidate to
      achieve healing along the lines of the popular tradition.

       All around us we see vast multitudes similar to those at the Pool
       of Bethesda, sick, damaged, hurt by the warfare of life, and
       waiting in vain for help from sources that really cannot give it.
       As Christians, what is the one thing that we, perhaps just as
       damaged, have been given that they need, as well? See Rom.
       8:24, Col. 1:5, Titus 2:13.



                                                                          47
                MONDAY February 2


     Healing the Paralytic (John 5:5-15).
Review the story of Jesus healing the paralytic, as presented in
     John 5:5-15. Summarize the essence of what happened, dwelling
     specifically on what this story tells us about the character of God.




        Several aspects of this story cry out for attention. First of all, Jesus
     healed the man arbitrarily. He picked one man out of a whole crowd
     of people—a man who had not sought Jesus out, a man who did not
     even know Him, a man who expressed no faith in Him before being
     healed. His only claim to Jesus' attention may have been that he was
     the most pitiful of all the cases present.
        How typical of God to act this way! To act in this way at decisive
     points in our lives, God's hand often is felt in ways we have not asked
     for and do not deserve. God does things such as this, not to excuse sin
     but so we can experience His grace, which reminds us of our total
     dependence on Him.
        A second startling aspect to the story is that Jesus chose to heal the
     man on the Sabbath. The rabbis allowed for special acts on the
     Sabbath in emergencies, but this was no emergency. After all, the man
     had been crippled for 38 years; surely a day's delay for the sake of the
     Sabbath would not have made a major difference. Jesus was deliber-
     ately making a point here. " 'It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath,' "
     Jesus had said in Matthew 12:12 (NIV). What was said there is acted
     here. "The Sabbath is not intended to be a period of useless inactiv-
     ity. . . . The work of Christ in healing the sick was in perfect accord
     with the law."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 207.
        The story in John 5 became a living parable illustrating the truth of
     John 5:21: " 'The Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it' "
     (NIV). Jesus can give life to anyone He wishes, because there are no
     limits to His life-giving power.

      After healing the paralytic, Jesus tells him not just to arise and
      walk but to take up his bed, as well, knowing that this action
      would arouse the indignation of the religious leaders. What do
      you think Christ's motives were in that command, and what
      message could that have for us, we who take the Sabbath com-
      mand seriously?

                TUESDAY February 3


     Dealing With Sin and Its Consequences
     (John 5:14).

What does Jesus tell the former invalid when He meets him later in
     the temple? John 5:14.


        When Jesus tells the man to "stop sinning" (N/I9, He implies, first
     of all, that the man's illness was caused by sin in some sense.
     Continued sin might result in a relapse of the paralysis.
        There is, however, an even deeper element here. The form of the
     word translated "sinning" is extremely continuous. Jesus commands
     the man to stop something that he had been doing continuously, right
     up to the time of this encounter in the temple. This implies that the
     man had somehow been continuing in sin, even in a paralyzed state.
     What kind of sin was Jesus talking about? A paralyzed man cannot
     rob banks, commit adultery, or kill anyone. Jesus must have been
     referring to sin of the mind—his thoughts, his attitudes, his imagina-
     tion.

After extending grace to the paralytic, Jesus tells him to "sin no
      more." Look up the following texts: How do they reveal the same
      principle manifested in Christ's words to the healed man? John
      8:10, 11; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 2:16, 17.


         But while the healing of the man's body was totally an act of grace
      on Jesus' part, there was a part for him to play in his recovery, as well.
      Sin not only separates us from God; it produces ongoing conse-
      quences that eventually destroy the quality of all aspects of a person's
      life.
         The consequences of sin include not only physical injuries and dis-
      ease; there are emotional, spiritual, and psychological effects, as well.
      All these can and should be addressed by a relationship with Jesus.
      All other things being equal, a genuine walk with Jesus brightens the
      facial expressions, soothes the emotions, warms the heart, and brings
      renewed energy to the body. This is why Seventh-day Adventist
      Christianity is so concerned with things such as diet, exercise, and
      attitude. Genuine faith involves every part of life—mental, physical,
      and emotional—as well as spiritual.
         Nevertheless, most Christians readily acknowledge that their inner
      lives, particularly the emotional aspect, can be quite unstable even
      after conversion. This passage tells us we have an active role to play
      in cooperating with Jesus in our recovery from sin and its effects on
      our life.

                                                                             49
         WEDNESDAY February 4


     Jesus, the Life-Giver (John 5:16-30).
How does Jesus justify His act of healing on the Sabbath? John 5:16-
     18.


        In response to the persecution He experienced, Jesus says He is sim-
     ply following the example of His Father, who is "always" at work on
     the Sabbath. God's action provides the model for human activity on
     the Sabbath.
        Jewish writers of the time recognized that God's work on the
     Sabbath could be detected in births, deaths, sunshine, rain, and the
     continued flowing of rivers (see William Barclay, The Gospel of John
     [Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1975], vol. 1, p. 183). The Jews,
     therefore, recognized that Jesus was claiming the same privileges on
     the Sabbath that God has claimed. By healing on the Sabbath, Jesus
     was claiming equality with God.
       "Should God forbid the sun to perform its office upon the Sab-
     bath? . . . Must the wheat and corn stop growing, and the ripening
     cluster defer its purple bloom? . . . In such a case, men would miss the
     fruits of the earth, and the blessings that make life desirable. . . . He
     will not be held guiltless who neglects to relieve suffering on the
     Sabbath. God's holy rest day was made for man, and acts of mercy are
     in perfect harmony with its intent. God does not desire His creatures
     to suffer an hour's pain that may be relieved upon the Sabbath or any
     other day."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 206, 207.

List the various ways John 5:16-30 portrays Jesus as equal with the
      Father.


        In John 5:19-30 Jesus demonstrates that He is doing the same work
     as His Father, the work of giving life (vss. 20, 21, 26, 28, 29) and the
     work of judging (vss. 22, 27, 30). By doing what His Father says on
     this earth, He not only shows that the Father is life but demonstrates
     the truth of His own claim to divinity (vss. 19-23). He does not leave
     anyone the option of believing in the Father while ignoring His claims
     about Himself (vs. 23).

      Here is Jesus, who performs an incredible miracle; however, so
      caught up in their own religious forms and customs, the leaders
      focus, instead, on the "minor" things, missing the bigger pic-
      ture. In what ways could we be focusing on "minors" while
      missing the important principle unfolding before our eyes?

             THURSDAY February 5


      The Greatest Witnesses to Jesus (John 5:31-47).
        In yesterday's study, we saw that Jesus made some powerful claims
      about Himself, claims that would ring false in the mouth of every
      other human being who ever lived. Jesus, obviously, saw the need to
      justify the kind of testimony He gave about Himself.

List all who offer a testimony in favor of Jesus in John 5:31-47. Which
       of these witnesses does Jesus seem to consider the most impor-
       tant?


        Jesus acknowledges that uncorroborated testimony about oneself is
      inadequate (5:31). One of the fundamental principles of Judaism is
      that truth can be established only in the mouths of at least two wit-
      nesses (Deut. 19:15; see also Rev. 11:3-13). So, Jesus adds to His
      own testimony the testimony of John the Baptist, His works, His
      Father, and the Scriptures, thereby doubling the minimum testimony
      needed to establish truthfulness within Judaism (John 5:31-40).

Read John 5:38. What powerful rebuke is Jesus giving to those leaders?


         When it is clear the religious leaders are not willing to accept the
      testimony of these witnesses (vss. 43, 44; see also 8:13, 14), Jesus
      calls forth the ultimate witness within Judaism, Moses. Moses had
      served as an intercessor with God in behalf of Israel (Exod. 32:7-14).
      But in the mouth of Jesus, Moses is transformed into a judge (John
      5:45-47). The words of Moses will condemn those who reject Jesus,
      because Moses wrote about Jesus and prepared the way for Him. Jesus
      closes with the parting shot, " 'Since you do not believe what [Moses]
      wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?' " (vs. 47, NIV).
         With this encounter, the battle is joined between Jesus and some of
      the leaders of Israel, a battle that continues in the Gospel until Jesus
      is arrested, suffers, and dies on the cross. In the hostility of these peo-
      ple, John portrays the hostility of all who reject the gospel, regardless
      of their background.

       How is your perception of Jesus shaped by the attitudes of

                 FRIDAY February 6

Futher Study: As pointed out in Tuesday's section, most
     Christians readily acknowledge that their inner lives, particularly the
     emotional aspect, can be quite unstable, even after conversion.
     Christians, as well as others, struggle with unhappy memories,
     flashes of anger, and unmentionable thoughts. The story of the para-
     lytic at Bethesda tells us that Jesus cares at least as much about the
     inner life as He does about the outward circumstances.
        Unwelcome thoughts and emotions can revolve around both things
     we have done and things that have been done to us. Things we have
     done cause feelings of remorse, regret, and failure. Things others
     have done to us can cause feelings of anger, grief, and deep resent-
     ment. Fullness in Christ involves dealing with issues of the past such
     as these. For practical suggestions about the process of mental and
     emotional healing, see chapter 6 in the companion volume by the
     author of these lessons.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Why do many Christians believe that accepting Jesus should
      put an end to all emotional difficulties? To what degree do you
      think this idea is true?

      ef Forgiveness is a major component in dealing with sin and its
      consequences. Why, then, do most people find it so hard to for-
      give?

      O The paralytic evidently suffered as a consequence of his own
      sinful actions. What do you think Jesus would have told the vic-
      tim of rape or of abuse? What would He say to one who causes
      others to suffer?

      0 Jesus violated human-made rules about Sabbath keeping to
      heal a man. To what degree are your personal rules for living
      God-made or man-made? How can you know the difference?


Summary: Jesus came to this earth to show how God would act
     within the human context of this world. By healing the paralytic at the
     pool of Bethesda, Jesus demonstrated that He is not limited by time
     or by the quality of the material He has to work with. He also showed
     that He is not satisfied to heal only the physical or spiritual side of a
     person. He wants to restore the entire person.

The Stolen Book
MARTIAL RAKOTONIAINA
   Martial learned about a charismatic church that claimed to be able to
heal people and chase out demons. He did not need healing, but he was
attracted to the group by their charismatic activities. He began attending
the church.
   When a church member invited him to study in the seminary to become
a pastor, he agreed. While at the seminary he found a book that sounded
interesting to him. He took the book home, and when he left the seminary
he did not return the book. When he completed his studies he was given a
church to pastor.
   One day he began to read the book he had taken from the seminary
library. It was Seventh-day Adventists Believe. As he read it he began to
question what he had been taught in the seminary and what he had been
teaching his congregation.
   He talked to his family about what he had learned from the stolen book.
The family agreed that the Adventist Church has the truth, but Martial
knew no Adventists or where he could find an Adventist church.
   When he stopped attending church for several weeks, members of his
congregation asked him what was wrong. He explained what he had
learned about the Bible and told them he could no longer pastor a Sunday-
keeping church. The church members loved their pastor and wept when he
told them he was leaving. He invited his members to join him in honoring
the seventh-day Sabbath.
   An Adventist believer learned that this charismatic pastor had accepted
 the Sabbath. He visited the family and told them about a congregation that
 worshiped a short distance from their home. The former pastor and his
 family began attending the Adventist church, and, in time, were baptized.
                                 The former pastor returned to hold evangel-
                              istic meetings in the area where he had once
                              pastored. Most of his former members came
                              and listened, but none of them followed him.
                                 One day he met a fellow seminarian and
                              shared the stolen book with him. "I hope the
                              stolen book will do for him what it did for
                              me," Martial said.

         LESSON              7       *February 7-13


      The Sacred and the
      Common


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 6.
Memory Text:" 'The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for noth-
      ing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life' "
      (John 6:63, NIV).

Key Thought: In Christ all of life, even the common things, can
      bring us into a closer communion with Christ.

             hroughout John, chapter 6, the people relate to Jesus on a ma-

      T      terial level. They are not searching for spiritual food; rather,
             they want their physical needs satisfied. They want to see more
      miracles such as the feeding of the 5,000. In spite of that awesome
      event, when the people looked at Jesus, they saw a common every-
      day human being like themselves, not Someone who came down
      from heaven. They were unable to see the sacred shining through the
      common.
        In chapter 6, Jesus tries to direct their eyes away from the common
      toward spiritual things, the food that endures to eternal life. Life is not
      found in miracles and in the things of this world. Life is found by
      accepting the claims Jesus makes about Himself. One of the secrets
      of the devotional life is to learn how to see the presence and the power
      of Jesus working in the common things of everyday life, to sense that
      He is there with us, even though we cannot see, hear, or touch Him.

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, February 14.

                  SUNDAY February 8


      The Miracle of the Fish and Loaves
      (John 6:1-13).

Read John 6:1-13, the feeding of the 5,000. What lessons can you see
      in this account? What does this story say to you personally?
      What's in it that speaks to your needs? What kind of hope does it
      offer? What does it tell you about God?




        Notice, too, the timing of this account: It took place around the time
      of Passover (John 6:4), when the Lord worked a mighty deliverance for
      His people. Though the feeding of the 5,000 certainly was not as dra-
      matic as the Exodus from Egypt, it was still a powerful manifestation
      of God's power in behalf of His people, even in their spiritual igno-
      rance. John makes it clear that many of those who had followed Christ
      did so only because of the miracles they already had seen (vs. 2) and
      not because of any deep, spiritual conviction that this Man was the
      Messiah or that He could bring them spiritual freedom.
         Nevertheless, the Lord still worked in their behalf. In other words,
      though He knew their hearts were still not right, He ministered to
      them anyway. How grateful we can be that our God is like that. What
      does that tell us about how we should act toward those who aren't
      where they should be spiritually?

Though Christ multiplies the fish and the loaves (the miracle), He
      does not miraculously deliver them to the crowd. How was the
      food distributed and gathered? What lesson is in there for us?
      John 6:10-12.




       Though Jesus ministers here to their physical needs, is that an
       end in itself or a means to an end? After all, a few hours later, all
       those people would be hungry again. What is Jesus doing with
       that miracle? In what ways are we called to do the same thing?




                                                                           57
                MONDAY February 9


     Miracle at Sea              (John 6:16-21).

Read the story in John 6:16-21 of Jesus walking on the water.
     Compare it to the miracle of the fish and the loaves. What are the
     differences?




       It is interesting that Christ would perform such a powerful miracle,
     especially after what just happened on the mountain with the multi-
     tude, who did not respond in a positive manner to the miracle He had
     performed there. (Read John 6:14, 15: They wanted to make Him a
     king, by force; Christ did not come to allow Himself to be set up as
     King. Their reaction caused Him to leave the area.)

What reason, then, would Jesus have for doing this miracle? Hint:
     Who are the ones who witness it?


        In the story of the disciples on the sea (John 6:16-21), Jesus accom-
     plishes a deed similar to those done by the God of the Exodus (see
     Exod. 14:20-22). To people schooled in the Old Testament, therefore,
     Jesus' ability to walk on water and to control wind and wave was a
     powerful affirmation of His divinity, something the disciples needed
     after their disappointment with Christ's refusal to be made king.
       In The Desire of Ages, Ellen White writes that the disciples are
     eager for Christ to be crowned the Davidic King, and when He for-
     bids it, they become upset. "The disciples had long hoped for a pop-
     ular movement to place Jesus on the throne; they could not endure the
     thought that all this enthusiasm should come to nothing. . . .
       "Unbelief was taking possession of their minds and hearts. Love of
     honor had blinded them. They knew that Jesus was hated by the
     Pharisees, and they were eager to see Him exalted as they thought He
     should be."—Pages 379, 380.

      By performing the miracle of walking on the water, Jesus
      strengthens the faith of His disciples. But do we always need
      miracles to have our faith strengthened? What are some things
      that have happened in your life that have helped your faith
      grow yet would not necessarily be called "miracles"?

                TUESDAY February 10


     Bread From Heaven (John 6:22-35).
       After that stormy night (John 6:16-21), the crowd crosses the lake
     and finds Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum, where all the preach-
     ing and the dialogue of the rest of the chapter take place.

How do the ancient Israelites survive in the desert, and what does
     that have to do with the feeding of the 5,000 earlier in the chap-
     ter? Exod. 16:33-35, John 6:27-31.




       A consistent theme in the background of John 6 is the Exodus from
     Egypt. The feeding of the 5,000 recalls the original Passover when the
     Israelites escaped from the immediate grasp of the Egyptians. Then
     the storm episode (vss. 16-21) recalls the perils the Israelites faced at
     the Red Sea. Now comes a reference to God's guiding of their expe-
     rience in the desert of Sinai. As with the Israelites in the desert, the
     hearers of Jesus react to miracles they can see or touch, but their faith
     remains inadequate. Jesus directs their attention away from the manna
     the Israelites received in the desert to the spiritual bread He has come
     to offer them.

Read prayerfully and carefully John 6:32-35. What point is Jesus
      making here? What is He telling us about Himself? What do these
      words mean to us? Why does He use the bread analogy?




         The clear implication of the sermon is that seeing Jesus and believ-
      ing in Him is what produces real life in the spiritual sense now and in
      the fullest sense " 'at the last thy' " (vs. 40; 5:21). Just as food con-
      stantly must be eaten in order to sustain physical life, so it is necessary
      to invite Jesus into our daily experience in order to sustain spiritual life.
      "Believing" in the Gospel of John (see also John 1:12, 6:47) always has
      a continuous sense. It must be an ongoing and daily experience.

       Read in verse 35 of John 6 where Jesus says that those who
       come to Him and who believe in Him will never hunger nor
       thirst. How have these promises been manifested in your life? If
       they have not, then you need to ask yourself, How can I come to
       Jesus and believe in Him?

                                                                                59
          WEDNESDAY February 11


      Talking to Deaf Ears (John 6:36-50).
Why do many people in the following text have a hard time accepting
     Jesus' claims? John 6:41, 42. How do the words of the people here
     reflect the words of Nicodemus in John 3:4?


How do many of Jesus' own disciples react to His teachings in this
    chapter? John 6:60, 66. Why would they react this way?


        Throughout this chapter the crowds relate to Jesus on a material and
     physical level. They want to see more miracles such as the feeding of
     the 5,000. When Jesus refuses to accommodate them, they all too
     quickly conclude that Jesus is a common everyday human being like
     themselves, not Someone who came down from heaven. The common
     keeps them from seeing the sacred. The very physical presence of
     Jesus becomes a stumbling block to them.
        Like the second generation of Christians, we think that we would be
     better off knowing Jesus in the flesh instead of struggling to have a
     relationship with Someone we can't see, hear, or touch. But the phys-
     ical presence of Jesus caused the first generation not to take Him as
     seriously as they certainly should have.
        Who really was Jesus? He was much more than just a good man
     who grew up in Nazareth with Joseph and Mary. But what kind of
     man would claim to be the Son of God who came down from heaven?
     To make such a claim, he would have to be either crazy, a deceiver (in
     neither case would people designate him a "good man"), or exactly
     what he claims to be. There is no middle ground; we must either
     accept Him and all that He stands for or reject Him as insane, or even
     worse, the perpetrator of the greatest scam of all time. The foolishness
     of the people in this story is that they insist on seeing Jesus as just a
     good man. This is not really an option as far as Jesus is concerned.
        It is crucial, therefore, that people recognize exactly who Jesus is.
     He brings from heaven a revelation of God and about God that is of
     life-and-death importance to the human race. To partake of Jesus as
     bread, flesh, and blood is a graphic way of expressing that only through
     an intimate relationship with Jesus—as close as food that has been
     eaten is to the body—can one gain the eternal life that He promises.


      In what ways might we be in danger of doing the same thing
      as the crowds in John 6; that is, not distinguishing the sacred
      from the common? For example, do our attitudes toward the
      church, its leaders, or our message reflect this same spiritual
      principle?

             THURSDAY February 12


     The Sacred and the Common                              (John 6:51-71).

Read John 6:51-58. What does Jesus mean by saying we must eat His
     flesh and drink His blood? Summarize in your own words the
     essence of what you believe He says to us with these startling
     words.




         Time and again in the Gospel of John symbols are drawn from
      everyday experiences, symbols such as bread, water, and light. These
      symbols help us to connect Jesus' words with things in the context of
      our everyday lives. No matter how ordinary our lives may be, our rela-
      tionship with Jesus will deepen and grow as we learn to remember
      Him in the course of everything we do. As the Bread of Life, Jesus
      brings us a foretaste of eternal life, which makes physical food and
      drink seem insignificant by comparison.
         As the body craves food and drink and sunlight, so the soul craves
      the presence of Jesus (whether or not one is aware of that), and if
      Jesus is not allowed to be present, human beings will go to all kinds
      of ridiculous lengths to fill the gap with something else.

What are some of the things people resort to in order to fill their
      innate spiritual needs?


         When we sit down at a table to eat, we can remember that rain, life,
      and sunshine, and the food production that they make possible, would
      all have ceased with sin were it not for the Cross of Jesus. When we
      lift up a glass to drink, we can remember the Water of Life. When we
      get dressed in the morning, we can think about the robe of Christ's
      righteousness. One of the keys to a living relationship with Jesus is
      recognizing His sacred touch at work in common things, to make all
      the ordinary events of our lives reminders of the words and actions of
      Jesus.

       Read again the text for today. Time and again Jesus talks about
       life and living. What, ultimately, has Jesus promised those who
       eat His flesh and drink His blood, and why is this promise so
       important to us?

                                                                          61
                   FRIDAY February 13

Further Study: Carefully compare the accounts in John 6:16-21
      with Matthew 14:22-27 and Mark 6:45-52. Note all the parallels and
      contrasts between John's account and the other two, including omis-
      sions. How does this comparison illuminate the point the Holy Spirit
      was making with the story? In what ways do Matthew and Mark,
      moved by the Holy Spirit, use the story?
         For additional spiritual insights into this marvelous chapter, see
      Ellen White's comments in The Desire ofAges. John 6:1-21 is covered
      on pages 364-382, and pages 383-394 are devoted almost exclusively
      to John 6:22-71.

Discussion Questions:
    0 Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote: "It is only because He became like
       us that we can become like Him" (The Cost of Discipleship [New
       York: Collier Books, 1963], p. 344). What do you think that
       means? Do you agree or disagree, and why?

       e Why was Jesus' teaching in John 6 so hard for the listeners to
       accept? Could it be because they had preconceptions about what
       they expected from a divine Deliverer? If so, what does that tell
       us about the danger, as Christians, of having certain ideas about
       what God should or should not do? What happens when those
       expectations are not met?


Summary: In John, chapter 6, Jesus struggles to communicate His
    mission in the face of continual misunderstanding. He feeds the 5,000
    in order to demonstrate that He is the One who can bring them the
    bread of divine spiritual life. They, instead, see someone worthy to run
    the national economy (vs. 14). In stilling the storm, Jesus sought to
    show His disciples that He is as capable as the God of the Exodus to
    supply their needs and free them from fear. But they seem at the same
    time too fearful and too self-confident to seek His help.
       At Capernaum He uses bread, flesh, and blood as analogies to illus-
    trate the need for the spiritual life He offers. Most of those who hear
    Him there, however, react with disgust and abandon Him. Taken
    together, the three events chronicled in this chapter teach us the need
    to differentiate between the sacred and the common, to learn how to
    have a living relationship with One who makes Himself real to us in
    the course of everyday life.

southern Philippines. The people in these mountains are known as fierce
warriors.
   Recently two students from Mountain View College answered a call to
go to this village to open a school. They expected to encounter primitive
conditions among a tribe who knew nothing of God. But when they
arrived in their target village, they heard singing. They recognized the
tune of a familiar Christian chorus.
   That evening one of the children announced, "Let's have worship!" In
moments the air was filled with the beautiful sound of children's voices.
A young girl led the children in song after song as one by one the par-
ents joined the children. The two missionaries were shocked and
delighted.
   The singing stopped, and the young song leader led the children in
reciting several Bible texts. The two student missionaries watched this
miracle of light flood a dark corner of God's vineyard.
   A young boy stood and offered a beautiful and heartfelt prayer. "Lord
God, thank you for sending our long-awaited teachers. Now we can learn
how to read and write, sing and pray."
   After worship the student missionaries asked the young girl, "Who
taught you these songs and memory verses?"
   "I attended the mission school in another village," she said. "When we
moved back here to my father's village, I missed the worships and the
singing, so I taught the children here the songs and Bible verses I had
learned. The chief asked me to teach the children to read and write, but
I do not know how to teach. I suggested that the village elders request a
 teacher from Mountain View College. I told them that if they would
 build a cottage for the teacher, one would come. We built the cottage,
 and we prayed every day that you would come. It has taken three years,
 but at last you are here! You are an answer to our prayers!"
   The student missionaries were thrilled to learn that before they ever
 arrived, God used a young child to bring the light of faith to a village that
 once had been in darkness.
    Dozens of villages in the mountains of southern Philippines remain in
 darkness. Pray that God will provide so that more young people from
 Mountain View College can be sent out as missionaries to reach these
 uttermost parts of God's vineyard.

      The Good                   Shepherd



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 7:1-10:21.
Memory Text:" 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd
      lays down his life for the sheep' " (John 10:11, NIV).

Key Thought: As the Good Shepherd, Jesus offers everything
      we need for an abundant life.

               ur life springs from His death. At the direction of His Father,

      0        Jesus belatedly attends the Feast of Tabernacles at the temple
               in Jerusalem. He comes as the living Presence of the great I
      AM. He offers Himself as the embodiment of the water and light that
      the feast celebrated (John 7:37-39, 8:12, 9:5), but He is largely
      rejected by those in attendance. Having failed to make a positive
      impact at the heart of the religious system, He reaches out to a blind
      man, an outcast of that system, and creates a living parable of the
      Good Shepherd, who cares for even the outcasts. In reaching out to
      the blind man, Jesus "showed the contrast between His own character
      and that of the leaders in Israel."—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
      Ages, p. 477.
         As the Good Shepherd, Jesus offers life to those who have strug-
      gled to find it elsewhere. He promises that His sheep will " 'know his
      voice' " (John 10:4, NIV). Those who commit everything to Jesus
      receive the privilege of a deep and intimate relationship with Him. He
      is the caring Friend who will never leave us nor forsake us. He will
      guide us in our thoughts and impressions. And He will provide life to
      the full, an abundance of meaning, joy, and fulfillment.

                 SUNDAY February 15


     The Feast of Tabernacles                        (John 7 and 8).

        In John 7-10 Jesus participates in the Feast of Tabernacles at the
     temple in Jerusalem. His presence at the feast draws Him into
     repeated confrontations with the religious leadership. These con-
     frontations are recorded in the Gospel of John, because they offer the
     opportunity for Jesus to clarify His mission.
        In Palestine there are two basic seasons of the year, an extremely
     dry summer of four to five months (virtually no rain) and a rainy sea-
     son of equal length spanning the winter. The Feast of Tabernacles
     comes at that time of year when the summer drought is usually end-
     ing (our months of September and October). The winter grains are
     planted and the harvest of summer fruits is celebrated.
        The Feast of Tabernacles commemorated the Exodus and the time
     of Israel's wandering in the wilderness (Lev. 23:43), when God pro-
     vided Israel with water and light (Exod. 13:21, 22; 17:1-7). So two
     major themes of the feast were water (a water ceremony was a major
     feature of each day's festivities) and light (torchlight processions at
     night). People lived outside in temporary structures, tents made from
     palm branches, reminding them of God's watchcare in the wilderness.
     They were to remember that just as God provided water, light, and
      food to Israel in the wilderness, so He can provide for the needs of the
      present, as well.

What does Jesus offer in place of the water ceremonies of the feast?
      John 7:37-39.


According to Jesus, what did the theme of light at the feast rep-
      resent? John 8:12.


        By His announcements at the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus made it
      clear that He is what the feast was all about. The mighty acts of God
      celebrated at the Feast of Tabernacles become present realities in the
      Person and teachings of Jesus. God is willing to do so much more for
      us than merely provide food, water, and natural light. In Christ the
      mighty power of the Exodus becomes real in our lives through the
      divine presence of the Holy Spirit. More than this, Spirit-filled
      Christians are enabled to pass the Spirit on to others.

       Christ made statements concerning Himself (John 7:37-39 and
       8:12). If someone asked you what it means to do the things
       Jesus said here, what would you answer? How have you experi-
       enced these statements and promises in your own life? How has
       your life been changed by them?
                                                                           65
                MONDAY February 16


     The Great "I AM" (John 8:24, 28, 58).
       In John 7 and 8 Jesus engages in a number of debates with His
     brothers, with the religious leadership, and with various segments of
     the crowd. One of the major features of this section is the presence of
     a number of special "I AM" statements on the part of Jesus.

How important does Jesus consider the "I AM" concept? What prom-
     ise is found in those words? What is Jesus telling us with that
     claim? John 8:24, 28, 58.




        The words " 'the one I claim to be' " in the NIV represent a help-
     ful interpretation supplied by the translators; the original simply says
     "I AM."
        In the Old Testament, "I AM" statements are applied to God. In the
     Gospel of John, Jesus applies the "I AM" statements of the Old
     Testament to Himself. The future salvation that was promised in the
     books of the Old Testament prophets has become a present reality in
     Him. He is the Good Shepherd revealed in Ezekiel 34 (John 10:11).
     He is the divine One (John 8:24, 28, 58) who knows the future (Isa.
     46:9, 10; John 13:19).
        In Jesus' "I AM" statements we see an assertion of His divinity. He
     is the Yahweh of the Old Testament, come down to shepherd His peo-
     ple just as He promised through the prophets. He is fully and truly
     God in the highest sense, even while walking on earth clothed in
     human flesh. He has preexisted throughout eternity (John 8:58).
        In Christ's "I AM" statements is the assertion that the future has
     become present in Christ. He can deliver the promised glories of the
     Old Testament future kingdom to those who believe in Him now. To
     be in relationship with Jesus is to have the abundance of the future
     kingdom now by faith. In a real sense, we are already living in heav-
     enly places in Christ Jesus (Eph. 2:6). In Old Testament times God
     did mighty things on earth from time to time. But on account of the
     Cross and through the work of the Spirit, God's mighty acts are now
     available everywhere to everyone who is in Christ.

      Look up each of the following texts. What are they telling us
      about Christ? Isa. 9:6; Mic. 5:2; John 3:13, 31, 32; Col. 1:16.
      What does this truth mean to us? What does it tell us about our
      God?

                TUESDAY February 17


     An Amusing Blind Man                          (John 9:1-41).

        John 9:1 through 10:21 continues John's description of events dur-
     ing Jesus' visit to the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. Jesus heals a
     blind man and then uses the experience as a living parable to illustrate
     His life and teachings.

Describe the healing and its investigation by the Pharisees in John
     9:1-34. What are a few spiritual lessons we can learn from this
     story? In what ways can we see ourselves in the Pharisees?




         By healing the man, Jesus offered a living parable to illustrate His
      earlier statement, " 'I am the light of the world' " (John 8:12, NIV;
      9:5). As the Light of the world, Jesus brings physical sight to a man
      who was born blind. But there is a deeper meaning behind this story.
         The healing creates a serious dilemma for the Pharisees. On the one
      hand, the healing points to the work of a man approved by God. But
      by a nonemergency healing on the Sabbath, Jesus appears to be act-
      ing like a false prophet (Deut. 13:1-5). The humor of the story lies in
      its biting irony. The man who was blind sees more and more clearly
      that Jesus represents the true God of Israel. On the other hand, the
      Pharisees, who see clearly in the physical sense, and who are sup-
      posed to be the guardians of the faith of Israel, become more and
      more blinded to the truth about Jesus.

How does Jesus apply the living parable of the blind man's experi-
      ence to the Pharisees? John 9:39-41.


        The Pharisees' rejection of the healing symbolizes their rejection of
      the truth about God, which Jesus brought into the world. Their rejection
      was rooted in their willful blindness with regard to the claims of Jesus.

       Even today, few people reject Jesus out of a lack of evidence.
       Usually they reject Him out of an unwillingness to let Him
       "tamper" with their lifestyle. It is easy to find excuses not to
       believe when we are protecting some cherished sin or attitude
       (John 3:20, 21). The root reality of the unbeliever is unconfessed
       and unforsaken sin. These things "blind" one to the truths
       about Jesus. How do you help someone who seems to be in this
       spiritual trap?


                                                                           67
          WEDNESDAY February 18


      Jesus, the Good Shepherd                          (John 10:1-21).

Read John 10:1-21; in your own words, describe what Jesus is telling
      us here. As you read, ask yourself the following questions: (1) How
      many ways of salvation does Jesus present? (2) How is the great
      controversy illustrated here? (3) VVhat distinguishes the shepherd
      from the hireling?




        Verses 35-41 of chapter 9 set the stage for the Good Shepherd dis-
      course of John 10. Jesus cares for the outcasts. When the leaders of a
      religious system cast people out on the basis of the leaders' enmity for
      Jesus, they demonstrate their own blindness (John 9:39-41) and give
      Jesus the opportunity to collect these outcasts for Himself.
        John 10:1-21 is made up of two parts. First, there is the story of
      shepherds and their sheep (vss. 1-5), the closest thing to a parable in
      the Gospel of John. Then, Jesus reflects on the meaning of the story
      in verses 7-21.

What is John 10:17, 18 referring to? Does that act qualify Him as the
      Good Shepherd, or will this happen because He already is the
      Good Shepherd? Explain your answer.


         Sheep pens in ancient Palestine were usually natural caves. The
      sheep would be led into the cave in the evening, and the shepherd
      would take his position at the entrance to the cave and sleep there. Any
      robber or wild animal that physically sought access to the sheep
      would have to get past the shepherd to do it. Where caves were not
      available, a fieldstone enclosure would be built with an opening at one
      end just big enough for the shepherd to block with his body as he
      slept. So, when Jesus described Himself as the Good Shepherd and as
      the gate for the sheep, listeners would have recognized that these con-
      cepts were two different ways of describing the same activity.
         When Jesus describes Himself as the Gate through which the sheep
      must pass in order to be saved, He is replacing all other methods of sal-
      vation. There is no other way into the sheepfold, except by the Gate.

       Read John 10:1-5. How do the sheep know the voice of the
       shepherd? How do you know the voice of your Shepherd, as
       opposed to the voice of a stranger, a hireling, or a wolf?

             THURSDAY February 19


      Hired Hands and Thieves (John 10:1, 5, 10-13).
What do the thieves and robbers do to the sheep? What do the
    hirelings do to the sheep? Contrast this to what Jesus promises to
    do to the sheep.


        Jesus contrasts the Good Shepherd with two other types of people
      who relate to sheep. One type is the thieves and robbers. These invest
      nothing in the sheep; they are interested only in what they can gain for
      themselves. Jesus probably had in mind the chief priests of the tem-
      ple who put on a show of piety in order to receive the offerings and
      fees the worshipers brought to the temple with them.
        The other contrasting type is the hired hand, who does not own the
      sheep, and, therefore, has no personal concern for them. He watches
      them only to make a living. When a wild animal comes, he protects
      the only thing that really matters to him, which is himself. Jesus prob-
      ably had in mind the Pharisees of chapter 9. Although more involved
      in the needs and concerns of the people than the chief priests were,
      they did not truly care for the sheep. They did not know them inti-
      mately nor were they willing to lay down their lives, nor even their
      reputations, for the sheep.

Do we see these types of people manifested in the Christian church
     today? If so, how are these characteristics manifested?


        As the Good Shepherd, Jesus claimed the outcasts of the religious
      leaders for Himself (John 9:34-38). The Good Shepherd story was a
      rebuke to those who, in their rough handling of the man born blind,
      betrayed their true character as hired hands (John 9:40).
         Jesus invites us to have the same kind of caring concern for others
      as the Good Shepherd has for His sheep. The one who truly cares
      about family, neighbors, and friends will never be pushy and abusive
      (as the Pharisees were in John 9) but will seek to act out of caring
      concern for the benefit of others. The world is full of sorrow, crying,
      pain, and dying. There is a bottomless need for people who, out of the
      strength they have received in Christ, will reach out to build up and
      encourage others. Such undershepherds will find, in this work, abun-
      dant life for themselves, as well.

       Maybe we are not pastors, but in what ways can we act the part
       of a shepherd? How can we guard against, even unwittingly,
       becoming either a thief or a hireling?



                                                                            69
                  FRIDAY February 20

Further Study: "The Pharisees had just driven one from the fold,
     because he dared to bear witness to the power of Christ. . . . In this
     they had shown themselves ignorant of the work committed to them,
     and unworthy of their trust as shepherds of the flock. Jesus now set
     before them the contrast between them and the Good Shepherd, and
     He pointed to Himself as the real keeper of the Lord's flock."—Ellen
     G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 477.
        Compare John 10:1-21 with two other sheep-and-shepherd stories
     in the Gospels (Matt. 18:10-14 and Luke 15:3-7). Note both the sim-
     ilarities between all three passages and the unique features of each.
     Who plays the role of shepherd in each of these other accounts, and
     how do the lessons of Matthew and Luke compare with the lesson of
     John 10?


Discussion Questions:
      O How do we get the kind of discernment needed to be able to
      tell the difference between the true Shepherd and hirelings or
      even thieves?

      © Compare what happens to the sheep when the hireling or the
      thief gets hold of them. What's the difference?

      O In what ways are sheep like or unlike human beings? Which
      aspect of sheep behavior is most likely to have caused Jesus to
      draw the analogy He did?

      0 Is your church a friendly place for "outcasts"? Are some types
      of people in your church more "acceptable" than others? Why is
      that so?



Summary: "Many of those who heard Jesus [at the Feast of Taber-
     nacles in the temple] were mourners over disappointed hopes, many
     were nourishing a secret grief, many were seeking to satisfy their rest-
     less longing with the things of the world and the praise of men; but
     when all was gained, they found that they had toiled only to reach
     a broken cistern, from which they could not quench their thirst."
     —Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 454.
       To those who have been bruised and battered by the world, the
     Gospel offers Jesus as the key to an abundant life (John 10:10). He is
     the Water and the Light, the Gate, and the Good Shepherd.

Out        of the Muck
by JOEL SANDOVAL
   For Joel and his family, life in Honduras was difficult. His father
drank and often did not come home for weeks at a time. When he did, he
often beat Joel, the eldest son. Joel's classmates at school took drugs and
offered Joel drugs, just to try them. But Joel refused. He was not a
Christian, but he knew drugs and alcohol messed up people's minds and
lives, and he wanted nothing to do with them.
   When Joel's father beat his mother, she often took Joel to the local
church to pray. Joel sensed that religion was key to a more stable life. He
began going on his own and made friends at the church. Joel wanted to
know more about Jesus and God's plan for his life.
   Then his father had an accident that nearly killed him. As he recovered
in the hospital, he began to realize that he needed to change his life. And
when Christians offered him Bible studies, he accepted.
   An Adventist man visited the family and prayed with them. Joel
wanted to know more about what this man's church taught. The family
studied the Bible together and grew in their knowledge of God and their
faith in Jesus. His father gave up his alcohol, and the family began
attending the Adventist church. Soon they were baptized.
   Joel was thirsty to know more about God. He studied his Bible and
grew in faith and in knowledge. He became a deacon at age 14 and
began to preach when the pastor was away. He became the youth leader
while still a youth himself. Joel's pastor saw potential in Joel and urged
the boy to consider preparing for the ministry. Joel felt unworthy of the
calling, but he agreed to pray about it. Joel accepted God's call, but how
could he afford university? His family was very poor.
   Joel prayed that God would provide the tuition for his studies. A man
who was visiting Joel's area took an interest in Joel, and told him, "If
                              you decide to become a minister, let me
                              know." When Joel wrote him to ask for help,
                              the man responded that his tuition had
                              already been paid.
                                 Tears come to Joel's eyes when he
                              recounts how God has changed his life.
                              "Jesus picked me out of the pit and placed
                              my feet on solid ground. How can I ever
                              repay him?"

      A Devoted Soul and an
      Impending Cross


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 11:1-12:50.
Memory Text:" 'I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat
      falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it
      dies, it produces many seeds' " (John 12:24, NIV).

Key Thoughts: In the death and resurrection of Lazarus, John
      provides a foretaste of the death and resurrection of Jesus. It is
      the impending Cross that draws out of Mary the full measure of
      devotion.

                 e love Him because He first loved us. In John 11 and 12 the

      W          author of the Gospel begins a transition from the earthly
                 ministry of Jesus to the events associated with the Cross.
      The two main incidents in these chapters occur in Bethany, just across
      the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem. In Jesus' raising of Lazarus
      from the dead and His anointing with perfume by Mary, John pre-
      pares the reader for the tragic but necessary events to follow shortly
      in Jerusalem.
         The raising of Lazarus from the dead provokes contradictory
      reactions. For the Sanhedrin, it is seen as a threat to their own self-
      interest. As a result, they begin plotting the death of Jesus. In con-
      trast stands Mary's glorious act of devotion. Her devotion was well
      timed. "As [Jesus] went down into the darkness of His great trial,
      He carried with Him the memory of that deed, an earnest of the love
      that would be His from His redeemed ones forever."—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 560.

     The Raising of Lazarus (John 11:1-44).
Read John 11:1-44 and then answer these questions:
       1. Why does Jesus wait so long before going to Bethany? See
     verses 15-17, 37, and 39. How did the delay make what He does
     even more miraculous?


       2. Read what Jesus says in verses 25, 26. How does the act of
     raising Lazarus help prove the truth of those words?



       3. Read what Jesus says in verses 41, 42. What do they reveal
     about the source of Christ's power? See also verse 22.



       4. Read verse 27. What is so important about this confession of
     faith, particularly in regard to the time in which it was expressed?


        The bottom line of Christian faith is that there is real power in the
     gospel. The power that raised Lazarus from the dead is real, and it is
     still available today. While tragedies always are not reversed in this
     life, the resurrection power of God will bring meaning and comfort to
     our souls if we allow it 10.
        We will all have the John 11 experience at one time or another; that
     is, death, betrayal, and destruction leave behind a real sense of loss
     that cannot be explained away. We are troubled by the sense that Jesus
     could have intervened to prevent them but did not. We struggle to
     understand what "glory to God" might possibly come out of tragedy.
     At low points such as these, we can remember that the God who
     raised Jesus from the dead is still able to create something out of noth-
     ing. Even when all seems hopeless, we still can place our trust in Him.
     We have to, for what else is there? Fortunately for us, we have
     accounts such as this in the book of John that can give us even more
     reasons to trust in God.

       Read verse 37. Who has not found himself or herself thinking a
       similar thing in the face of personal tragedy? What is the only
       answer we can give?




                                                                            73
                MONDAY February 23


       Mary and Martha.
What is the first thing that both Martha and Mary say to Jesus when
     they first approach Him? How do those words reveal both faith
     and doubt at the same time? See John 11:21, 32.




       For Mary and Martha, the death of Lazarus itself was not the worst
     thing. The worst part about the situation was the delay of Jesus! The
     two sisters seem to have had a very different reaction to Jesus. When
     news of Jesus' arrival outside of town comes, Martha goes out to meet
     Him, but Mary stays at home until Martha comes and gets her. While
     both sisters are upset and distressed, Martha combines her statement
     of frustration (vs. 21) with strong statements of continued faith in
     Jesus (vss. 22, 24, 27). In response to her expressed faith, Jesus offers
     one of the most magnificent descriptions of His life and mission: " 'I
     am the resurrection and the life' " (vss. 25, 26, NIV).

What do you understand the statement of Christ's in verses 25 and
     26 to mean? What hope is implicit in those words for us?




       When Mary finally goes out to meet Jesus, she repeats Martha's
     complaint but without any affirmation of continued faith. She
     receives no revelation from Jesus, and He draws no expression of
     faith from her (compare verses 32, 33 with verses 22-27). Jesus has
     come to invite them to behold the Resurrection and the Life, but their
     minds are fixed on their loss instead.
       Beneath the surface of this story, it is not hard to catch a glimpse of
     the inner life of these sisters. Their hearts were a raging sea of turbu-
     lent emotions. The pain of sudden loss has all but crushed them. The
     actions of Jesus have piled doubts on top of their sorrows. While
     Martha seems to have been more successful at maintaining a sem-
     blance of emotional stability, even she did not grasp in advance what
     Jesus had come to do (vs. 39).

      This story has a happy ending, of course. What hope do you
      find in this account for deaths that do not, at least for now, end
      as this one does?

               TUESDAY February 24


     The Plot to Kill Jesus (John 11:45-57).
Read John 11:45-57 and then answer the following questions:

       1. Did the leaders believe that Jesus had really performed this
     miracle, or did they think it was a trick? Explain the importance
     of the answer.




      2. What justification did they give for having to stop Jesus?
     Does that argument not make sense?




        In these texts we see the reactions of the religious leaders to the
     resurrection of Lazarus. Instead of the unlimited possibilities the res-
     urrection of Lazarus would seem to open to the human race, the reli-
     gious leaders can focus only on the threat to their own position and
     interests.
       With delicious irony, John uses the leaders' own words against
     them. They plot to kill Jesus, because they fear that if they allow Him
     to continue His ministry, " 'everyone will believe in him, and then the
     Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation' "
     (vs. 48, NIV). To the first readers of the Gospel, the foolishness of this
     statement would have been plain. The very thing the religious leaders
     sought to prevent, the death of Jesus brought about: worldwide belief
     in the teachings of Christ and the destruction of Jerusalem and its
     temple. Even their leader, Caiaphas, prophesies that they " 'know
     nothing at all' " (vss. 49-52, NIV). The council determines that,
     although Jesus has done nothing to deserve death, His death is the
     only way to maintain their position and the security of their nation.

       However dramatic their example, the religious leaders here
       symbolize the danger we all face: rationalizing our actions, even
       those that fly in the face of what we know is right, for personal
       expediency. How have you done the same thing in your own life?
       What can we do to stop ourselves from falling into this com-
       mon, but deadly, trap? Some verses that might help are
       Matthew 16:24, Philippians 2:4, and 1 Peter 4:1.



                                                                            75
         WEDNESDAY February 25


      Mary of Bethany                 (John 12:1-8).

       The anointing at Bethany probably took place on Saturday night,
     the week before the Crucifixion (John 12:1). Bethany was located
     about two miles east of Jerusalem, on the other side of the Mount of
     Olives.

Read John 12:8. Imagine yourself in the position of someone there
     who, not knowing about the impending death of Christ, witnessed
     the reaction of Jesus and Judas to Mary's act. What reasons might
     such an eyewitness have for, perhaps, thinking Judas was right?
     What lesson exists here regarding how we can not always judge
     actions by what we see?




        The heart of the narrative at the beginning of John 12 lies in the
     deliberate contrast between Mary's wholehearted faith in, and love
     for, Jesus and the coldhearted calculations of Caiaphas (at the end of
     chapter 11) and Judas. Mary's anointing of Jesus' feet is motivated by
     unselfish love and sacrifice. The opponents of Jesus, on the other
     hand, are motivated by greed and self-interest.
        In this scene we see Mary's total devotion of soul. Whatever doubts
     she may have had before the resurrection of Lazarus are gone now.
     Every emotion trembles with gratitude to the One who raised her
     brother and who is about to die for her. The perfume she pours on
     Jesus cost her a year of hard work, but it represents her whole life,
     gratefully offered to Jesus. Such total devotion is rarely popular, as
     Judas's reaction makes clear. "What a waste," people say. "You could
     have done great things with your life, but you chose to waste it on
     Jesus!"
        Judas's reaction is normal and human. Mary's action does seem a
     waste. What church board would approve such an expenditure? To
     human reasoning, Mary seems emotionally disturbed. But notice
     again how Jesus feels about it, this time as recorded in Mark 14:6-9:
     " 'She has done a beautiful thing to me. . . . She did what she
     could. . . . I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached
     throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in mem-
     ory of her' " (NIV).

      Look at the reaction of Judas to Mary's anointing of Christ. In
      what ways can we be guilty of doing the same thing; that is, hid-
      ing our own spiritual weaknesses and defects behind a veneer of
      piety and self-sacrifice?

76
            THURSDAY February 26


     The Impending Cross (John 12:9-27).
       John portrays three main reactions to the miracle of raising Lazarus
     from the dead.
        • The religious leaders want to kill Jesus and even Lazarus for fear
     of what will happen to them if they do not (John 11:47-53).
        • Mary, on the other hand, responds with gratitude and devoted,
     self-sacrificing love (John 12:1-9).

At the same time, a third reaction occurs. What is it? See
     John 12:9-11, 17-19.



       Of the three reactions, Mary's is clearly the one the author of the
     Gospel wishes the reader to see as the great model of response to
     Jesus and His miraculous signs.

What is Jesus' answer to the request of the Greeks? John 12:20-27.
     What is He specifically telling us there about what it means to fol-
     low Him? How did Mary's act in anointing Christ's feet manifest
     what Jesus is telling us here?


        John 12:26 shows that to follow Jesus is to disown self-centeredness.
     When our lives are filled with striving for advantage, security, and
     pleasure, we do not experience the fullness of life Jesus offers. In fact,
     what Jesus seems to be saying in verse 25 is that the only way we can
     truly follow Christ is to disown ourselves; this has to be a full, complete
     death to self. This, of course, is something only the Lord can do for
     us, if we allow Him, if we make the choice to follow Him; and to do
     that we must, like the kernel of wheat, first die. There is no other way.
     Judas, the leaders of Israel, and the crowd that came to Jesus as He
     entered Jerusalem all represent, to one degree or another, those who (at
     least at that point) did not make the full surrender.
        Of those whom we have looked at in today's study, only Mary seems
     to have understood this, an understanding clearly made manifest by her
     works.

       How would you explain to a non-Christian that what Jesus is
       saying in John 12:25 is to our immense advantage? How could
       you express it in a way to help him or her understand this in a
       positive manner?




                                                                             77
                  FRIDAY February 27

Further Study: "Had Christ been in the sickroom, Lazarus would
      not have died; for Satan would have had no power over him. . . . Christ
      knew that as [the suffering sisters] looked on the dead face of their
      brother their faith in their Redeemer would be severely tried. But He
      knew that because of the struggle through which they were now pass-
      ing their faith would shine forth with far greater power."—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire ofAges, p. 528.
        "The Saviour understood the plotting of the priests. He knew that
      they longed to remove Him, and that their purpose would soon be
      accomplished. But it was not His place to hasten the crisis, and He
      withdraws from that region, taking the disciples with Him. Thus by
      His own example Jesus again enforced the instruction He had given to
      the disciples, 'When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
      another.' Matt. 10:23. There was a wide field in which to work for the
      salvation of souls; and unless loyalty to Him required it, the Lord's
      servants were not to imperil their lives."—Ellen G. White, The Desire
      ofAges, p. 541.

Discussion Questions:
    0 If you had a year's worth of salary or a year of time to use to
       honor Jesus, how would you use it? How would your friends be
       likely to react?

          Read John 12:26. How do those words debunk the notion that
       Jesus wants us only as friends, not as servants? Why must we be
       both?

       41) Look up these texts: Matthew 19:29, Mark 8:36, Galatians
       6:14, Philippians 3:8. How do they express the same idea that we
       see revealed in Mary's actions? What must happen in our own
       lives so we can have that kind of devotion?


Summary: In this lesson we have seen how the kindness of Jesus pro-
      vokes contradictory reactions. His kindness in raising Lazarus from
      the dead and in showing acceptance to Mary draws out the full depth
      of her devotion to Him. On the other hand, the same actions lead to
      the murderous plots of the religious leaders, the greedy complaint of
      Judas, and the misguided praise of the crowd. The author of the
      Gospel would have us ponder our own reactions to the greatest kind-
      ness of all, Jesus' sacrifice for us on the cross.

Muslims Find an
Easier Way to Heaven
by J. H. ZACHARY
   I have learned to have a profound respect for true Muslims. The main
goal of their life is total surrender in obedience to the living God. Their
lives are filled with godly activities. Hours each week are spent in prayer
and memorizing verses from the Holy Qur'an. They faithfully give alms to
the poor and live in strict obedience to the laws of health. It takes a lot of
work to be a faithful Muslim. Assurance of salvation depends on much
moment-by-moment effort.
   Shah-jahan comes from this kind of family. He is a devoted follower of
the living God, a son of Abraham. One day someone showed him the pas-
sage in the Qur'an that encourages believers to study the Tawrat
(Pentateuch), the Zabur (Psalms), and the Injil (Gospels). The Qur'an
often refers to Jesus as the Son of Mary. Shah-jahan was interested in
learning more about Jesus.
   He began to study the Bible, and his life began to change. A peace filled
his heart. He experienced new power from reading the Bible. His wife
noticed that he was becoming a better person. His daily prayer life became
more precious. He began to understand more of the amazing love that
Allah has for sinners. Shah-jahan was amazed to learn from the prophet
Zechariah that God not only forgives sin, but He gives the repentant sin-
ner a robe of righteousness.
   As Shah-jahan began to accept this gift of salvation, joy flooded his
heart. He eagerly shared his joy with relatives and neighbors. "I have
found an easier way to heaven!" he exclaimed. What a precious assurance
has come to Shah-jahan since he began following the instructions of the
Qur'an to read the Bible.
   In the Western world, church leaders and pastors spend considerable time
 making plans and developing materials to use to spread the good news of
 Christ. Shah-jahan and his friends found the good news simply by reading
 the Bible. They now are compelled to share the wonderful news of salvation
 with others.
    Hundreds of Muslims throughout the world are rejoicing in this pre-
 cious experience with the living God. Pray that others will open their hearts
 to receive the good news that Jesus saves.

        LESSON 10 *February 28—March 5


      True
      Greatness



      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 13:1-30, chapter 17.
Memory Text:" 'I have set you an example that you should do
      as I have done for you' " (John 13:15, NIV).

Key Thought: Instead of becoming self-absorbed as He ap-
      proaches His great humiliation, Jesus, in John 13-17, expresses His
      loving concern for His disciples.

             rue greatness is to follow Jesus in the path of service and humil-

      T      ity. For many, greatness consists in the accumulation of wealth,
             fame, and power. To such, the opportunity to "wash feet" rep-
      resents the ultimate humiliation. Jesus here does the opposite of what
      seems natural to human experience.
        With chapter 13 the entire tone of the Gospel of John is trans-
      formed. Instead of public ministry, Jesus retires to an unspecified
      place to quietly instruct His disciples at great length.
        This lesson and the next cover John 13-17, the portion of the
      Gospel that deals with the "upper-room experience." Because of space
      limitations, we will deviate from the order of the Gospel here. In this
      lesson we highlight the common elements of chapters 13 and 17,
      where Jesus' concern for His disciples is expressed in the foot wash-
      ing (John 13) and in a marvelous prayer (John 17). In the next lesson,
      we cover chapters 14-16, where Jesus' concern for His disciples is
      expressed in the gracious provision of the Comforter.

                  SUNDAY February 29

     The Foot Washing                    (John 13:1-11).

Read John 13:1-11 and then in your own words write down what you
     think this account means and why the Holy Spirit directs John to
     include it in his Gospel. Focus on what you believe is the key mes-
     sage to us here.


       It was the custom in New Testament times for people to bathe them-
     selves before attending a feast. Upon arrival, they would not need to
     bathe again; they needed to have only their feet washed. The washing
     of the feet, then, was like a ceremony that preceded entry into the
     house where they were to be guests. In this case, however, something
     so much greater was going on.


Read John 13:10-12. What does the text reveal? Why does Jesus, nev-
     ertheless, wash the feet of Judas? How does that act, in its own
     way, symbolize what foot washing is all about?


        The full-body bath represents the complete cleansing that a person
      receives at the beginning of the Christian life (baptism). Foot wash-
      ing, on the other hand, represents the Christian's ongoing need to deal
      with the soiling that comes from daily contact with the sinful world
      and its contamination. The foot is the part of the body that in ancient
      times came in regular contact with the earth and, therefore, needed
      continual cleansing.
        The beautiful lesson that comes through in Jesus' action is that our
      daily shortcomings as Christians do not call our original cleansing
      into question. It is not necessary to be rebaptized or to start all over
      every time we make a mistake. One who has bathed needs only to
      wash the feet again! We are secure as long as we do not choose to turn
      away (see also John 10:27-29).
         The image of Jesus washing the feet of His disciples represents His
      forgiveness of sins committed after baptism. The image of the disci-
      ples washing one another's feet signifies our willingness to forgive
      those daily irritations and transgressions that threaten the unity in love
      that Jesus purposed for His disciples (see also John 13:34, 35).

       What does it mean to "wash feet" in the context of everyday
       life? How can we be willing to "wash" one another's feet? What
       does it take to be able to do that?




                                                                             81
                MONDAY March 1


      True Greatness                (John 13:12-17).

What is Jesus' further purpose in washing the feet of the disciples?
      John 13:12-1 7.




        True greatness is the King of the universe walking over to the cor-
     ner of a room, picking up a towel and a basin of water, and stooping
     down to wash the feet of an unstable disciple such as Peter and a trai-
     tor such as Judas. True greatness does not need to brag or assert itself.
     It takes true greatness to exercise self-control or to act the role of a
     slave. It takes true greatness to do the right thing when everyone
     laughs at you or despises you in his or her heart.
        True greatness is to have the same attitude as Jesus (Phil. 2:5), who
     was "in very nature God" (vs. 6, NIV) yet took "the very nature of a
     servant" (vs. 7) and "humbled himself" (vs. 8). True greatness is to
     "consider others better than yourselves" (vs. 3). True greatness is to
     follow Jesus in the path of service and humility.
        In contrast, if our first thought in any situation is of our own advan-
     tage and self-interest, we are pursuing a false greatness. If our first
     reaction to any situation is to nag, belittle, criticize, and complain, we
     are exhibiting the opposite of humility and true greatness. Putting
     other people down says "I am better than you." Considering others as
     better than yourself causes you to uplift, encourage, and praise.

How can we develop true greatness? How can we learn to love a life
      of service? John 13:12-1 7, 15:4-8, 2 Cor 3:18.




      Does the way your local church practices foot washing capture
      the spirit of Jesus' command? If not, how can you change that
      situation? Does your local church carry out Jesus' example in
      its relationships with people inside and outside the church
      body? How can the foot-washing service become a more mean-
      ingful part of our Christian experience?

82
                TUESDAY March 2


     Judas: The Other Path to "Greatness"
     (John 13:18-30).

What purpose does Jesus have in predicting His betrayal? In what
     way does the principle shown here work all through prophecy?
     John 13:18, 19.




How does the knowledge of His coming betrayal affect Jesus? John
     13:21-26. Why should it have hurt Him so much? What do these
     texts tell us about God's feeling toward even the worst sinners?




        "The disciples knew nothing of the purpose of Judas. Jesus alone
      could read his secret. Yet He did not expose him. Jesus hungered for
      his soul. He felt for him such a burden as for Jerusalem when he wept
      over the doomed city. His heart was crying, How can I give thee
      up?"—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 645.
         But Judas chose to follow a different path to "greatness" than that
      exhibited by Christ in the foot-washing service. On this particular
      point he considered himself wiser than Christ. Surely it was obvious
      to anyone that greatness came from power, wealth, and the esteem of
      others! But his logical course of action led only to personal destruc-
      tion.
         "The prospect of having a high place in the new kingdom had led
      Judas to espouse the cause of Christ. . . .
         "It was he who set on foot the project to take Christ by force and
      make Him king. . . .
         "[He hoped to secure] the first position, next to Christ, in the new
      kingdom."—Pages 718-721.
         Judas failed to realize that anybody can act great or demand to be
      treated as great. Anybody can spend money or command others, given
      the opportunity. It takes true greatness to act the part of a servant and
      do tasks that others should have done. It takes true greatness to put
      others first, to treat others as better than yourself.

       Is the typical view of greatness in today's world more like that
       of Jesus or Judas? How can one best present the message of
       Jesus to people who are used to a different kind of greatness?

                                                                            83
         WEDNESDAY March 3


      Jesus Prays for His Disciples                          (John 17:1-19).


Read carefully John 17:1-19, focusing on the question: For whom
     does Jesus pray here, and why?




        The farewell gathering of Jesus and His disciples (John 13-17)
     draws to a close with an intercessory prayer in three parts. In John
     17:1-5 Jesus prays for Himself. In verses 6 to 19 His attention turns to
     His disciples and to their need for support in the absence of His phys-
     ical presence (the third part we'll look at tomorrow).
        The initial goal of Jesus' prayer is for help in completing the task of
     glorifying the Father on earth (vss. 1-5). This task will be accom-
     plished on the cross. There never has been a clearer picture of the
     character of God than that exhibited by Jesus in His humiliation and
     death. But Jesus prays for strength to complete this task, not to bene-
     fit Himself or His Father only but for the sake of all who will believe
     in Him. When Jesus and His Father are glorified on the cross, eternal
     life becomes available to those in relationship with Jesus (vss. 2, 3).
     So, even in His prayers for Himself, Jesus' ultimate goal is the glory
     of His Father and the benefit of others.
        Jesus then focuses His prayer directly in behalf of His disciples,
     who soon will have to learn how to live without His physical presence
     among them. He does not pray for the world but only for those who
     have renounced the world (vs. 9). He prays for His disciples, because
     they will have to remain in the world when He goes away, and they
     will become the object of the world's evil attention. As in chapter 13,
     Jesus' coming humiliation does not draw out concern for Himself;
     rather, it directs His attention to the consequences of His "going
     away" for His disciples.


Read verse 14. What does it mean to be " 'not of this world' "? In
     what ways should we, as Christians who are in this world, be
     " 'not of this world"? How could we know whether we are or are
     not?

     "But for Them Also Which Shall
     Believe" (John 17:20-26).
Whom else does Jesus pray for in John 17? John 17:20.

What does He pray will be the common experience of both the disci-
     ples and the second generation of Christians? John 17:21-24.




        In the last part of Jesus' prayer, He turns to the second generation
     of Christians. In the fullest sense, this second generation includes all
     Christians who have never had an encounter with Jesus in the flesh.
        When the love that Jesus prays for produces unity in the church, the
     world will come to know that Jesus is truly the One who represents
     the character of the Father on earth (see also John 13:34, 35). On the
     other hand, the world never will be seriously attracted to Christ
     through the instrumentality of a church that is bitterly divided.
        In Jesus' prayer we catch a glimpse of one reason prayers do not get
     answered. Every provision has been made for the church's unity. But
     the evident disunity of the church in general shows that even Jesus'
     prayers can be frustrated by the stubborn and self-serving human
     spirit. There are many things God would long to do for the church if
     only His people were willing to allow Him to do them.
         Another remarkable thing about this chapter is the idea of Jesus
     praying for His disciples and for us. With all the power Jesus dis-
     played in the course of His ministry on earth, He still saw great value
     in praying for others. Prayer for others accomplishes things in this
     world that never would happen otherwise.
         For most Christians, however, prayer for others can be an up-and-
      down experience. So, it helps to have a regular time set aside for
      prayer. It also can be helpful to make a prayer list, as long as the list
      is not so long that it becomes unmanageable. But most important of
      all, it helps to have some kind of accountability in the prayer life, a
      prayer partner or a prayer group that encourages one to keep on when
      the going gets tough.

       Look carefully at John 17:26. Jesus prayed that the love the
       Father had for Him would be in us, we who claim to follow
       Jesus. What is that love? Would it not be the most perfect love
       possible? How, then, can we manifest that love in our lives? Is
       perhaps the lack of unity among Christians one manifestation
       of this lack of love?

                                                                            85
                 FRIDAY March 5

Further Study: Read some of the great "farewell speeches" of the
     Bible outside the Gospel of John (Gen. 47:29-49:33; the whole book
     of Deuteronomy; Joshua 23, 24; 1 Chronicles 28, 29; Acts 20:17-38;
     2 Tim. 3:1-4:8). What are the common elements in all these dis-
     courses? To what degree does Jesus in John 13-17 conform to a com-
     mon literary pattern? In what ways does He deviate from earlier
     examples? If you were to give a farewell discourse to your family and
     friends that was based on the biblical model, what would you say?
        In John 17 Jesus talks about "glorifying" His Father and being glo-
     rified Himself (vss. 1, 4, 5). This concept of glory is a central theme
     in the Gospel of John (John 1:14; 2:11; 7:18; 8:50; 12:23, 24; 14:13;
     15:8; 17:10; 21:19; in some texts translators may substitute words
     such as honor). It is also a significant component of the first angel's
     message in Revelation (Rev. 14:6, 7). What do these texts imply about
     the word glory? How does the reading of these texts impact your life?
     How can we "glorify God" in our lives today?

Discussion Questions:
    0 What kind of unity was Jesus praying for? Is it possible to
      have unity of faith without unity of doctrine or belief? How wide
      a difference in belief can there be before disunity appears?

         Why is knowing Jesus the key to eternal life? When Jesus talks
      about eternal life in John 17:3, is He thinking in terms of quality
      of life now, or is He thinking only of heaven?

         Read carefully John 17:17. What is Jesus saying there that
      shows how crucial the Bible is to our spiritual life?


Summary: The key point of this lesson is that true greatness is not
     found in power, wealth, or fame; it is found in following Jesus along
     the path of service and humility. Jesus demonstrated this path when,
     in full awareness of the Cross He was about to experience, He never-
     theless was more concerned for the impact of the coming events on
     His disciples than He was for Himself. In washing the feet of His dis-
     ciples and in praying for them, as well as for us, Jesus did the oppo-
     site of what comes naturally to the human spirit. In so doing, He set
     for us an example of true greatness.

Life-Saving Change
by NARANTSETSEG and RAVDANDORG
   Ravdan: Like most of the people in Mongolia, we had no meaningful
religion. We felt hopeless and did not know where to turn for help in our
lives. We thought that education, money, possessions, and a good name
were all there were in life. Nothing seemed to bring us happiness.

  Nara: One day while on a train to another city, I met two young women,
Jolly and Orna. We talked, and the women invited me to visit their little
church in Darhan. I had not been to a Christian church before and was not
even sure there was a God. But I decided to go, just to see. After all, it
couldn't hurt to try God. Besides, I hoped that they would help us with
food and other things, as some churches do.
  I visited the church a few times and felt God's presence there. Ravdan
did not mind that I went and took the children, but he warned me to be
careful of strange new religions.

  Ravdan: Then the church leader came to visit us and talk to me about
God. He did not tell me what they thought, just what the Bible says. His
visit helped me understand what my wife and children were learning in
church. But I did not attend the church until months later.
  Then Nara invited me to evangelistic meetings the church was holding.
I wanted a better life; I was not happy with the way we were living. So
when I saw that the church was helping my wife and children, I decided to
try it, too. God opened our eyes, and I learned the truth. We all went
together, and by the end of the meetings, we decided to let God be the head
of our home. We were baptized.
  God has taken our sad, hopeless life and given us a peaceful life, full of
love for others. We never dreamed that God would change our lives so dra-
                             matically, that we would become Christians
                             and would share our new faith with others. It
                             is not easy to get people to listen to what God
                             has to tell us, but we can let them see the
                             change God has made in our lives, and we
                              pray that they will want a better life too. Now
                             we have our own small group that meets in a
                              room we rent.

                                NARANTSETSEG and RAVDANDORG live   in Darhan.

        LESSON 11 *March 6-12


      The Spirit "Replaces"
      Jesus


      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 13:31-16:33.
Memory Text:" 'But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that
      I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to
      you; but if I go, I will send him to you' " (John 16:7, NIV).

Key Thought: Life without a sense of Jesus' presence is empty.
      When He left earth, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to fill the place that
      He had held in the lives of His disciples. As hard as it was for His
      disciples to grasp, this arrangement was better for them than His
      physical presence had been.

             he Spirit was sent to continue and enhance Jesus' work on

      T      earth. After the foot washing, the shadow of the Cross began
             to hang over the room where Jesus and His disciples were
      reclining. Christ's last moments with them had come. They began to
      realize that Jesus was about to leave them. In John 13 to 16 Jesus
      delivers a farewell speech to His disciples in which He teaches them
      how to live without His physical presence, just as the second gener-
      ation of Christians would have to live without the physical presence
      of the disciples.
         How important for us, many generations removed from the time of
      Christ, to realize that the physical absence of Jesus is no handicap to us
      or to our walk with Him. We can be all He wants us to be, here and now,
      even while He is not among us as He was among the disciples. Through
      the presence of the Holy Spirit, Jesus' word is still as good as His touch.

                   SUNDAY March 7


     Going Away (John 13:31-14:31).
       Jesus waited until the departure of Judas (John 13:28-30) to begin
     His farewell speech to His disciples. What followed was spoken for
     their encouragement—and ours.

What problems are Jesus and His disciples facing at this time? John
      13:33, 36.


What impact does Jesus sense this would have on His disciples? John
      14:18.


        Jesus is going away, and the disciples are feeling abandoned. How
      can they possibly continue without Him? But Jesus makes it clear that
      His going away to the Father will benefit them.

What is one way in which the disciples are better off when Jesus goes
      to the Father? See John 14:12-14. What is Jesus saying here?


        A key to understanding how the departure of Jesus would benefit
      the disciples is found in the statement that the disciples would do
      greater works than Jesus did (John 14:12). At first glance this state-
      ment seems preposterous. How could anyone do greater works than
      Jesus did? Yet, the earthly Jesus was subject to human limitations. He
      could be only in one place at a time. When He was with the disciples,
      the Father could be seen only in His person (vs. 9). But when He went
      to the Father, those specific limitations were left behind. Through the
      Spirit (vss. 16, 17), His disciples could represent the character of God
      throughout the world.
         Because Jesus went to the Father and sent the Spirit, millions of dis-
      ciples have extended Jesus' work. And through the works and the
      writings of the disciples, Jesus has become real to millions around the
      globe. In a sense, the disciples of Jesus took His place in the world.
      The words and actions of believers may be the only picture of Jesus
      some people will ever see.

       Think of those with whom you have been in personal contact in
       the past 24 hours. Was your influence on them such that they
       would have been more interested in knowing the God whom you
       profess to serve, or would you have turned them off? Be honest
       with yourself.



                                                                            89
                MONDAY March 8


     Remaining Connected to Jesus (John
      15:1-16:33).

In John 15:1-8, Jesus gives the beautiful analogy of the vine and the
     branches. How does one "remain in the vine"? John 15:6, 7, 9, 10.




       The relationship of Jesus with the Father is the model for the dis-
     ciples' relationship with Jesus. Jesus loves the disciples the way the
     Father loves Him (John 15:9). On the other hand, the disciples are to
     obey His commands just as He obeys the commands of His Father
     (vs. 10).

How are the disciples to cope with the loss of Jesus' personal pres-
     ence? John 15:26, 27; 16:7.


        The relationship of Jesus with the world is paralleled in the rela-
     tionship of the disciples with unbelievers (John 15:18). The world's
     hatred of the disciples is rooted in its hatred of Jesus (vss. 22-25). The
     values of the world are often the opposite of God's values; at times,
     they are in direct conflict. Thus, the disciples need to be ready to face
     the hostility of the world.
        For the disciples, the negative experience of hatred and persecution
     (vss. 18-25, 16:1-4) is counterbalanced by the benefits that will come
     because Jesus has gone to the Father and has sent His Spirit (John
     15:26, 27; 16:7-15).
        Why was it better that Jesus was going away? (1) He would send
     the Holy Spirit, who would not be subject to human limitations.
     (2) Through the efforts of the disciples, the work of Jesus would be
     spread throughout the world and would impact every people and place.
     (3) The love they would have through the Spirit (John 15:12-15) would
     have convincing power in the world (John 13:34, 35). (4) Coping with
     the absence of Jesus would enable the disciples to provide a solid foun-
     dation for those who followed their generation (John 15:1-8).

      Read John 14:21, 23 and 15:10-14. What link does the Lord
      show between love and the commandments? In your own expe-
      rience, how have you seen the inseparable link between love and
      the commandments? How are these linked with "remaining in
      the vine"?

                TUESDAY March 9


     Seeds of the Spirit (John 1:32, 33; 3:5-8; 4:23, 24;
     6:63; 7:37-39).

       There are eleven passages in the Gospel of John that refer either
     directly or indirectly to the nature and work of the Holy Spirit. Five of
     these passages are located in the narrative section of the first half of
     the book. These passages mention the Spirit only in passing. It is as
     though John were using these passages to plant seeds in the reader's
     mind that would sprout only in the fertile soil of Jesus' farewell
     speech (John 13-16).

What can we learn about the work of the Spirit from John 1:32, 33;
     3:5-8; 4:23, 24; and 7:37-39?




         Although the Spirit makes several appearances in the first half of
      this Gospel, there is little information about Him. The Spirit makes it
      possible for the Baptist to identify Jesus at the Jordan (John 1:32, 33).
      He is an essential part of human participation in the kingdom of God
      (John 3:5, 6). Although His work cannot be controlled by human
      beings, His effect on people can be seen (vs. 8). Worship is no longer
      tied down to specific locations or temples, nor is it limited to any par-
      ticular people (John 4:23, 24). He is available in every place and to
      anyone of any background through the words of Jesus (John 6:63).
          The exact nature of the Spirit's work would become manifest only
      in the context of the Cross (John 7:39). So, John 7:37-39 is a transi-
      tional passage, preparing the reader for the clearer, more-detailed
      information about the Spirit's work that comes in the farewell dis-
      course of John 13-16. John 20:22 ("And . . . he breathed on them and
      said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit' " [NIVJ) shows that the promise of
      John 7:39 in fact began to be fulfilled right after Jesus' "glorifi-
      cation" on the cross.
          In John 14-16, the title given to the Spirit is a Greek noun that can
       be translated as "Comforter" or "Counselor." The root meaning of
      paraclete is a person who is called alongside to help someone. So the
       word can be used in the legal sense of a defense attorney at a trial who
       appeals in behalf of another or as one who comes to comfort some-
       one who is overwhelmed with grief at a time of loss. Both meanings
       fit well into the context of John 14-16.

                                                                            91
         WEDNESDAY                March 10

      Just Like Jesus              (John 14:16, 17, 26, 27).

Read carefully John 14:15-21, focusing specifically on verses 15 and
      21. What are they saying? How do they relate the Spirit to the
      commandments? Why would these two truths be so closely con-
      nected? What does one have to do with the other?




        Jesus calls the Holy Spirit " 'another Counselor' " (John 14:16,
     NIV). This means the Holy Spirit is not the only Counselor (or
     Comforter); He is another Counselor. The original language empha-
     sizes the similarity between Jesus and the Spirit. The Spirit is another
     Counselor just as Jesus is. Jesus is also the Counselor.
        The disciples are feeling depressed. Jesus has said that He is going
     away, and they are distressed (John 13:33, 36; 14:2-5). So, Jesus
     assures them they will not be left as "orphans" (John 14:18, NIV).
     Through the Spirit, He will continue to be with them. The Spirit will
     do for them the same things Jesus did when He was physically on
     earth. The ultimate targets of this message, of course, are those who
     have come after, those who have come to believe through the words
     of the written Gospels, not through physical contact with Jesus or
     with anyone who knew Jesus in the flesh.
       "Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every place per-
     sonally. Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the
     Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one could
     then have any advantage because of his location or his personal con-
     tact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all.
     In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended
     on high."—Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 669.
        Jesus also calls the Holy Spirit the "Spirit of truth" (John 14:17).
     The person and work of the Spirit are authentic and real; they can be
     trusted. The Spirit will not guide us contrary to the truth about Jesus
     nor about ourselves. Truth can be painful to hear but is necessary to
     spiritual growth. Only those who are committed to truth, as mani-
     fested in obedience to the truth they already know, will receive the
     Spirit (vss. 15, 16, 21). And how can we understand obedience apart
     from the commandments?

      Look again at John 14:21. Jesus says that those who keep His
      commandments are those who love Him and that to these He
      will manifest Himself. How have you experienced this manifes-
      tation of Christ in your own life?

      The Ultimate Guide                      (John 15:26, 27; 16:7-15).

What task of the Spirit is recorded in John 15:26?
In what three areas does the Holy Spirit bring conviction? John
      16:8-11. What two features of the Spirit's work are highlighted in
      John 16:13? Also, how do the commandments, as seen in the text
      for yesterday, fit in here? How are they all related?




         Jesus does not need the Holy Spirit to glorify Him in His person;
      the Father did that when He exalted Jesus to His right hand at the
      Ascension. The role of the Spirit is rather to exalt and glorify Jesus in
      the estimation of humanity here on earth. There are no revelations
      from the Spirit except those that exalt and glorify Jesus. As valuable
      as the work of the Spirit is, therefore, attention to the Spirit is not
      healthful if it directs our attention away from Jesus.
         The Spirit is Christ's Successor and Representative with the disci-
      ples and to the world. It is in this sense that the Holy Spirit can be said
      to "replace" Jesus. The Spirit extends the presence of Jesus to the new
      generation that never knew His physical touch. The instruction that
      Jesus no longer could give in the flesh, the Spirit would do every-
      where in His behalf. The witness that He would no longer bear, the
      Spirit would bear in His behalf. Through the Spirit, Jesus would con-
      tinue to be glorified.
         On the other hand, as Jesus brought judgment and conviction to all
      who were exposed to His light, so the Holy Spirit has a ministry also
      to the world, to bring conviction of sin, the offer of righteousness, and
      a warning of judgment to come. The world rejected Jesus and still
      does so today. But in spite of the world's continued rejection, the
      Spirit continues to convict, and people hear Jesus' voice through the
      voice of the Spirit.
         Above all else, therefore, it is through the Spirit that the presence
      of Jesus is made real in our lives, even though we cannot see Him or
      touch Him. Although others may not share our experience, the Spirit
      changes the lives of those who enter into relationship with Jesus and
      yield themselves to the guidance and comfort of the Holy Spirit.

       If someone were to ask you how the Holy Spirit has touched
       your life, what would you answer? What does your answer say
       to you about the state of your walk with the Lord? What
       changes might you need to make?

 Further Study: "As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit
      flashes conviction into the mind. It is not the conviction that logical
      reasoning produces; but unless the mind has become too dark to know
      God, the eye too dim to see Him, the ear too dull to hear His voice, a
      deeper meaning is grasped, and the sublime, spiritual truths of the
      written word are impressed on the heart."—Ellen G. White, Christ's
      Object Lessons, p. 24.
         "It is one thing to assent in a general way to the agency of the Holy
      Spirit, and another thing to accept His work as a reprover calling to
      repentance. Many feel a sense of estrangement from God, a realiza-
      tion of their bondage to self and sin; they make efforts for reform; but
      they do not crucify self. They do not give themselves entirely into the
      hands of Christ, seeking for divine power to do His will. They are not
      willing to be molded after the divine similitude. In a general way they
      acknowledge their imperfections, but they do not give up their partic-
      ular sins. With each wrong act the old selfish nature is gaining
      strength."—Page 48.

Discussion Questions:
    0 When Jesus said " 'I will do whatever you ask in my name' "
       (John 14:13, NIV), how do you think He defined "whatever"?
       How would you interpret John 15:7 in this regard?

       0 What happens to Christians when they lose a major spiritual
       leader or mentor? What can one do to find new sources of spir-
       itual strength? How much weight should we put upon anyone,
       no matter how much of a spiritual encouragement he or she has
       been?


Summary: In John 13 to 16 Jesus taught His disciples how to live
    without His physical presence, just as the second generation of
    Christians would have to live without the physical presence of the dis-
    ciples. As followers of Jesus manifest their desire for the truth through
    prayerful obedience to Jesus' commands, the Spirit of truth comes to
    them. That Spirit reminds us of Jesus' words and teachings (John
    14:26), guides us into all truth, tells us what we need to know about the
    future (John 16:13), and glorifies Jesus on this earth (vs. 15). But to
    those who have rejected or ignored Jesus' commands, the Spirit brings
    conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment (vss. 8-11).

Love Without Limits
Part 1
by RUTH SCHNEIDER TESCHE
   God took me from being a complacent, pew-sitting Christian to becom-
ing active in prison ministries. I had fought this change in my life all the
way, but when I finally allowed God to work His will in my life, I found
great happiness and joy in ministering to people in prison.
   I had been involved in prison ministries for only a short time when I
read a newspaper story about a terrible crime that was committed in the
area of South Brazil where I live. I shuddered as I read the story and
silently asked God to protect me from having to meet the monster who had
committed that crime.
   The warden and I had become friends. He often asks me to provide
needed clothing and toiletries for prisoners whose families were too far
away or too poor to provide these items for them. One day he mentioned
that a new prisoner needed some things and asked me whether I could get
him a change of clothes, shoes, and some toiletries. I agreed to go buy the
needed items, and I asked for the man's name and sizes. I wrote the infor-
mation down in my memo book beside the man's name, Luis.
   When I returned to the prison with the items the warden had asked for,
he told me, "You have no idea of the good you have just done for Jamir."
   "Jamir?" I said, shocked. "I thought these things were for a prisoner
named Luis." Jamir was the name of the man who had committed that ter-
rible crime, the man I never wanted to meet or even think about. I strug-
gled with myself for several moments, realizing that God had allowed me
to hear the man's name wrong because I might have refused to help this
Jamir if I had known the supplies were for him.
                                I have argued with God a lot about various
                             issues in the past, and I sensed what He had in
                             mind for me next. All the way home I argued
                             with God about helping Jamir. But God gave
                             me no peace until I agreed to pray for this
                             man. And as I prayed for him, my attitude
                             began to change.

      Jesus Lays Down His Life
      for His Friends




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
                                      T
Read for This Week's Study: John 18:1-19:42.

Memory Text:" 'Greater love has no one than this, that he lay
      down his life for his friends' " (John 15:13, NIV).

Key Thought: It is by contemplating the Cross of Jesus that we
      experience both His glory and our own value as human beings.

              he Cross forever establishes the value of the human soul.

      T       Human beings have experimented with a variety of ways to
              establish a sense of worth and meaning in their lives. But, ulti-
      mately, there is only one place on earth where human value and mean-
      ing are forever established. And that place was on a hill called Calvary
      (Golgotha).
         Here, in a way unseen or even unimagined (except within the
      Godhead), the worth of human beings before God was forever revealed
      to human beings, angels, and the onlooking universe. Here, more than
      anywhere else in the universe, the true nature and character of our
      Creator are revealed.
         The story of Jesus' crucifixion in the Gospel of John begins and ends
      in a garden (John 18:1, 19:41). The story itself falls into three parts.
      First, there is a section describing the betrayal, arrest, and indictment of
      Jesus (John 18:1-27). The central section of the story is concerned with
      the trial before Pilate (John 18:29 to 19:16). Finally, the Crucifixion
      itself and then burial of Jesus are described in John 19:16-42.
         Let us take a look at the greatest event in all cosmic history.

*Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, March 20.

                  SUNDAY March 14


     Betrayed and Denied                        (John 18:1-11, 15-18, 25-27).

Read John 18:1-11. What does John say that shows how Christ was
     fully in control of events that happened there? What does Jesus do
     to show that He allowed Himself to be taken prisoner?




        In John 18:1-11, the main point seems to be that Jesus is in full con-
     trol of the situation, in fulfillment of John 10:18: " 'No one takes [my
     life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord"' (NIV). Although
     about to be murdered, Jesus is not a victim; all this had to happen. See
     John 3:14. If Jesus had wanted to avoid arrest, He could have simply
     gone somewhere else other than the Garden where Judas would look
     for Him. He leads His disciples to the Garden, even though He knows
     what is coming. He does not wait for the mob to come to Him; He
     moves forward and addresses them, capable of intimidating them
     fully should that have served His purpose. His death is voluntary.
     They could not have arrested Him had He not allowed it.

How does Peter react to the situation? Why is that so typically a
      human reaction?




         Under these circumstances, the reaction of Peter is almost comical.
      Although Jesus is fully in control of the situation, to Peter things look
      totally out of control. He whips out his sword and tries to protect Jesus,
      but Jesus tells him to put the sword away. Jesus must go to the cross, or
      God's plan of salvation would fail. The very actions by which Peter
      sought to gain control of the situation only would have moved things
      truly out of control. In fact, Peter's rash action in the Garden jeopardizes
      the validity of Jesus' appeal to Pilate later in the chapter (John 18:36).

       Jesus knew the future, knew what was going to happen before
       it did. He does today, as well. What kind of comfort does that
       give you, knowing that nothing that happens, even in your own
       life, takes God by surprise? At the same time, what kind of trou-
       bling questions does it raise?


                                                                               97
                MONDAY March 15


      Before Annas and Pilate                        (John 18:12-40).

        Only in the Gospel of John does more than one disciple follow
      Jesus into the high priest's courtyard (John 18:15, 16). Presumably,
      the girl at the door knew that John (the "other disciple") was a disci-
      ple of Jesus but didn't challenge him because he had privileged
      access.

Why does Jesus get slapped in the face in front of Annas? John 18:19-
     23.


        Jesus is quite assertive in His encounter with Annas (John 18:20-
     23, NIV). He challenges both the secretiveness of His arrest ("I said
     nothing in secret") and the legal procedures being followed ("Why
     question me?"). He even tosses in a dash of ironic humor ("If I spoke
     the truth, why did you strike me?"). In this instance Jesus does not fol-
     low an extreme interpretation of "turning the other cheek" (Matt.
     5:39). He protests His opponent's abuse of authority (John 18:23).
     There is sometimes a fine line between being humble and taking
     abuse.
        After being taken to Caiaphas, Jesus is brought before Pilate, the
     central figure of this part of the narrative. At the time, Pilate was in a
     position of considerable political weakness. A series of blunders had
     repeatedly offended the Jews. He was unpopular, therefore, and his
     fitness to rule even had come under suspicion in Rome. One more
     major conflict with the religious leaders, and he probably would be
     out of office. This made him extremely vulnerable to blackmail.
        In approaching Pilate, the priests first formulate their charge
     against Jesus in the political terms that a Roman governor could
     appreciate. Jesus must be executed, because His kingship is a threat to
     Caesar. But Jesus' statement " 'My kingdom is not of this world' "
     and the supporting evidence (vs. 36, NIV) make it clear to Pilate that
     Jesus' claim to kingship is no political or military threat to Rome. He
     determines to free Jesus and at the same time provide the Jewish lead-
     ers a face-saving way out, offering to release Jesus on the basis of a
     traditional prisoner release rather than a judgment of innocence.

      Read what Jesus says to Pilate in John 18:36. How do you
      understand what Jesus means when He says that His kingdom
      is not of this world? What implications do His words have for
      you, if you claim to be part of His kingdom? Write out your
      answer in a short paragraph. Be prepared, if willing, to share it
      with your Sabbath School class.

                TUESDAY March 16


     Political Expediency                   (John 19.1-16).

Read John 19:1-16. What irony exists in the actions of the soldiers
      (vss. 2-4)?


         Things get complicated for Pilate when the Jewish leaders reject his
      offer to release Jesus on terms favorable to them. They want Jesus
      dead at any cost. That means Pilate either must persuade them against
      their set opinion or release Jesus in the face of their wrath, which
      would cost him his job. Pilate was caught in a dilemma between jus-
      tice and self-interest.
         Pilate seeks, therefore, to engage his opponents' sympathy by flog-
      ging Jesus and presenting Him before them. But they refuse to be
      moved. Sensing that Pilate's self-interest has weakened him, the reli-
      gious leaders start playing dirty; they argue that Jesus should die
      because He has broken their religious law. They know that Pilate can-
      not afford to be seen as acting against their religious interests.

Read verses 7 and 8. Why was Pilate made even "more afraid" (NIV)?
      What does Pilate ask Jesus (vs. 9), and why would he ask Jesus
      such a question? What does that question reveal?


         Pilate seems to realize at this point that indecision has been his
      weakness. He cannot save both himself and Jesus. He determines
      finally to save himself at Jesus' expense. He will consent to the reli-
      gious leaders' request, but they will pay dearly for it. He condemns
      Jesus in exchange for a public confession of their obligation to serve
      Caesar: "We have no king but Caesar."
         Earlier Caiaphas had insisted that one Man had to be sacrificed so
      the nation might not be destroyed (John 11:48-52). Now Pilate is
      ready to sacrifice the nation in order to destroy one Man. The reli-
      gious leaders reject Jesus' kingship with such passion that they now
      rejoice in a king whom they always have hated. Pilate intends to hold
      them to that pledge in the future. They will have no more power over
      him. From this point on in the Gospel story, Pilate is unmovable. In
      one of the Gospel's fascinating ironies, the death of Jesus makes
      Pilate strong!

       Look at Pilate, doing what he knows is wrong, all for personal
       gain. What can we learn from his example in order to spare us
       from making a similar mistake when confronted with a similar
       dilemma, that of being pressured to compromise on a moral
       issue?


                                                                          99
          WEDNESDAY March 17


      Humiliation, Death, and Burial                                (John
      19:16-42).

        Crucifixion was used by the Romans to intimidate potential oppo-
      nents. In order to breathe, victims had to push up with their feet to raise
      their bodies. Death came by suffocation when they were too weary to
      raise themselves anymore. Death was, therefore, slow and agonizing.
      Breaking the legs would hasten the process, when that was for the exe-
      cutioner's convenience. An additional element of torture was shame and
      exposure, being hung naked in front of family and friends.

What significance is found in the words of the sign that Pilate had
      written and placed over the cross? John 19:19. Why do you think
      he had them placed there? Guilt? Arrogance? Fear? A mixture of
      all three?


        In these verses we see a stronger, bolder version of Pilate, energized
      by the sacrifice of Jesus. The wording he chose for the inscription
      placed on the cross made the crucifixion of Jesus symbolic of Rome's
      dominance over Palestine and its native religion. With the inscription
      he turned the Crucifixion into a blow against the prestige of the Jews
      and their religious leaders.

What major theme of this passage occurs four times? John 19:24, 28,
      36, 37.


         Although Pilate now feels in control of matters, there are repeated
      reminders in this part of the text that everything is happening accord-
      ing to the predictions placed in the Scriptures. God is in control, even
      when human beings feel they are. Jesus' death is voluntary, purpose-
      ful, and according to the Scriptures.
         In John 19:30, Jesus says, " 'It is finished.' " But what exactly was
      finished at the Cross? The particular emphasis in chapter 19 seems to
      be that the Cross is the fulfillment of the Bible prophecies pointing
      toward the Messiah. Prophecy was fulfilled down to the minutest detail
      of just what type of garment was divided, what type was wagered for
      (vss. 23, 24), and just how the body of Jesus was handled after His death
      (vss. 35-37). The Cross makes it clear that even when bad things hap-
      pen in our lives things are not out of God's control. Followers of Jesus
      do not need to live in fear of what they cannot control.

       What did Christ finish, in your behalf, at the Cross? See also
       Mark 10:45, Heb. 9:26, 1 John 2:2.

             THURSDAY March 18


     In Search of the Cross                      (John 12:20-32).

       John offers additional interpretations of the Cross in other parts of
     the Gospel.

How does John turn the words of Caiaphas into a theology of the
     Cross? John 11:49-52.


       What is so special about the Cross that Paul refused to glory in any-
     thing else (Gal. 6:14)? Through the words of Caiaphas, John
     expresses that in some sense the death of Jesus stands in place of
     every other human being.
       According to Paul, at the Cross the wages of sin (Rom. 6:23) were
     placed upon Jesus as the Representative of the sinful human race. If the
     law of God could have been changed, humanity could have been saved
     without a cross; thus, in the truest, most dramatic sense, the Cross
     affirms the perpetuity of the law. The Cross condemned human sin in the
     person of Christ (Rom. 8:3, 1 Pet. 2:24); the resurrection of Christ paves
     the way for our resurrection at the end of the world (1 Cor 15:12-23).

How does Jesus Himself express the significance of the Cross? John
     12:24, 31-33.


       Jesus expresses the "one in place of many" theme in terms of seeds.
     Then in verses 31-33 He shows that the Cross results in the condem-
     nation of Satan and of sin in a mighty act of judgment. The Cross also
     becomes a wonderful magnet of attraction that draws "all men" (vs.
     32, NIV—in the original, the implication may include the entire uni-
     verse!) to Jesus.
       What is so attractive about the Cross? Above all else, the Cross
     affirms the incredible value of the human person. "One soul is of
     infinite value; Calvary speaks its worth."—Ellen G. White, Gospel
     Workers, p. 184. God so loves every human being that Jesus would
     have died for even one (John 3:16).
       As Creator of the entire universe, Jesus possesses in His Person
     infinite value. In dying for you and for me, Jesus testified to the infi-
     nite value He places on every one of us. And the value we have in the
     Cross is a value that does not change, no matter what we do or whom
     we become. If we should, in the end, choose to reject the Cross, our
     value in eternity will be measured by the pain of our absence that is
     felt in the heart of God.

       What should the Cross do to our pride, self-sufficiency, and
       arrogance—and why?

                                                                           101
                   FRIDAY March 19


Further Study: Read The Desire of Ages, pages 758-764, where
      Ellen G. White offers a powerful theology of the Cross, without any
      direct reference to the Gospel of John, except for the words of 19:30,
      " 'It is finished.' " List the main themes of her presentation in that
      chapter. Then list the main ideas of John's theology of the Cross as
      expressed in the lesson and in any other passages of the Gospel that
      may address the issue in some way (such as John 2:1-11, 6:50-59, and
      16:7-11). Compare and contrast the respective emphases of Ellen
      White and John. In what ways does she deepen and broaden the con-
      cept of "One in place of many"?
         "Without the cross, man could have no union with the Father. On it
      depends our every hope. From it shines the light of the Saviour's love,
      and when at the foot of the cross the sinner looks up to the One who
      died to save him, he may rejoice with fullness of joy, for his sins are
      pardoned. Kneeling in faith at the cross, he has reached the highest
      place to which man can attain."—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
      Apostles, pp. 209, 210.
         "Paul saw that the character of Christ must be understood before
      men could love Him or view the cross with the eye of faith. Here must
      begin that study which shall be the science and the song of the
      redeemed through all eternity. In the light of the cross alone can the
      true value of the human soul be estimated."—Ellen G. White, The Acts
      of the Apostles, p. 273.

Discussion Question:
       In the first Ellen White quote above, why does all our hope rest
       on the Cross? What happened there that gives us such hope?


Summary: The Cross is the place where human value and meaning
      are established. "Christ paid an infinite price for us, and according to
      the price paid He desires us to value ourselves."—Ellen G. White, The
      Ministry of Healing, p. 498.
         When we gain a sense of our value in the Cross, we can begin to
      avoid the ups and downs that come when our self-worth is based on
      performance or on the fickle opinions of others. When we see our-
      selves in the light of the Cross, we develop the strength to overcome
      sin, the confidence to defeat Satan, and the joy that comes from know-
      ing who we are. No wonder Paul said, "May I never boast except in
      the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Gal. 6:14, NIV).

Love Without Limits
Part 2
by Rum SCHNEIDER TESCHE
   God called me to minister to prisoners and lead them to the Savior, but
often God used the prisoners to lead me closer to His will, as well. When
the warden asked me to help a new prisoner, I was willing, until I realized
it was a man who had committed a terribly cruel crime in our town. Then
God worked with me until I was willing to pray for Jamir.
   Soon God told me to go visit Jamir. It took awhile to pray through my
prejudices, but finally I asked the warden whether I could visit him. I
trembled as I entered the prison's visitation room. A prisoner I did not rec-
ognize walked toward me. Our conversation was awkward, and he did not
want to hear about God. But before I left, I told him I was praying for him.
   For weeks I resisted visiting Jamir again. Every time I thought of him I
still saw the terrible crime of which he was accused. Then one Sabbath I
visited another couple with whom I was working in the same prison.
During our conversation the couple told me, "There is a prisoner here who
wants to talk to you." Of course I agreed. The guard brought in the pris-
oner. When I heard Jamir's name announced, I stiffened. I could not refuse
to see him, and I could not leave for I was locked inside a prison.
   A few minutes later Jamir appeared, greeted us, and kissed me on the
cheek. That monster kissed me! I thought to myself. I stumbled through
 the visit.
    At home I ranted at God. "How can you ask me to work with this man?
 I can't handle it!" For weeks I fought God about Jamir until finally,
 exhausted and weary of arguing, I gave in. "OK, God, if it's Your will, use
 me." Finally I had peace.
    I began spending time with Jamir. I spent more time and money for
 Jamir than most prisoners. Then he was moved to another prison farther
 away. But God told me to go visit him. I went, and I met other prisoners
 there who needed help. Soon my husband and I were making regular trips
 to that prison, filling the car with clothing and supplies the prisoners
 needed.
    I watched in amazement as Jamir's life changed dramatically. He found
 Jesus as his Savior and is leading other prisoners to Christ. He wants noth-
 ing more than to share God's love, which knows no boundaries, with those
 who need it most. What a change God has wrought in this monster of a
  man! What a change He has wrought in me!

        LESSON            13 *March 20-26
      The Power
      of the Resurrection




      SABBATH AFTERNOON

Read for This Week's Study: John 20:1-21:25.
Memory Text: "But these are written that you may believe that
      Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may
      have life in his name" (John 20:31, NIV).

Key Thought: The resurrection of Jesus provides both the assur-
      ance that the claims of Jesus are true and a living parable of God's
      mighty power in our lives today.

             he power of the Resurrection is real. John 20 brings us to a

      T      crucial point in the Gospel of John. There is a sense in which
             the story is "finished" with Jesus' death on the cross (see
      John 19:30).
        But there is also a sense in which it is unfinished. There would be no
      Christian church if Jesus had remained in the tomb. The resurrection of
      Jesus turns apparent defeat into victory. The Resurrection is a mighty
      act of God on the level of the Creation and of the Exodus.
        The New Testament records eleven separate post-Resurrection
      appearances of Jesus, four of which are recorded in chapters 20 and
      21 of the Gospel of John, three of them in chapter 20 (John 20:10-18,
      19-23, 24-29). And, perhaps, the most important message here is one
      that's been seen all through the book: A true Christian experience
      comes not by seeing and touching but by believing in the words of
      Jesus, whether spoken in the flesh or in the written testimonies of His
      disciples.

     At the Tomb             (John 20:1-18).

        The many witnesses to the Resurrection help assure us the accounts
     of the Resurrection were not made up by the disciples in order to save
     face. As long as these witnesses lived, their stories could be compared
     and checked out (Luke 1:1-4).
        For the second generation, however, the greatest evidence of Jesus'
     resurrection was the empty tomb. The empty tomb is a central feature
     of this Gospel. Indeed, given the circumstances, the emptiness of the
     tomb is extremely hard to understand unless Jesus was, in fact, raised
     from the dead. Did the enemies of Jesus come and remove His body
     from the tomb? Did the disciples steal His body in order to create the
     illusion of a resurrection? We will see in tomorrow's study that none
     of these scenarios makes sense. The best explanation for the empty
     tomb (unless one is predisposed to deny the possibility of resurrec-
     tion) is that Jesus was, in fact, raised from the dead.

Read John 20:3-10, the account of the first two disciples at the tomb.
      Focus specifically on verse 9. How could they not understand that,
      especially after all that Jesus had told them about His resurrec-
      tion? See Matt. 12:40, 27:63, Mark 9:30-32, 10:32-34, John 2:19.




How does Mary Magdalene understand the empty tomb at first, and
      how does she come to realize that Jesus was alive? John 20:10-16.


        To the next generation of Christians, the message in the little scene
      between Jesus and Mary was powerful. Although Mary was in the
      personal presence of Jesus, her eyes were so blinded by tears that she
      had no idea with whom she was talking. His physical presence was of
      no use to her until she gave attention to His word. We, too, have that
      word, through the Gospel of John.

       Look at the initial reaction of those who found the empty tomb.
       Despite everything that Jesus had taught them, all thought
       there was a natural explanation: Someone took away His body.
       With all the supernatural things they had seen with Jesus, their
       first reaction was toward doubt and skepticism. What lessons
       can we learn from this for ourselves?


                                                                         105
                 MON DAY March 22


      In the Upper Room                      (John 20:19-29).

How do the rest of the disciples come to know that Jesus was raised
      from the dead? John 20:19, 20. How does Thomas? John 20:24-29.
      What do their reactions reveal about their faith? Did they really
      have "faith" before seeing Him, as we understand faith? How
      much faith does it take to believe in what you see, hear, tell, and
      touch?


         The first generation of Christians was very slow to believe, despite
      the evidence of the empty tomb and the witness of Mary. All needed
      to see Jesus for themselves before they could forsake other explana-
      tions for the empty tomb. Only the beloved disciple believed without
      seeing Jesus first (John 20:8), representing the kind of faith the sec-
      ond generation would have to exercise and Jesus would bless.


Read John 20:29. What is Jesus saying here, and what does that
      mean to us, today? Is Jesus asking us to have "blind" faith?
      Explain your answer.


         How did the tomb become empty? Certainly the enemies of Jesus
      had no motive for removing His body from the tomb, and if they had
      done so, why did they not produce the body to prove He had not
      risen?
         It is equally clear that the disciples had neither the ability nor the
      intention of stealing Jesus' body. The fact is that the disciples did not
      believe that Jesus would allow Himself to die, in spite of His repeated
      assertions of what lay ahead. On top of this, if the disciples had stolen
      the body of Jesus, their later behavior is totally unexplainable. Who
      would suffer ridicule, torture, and death over an event that never took
      place?
         Thus, the Lord has given us, besides the clear testimony of the Bible,
      rational and historical evidence to help us believe in the resurrection of
      Christ. And if Jesus rose from the dead, no other miracle is impossible.
      Anything we possibly could ask of Him can be done when it is accord-
      ing to His will. Our own resurrection also is guaranteed by the certainty
      of His. The same divine power that raised Jesus from the dead can bring
      life and healing into even the most hopeless human situations.

       Who has not, in his or her walk with the Lord, at some time
       experienced some struggle with faith? How, by our focusing on
       the Cross and the Resurrection, can our faith be strengthened?

               TUESDAY March 23


     The Power of His Resurrection                               (John 2:22;
     7:37-39; 12:16).

What are some other things that happened to the disciples as a
     result of the resurrection of Jesus? John 2:22, 7:37-39, 12:16.


       "I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection," Paul writes
     to the Philippians (Phil. 3:10, NIV). The resurrection of Jesus was the
     most awesome event of all time. With all our science and technology,
     we still have no clue how to bring life back from the dead. Anyone who
     has the power to raise the dead would (one would think) have the power
     to accomplish anything else the human race might need.
        At the heart of Christian faith is the testimony of the New Testament
     that Jesus rose from the dead. The power of Jesus' resurrection became
     the basis for the mighty acts of God in the lives of Christians ever since
     (2 Cor 5:14-17). The power of the Resurrection is the basis for limit-
     less power in the lives of Christians today. Why, then, are these "limit-
     less powers" so invisible in many churches today?
        One of the major themes of the Old Testament has to do with remem-
     bering and forgetting. Whenever the Israelites forgot the mighty things
     God had done for them, they lost the sense of His power and presence.
     When they remembered what He had done for them in the past, the
     power of the original action was reactivated in their lives. In fact, the
      very essence of Old Testament spiritual life was recounting the mighty
     acts of God in their past history.

Read Deuteronomy 26:1-12. How do these verses reveal the impor-
     tance of remembering how God has acted in the past? See also
     Pss. 66:1-6, 78:1-55.


        Indeed, when the Israelites told of the mighty acts of God in their
     past history, the power of the original act was unleashed again in their
     experience (2 Chron. 20:1-30).
       What was true in Old Testament times is also true of the New
     Testament. The greatest mighty act of God is the action He did at the
     Cross and the resurrection of Jesus. There is power in the constant
     retelling of the Christ event. That is why sharing our faith is such an
     essential part of the Christian experience. Where there is no retelling
     of the mighty acts of God, there is no power. But telling what God has
     done brings revival and reformation. The power of the Resurrection
     turns a formal religion into a living and powerful one!

       How, in your own walk with the Lord, has recounting the Lord's
       actions in your past helped strengthen your faith?

                                                                           107
          WEDN ESDAY March 24


      Gone Fishing               (John 21:1-14).

Read John 21:1-11. What makes this event so appropriate, so sym-
      bolic, of what Jesus would have them do after He's gone (see par-
      ticularly vs. 11)? Compare this account to Luke 5:1-10, particu-
      larly verse 10.


         John 21 is often described as the epilogue to the Fourth Gospel,
      because it comes after a passage that reads like the concluding words
      of the Gospel (John 20:30, 31). John 21 tells the story of how the dis-
      ciples encountered Jesus in Galilee after His resurrection. Jesus pro-
      vides a huge catch of fish (vss. 1-6), fixes breakfast (vss. 7-14), and
      then holds a serious conversation on the beach with Peter (vss. 15-23).
         The impression one gets, particularly in the Gospel of John, is that
      Jesus' postresurrection appearances were occasional and rather unex-
      pected. Mary, the ten, Thomas, and now seven disciples are all startled
      at the suddenness of Jesus' appearances. In a real sense, the ministry
      of Jesus to His disciples was completed in the upper room (John
      13-17). He says very little to them after the Resurrection, at least, that
      is recorded. The purpose of His appearances, perhaps, is not so much
      to teach as to validate the reality of His resurrection.

What has Jesus been doing on the shore? John 21:9-13. What spiritual
     meaning can you find in Jesus inviting them to dine with Him?


         It appears that breakfast that morning was pretty silent (see also
      Ellen G. White, The Desire ofAges, p. 810). The disciples didn't seem
      to know what to make of Jesus' behavior since they had been with
      Him in the upper room. On that day they experienced the same uncer-
      tainties the second generation Christians would experience over the
      death of the beloved disciple. The disciples were in the presence of
      Jesus in the flesh, yet His physical presence seems to have offered no
      advantage to them. Only the coming of the Spirit would provide solid
      assurance, and the coming of the Spirit proved to be equally effective
      for both the first and the second generation.

       Imagine being in the presence of Jesus and it giving you no
       advantage! That could happen if someone were to allow formal
       religion alone—creeds, rules, doctrines—without a living expe-
       rience with the Lord, to dominate his or her religious life. What
       lesson is here for us?




108
             THURSDAY March 25


     Getting Peter Back on Track (John 21:15-23).
Read the exchange between Jesus and Peter in John 21:15-17.
     Compare it with what happened in Luke 22:55-62. What was
     Jesus doing here with Peter?


        Verses 15-17 describe a threefold repetition of question, reply, and
     response. This approach could seem rude on the part of Jesus. Its
     effect is to probe Peter to the depths of his being, at the cost of con-
     siderable pain. Peter's self-confidence is gradually chipped away,
     until he is left with nothing but the certainty that Jesus knows his
     heart and will be fair in His judgments.
        There is something about pain, loss, poverty, and emotional anguish
     that brings people to the place where major gains in spiritual develop-
     ment are possible. And sometimes, as in the case of Peter, the author of
     that pain is Jesus who, like a loving surgeon, wounds so that He might
     heal. Jesus does not settle for quick, superficial answers. He insists on
     getting down to the true feelings and motives of those He loves.
        The experience of Peter shows that any relationship with Jesus will
     tend to have its ups and downs. What would Jesus have us do when
     we fall? How can we know we are accepted in spite of what we have
     said, thought, or done?
         I. Know what kind of God you are dealing with. God loves sinners!
     This is not to say that sin does not matter but that no matter what we
     have done in the past, we can start over today. It is at those very times
     when you feel the worst that you have the greatest claim on His
     mercy!
         2. Tell the truth about yourself. The Bible calls this confession.
     Confession simply is facing reality and being honest with God about
     it. Confession can be difficult, because our natures will rebel against
     it, but if we are grounded in the value that we have at the Cross, it will
     be less painful than the consequences of not confessing!
         3. Ask for forgiveness. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
      and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness"
      (1 John 1:9, NIV). God does not require a whole list of conditions
      before He becomes willing to forgive. The conditions were already
      met in Jesus Christ.
         4. Plan to forsake sin forever. How can you do this when many sins
      seem attractive? Total up in advance some of the consequences of con-
      tinuing in sin. Read the list to yourself every time you are tempted.

      Take a spiritual inventory of yourself, based on those four steps
      listed above. How have you done? Better with some steps than
      with others? What changes must you make in your own life?


                                                                             109
                  FRIDAY March 26

Further Study: "Jesus had several times attempted to open the
      future to His disciples, but they had not cared to think about what He
      said. Because of this His death had come to them as a surprise; and
      afterward, as they reviewed the past and saw the result of their un-
      belief, they were filled with sorrow. When Christ was crucified, they
      did not believe that He would rise. He had stated plainly that He was
      to rise on the third day, but they were perplexed to know what He
      meant. This lack of comprehension left them at the time of His death
      in utter hopelessness. They were bitterly disappointed. Their faith did
      not penetrate beyond the shadow that Satan had cast athwart their
      horizon. All seemed vague and mysterious to them. If they had
      believed the Saviour's words, how much sorrow they might have been
      spared!"—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 25, 26.


Discussion Questions:
       O Are there times when it is good to be as skeptical as Thomas
       was? How do we know when it is appropriate to doubt some-
       thing?

       • How do we know whether the pain in our lives is something
       God is allowing to happen in order to teach us something? Or do
       we need to know? Is it not enough simply to ask the Lord, If the
       pain, whatever its source, does not go, could You at least allow me
       to learn from it?

       e If someone asked you to give evidence of the resurrection of
       Christ, what would you say?



Summary: The power of the Resurrection not only convinces us that
      the story of Jesus is true; it convicts us of sin and provides the basis
      for a living and vibrant relationship with Jesus. There is nothing like
      the peace that comes from being totally committed to His will. There
      is nothing like the joy that comes when your conscience is clean.
      Christianity has lasted about two thousand years, because nothing can
      compare with the kind of life that comes when you have a living rela-
      tionship with Jesus Christ. It is possible to go through the motions and
      call it Christianity. But the real thing is the greatest. Why settle for I
      less?

Determined
to Succeed
by J. H. ZACHARY
   Dorina Mardare of Romania had decided when she was 14 that she
would become a leader in her town one day. Through hard work she even-
tually became mayor.
   When two of her sisters became Seventh-day Adventists, Dorina
opposed them and accused them of joining a cult. Then Dorina became ill
with chest pains. She grew weaker, and her family feared she would die.
Anna, one of her Adventist sisters, urged her to give her life to God before
it was too late. Anna said, "If you do not place your life in the hands of
Jesus, you are lost."
   Dorina was impressed by her sister's concern. "What do I have to do to
place myself in the hands of the Savior?" she asked.
   Anna shared the steps with her sister, and Dorina promised she would
pray—alone. But it took several days before Dorina could open her heart
to God. As she prayed she felt the presence of God with her. Joy filled her
heart, but she regretted the years she had spent away from God.
    Dorina returned home to care for her husband and daughter, both of
whom were not well.
   The next day two young people came to her home and invited her to
attend evangelistic meetings at Anna's church. Dorina decided to attend
the meetings and was impressed with the sound biblical positions to sup-
port the speaker's statements. She continued attending the meetings and
accepted the speaker's invitation to get to know Jesus better. She began
attending the Adventist church and joined a Bible class, but she was afraid
 to tell her husband of her decision to become an Adventist.
    When Dorina decided to surrender completely to Christ, the chest pains
 that had plagued her for years disappeared. This miracle impressed her
 husband, who encouraged her to follow her convictions.
    Dorina and her parents were baptized together. But when her younger
 sister was diagnosed with cancer, friends blamed the illness on the fam-
 ily's decision to become Adventists. Dorina and her family prayed for her
 sister, who gave her heart to Christ and was baptized shortly before her
 death.
    Dorina testifies that God has helped her through many difficulties and
 has answered her prayers and stood beside her when troubles threatened to
 overwhelm the family. She prays that soon God will bring her husband to
 the Lord.

2004 Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

        This quarter, we take a look at Isaiah, at his words, his times, his
      predicaments, but mostly at His God, the God who back then, as
      well as today, cries out to us, "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I
      have called thee by name; thou art mine" (Isa. 43:1). Roy E. Gane,
      author of this quarter's Bible Study Guide, called Isaiah: "Comfort
      My People," leads us in our exploration of the message of a prophet
      who still speaks so powerfully to us today.

    Of all the disciples, John seems to have responded most
fully to the love and deepest messages of Jesus. It is no sur-
prise, then, that of all the Gospels, many today respond most
powerfully to John's record of Christ's life. It was meant to
answer what may be the most crucial question of contempo-
rary Christian faith: How can I have a living relationship with
Someone I cannot see, hear, or touch?
