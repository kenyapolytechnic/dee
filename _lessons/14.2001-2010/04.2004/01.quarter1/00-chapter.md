                     many years, and this masterly product
                     of his pen stamps him as an authority
                     on the subject.

   PRAYER                        quiets the fears,
                                 subdues the pas-
                                 sions, conquers
habits, mollifies feelings, and is a general tonic
for health and happiness.
  Ever look at it in just that way?
  Of course it is more than that, as is brought
out in the new 300-page Fook

            "In Touch with God"
  With the aid of numerous personal experiences, William P.
Pearce, author and lecturer, beautifully tells of the advan-
tages of prayer, how to pray, causes for negligence in prayer,
why some prayers are unanswered, conditions to the answer
of our prayers, the curative power of prayer. In fact, the
whole subject of prayer is considered from every standpoint.
  Highly prized by all who have read it. '$1.00 postpaid.

                              Notes
    1. "There are different orders of angels. 'Cherubim'
 (Gen. 3:24) ; 'Seraphim' (Isa. 6: 2, 6). . . .
    "Some of their names are: 'Michael' -(Dan. 10: 13, 21;
12: 1; Jude 9) ; 'Gabriel' (Dan. 8: 16; 9:21; Luke 1: 19) ;
'Uriel' (2 Esdras [Apocrypha] 4: 1, 36; 5: 20. See 1 Chron.
15: 5) ; 'Ariel' (doubtless of angelic origin. See Ezra 8: 16).
    "Michael means, 'Who is like God,' and hence is a fit title
for Christ. Gabriel signifies, 'The strength of God,' an ap-
propriate name for the angel or being who stands next to
Christ (Dan. 10: 21). Uriel means, 'The light of God;' Ariel,
`The lion of God.' "—"Bible Readings for the Home Circle,"
 page 524.
    2. "Before the creation of man, angels were in existence;
for when the foundations of the earth were laid, the morn-
ing stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for
 joy.'"—"The Great Controversy," page 511.
    3. "Satan commenced his deception in Eden. He said to
Eve, 'Thou shalt not surely die.' This was Satan's first
lesson upon the immortality of the soul, and he has carried
on this deception from that time to the present, and will carry
it on until the captivity of God's children shall be turned. I
was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden. They partook of the
forbidden tree, and then the flaming sword was placed around
the tree of life, and they were driven from the garden, lest
they should partake of the tree of life, and be immortal
sinners. The fruit of this tree was to perpetuate immortality.
 I heard an angel ask, 'Who of the family of Adam have
passed that flaming sword, and have partaken of the tree of
life?' I heard another angel answer, 'Not one of the family
of Adam have passed that flaming sword, and partaken of
that tree; therefore there is not an immortal sinner.' The
soul that sinneth, it shall die an everlasting death,—a death
from which there will be no hope of a resurrection; and then
the wrath of God will be appeased."—"Early Writings,"
 page 218.
    4. The American Revised Version reads, "For our wres-
tling is not against flesh and blood, but against the prin-
 cipalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of
 this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in
the heavenly places."
    "The power and malice of Satan and his host might justly
 alarm us, were it not that we may find shelter and deliverance
in the superior power of our Redeemer. We carefully secure
 our houses with bolts and locks to protect our property and
 our lives from evil men; but we seldom think of the evil
 angels who are constantly seeking access to us, and against
 whose attacks we have, in our own strength, no method of
 defense. If permitted, they can distract our minds, disorder

8            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

and torment our bodies, destroy our possessions and our
lives. Their only delight is in misery and destruction. Fearful
is the condition of those who resist the divine claims, and
yield to Satan's temptations, until God gives them up to the
control of evil spirits. But those who follow Christ are ever
safe under His watchcare. Angels that excel in strength
are sent from heaven to protect them. The wicked one cannot
break through the guard which God has stationed about His
people."-"The Great Controversy," page 517.

                               Notes
     1. "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resem-
 blance and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image'
 of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God.
 His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind
 was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
 were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control
 of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of
 God, and in perfect obedience to His will.
      "As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he
 was of lofty stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance
 bore the ruddy tint of health, and glowed with the light of
 life and joy. Adam's height was much greater than that of
 men who now inhabit the earth. Eve was somewhat less in
  stature; yet her form was noble, and full of beauty. The
  sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed
  with a covering of light and glory, such as the angels wear.
• So long as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light
 continued to enshroud them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
  page 45.
      2. "From this scripture, it is plainly seen that there are
  spiritual beings with spiritual bodies—bodies unlike the ma-
  terial bodies we possess. Just as surely as there are earthly,
  or material bodies, just so surely are there spiritual bodies.
  `There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
  the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the ter-
  restrial is another.' It is sown a natural body; it is raised
  a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a
  spiritual body.' Man was created with a natural, or material
  body. He belongs to this earth; for he was made from the
  dust of the ground. But though man's eyes are holden 'from
  perceiving spiritual beings with his natural senses, still these
  are revealed to him through the Word of God and by the
  influence of the Holy Spirit."—"Ministry of Angels," page 35.
      3. When Jesus came into this world, He came as a man.
  He did not take "the nature of angels," but He took the nature
  of "the seed of Abraham." Jesus, then, was made "for a
  little while" lower than the angels. Read carefully Heb.
  2: 7, 9, 17, noting marginal readings of the verses.
      4. "Let us not forget that the promise is never given to
  man that he will at any time become an angel. We are as-
  sured, however, that in one respect we shall be made equal to
  the angels—we shall not be subject to death. Of those who
  are accounted worthy to have a part in the first resurrection,
10             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
Jesus Himself said, 'Neither can they die any more: for they
are equal unto the angels.' At that long desired and trium-
phant day, the saved of earth will be made 'equal unto the
angels.' Every longing of the heart will find complete satis-
faction. The fear of death will be banished; and they will
receive from the hand of God, through faith in Jesus Christ,
the priceless gift of immortal life."-Id., page 39.

        1 John 3: 2.
                             Notes
    1. "In this wonderful description, we obtain a glimpse of
how this earth and its people appear in the eyes of heaven.
In God's sight the earth is but as a grain of sand, the waters
He can measure in the hollow of. His hand, and all the in-
habitants of the earth are but as grasshoppers. Looking
up to the starry heavens, man can see with the naked eye
something of the magnitude of God's creation. He beholds,
and marvels—but his unaided eye cannot number those glit-
tering suns. Now let him bring to his aid the strongest
telescope and again gaze at some chosen spot in the heavens.
What myriads of worlds before unseen are visible! Could
he add to this telescope still greater magnifying power,
there would be revealed still other worlds,—worlds that have
been hidden from the gaze of man during all the ages past.
So great is the immensity of space into which we gaze, that
man has never found the end. By the aid of photography,
stars otherwise invisible have been distinguished; and as-
tronomers tell us there are 18,000,000 worlds in a single
system, and that the systems are beyond counting."—"Min-
istry of Angels," pages 42, 43.
    2. "This language leaves us in a state of uncertainty
concerning the precise number of the heavenly beings,—
`thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thou-
sand times ten thousand stood before Him.' We know that
`ten thousand times ten thousand' equals one hundred million,
but we can form no idea of the number represented by 'thou-
sands of thousands.' Nowhere in the Word of God is given
the exact number of the heavenly beings."—Id., page 46.
    3. "As night drew on, soldiers were stationed to guard
 the Saviour's resting place, while angels, unseen, hovered
 above the sacred spot. The night wore slowly away, and
 while it was yet dark, the watching angels knew that the
 time for the release of God's dear Son, their beloved Com-
 mander, had nearly come. As they were waiting with the
 deepest emotion the hour of His triumph, a mighty angel
 came flying swiftly from heaven. His face was like the
 lightning, and his garments white as snow. His light dis-
 persed the darkness from his track, and caused the evil
angels, who had triumphantly claimed the body of Jesus, to
 flee in terror from his brightness and glory. ,one of the
12           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
angelic host who had witnessed the scene of Christ's humilia-
tion, and was watching His resting place, joined the angel
from heaven, and together they came down to the sepulcher.
The earth trembled and shook as they approached, and there
was a great earthquake."-"Early Writings," page 181.
   4. The Son of God is the "Archangel." See 1 Thess. 4: 16.
To no other being is given this exalted title. The glory of
His presence surpasses that of the angels.

                            Notes               •
    1. "What a thrilling tale of deliverance from captivity
wrought by God through the agency of an angel! Where,
now, is the boasting of the proud, blasphemous monarch, who
defied the Lord of heaven, and said He was not able to de-
liver out of his hand? Before the Assyrians can shoot an
arrow or throw a javelin, the God of heaven sends an angel
to smite their sleeping hosts. In a single night, one hundred
eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib's warriors are slain, not
on the field of battle, but by this silent messenger from
heaven.
    "Was ever such victory won before, in the history of
nations?—a whole army gone down into the jaws of death,
not in battle, not on the field of campaign and strife,
but while they lay sleeping, dreaming perchance of the mor-
row, when they hoped to scale the walls of Jerusalem, and
satisfy their lust and appetite and greed in the plunder and
spoils of a conquered city. From a study of this record,
we must admit that the power of angels is limited only by
the work which God designs they shall accomplish."—"Min-
istry of Angels," page 59.
    2. Man has never attempted to measure the velocity of
anything traveling faster than light. Light travels 186,000
miles a second—more than seven times around the earth in
one second of time. Yet angels can travel faster than this.
Ezekiel wrote of their movement that they £'ran and returned
as the appearance of a flash of lightning." Men may move
about by train, automobile, or aeroplane, at the speed of
sixty, seventy-five, ninety, and even more, miles an hour.
 When we compare such movement to that of an angel, it is
as nothing. Faster than the telegraph message these heav-
enly messengers speed on their errands of ministry to man.
    3. "Here a messenger from heaven, standing before the
throne of God when Daniel began to pray, was commanded
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

to come to the prophet, and to give him skill and under-
standing concerning the revelations of Jehovah. While the
prayer was still on his lips, before he had closed his petition, a
messenger from the throne of God was at Daniel's side, an-
nouncing, 'At the beginning of thy supplications the com-
mandment came forth, and I am come to show thee.' Surely
one could not ask for a more speedy response to his suppli-
cation than this.
    "Notice the expression 'being caused to fly swiftly.' Our
Father knows the need of immediate help for His children,
and when the occasion demands, He causes His more than
lightning-swift messengers to quicken their flight. The
angel did not have to search from place to place in Babylon
to find Daniel. He did not have to look for him in the palace
of the king, or in the council halls of the wise men, or among
the throngs in the streets, but he came direct from the throne
of God to Daniel's side. No earthly monarch ever sent so
swift a messenger to bear tidings of good or ill as Jehovah
sent to this prophet in prayer. No heart of love, bound by
the strongest cords of devotion, ever yet sent so quick an
answer to the object of his affections as God sends through
His holy angels to those who trust in Him. For our Lord
is no respecter of persons; what He did for Daniel, He will
do for the humblest of His children who serve Him in sin-
cerity and offer their petitions to Him in faith."—Id., pages
65, 66.

                            Notes
  1. "I have seen the tender love that God has for His people,
and it is very great. I saw angels over the saints with their
wings spread about them. Each saint had an attending angel.
16         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

If the saints wept through discouragement, or were in danger,
the angels that ever attended them would fly quickly upward
to carry the tidings, and the angels in the city would cease
to sing. Then Jesus would commiosion another angel to
descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep then from
going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed
to the watchful care of these angels, and would not be com-
forted by them, but continued to go astray, the angels would
look sad and weep. They would bear the tidings upward,
and all the angels in the city would weep, and then with a
loud voice say, 'Amen.' But if the saints fixed their eyes
upon the prize before them, and glorified God by praising
Him, then the angels would bear the glad tidings to the
city, and the angels in the • city would touch their golden
harps and sing with a loud voice, 'Alleluia!' and the heavenly
archeS would ring with their lovely songs."—"Early Writ-
ings," page 39.
    2. " 'The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
that fear Him, and delivereth them;' God commissions His
angels to save His chosen ones from calamity, to guard them
from 'the pestilence that walketh in darkness,' and 'the de-
struction that wasteth at noonday.' Again and again have
angels talked with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and
led them to places of security. Again and again have the
encouraging words of angels renewed the drooping spirits
of the faithful, and carrying their minds above the things
of earth, caused them to behold by faith the white robes,
the crowns, the palm branches of victory, which overcomers
will receive when they surround the great white throne."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," page 153.
    3. "Between the servant of God and the hosts of armed
foemen was an encircling band of heavenly angels. They had
come down in mighty power, not to destroy, not to exact
homage,, but to encamp round about and minister to the
Lord's weak and helpless ones.
    "When the people of God are brought into strait places,
and apparently there is no escape for them, the Lord alone
must be their dependence."—"Prophets and Kings," page 257.
    4. "From ,the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn
that in seasons of trial and gloom, God's children should be
just what they were when their prospects were bright with
hope and their surroundings all that they could desire. Dan-
iel in the lions' den was the same Daniel who stood before
the king as chief among the ministers of state and as a
prophet of the Most High. A man whose heart is stayed
upon God will be the same in the hour of his greatest trial
as he is in prosperity, when the light and favor of God and
of man beam upon him. Faith reaches to ;the unseen, and
grasps eternal realities.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17
   "Heaven is very near those who suffer for righteousness'
sake. Christ identifies His interests with the interests of His
faithful people; He suffers in the person of His saints; and
whoever touches His chosen ones touches Him. The power
that is near to deliver from physical harm or distress is also
near to save from the greater evil, making it possible for the
servant of God to maintain his integrity under all circum-
stances, and to triumph through divine grace."—Id., page 545.
    5. "Said the angel, 'List ye!' Soon I heard a voice like
many musical instruments all sounding in perfect strains,
sweet and harmonious. It surpassed any music I had ever
heard, seeming to be full of mercy, compassion, and elevating,
holy joy. It thrilled through my whole being. Said the angel,
`Look ye!' My attention was then turned to the company I
had seen, who were mightily shaken. I was shown those
whom I had before seen weeping and praying in agony of
spirit. The company of guardian angels around them had
been doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from
their head to their feet. They moved in exact order, like a
company of soldiers. Their countenances expressed the
severe conflict which they had endured, the agonizing strug-
gle they had passed through. Yet their features, marked
with severe internal anguish, now shone with the light and
glory of heaven. They had obtained the victory, and it called
forth from them the deepest gratitude, and holy, sacred joy."

                            Notes
   1. "Many have a form of godliness, their names are upon
the church records, but they have a spotted record in heaven.
The recording angel has faithfully written their deeds. Every
selfish act, every wrong word, every unfulfilled duty, and
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   19
every secret sin, with every artful dissembling, is faithfully
chronicled in the book of records kept by the recording angel.'
—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 2, page 442.
    "I was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful
record of every offering dedicated to God, and put into
the treasury, and also of the final result of the means thus
bestowed. The eye of God takes cognizance of every farthing
devoted to His cause, and of the willingness or reluctance of
the giver. The motive in giving is also chronicled. Those
self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render back to God
the things that are His, as He requires of them, will be
rewarded according to their works. Even though the means
thus consecrated be misapplied, so that it does not accom-
plish the object which the donor had in view,—the glory of
God and the salvation of souls,—those who made the sacrifice
in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of God,
will not lose their reward."—Id., pages 518, 519.
    2. It is evident that angels are familiar with every de.
tail of our lives (Eccl. 5: 6; 10: 20; 1 Cor. 11: 10, A. R. V.),
and it is reasonable to believe that they are heavenly re-
corders. In each note of this lesson, quotations are given
from the spirit of prophecy, declaring that angels are keep-
ing these record books. In 1882, an important testimony
was sent to one of our denominational centers; the following
paragraph is taken from it:
    "A few weeks since, I was in a dream brought into one
of your meetings for investigation. I heard the testimonies
borne by students against Bro. —. Those very students
had received great benefit from his thorough, faithful in-
struction. Once they could hardly say enough in his praise.
Then it was popular to esteem him. But now the current
was setting the other way. These persons have developed
their true character. I saw an angel with a ponderous book
open, in which he wrote every testimony given. Opposite
each testimony were traced the sins, defects, and errors of
the one who bore it. Then there was recorded the great
benefit which these individuals had received from Bro. —'s
labors."—Id., volume 5, page 59.
    3. "It will pay, then, to improve the privileges within
our reach, and, even at some sacrifice, to assemble with those
who fear God and speak for Him; for He is represented as
hearkening to those testimonies, while angels write them
in a book. God will remember those who have met together
and thought upon His name, and He will spare them from the
great conflagration. They will be as precious jewels in His
sight; but His wrath will fall on the shelterless head of the
sinner."—Id., volume 4, page 107.
    4. "Some talk too much; they stand in this position, 'Re-
port, and we will report it.' Miserable indeed is such a po-
 20          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
  sition! If all these gossipers would ever bear in mind that
  an angel is following them, recording their words, there would
  be less talking and much more praying."—Id., volume 4,
   page 40.
       "You all have an influence for good or for evil on the
  minds and characters of others. And just the influence which
  you exert is written in the book of records in heaven. An
  angel is attending you, and taking record of your words and
  actions. When you rise in the morning, do you feel your
  helplessness, and your need of strength from God? and do
  you humbly, heartily. make known your wants to your heav-
  enly Father? If so, angels mark your prayers, and if these
  prayers have not gone forth out of feigned lips, when you
  are in danger of unconsciously doing wrong, and exerting an
  influence which will lead others to do wrong, your guardian
  angel will be by your side, prompting you to a better course,
  choosing your words for you, and influencing your actions."
  —Id., volume 3, pages 363, 364.
       5. "Words and actions and motives are recorded; but how
  little do these light, superficial heads and hard hearts realize
  that an angel of God stands writing down the manner in
  which their precious moments are employed. God will bring
  to light every word and every action. He is in every place.
  His messengers, although unseen, are visitors in the work-
  room and in the sleeping apartment. The hidden works of
''darkness will be brought to light. The thoughts, the intents
  and purposes of the heart, will stand revealed. All things
  are naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have
  to do."—Id., volume 4, pages 589, 590.
      6. "Every man's work passes in review before God, and
  is registered for faithfulness or unfaithfulness. Opposite
  each name in the books of heaven is entered, with terrible
  exactness, every wrong word, every selfish act, every unful-
  filled duty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissem-
  bling. Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted
  moments, unimproved opportunities, the influence exerted for
  good or for evil, with its far-reaching results, all are chron-
  icled by the recording angel."—"The Great Controversy,"
  page 482.

                          Notes
   1. "In the past, God has revealed to man many of His
plans and purposes. Again and again, in different ages, He
has spoken to men in various ways, through His Holy Spirit,
by vision, and by sending angels to bring His messages to
those through whom He would reveal His will. Almost from
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
the earliest records of God's dealings with His chosen people,
to the closing book in the Bible, we find that God has re-
peatedly spoken to His prophets and His people through the
agency of angels."—"Ministry of Angels," page 98.
    2. "In this instance a direct message from heaven was
given to Abraham through the agency of a heavenly being.
The angel spoke in a language Abraham understood, giving
him a message that greatly cheered his heart, and that re-
vealed to him God's acceptance of his sacrifice. When the
Lord had thus tested His servant, He also revealed His
purpose toward him and toward his seed."—/b.
    3. "The words of the angel, 'I am Gabriel, that stand in
the presence of God,' show that he holds a position of high
honor in the heavenly courts. When he came with a mes-
sage to Daniel, he said, 'There is none that holdeth with me
in these things, but Michael [Christ] your prince.' Of Ga-
briel the Saviour speaks, in the Revelation, saying that 'He
sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John.'
And to John the angel declared, 'I am a fellow servant with
thee, and with thy brethren the prophets.' Wonderful thought
—that the angel who stands next in honor to the Son of God,
is the one chosen to open the purposes of God to sinful men."
—"The Desire of Ages," pages 98, 99.
    4. "Christ sent and made known the Revelation to John
by 'His angel.' A particular angel seems here to be brought
to view. What angel could appropriately be called Christ's
angel? May we not find an answer to this question in a
significant passage in the prophecy of Daniel? In Dan. 10: 21,
an angel, which was doubtless Gabriel (see Daniel, chapters
9, 10, and 11: 1), in making known some important truths to
Daniel, said, 'There is none that holdeth with me in these
things, but Michael your prince.' Who Michael is, we easily
learn. Jude (verse 9) calls him the 'archangel.' And Paul
tells us that when the Lord descends from heaven, and the
dead in Christ are raised, the voice of the archangel shall be
heard. 1 Thess:.4: 16. And whose voice will be heard at that
amazing hour when the dead are called to life? The Lord
Himself replies, 'Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming
in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice'
 (John 5: 28) ; and the previous verse shows that the one
here referred to, whose voice will then be heard, is the Son
of man, or Christ: It is the voice of Christ, then, that calls
the dead from their graves. That voice, Paul declares, is the
voice of the archangel; and Jude says that the archangel is
called Michael, the very personage mentioned in Daniel, and
all referring to Christ. The statement in Daniel, then, is,
that the truths to be revealed to Daniel were committed to
Christ, and confined exclusively to Him, and to an angel
whose name was Gabriel. Similar to the work of communi-
               SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 23
eating important truth to the 'beloved prophet' is the work
of Christ in the Revelation of communicating important truth
to the 'beloved disciple'; and who, in this work, can be His
angel but he who was engaged with Him in the former work,
that is, the angel Gabriel?"-"Daniel and the Revelation."

had he not been rescued by the angels of God. The heavenly
messengers 'put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
house to them, and shut to the door.' The events that fol-
lowed, revealed the character of the guests he had enter-
tained."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 159.
     2. "We need to understand better than we do the mission
of the angels. It would be well to remember that every true
child of God has the cooperation of heavenly beings. Invis-
ible armies of light and power attend the meek and lowly
ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim
and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at
God's right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to min-
ister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts
of the Apostles," page 154.
     3. "Thus it is that Heaven ministers to man's needs.
These poor exiles were hopeless and friendless. No more
could they return to the abundance of Abraham's house.
Moreover, He to whom the future is as an open book, knew
that Ishmael would not choose to walk in the paths of right-
eousness; yet notwithstanding all this, He sent an angel from.
heaven to this sorrowing mother and her suffering child to
supply their needs.
    "In this dark world, there is many a mother whose heart
aches as did Hagar's; many a one who, like the outcast
Egyptian, knows not what to do. Often her heart is too full
for utterance. There may be no true human friend to whom
she can tell her sorrows, none from whom she may seek
counsel. In utter hopelessness, she may feel that life is too
bitter to be borne, and long for the time when she may rest
from her troubles. But there is not one such who may not
find comfort and help in God."—"Ministry of Angels," page
128.

                            Notes
    1. "Heaven is brought near to earth by that mystic ladder,
the base of which is firmly planted on the earth, while the
topmost rcund reaches the throne of the Infinite. Angels
are constantly ascending and descending this ladder of.shin-
ing brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy and dis-
tressed to the Father above, and bringing blessing and hope,.
courage and help, to the children of men. These angels of
light create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us
toward the unseen and the eternal. We cannot behold their
forms with our natural sight; only by spiritual vision can
we discern heavenly things. The spiritual ear alone can
hear the harmony of heavenly voices."-"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 153.
    2. "Again the Lord granted Jacob a token of the divine
care. As he traveled southward from Mount Gilead, two
hosts of heavenly angels seemed to encompass him behind
and before, advancing with his company, as if for their pro-
tection. Jacob remembered the vision at Bethel so long
before, and his burdened heart grew lighter at this evidence
that the divine messengers who. had brought him, hope and
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  27
 courage at his flight from Canaan, were to be the guardians
 of his return. And he said, 'This is God's host; and he
 called the name of that place Mahanaim'—`two hosts, or
 camps.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 195.
     3. "The struggle continued until near the break of day,
 when the stranger placed his finger upon Jacob's thigh, and
 he was crippled instantly. The patriarch now discerned the
 character of his antagonist. He knew that he had been in
 conflict with a heavenly messenger, and this was why his al-
 most superhuman effort had not gained the victory. It
 was Christ, 'the Angel of the covenant,' who had revealed
 Himself to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled, and
 suffering the keenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold.
-All penitent and broken, he clung to the Angel; 'he wept,
 and made supplication,' pleading for a blessing. He must
 have the assurance that his sin was pardoned. Physical
 pain was not sufficient to divert his mind from this object.
 His determination grew stronger, his faith more earnest and
 persevering, until the very last. The Angel tried to re-
 lease Himself; He urged, 'Let Me go, for the day breaketh;'
 but Jacob answered, 'I will not let Thee go, except Thou
 bless me.' Had this been a boastful, presumptuous confidence,
 Jacob would have been instantly destroyed; but his was the
 assurance of one who confesses his own unworthiness, yet
 trusts the faithfulness of a covenant-keeping God. . . .
     "While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another
 heavenly messenger was sent to Esau. In a dream, Esau
 beheld his brother for twenty years an exile from his father's
 house; he witnessed his grief at finding his mother dead; he
 saw him encompassed by the hosts of God. This dream was
 related by Esau to his soldiers, with the charge not to harm
 Jacob, for the God of his father was with him. . .
     "At sight of that crippled sufferer, 'Esau ran to meet
 him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him;
 and they wept.' As they looked upon the scene, even the
 hearts of Esau's rude soldiers were touched. Notwithstand-
 ing he had told them of his dream, they could not account
 for the change that had come over their captain. Though
 they beheld the patriarch's infirmity, they little thought that
 this his - weakness had been made his strength."—Id., pages
197, 198.
     4. "Into the experience of all there come times of keen
 disappointment and utter discouragement,—days when sorrow
 is the portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the
 kind benefactor of His earthborn children; days when troubles
 harass the soul, till death seems preferable to life. It is
 then that many lose their hold on God, and are brought into
 the slavery of doubt, the bondage of unbelief. Could we
 at such times discern with spiritual insight the meaning of
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

God's providences, we should see angels seeking to save
us from ourselves, striving to plant our feet upon a founda-
tion more firm than the everlasting hills; and new faith, new
life, would spring into being."—"Prophets and Kings," page
162.
    5. "As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
so in the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work
mightily in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the
right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery
furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His
abiding presence will comfort and sustain. In the midst of
the time of trouble,—trouble such as has not been since there
was a nation,—His chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan
with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God's
saints. Angels that excel in strength will, protect them, and
in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of
gods,' able to save to the uttermost those who have put their
trust in Him."—Id., page 513.

                            Notes                      •
   1. "The wise men had seen a mysterious light in the
heavens upon that night when the glory of God flooded the
hills of Bethlehem. As the light faded, a luminous star ap-
peared, and lingered in the sky. It was not a fixed star nor
a planet, and the phenomenon excited the keenest interest.
That star was a distant company of shining angels, but of
this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they were impressed
that the star was of special import to them."—"The Desire
of Ages," page 60.
    2. "After the foe had departed, Jesus fell exhausted to
the earth, with the pallor of death upon His face. The angels
of heaven had watched the conflict, beholding their loved Com-
mander as He passed through inexpressible suffering to
make a way of escape for us. He had endured the test,
greater than we shall ever be called to endure. The angels
now ministered to the Son of God, as He lay like one dying.
He was strengthened with food, comforted with the mes-
sage of His Father's love, and the assurance that all heaven
triumphed in His victory."—Id., page 181.
    3. "Some were casting stones at Him, when suddenly He
disappeared from among them. The heavenly messengers
who had been by His side in the synagogue were with Him
in the midst of that maddened throng. They shut Him in
from His enemies, and conducted Him to a place of safety."
—Id., page 240.
   4. "The worlds unfallen and the heavenly angels had
watched with intense interest as the conflict drew to its
close. Satan and his confederacy of evil, the legions of
apostasy, watched intently this great crisis in • the work of
redemption. The powers of good and evil waited to see what
answer would come to Christ's thrice-repeated prayer. Angels
had longed to bring relief to the divine sufferer, but
this might not be. No way of escape was found for the
Son of God. In this awful crisis, when everything was at
stake, when the mysterious cup trembled in the hand of the
sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone forth amid the
stormy darkness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel
who stands in God's presence, occupying the position from
which Satan fell, came to the side of Christ. The angel came
not to take the cup from Christ's hand, but to strengthen
Him to drink it, with the assurance of the Father's love. He
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 31
came to give power to the divine-human suppliant. He
pointed Him to the open heavens, telling Him of the souls
that would be saved as the result of His sufferings. He as-
sured Him that His Father is greater and more powerful
than Satan, that His death would result in the utter discom-
fiture of Satan, and that the kingdom of this world would
be given to the saints of the Most High. He told Him that
He would see of the travail of His soul, and be satisfied, for
He would see a multitude of the human race saved, eternally
saved."—Id., pages 693, 694.
    5. `•`No traces of His recent agony were visible as Jesus
stepped forth to meet His betrayer. Standing in advance of
His disciples He said, 'Whom seek ye?' They answered, 'Jesus
of Nazareth.' Jesus replied, 'I am He.' As these words were
spoken, the angel who had lately ministered to Jesus, moved
between Him and the mob.. A divine light illuminated the
Saviour's face, and ,a dovelike form overshadowed Him.. In
the presence of this divine glory, the murderous throng could
not stand for a moment. They staggered back. Priests,
elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to the
ground."—/d., page 694.
    6. "Jesus bade him put up the sword, saying, `Thinkest
thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall
presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?' I
saw that as these words were spoken, the countenances of
the angels were animated with hope. They wished then and
there to surround their Commander, and disperse that angry
mob. But again sadness settled upon them, as Jesus added,
`But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
must be?' The hearts of the disciples also sunk in despair
and bitter disappointment, as Jesus suffered Himself to be led
away by His enemies.
    "The disciples feared for their own lives, and they all
forsook Him and fled. Jesus was left alone in the hands of
the murderous mob. Oh, what a triumph of Satan then!
And what sadness and sorrow with the angels of God! Many
companies of holy angels, each with a tall commanding angel
at their head, were sent to witness the scene. They were to
record every insult and cruelty imposed upon the Son of God,
and to register every pang of anguish which Jesus should
suffer; for the very men who joined in this dreadful scene
are to see it all again in living characters."—"Early Writ-
ings," page 168.
    7. "From the first, Pilate was convicted that Jesus was
no common man. He believed Him to be an excellent char-
acter, and entirely innocent of the charges brought against
Him. The angels who were witnessing the scene marked
the convictions of the Roman governor, and to save him from.
engaging in the awful act of delivering Christ to be crucified,
an angel was sent to Pilate's wife, and gave her information
32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
through a dream that it was the Son of God in whose trial
her husband was engaged, and that He was an innocent suf-
ferer. She immediately sent a message to Pilate, stating
that she had suffered many things in a dream on account of
Jesus, and warning him to have nothing to do with that
holy man."—Id., page 173.
    8. "As He passed upward, the awe-stricken disciples
looked with straining eyes for the last glimpse of their as-
cending Lord. A cloud of glory hid Him from their sight;
and the words came back to them as the cloudy chariot of
angels received Him, `Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
end of the world.' At the same time there floated down to
them the sweetest and most joyous music from the angel
choir."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 830, 831.
    9. "These angels were of the company that had been
waiting in a shining cloud to escort Jesus to His heavenly
throne. The most exalted of the angel throng, they were
the two who had come to the tomb at Christ's resurrection,
and they had been with Him throughout His life on earth.
With eager desire all heaven had waited for the end of His
tarrying in a world marred by the curse of sin. The time
had now come for the heavenly universe to receive their King.
Did not the two angels long to join the throng that welcomed
Jesus? But in sympathy and love for those whom He had
left, they waited to give them comfort. 'Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation?' "—Id., pages 831, 832.
   10. "Heaven and earth are no wider apart to-day than when
shepherds listened to the angels' song. Humanity is still
as much the object of heaven's solicitude as when common
men of common occupations met angels at noonday, and
talked with the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and
the fields. To us in the common walks of life, heaven may
be very near. Angels from the courts above will attend
the steps of those who come and go at God's command."—Id.,
page 48.
    "From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been
preserved through the interposition of the angels, we shall
never know, until in the light of eternity we see the provi-
dences of God. Then we shall know that the whole family of
heaven was interested in the family here below, and that
messengers from the throne of God attended our steps from
day to day."—Id., page 240.

13. In what way is this experience of Peter and Cornelius

                            Notes
   1. "This Ethiopian was a man of good standing and of
wide influence. God saw that when converted, he would give
others the light he had received, and would exert a strong
influence in favor of the gospel. Angels of God were attend-
34         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ing this seeker for light, and he was being drawn to the
Saviour. By the ministration of the Holy Spirit, the Lord
brought him into touch with one who could lead him to the
light."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 107.
    2. "This Ethiopian represents a large class who need to
be taught by such missionaries as Philip,—men who will hear
the voice of God, and go where He sends them. There are
many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot understand
their true import. All over the world men and women are
looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries
go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy
Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only
to be gathered in.
    "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for
light, and who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day
angels will guide the footsteps of those workers who will
allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and refine and
ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to Philip could himself
have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is not God's
way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for
their fellow men."—Id., page 109.
    3. "Interesting indeed are these minute directions of the
angel. He knew Simon, knew his surname, knew where he
was, the name of the city in which he was stopping, the man
at whose house he was lodging, his name, and the street in
which he lived. Such intimate knowledge shows that angelic
beings know all about man. They know his lying down and
his rising up, his faithfulness or negligence, his zeal and
earnestness, his lukewarmness and barrenness of soul; they
are messengers of Him who knows even man's very thoughts
afar off."—"Ministry of Angels," page 182.
    4. "The angel, after his interview with Cornelius, went to
Peter, in Jappa."—"The Acts of the Apostles," page 135.
    5. "Because Cornelius was living in obedience to all the
instructions he had received, God so ordered events that he
was given more truth. A messenger from the courts of
heaven was sent to the Roman officer and to Peter, in order
that Cornelius might be brought into touch with one who
could lead him into greater light.
    "There are in our world many who are nearer the king-
dom of God than we suppose. In this dark world of sin, the
Lord has many precious jewels, to whom He will guide His
messengers. Everywhere there are those who will take their
stand for Christ. Many will prize the wisdom of God above
any earthly advantage, and will become faithful light-bearers.
Constrained by the love of Christ, they will constrain others
to come to Him."—Id., pages 140, 141.
    "Heavenly intelligences are waiting to cooperate with
human instrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                35
what human beings may become, and what, through their
influence, they may accomplish for the saving of souls that
are ready to perish."-"Testimonies for the Church," volume
9, page 30.
    "Heavenly angels have long been waiting for human
agents-the members of the church-to cooperate with them
in the great work to be done. They are waiting for you.
So vast is the field, so comprehensive the design, that every
sanctified heart will be pressed into service as an instrument
of divine power."-Id., pages 46, 47.

        Note 6.
                              Notes
    1. "The angels of glory find their joy in giving,—giving
love and tireless watchcare to souls that are fallen and un-
holy. Heavenly beings woo the hearts of men; they bring
to this dark world light from the courts above; by gentle
and patient ministry they move upon the human spirit, to
bring the lost into a fellowship with Christ which is even
closer than they themselves can know."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 21.
    "In this work all the angels of heaven are ready to co-
operate. All the resources of heaven are at the command of
those who are seeking to save the lost. Angels will help
you to reach the most careless and the most hardened. And
when one is brought back to God, all heaven is made glad;
seraphs and cherubs touch their golden harps, and sing
praises to God and the Lamb for their mercy and loving-
kindness to the children of men."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 page 197.
    2. "These angels are evidently symbolic; for the work
assigned them is that of preaching the everlasting gospel to
the people. But the preaching of the gospel has not been in-
trusted to literal angels; it has been committed to men, who
are responsible for this sacred trust placed in their hands.
Each of these three angels, therefore, symbolizes a body of
religious teachers, who are commissioned to make known to
their fellow men the special truths which constitute the
burden of these messages respectively.
    "But we are to consider further that angels, literally, are
intensely interested in the work of grace among men, being
sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of sal-
vation. And as there is order in all the movements and ap-
pointments of the heavenly world, it may not be fanciful to
suppose that a literal angel has charge and oversight of the
work of each message."—"Daniel and the Revelation."
    3. "I saw four angels who had a work to do on the earth,
and were on their way to accomplish it. Jesus was clothed
with priestly garments. He gazed in pity on the remnant,
then raised His hands, and with a voice of deep pity cried,
`My blood, Father, My blood, My blood, My blood!' Then I
saw an exceeding bright light come from God, who sat upon
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    37
the great white throne, and was shed all about Jesus. Then
I saw an angel with a commission from Jesus, swiftly flying
to the four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and
waving something up and down in his hand, and crying with
a loud voice, 'Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold! until the servants
of God are sealed in their foreheads.'
    "I asked my accompanying angel the meaning of what
I heard, and what the four angels were about to do. He
said to me that it was God that restrained the powers, and
that He gave His angels charge over things on the earth;
that the four angels had power from God to hold the four
winds, and that they were about to let them go; but while
their hands were loosening, and the four winds were about
to blow, the merciful eye of Jesus gazed on the remnant that
were not sealed, and He raised His hands to the Father, and
pleaded with Him that He had spilled His blood for them.
Then another angel was commissioned to fly swiftly to the
four angels, and bid them hold, until the servants of God
were sealed with the seal of the living God in their fore-
heads."—"Early Writings," page 38.
    4. "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, de-
scending to the earth, and again ascending to heaven, pre-
paring for the fulfillment of some important event. Then I
saw another mighty angel commissioned to descend to the
earth, to unite his voice with the third angel, and give power
and force to his message. Great power and glory were im-
parted to the angel, and as he descended, the earth was light-
ened with his glory. . . .
    "Angels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven,
and I heard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, 'Come
out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,
and that ye receive not of her plagues; for her sins have
reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniqui-
ties.' "—Id., page 277.
    5. An angel has never failed to do a work given him of
God. The Bible records no instance of an angel unable to
Perform a mission given him by High Heaven. On one oc-
casion, a king "withstood" an angel for three weeks, and
Michael Himself (Christ) "came to help" the angel. Dan.
10: 12, 13. When a work is given to a heavenly angel, it will
be done, even if all heaven has to join him to do it. The
angel with the inkhorn will finish his work. The third angel's
message movement cannot fail; it is in charge of an angel.
    "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel
with a writer's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth,
and reported to Jesus that his work was done, and the
saints were numbered and sealed. Then I saw Jesus, who
had been ministering before the ark containing the Ten
Commandments, throw down the censer. He raised His
hands, and with a loud voice said, 'It is dor.e.' "—Id., page 279.
38         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    6. "When He [Jesus] leaves the sanctuary, darkness
covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time
the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an
intercessor. The restraint which has been upon the wicked
is removed, and Satan has entire control of the finally im-
penitent. God's long-suffering has ended. The world has re-
jected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled upon His
law. The wicked have passed the boundary of their proba-
tion; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at
last withdrawn. Unsheltered by divine grace, they have no
protection from the wicked one. Satan will then plunge the
inhabitants of the earth into one great, final trouble. As
the angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of
human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose.
The whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than
that which came upon Jerusalem of old."—"The Great Con-
troversy," page 614.

                            Notes
   1. "The living righteous are changed 'in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye.' At the voice of God they were
glorified; now they are made immortal, and with the risen
saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the air. Angels
40          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 `gather together the elect from the four winds, from one
 end of heaven to the other.' Little children are borne by
 holy angels to their mothers' arms. Friends long separated
 by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs of
gladness ascend together to the city of God."—"The Great
Controversy," page 645.
    2. "On each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and
beneath it are living wheels; and as the chariot rolls upward,
the wheels cry, 'Holy,' and the wings, as they move, cry,
`Holy,' and the retinue of angels cry, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God Almighty.' And the redeemed shout 'Alleluia!' as the
chariot moves onward toward the New Jerusalem."—Ib.
    3. "But suddenly a terrible change came over him. His
face became pallid as death, and distorted with agony. Great
drops of sweat started from his pores. He stood for a mo-
ment as if transfixed with pain and terror; then turning his
blanched and livid face to his horror-stricken friends, he
cried in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you have exalted
as a god is stricken with death.. .
    "The same angel who had come from the royal courts to
rescue Peter, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment
to Herod. The angel smote Peter to arouse him from slum-
ber: it was with a different stroke that he smote the wicked
king, laying low his pride, and bringing upon him the pun-
ishment of the Almighty. Herod died in great agony of mind
and body, under the retributive judgment of God."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 151, 152.
    4. Heavenly angels are both ministers of mercy and mes-
sengers of wrath. In the final harvest of earth, they will
both reap the saved of the ages for the garner of God and
gather the tares to be burned. Blessed is the man who may
be smitten by an angel as was Peter (Acts 12: 7) rather
than be smitten as was Herod (Acts 12: 23).
    5. "Then I saw a very great number of angels bring from
the city glorious crowns,—a crown for every saint, with his
name written thereon. As Jesus called for the crowns, angels
presented them to Him, and with His own right hand the
lovely Jesus placed the crowns on the heads of the saints.
In the same manner the angels brought the harps, and Jesus
presented them also to the saints. The commanding angels
first struck the note, and then every voice was raised in grate-
ful, happy praise, and every hand skillfully swept over the
strings of the harp, sending forth melodious music in rich
and perfect strains."—"Early Writings," page 288.
