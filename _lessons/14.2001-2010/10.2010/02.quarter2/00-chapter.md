                              NOTES.
   To those acquainted with the Old Testament Scriptures the
basis of the instruction in this parable was perfectly' famil-
iar. A fruit tree existed simply for the purpose of bearing
fruit, and when it failed repeatedly to do this, it was not 10
be permitted to draw life out of the earth merely to keep
itself alive. This was the gospel of the fruit tree, and it had
been frequently interpreted to the people. The cause of bar-
renness was to be found in sin (Ps. 107:33, 34), while right-
eousness was the basis of fruitfulness (Ps. 92:12-15), which
would continue even "in old age." The truth had been set
forth that delight in the law of the Lord would result in
bringing forth fruit (Ps. 1:1-3), and the Messiah's work in
imparting to His people "the law of the Spirit of life" would
make them "trees of righteousness" (Isa. 61:1-3).
  The rejection of the Messiah and His work of grace re-
sulted in the loss of the kingdom of God, which was given
"Lo a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." They thus
lost the opportunity of giving to the world the gospel of the
kingdom.
  The tree which did not "cease from yielding fruit" was
constantly proclaiming the experience of "the man that.
trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is." Jer.
17:7, 8, In the light of these interpretations, those who
heard the parable of the unfruitful tree had no difficulty in
making a right application of its meaning. With the further
light from the teaching of Jesns (Matt: 7:19; John 15:2-5), -
we ought to be able to make a close personal a.pplica•tion of
this lesson (2 Peter 1:5-8), and bring forth "fruit worthy of
repentance." Read Luke 13:1-5, which gives the circum-
stances which led to this parable, and then read Rev. 3:14-19, "
and note the earnest call to repentance. This parable is pres-
ent truth.

  LESSON IL-THE PARABLE OF THE GREAT
                 SUPPER.
                    Lesson Scripture.—Luke 14: 12-20.

than the privilege of being present at the feast?

  15. Whose influence held the third one back from respond-
ing to the final call?
                                NOTES.
  It is evident that this parable deals with the final call to
the gospel feast of those who had previously been invited;
and of the way in which they treated this call. The sug-
gested future happiness of those who should "eat bread in
the kingdom of God" led to this instruction and furnishes

"Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white already to
                              harvest."
6            LESSONS ON THE PARABLE'S OF JESUS.

a simple basis for understanding its meaning. The Lord
rained "bread from heaven" for His people (Ex. 16:4), that
they might learn that feeding upon His Word was the real
means of sustaining life. Dent. 8:3. On this basis the gospel.
invitation had beer, sounded through the prophet Isaiah (Isa..
55:1-3), with the promise of "the sure mercies of David."
This was the promise of eternal life through faith in Christ
(Ps. 89:28, 29), who was "born of the seed of David, accord-
ing to the flesh."
  When the Word "became flesh, and dwelt among us," He
said: "The bread of God is He which cometh down from
heaven, and givefh life to the world. . . . I am the living
bread which came down from heaven; if any man eat of this
bread, he shall live forever." John 6:33, 51. Thus it is evi-
dent that when "they did all eat the same spiritual food,"
they were feeding• upon Christ, just as "they drank of that
spiritual Rock that went with them; and that Rock was
Christ," 1 Cor. 10:4. And so the provision for the gospel
feast is Christ Himself,. who has been given for us and to
     The eating of this "bread of life" is not to be deferred
until the setting up of the kingdom of God, but the call to
the feast must be heeded here or that future happiness will
never be realized. This is the emphatic teaching of this
parable.
  Those who were bidden to the feast were so much occupied
with various temporal matters that they treated as of trifling
importance the final call of the host. What a true picture
of the present danger! Luke 21:34. No earthly possession
or earthly tie should be allowed to keep us away from
Christ (Luke 14:33; Matt.. 19:29), and the most diligent at-
tention to worldly interests will not be a valid excuse for
neglecting the gospel call. Read Luke 10:38-42.

  LESSON HL—THE PARABLE OF THE GREAT
           SUPPER (Continued).

  1. How did the servant deal with. these excuses?
  2. What effect did they have upon the master of the house•?
  3. Where did he tell the servant to go next?
  4. 'What classes of persons were to be brought in?
  5. What report did the servant then make?
  G. Where did his lord then send him?
     How urgent was to be the invitation?
  S. What result was expected?
  9. What declaration was made concerning the guests first
invited?
                            NOTES.
  Those who refused the last call, "Come; for all things are
now ready," were left to their own choice, but the feast was
not thus deprived of its guests. Those whose outward cir-
cumstances caused them to be despised by the world, and_
those hidden from the observation of men, were most ur-
gently invited, and they responded to the call. Thus it often
happens that the very blessings bestowed upon men as a
n.ieans of drawing them to the Lord are turned by them into
a hindrance to spiritual life, while the absence of temporal
comforts leads to a greater readiness to receive the "un-
speakable gift." The rejection of thd gospel call by those
first invited, and the turning to others with the same in-
vitation, foreshadowed the giving of the gospel to the Gen-
files, and is the distinct call to us to send the last message
"to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."
  The whole Bible is an invitation to come to the Lord for
salvation. This was the Lord's call to Noah (Gen. 7:1); it
was His invitation through Isaiah (Isa.. 55:1); Jesus Himself
repeated it (Matt. 11:28); a•nd among the closing words of

S              LESSONS ON THE PARABLES OP JESUS.

 the Bible the call is thrice repeated (Rev. 22:17). On the
 other hand, the whole message of the Bible is concerning
 the coming of Christ to and for His people. The symbolic
 service foreshadowed it, the prophets foretold it, John the
 Baptist gave the message of His first coming (Luke 1:76),
 and his work finds its full completion in the last message
 before the second coming. And so the call to-day, "Come;
 for all things are now ready," is a call to prepare for the
 second coming of Christ and the marriage supper of the
 Lamb. By the winning power of love this message. is to go
 forth to the world in this generation, to compel men to re-
 ceive the gift of God's grace, to "eat the flesh of the Son of
 man, and drink His blood," that they may live forever.
 Through the neighborly ministry of the medical missionary
 work this message is to go to the suffering and the needy,
 and so, through the right use of all of God's appointed.
, agencies, all classes are to be reached and the day of the
 Lord is to he hastened. Read Isa. 26:20, 21, and Rev. 22:20,
 for a combination of the Lord's call and our response.

  The allegory, in which natural objects or people are rep-
resented as acting or talking, often in a manner that would
be impossible in actual life, was a familiar means of illustra-
tion in olden times, and is here used to point the warning
against selfish living. Let not the purpose of the allegory be
missed by turning the lesson into a discussion of the state
of the dead. At most a few references only will be needed
in case any are not familiar with the Bible teaching on this
subject, as, for instance, man's condition in death (Eccl.
9:6, 6; John 11:11, 14); when the dead will be awakened (Job
14:12; John 5:28, 29); when only the righteous and the wicked
will in fact view one anther's reward (Revs 20:5, 7, 10).

                                 NOTE.
  By reading carefully the last fifteen verses of Matthew 20,
the event, which led up to this parable is made very plain.
A rich young man, coming to Jesus, had been told, "If thou
wilt be perfect, go and sell
                           - that thou hest, and give to the
poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come
and follow Me." The disciples were amazed at Jesus' com-
ments concerning the rich, as they had been taught to look
upon this class as favorites of heaven.
  Peter immediately connected the action of the young man
and Christ's words with their experience as disciples, and
asked what they, who had forsaken all and followed Him,
were to receive.
  After a promise which breathes hope to every true disciple,
Joins illustrates by the parable of the laborers in the vine-
 and the true motive that should prompt all sacrifice. The
reward is not of works, but of grace. "To him that worketh
not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness." nom. 4:5. "Not by
works of righteousness which we have done, but according
to His mercy He saved us." Titus 3:5.




       The offerings for this quarter go to the most neLoy fields.

Ghe HOME
         We are planning on making the Home
 Department of the Sign, of the Times fot the next
 yea• just as practical, helpful, and interesting as
 possible. We are securing many original articles
 from men and women of wide experience in differ-
 ent phases of the world's work, some of which
 are as follows:—
        Under the general heading of "Plain Talks.
 on Health and Hygiene" there will be given the
 value of different baths, simplicity in diet, the
 evils of such bad habits as hasty eating, hot foods,
 soda and seasoning, drinking at meals, tea, coffee,
 and tobacco using.
         Practical suggestions will be given on venti-
 lation, while the blessings of sunshine, pure water,
 pure rood, and the hygiene of hopefulness will all
 receive due attention.
        Talks to the father, to the mother, to the
 parents, co ale boys, to the girls, and to the family,
 will be features in which our readers will be much
 interested. Ocher writers will speak of economy
 in the home, beauty and simplicity in the home,
 and the sate of children There will also be the
 usual number of unusually good stories.
       Sample copies will be sent free to those
 asking for them. .

A Boon to the Isolated
  Missionary Woriter
              And a Help to All




     Hereafter the isolated missionary worker and
the small church will be supplied with the Signs
at the same price as the largest church. That rate
is seventy cents per copy in clubs of five or more.
     This is an important change, and certainly one
which will appeal to thousand's of our brethren and
sisters who can not secure papers through a large
club, and can not afford to subscribe for a few copies
at the rates which have been in force heretofore.
     It will also recommend itself to members of
large churches who take five or more copies through
their church clubs, inasmuch as they may now receive
them direct from this office. It is true the rate on
these large clubs will be slightly increased, but the
greater convenience of a personal club, and the knowl-
edge of the fact that their small financial loss is the
gain of the isolated member, will outweigh the in-
creased expense.

                   Another Aid

    From any one who is taking a club of five papers,
we will accept single additional subscriptions at the
rate of 83 cents per year. in other words we will
charge only the club rate of 70 cents per year plus
the cost of sending out such single subscriptions sep-
arately, which is one-fourth cent each, or 25 cents
per hundred. This offer will greatly help those who
are engaged in missionary correspondence, who only
wish papers sent to individuals a month or six weeks.
Often the person to whom such papers are sent, if
written to with the first copy, will either write his
appreciation of the paper or refuse to accept it within
that time, in which case it may be changed to another
name without additional cost.
     Then again, there are many churches that would
gladly use larger clubs if they did not have to pay
a cent a copy postage. If such will send in lists of
names to which they, wish papers sent, we will
address, wrap, and mail such papers for 25 cents
extra per hundred, or will furnish the papers and
send them out for $z .6o per hundred.
     To make this missionary feature as helpful and
practical as possible, we have secured the services of
an experienced man in tract and missionary work,
a man in fact who has been laboring in. a state tract
society office for eight years, to take the immediate
charge of all such lists of names and to make any
suggestions to those sending them, which, according
to his experience, would be most helpful. He will
see that the papers are neatly addressed, carefully
wrapped, and promptly mailed each week. Where
sample copies are ordered out, he will have each
marked "Sample Copy," and will attend to all other
technicalities required by the post-office authorities.
All these attentions to details will greatly help the
appearance of the papers and add much to their influ-
ence. Thus we will attend to sending out the papers,
and the worker will attend to the correspondence.
                 Special Terms
     We have not changed our special terms to those
taking less than five papers. They are as follows:
    One new yearly subscription and one renewal,
or two new yearly subscriptions, sent at one time,
$2.50.
     Two new yearly subscriptions and one renewal,
or three new yearly subscriptions, sent at one
time, $3.25.
     Three new yearly subscriptions and one renewal,
or four new yearly subscriptions, sent at one
time, $4.00.
                 Special Agents
    We have a class of agents who are selling one
hundred or more copies of the Signs weekly, from
house to house. The results of such work have
been most excellent, and to encourage it all we can
we have made a special rate of $1.00 per hundred.
This is allowed only where one hundred or more are
taken weekly, however. This rate will be continued.
                  Co=operation
     It is our desire to co-operate with those in the
field, hence the foregoing plans. They will add
much to our work here, but this we will look upon
as our part, and will be done to the very best of our
ability. Write to -as.
