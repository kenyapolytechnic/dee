4            OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

(3) as Judge; (4) as King. The Spirit of God rested
upon him at the time of his baptism (John 1 :33); the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and
might and knowledge, was manifested repeatedly in his
marvelous teaching, in his knowledge of men's hearts, in
his replies to his adversaries, in his speaking the dead
to life, and the stormy sea to a calm (see Luke 4:22;
Matt. 13:54; 7:28, 29; Luke 20 : 26, 40; John 11:43, 44;
Mark 4: 39); and his fear of the Lord was shown in
that he, as our Example, kept his Father's command-
ments (John 5:30; 12:49, 50; 15:10). Between his first
and second advent Christ is a kingly priest upon his

4.26; Isa. 54:5; 62:4. Here the people of God have
been pilgrims and strangers, they have seen earth's fair-
est, strongest cities fall and perish, and the brighest
glories of earth fade away; no wonder, then, that they
look and long for the haven of rest, where, in the pres-
ence of Father and Redeemer, they will " delight them-
selves in the abundance of peace," in that city which
continueth ever. Note the contrast between the "strong
cif}, " of God and the "lofty city" of men mentioned in

Rev. 21: 9, 1o; Gal. 4: 26; Isa. 54:5.

       18. What will be the heart longings of those
    who are looking for Christ's coming? Isa. 26:8, 9.
•     NOTE.—This Scripture lesson fixes the time of this song
    of ,salvation in connection with the coming of Christ-.
    The characteristics of the people who will be saved at
    that time are thus expressed: " Here is the patience cf
    the saints; here are they that keep the commandments
    of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14: 12. Ow.: .)f
    God's commandments, namely, the fourth, presents tit.
    name, title, and extent of the authority of the Giver of
    law. The Psalmist (111:4) says. that God has "marls
    his wonderful worts to be remembered." The fourth
    commandment and other scriptures show that God ha.-.3
    given, as the memorial of his wonderful works, the holy
    Sabbath. His faithful people will remember this in the
    last days, and, therefore, in this time of trouble, while.
    longing for his coining, will sing: " Yea,. in the way o(
    thy judgments ["highway of thy commandments," Spur-
    rell], 0 Lord, have we waited for thee; the desire of out

    rial," Rev. Ver.] of thee."

8                OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.


21. How do God's judgments and favor affect
men? Isa. 26: 9 (last clause), and verse ro.
  NOTE.—It is ever true that the man who is willing, or
wills, to do God's will, will be brought to see it. The
goodness of God or the judgments of God will bring him
to his senses and to repentance; but he whose heart is to
do evil, will do evil still. Like Pharaoh, he will harden
his heart under God's judgments, or, like Judas, under
God's favor. Others will be brought to repentance un-
der God's mercy, like Peter, or under his judgments, like
Manasseh. Whichever it may be that comes to us,
whether prosperity or calamity, God desires that we
shall learn of him righteousness and truth.

    6. How did God regard him? 2 Kings 18:7,

  NOTE.—Hezekiah seems to have been at least out-
wardly friendly to Shalmanezer and Sargon, successors

ordinate power. His faith had not yet reached the point
of relying on God alone.
   8. What did Hezekiah do when he thought
himself strong? 2 Kings 18:7, last clause.
  NOTE. —Rawlinson points out that at the time of Sen.•
nacherib's accession to the throne nearly all of the king-
doms south and west of Assyria, which had been tribu-
tary to that empire, were in open revolt, and Hezekiah
seized upon such a time to declare Judah free. He was
at this time, however, forced to yield, for he trusted in
his own strength and the strength of allied powers, in-
stead of resting wholly upon God. See 2 Chron. 32:1--S
and Isaiah 20 Se also on Hezekiah in " Kings of IsraA
and Judah," by Rawlinson.

he had no faith whatever in Jehovah? Isa. 36:14,

of God, but he reproached and blasphemed Jehovah by
classing him with the gods of the heathen.
  14. How did this boastful chief, with his mighty
army, affect Hezekiah? Ans. —Hezekiah humbled

omnipotence; (2) to God's honor, which had been in-
sulted; (3) he admitted the truth of all Sennacherib's vic-
tories, but e alted God above him; (4) and, lastly, he
pleads God's mercy to his people, and asks that the sal-
vation granted may be such that all the nations of earth
might know that Jehovah was God alone.
  19. What answer did the Lord through his
prophet give Hezekiah? Verses 21-35
  NOTE.— He assured the king of Assyria that the virgin
daughter of Zion laugh d him to scorn; that as he had
blasphemed the Holy One of Israel and reproached the
             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

Lord, in whose power was all nations, so would God over-
come Assyria, and lead him back as a man would a beast,
with a hook in the nose; and that the Lord would defend
Jerusalem for his own sake.
  20. How did the Lord fight for his people? and
what became of this proud king? Verses 36-38.
  21. Why did God thus come to the help of Heze-
kiah? Verse 21.
  22. What promise has God made to all that call
upon him in trouble? See golden text and Ps.
107 : 17-21.

    THE SUFFERING SAVIOUR.—ISAIAH. 53.
                  (MEMORY VERSES, 3-5,)
 GOLDEN TEXT:   " He   hath laid on him the inquity of us all." Isa.

   NOTE.—The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah is a prophecy
of Christ from the standpoint of the Christian dispensa-
tion, •with his glory and kingdom yet future. The tense
of the verbs in the Revised Version, as well as the mat-
ter itself, makes this clear.
    I. IN contemplating the people who slew Christ
and the wonderful message of the gospel which
centers in his person, what question were his serv-
ants constrained to ask? Isa. 53:1; see also Rom.
10: 16; John 12:37, 38.
    2. What does the prophet say of Christ's person
as he was manifest among men? Vers e 2.
  NOTE.— This statement does not mean that Christ's ap-
 pearance was repulsive. They expected a monarch
 whose glory and splendor outshone that of Solomon, but
 Christ's appearance was such that they could not natu-
 rally expect anything from him. They desired the beauty
14           OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

o: worldly glory; they did not find in him what they de
sired. His birth was also lowly, as a root out of dry
ground.

    4. How did the prophet say that men would re-
 gard this man of sorrows? Isa. 53:3.

also John- 6:66; Matt. 26:56.
. 6. By whose afflictions was he made sorrowful?
 Isa. 53:4, first part. See Heb. 4:15; John 11 35,

the Revised Version translated " sickness ' and " sick-
nesses."
   7. Yet what did these sorrows lead men to con-
clude? Isa. 53:4.
   8. For, or on whose account, did Jesus bear all
these sufferings? Verse 5; 2 Cor. 5: 21.
   9. How many are in need of the grace and
healing of Christ? Rom. 3:23; Isa. 53:6, first
two clauses.
  1o. How great was the burden of sin that rested
upon him? Verse 6; John I: 29.
       How did he bear these sufferings? Verse 7.
  No'rE.—Boothroyd and others render the first part of
this verse, "It was exacted, and he was made answer-
able; " that is, God's infinite holiness and justice could
not remit the penalty du:: the transgression of his perfect
law. The innocent One was made to bear it.
  12. What is said of the injustice toward him?
Verse 8, first part. "In his low estate, his judg-
ment was taken away, and the [injustice and cruelty
of the] men of his generation, who can describe?"
—Boolnroyd.
             OLD TESTAMENT. LESSONS.

   13. Yet on account of whom was all this injus-
tice borne? Verse 8, last part. Boothroyd reads:
" He was cut off out of the land of the living; for
the transgression of my people was he smitten to
death." See Heb. 2:9, 10.
   14. What kind of a burial attested his innocence?
Verse 9, first part.
   NOTE.—Boothroyd reads: "And he was placed with
the wicked in his death, but with the rich in his sep-
ulcher." See Matt. 27:57-60. A criminal was not al.
lowed such burial.
   15. Was this suffering a part of the divine plan?
Verse 9, last part; verse to, first part.
   NOTE.—Boothroyd connects the verses thus: "Al-
though he had done no wrong, neither was guile found
In his mouth; yet it pleased the Lord to crush him with
affliction, " or, as in our version, "to bruise him; he hath
 put him to grief."
   16. What part did Jesus personally take in this
 offering? Titus 2:14; Mark 14:36:
   17. What did the prophet say should result to
 Christ from the offering of his soul or life for man's
sins? Verse to, last part.
    18. What is the pleasure of the Lord that shall
 prosper in his hands? Verse to, first clause. The
 humility and suffering are the foundation of honor
 and power. See Col. t:19; Phil. 2 :".6-9.
    19. To what extent will the sufferings of Christ
 prosper? Verse it, first part. They will prosper
 to the full satisfaction of Christ in looking upon the
 kingdom he has redeemed and the souls he has
 saved. See Heb. 12: 2 ; Isa. 62:3, 4.
    20. What will he do for those who know and

trust in him? Isa. 53: It; John T : 3; Rom. 5: 1,
9.
21. Over whom and how will he completely tri-
umph? Isa. 53:12.
  NorE.—Again we give the translation of Boothroyd, as
better expressing the sense: "Therefore will I give to
him as a portion the great; and the mighty fSatan and his
angels] shall he possess as a spoil [see Gen. 3:15; 22: ij;
Matt, 12:28, 29]; because he poured out his soul unto
death," etc. For divine commentary on this chapter, see
       2:14-18.

Jewish people alone? Isa. 55:5; John to:16;
Cor: 12:13.
  NOTE.- " Know " is used in Isa. 55:5 in the sense of
covenant relationship, such as exists between God and
his people. See John 17 :3 and Gal. 4:9, for its use in
this sense. It is here used of the Gentiles.
   13. Why would men run after Christ? Isa. 55:
5. -Because God had glorified him in his sufferings
for the'world (John; 3: 31), in his resurrection from

power of God's gracious mercy upon the heart of the
sinner than is contained in the two verses above. Just
as the snow and rain, to the human eye of little worth,
falling upon the dry and barren soil, causes to spring
forth the grass and herb, so God's grace and mercy will
soften the hard, barren heart of the sinner and make it
fruitful. This is the promise, it will never return void to

                    (MEMORY VERSES, 3, 4.)

flesh shall see it together." ha. 40:5.

   I. WHAT message does God give his people
through the prophet? Isa. 40:1.
   NOTE.—Jerusalem, as the center of worship, the chief
city of the kingdom, stands for the people of God. Her
sins are the sins committed by them: If the Jews had
proved faithful to God, old Jerusalem would have stood
forever (Jer. 17:24-27), but as Israel continued to trans-
gress, Jerusalem was destroyed. But this unbelief did
not make the promise of God of none effect (Rom. 3:3);
God's promises to the faithful are fulfilled through Christ
in the new covenant, and to the new covenant city, New
Jerusalem, the mother of us all (Gal. 4:24). See Isaiah
54 and Revelation 21.

lein.

cloned? Isa. 53:4, 5•

Son of God when he comes to reign? Isar 40:4;
Luke 3:5. See note.,
  NOTE.—The figure used is that of the advance guard
of an army or king's retinue preparing the literal way
before him. It doubtless meant that those who received
Christ must put away their.traditions, their errors, their
sins. When this is not done by the grace of Christ in
the hearts of those who accept him, it will be done by his
glory when he comes.
