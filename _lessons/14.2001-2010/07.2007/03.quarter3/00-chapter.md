            The Bible
People all over the              As Seventh-day Adventist Christians
                              we believe that God reveals Himself to
world have found              us in this fallen world. Among all the
in the Bible the              various ways He has done so, the Bible
answers to their              is, we believe, the greatest expression
                              of that revelation available today—the
deepest needs.                final and ultimate standard of truth
                              for a fallen world.
   The Bible does, indeed, make claims about itself that very few
books ever do. Even more so, it comes with a massive amount of
evidence to back up those claims. It is self-authenticating; its
proof comes built right in.
   It’s not just the incredible prophecies, however impressive; it’s
not just its historical accuracy, however authenticating; it’s not
just the revelation of God as revealed in its pages, however pow-
erful. Though all these have their role in showing that the Bible
is the Word of God, perhaps the greatest evidence for the Bible is
the influence and impact for good it has had and still continues
to have on the lives of those who apply its teaching to them-
selves. Despite all the evidence of prophecy, history, and so forth,
in some ways the most powerful proof is found in the Bible’s
amazing ability to bring hope, joy, and promise to people thou-
sands of years after it was first written. For many centuries now,
people all over the world have found in the Bible the answers to
their deepest needs. And why not? After all, it’s the greatest rev-
elation of the only One who can meet those needs—our Creator
and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.
   With such claims made for the Bible, it’s no wonder that peo-
ple have challenged its authenticity and reliability. Is it truly the
Word of God? Does the Creator of the universe really speak
through its pages? How reliable are the texts? What scientific evi-
dence, if any, backs up its claims? What does archaeology say
2
for Today
regarding the Bible? And even if we believed that the Book is
inspired, is it applicable to us who live in the twenty-first cen-
tury? And if it is, how and why?
   These, and more, are some of the questions our Bible study
guide for this quarter will address. We just as easily could have
titled it “Why I believe in the Bible,” for in it the authors show
why they do trust the Bible and have made it the spiritual and
moral guide of their lives.
   Even more important, during this quarter we seek to show just
how relevant the Bible remains for us today—pretty impressive
for a book whose latest sections were written about seventeen
hundred years before doctors finally discovered that it might be a
good idea to wash their hands before surgery. Again, it’s in this,
the Bible’s power to change our lives for good, that we find some
of the greatest proof of its relevancy and importance.

      The Voice From
      Heaven


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:8, 9; 2 Sam. 12:1-7;
      Isa. 59:2; Jer. 38:14-19; Ezekiel 4; Amos 3:7; 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:20,
      21; 3:1.

Memory Text: “In the past God spoke to our forefathers through
      the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last
      days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all
      things, and through whom he made the universe” (Hebrews 1:1, 2,
      NIV).

Key Thought: Since the fall of humanity, the Lord has been com-
      municating with us through various means.

              ow much is a human worth? From a purely chemical stand-

      H       point, quite a bit. According to various estimates, the value of
              the proteins, enzymes, RNA, DNA, amino acids, and bio-
      chemicals within the human body may make a person worth, literally,
      millions of dollars.
        Of course, our true worth can be understood only through the life
      and death of Jesus. If our value wasn’t infinite in the sight of God,
      such an infinite price would not have been paid for our redemption.
        How, though, has the Lord revealed to us the good news of our
      worth and our redemption? This week we begin by looking at the vari-
      ous means in which God has been communicating with us.
        Yes, God is still talking to us sinful and degraded creatures. The cru-
      cial question is, Will we listen to what He is saying?

      God’s Search for Humanity
        Before sin, Adam and Eve were in direct communication with God;
      after sin, that communication was broken. They no longer could speak
      face to face with their Maker. It was not because God had changed,
      but because Adam and Eve’s relationship to Him had.

Read Isaiah 59:2. What principle seen here helps explain what sin has
      done to our relationship with God?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        Because of sin, Adam and Eve were unable to stand at the presence
      of the Lord (see Gen. 3:8). They were afraid of God. Sin had driven
      them from the Creator. Moreover, the sin that separated humankind
      from the Creator also has separated nations, kingdoms, tribes, com-
      munities, churches, and families from each other. This is an unfortu-
      nate fact of life that we all have experienced, one way or another.

Read Genesis 3:9. What is the significance of this verse? Why would
      God, who knows all things, ask this question?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         How ironic that we sometimes hear such phrases as “Man’s search
      for God.” The truth is the opposite, actually: God is searching for us.
      He is seeking us, using all kinds of ways and means to lead us to sal-
      vation. From Genesis to Revelation, from Moses to John, the Bible
      reveals God’s search for humanity; it shows His desire to touch us, to
      let us know He is there and that He loves us despite our sins (Isa. 5:
      1-5, Matt. 23:37).

       “Where are you?” The question isn’t so much about where we
       are physically as it is about our spiritual well-being. Where are
       we in relationship to our Creator and Redeemer, who has done
       so much for us? If you were to hear the question “Where are
       you?” from the Lord, how would you answer, and why?




                                                                           7

      God and the Prophets
Read Amos 3:7. What does that tell us about the importance of
      prophets to the human race?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

        From the earliest days—indeed, from the time that direct communi-
      cation was broken—God used prophets to communicate with us. The
      prophets’ work consisted of numerous things: They revealed both
      comings of Jesus; they showed that God values human beings enough
      to choose from among them prophets to represent Him; they were the
      means by which the Lord revealed His love and character to His peo-
      ple; they sent warnings about impending judgments. The prophets
      also revealed the plan of salvation. And the Lord used the prophets to
      write the Bible.

Read 2 Samuel 12:1-7, Jeremiah 38:14-19, Ezekiel 4, 2 Peter 3:1. How
      do the prophets deliver their messages?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

Compare 2 Chronicles 20:20 and Luke 16:31. Here we see two atti-
      tudes toward the prophets displayed. In a sense, we are in one of
      the two camps depicted here. Either we believe in what God says to
      us (often through His prophets) or we don’t. In the end, our atti-
      tude toward the prophets merely reflects our attitude toward Him.

How do we know if we really believe? Can we be deceived into thinking
      we believe when we really don’t, as were many of the leaders in
      Israel all through the nation’s history?

        The answer is easy. Jesus said it numerous times. “If you love Me,
      keep My commandments” (John 14:15, NKJV); “And why call ye me,
      Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” (Luke 6:46).

        As Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we say that we believe in
       the writings of the prophets. Do we really? Have your actions in
       the past week reflected belief or unbelief, faith or lack of faith?
       What’s the only way you can answer this question correctly? If
       you could do something over, what would it be?

     The Revelation Through Jesus Christ
       While the revelation of God through His prophets is the most com-
     mon method, the coming of Jesus Christ in this world is the greatest
     and most complete revelation of God ever given. After all, Jesus was
     God, here in the flesh. What more could we ask for?
       Although Jesus came in a different form from what people had
     expected, His life and His teaching demonstrated to humanity the will
     of God. People who lived in the time of Christ looked for greatness to
     satisfy their physical expectations. They looked for power instead of
     humility, for majesty and not meekness. However, the coming of Jesus
     faithfully revealed the true character of God the Father.

How do the following texts show how Jesus fully revealed God?

     Matt. 11:27
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 1:14, 18
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 14:8-11
     ____________________________________________________________________

     2 Cor. 4:6
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Heb. 1:1-3
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Based on John 14:8-11 we know that those who have seen Him have
     seen the Father, because Jesus and the Father are “in” each other. Their
     intimate relationship is much more than that of a master and a disci-
     ple. The words that Jesus speaks are more than those of a mere human
     being; they are a revelation of the actions of God Himself. Therefore,
     when we become acquainted with Jesus, we become acquainted with
     God, the Father, as well. The best way to know God’s love and His
     goodness is to know Jesus Christ personally.

      If you claim to know Jesus, how would you answer this question:
      What is Jesus like? Be prepared to share your answer with the
      class on Sabbath.

     God Speaks Today
       “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:
     and they are they which testify of me” (John 5:39).

       We have discussed divine communication through the prophets and
     through Jesus Christ. However, divine communication has not been
     confined to biblical times only.

In what way does God reveal Himself to us?
     Job 12:7-10
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     Psalm 107:1-8

     Phil. 4:9
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     2 Tim. 1:5
     ____________________________________________________________________

       The above texts clearly show that God never intended for us to be
     without certainty regarding the purpose of life. He made certain that
     we could know the truth and the means of salvation. God has revealed
     Himself through nature, science, the Bible, Jesus, divine providence in
     our lives, human relationships, and the Holy Spirit. He also reveals
     Himself through the image of God reflected in those who have dedi-
     cated their lives to Him.
      What about you? How has God been communicating with you
      lately? The more important question, however, is, How well are
      you listening? Again, you can know the answer easily simply by
      asking yourself, Am I doing what the Lord is commanding me
      to, or not? There’s your answer.

     God Speaks Through the Bible
Read 2 Timothy 3:16 and 2 Peter 1:20, 21. Summarize in your own
     words the basic message of these two texts. What should they be
     saying to each of us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In many cases, the Lord specifically asked the prophets to write
     down His messages; many of them have been preserved. Those pre-
     served writings are in the Bible. For example, “Moses wrote all the
     words of the Lord” (Exod. 24:4; see also Exod. 34:27, Lev. 26:46).
     Joshua was commissioned to write (Josh. 24:26). The Lord also asked
     Jeremiah to write a book containing the words He would give him.
     Years later the prophet Daniel (Dan. 9:2) tells of his reading
     Jeremiah’s message and how the Lord had promised deliverance for
     God’s people after the 70 years’ captivity. Daniel himself was told to
     write a book especially for those living at “the time of the end” (12:4).
     Thus the Lord reveals Himself through the Bible. As the written mes-
     sage, the Bible is an expression of God’s will.
        It is interesting that the word Bible is not found in the Bible. It comes
     from the Latin word biblia, “books,” which comes from the Greek
     word biblos, meaning “a book.” The Holy Bible therefore means “the
     holy books.” This is indeed appropriate, because the Bible is composed
     of many books, 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New.
        Despite a great deal of diversity in style and form, from the first
     book to the last, the Bible speaks about a loving God, the Creator of
     the universe, who reaches out to His sinful creatures. The theme of
     God’s love is the focus of the Bible, which is seen particularly through
     Christ, who came into this world, lived as a human being, and died on
     Calvary. This is the greatest truth of the universe. All major Bible
     truths, therefore, should be studied from this perspective.

      What role has the Bible played in your relationship to God?
      What changes might you need to make so that the Bible could
      have an even greater impact in your walk with Jesus?

            “Jesus met the people on their own ground, as one who was
         acquainted with their perplexities. He made truth beautiful by pre-
         senting it in the most direct and simple way. His language was pure,
         refined, and clear as a running stream. His voice was as music to those
         who had listened to the monotonous tones of the rabbis. But while His
         teaching was simple, He spoke as one having authority. This charac-
1        teristic set His teaching in contrast with that of all others. The rabbis
         spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the Scriptures might be inter-
         preted to mean one thing or exactly the opposite. The hearers were
         daily involved in greater uncertainty. But Jesus taught the Scriptures
         as of unquestionable authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented
         with power, as if His words could not be controverted.”—Ellen G.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 God has never given up on us. What are the implications of
          this fact as we deal with our relatives, friends, or neighbors who
          belong to the unchurched community? How can we have the
          never-give-up spirit in reaching out to others?

3         ●2 Discuss your answers to Tuesday’s question. What things do
          you see in common? What are the differences? What can you
          learn from one another?

          ●3 What can you say to someone who claims that he or she is
          earnestly seeking to know God and His will? What practical
          things can you say to help him or her hear the voice of God?

          ●4 Share various encounters in which God spoke to you in a pow-
          erful manner. What happened? How did you know for sure that
          it was the Lord? Did you have any means to test the experience
          to know if it truly was of God? If so, what were those means?

Walking by Faith
by PAULINE NGELO
   I am the youngest of 12 children in a Kenyan family. My family
attended church, but I could not see where their religion changed them.
My parents often drank and fought. Then my brother began attending the
Adventist church. He shared his faith with us, and I started attending
church with him.
   In high school my parents sent me to a religious boarding school. I
learned that students from the Adventist University of Eastern Africa in
Baraton came to our school to hold services one Sabbath a month. I
attended and was impressed that these students knew their Bible and
loved God. They shared their faith and encouraged us to stand up for
Jesus. I joined the baptismal class, and at the end of the year I was bap-
tized.
   But then I faced new problems. My school no longer allowed the stu-
dents from Baraton to lead our worships. So we were on our own. Then
the headmaster told us we could no longer worship together on Sabbaths.
We met in our dormitory rooms to read our Bibles and pray together.
   We faced other problems. We could not make up school work or exams
we missed on Sabbaths, and the headmaster refused to help us when final
exams were scheduled on Sabbath. We prayed, and God helped us. We
passed. However, the next year we were told to give up our Sabbath wor-
ship or leave the school. I chose to leave.
   My brother helped me to find a school where I could keep the Sabbath.
I finished high school and enrolled at the Adventist university. I had to
stop school to work in order to pay my school fees, but now I am com-
pleting my studies. Just think, I, the youngest and least in my family, am
the first to complete a university degree. Just as the witness of former stu-
                             dents at Baraton changed my life, I have
                             sought to encourage other young people who
                             face difficult times to trust Him, for He shall
                             bring their desires to pass.
                                Our mission offerings help support this
                             school and hundreds of others around the
                             world. You can have a part in their ministry.

         The Final Word




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:4-10; 21:42;
      22:29; 26:54, 56; Gal. 1:11, 12; James 2; 2 Pet. 1:19-21; 3:16.

Memory Text: “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for
      teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so
      that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good
      work” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17, NIV).

Key Thought: From where does the Bible derive its authority?

                 e all live under one final authority or another, whatever it

      W          happens to be. As Christians, we believe that the final
                 authority is God, whose will is expressed in the Bible.
      Hence, the Bible is the final Word.
         But why should any one of us put ourselves under the authority of
      a book? The answer is that the Bible isn’t just a book; it is, instead, the
      Word of God.
         Thus, by virtue of who its Author is, the Lord God, the Creator of
      the heavens and the earth, the Book comes with its divine authority
      built in. After all, who has authority over God? No one. That’s why the
      Bible has to be the foundational and final Word.
         This week we’ll take a look at the authority of the Scripture. What
      does the Scripture say about itself? What claims does it make about
      itself and its origins? How did the Bible writers view other books of
      the Bible? And, most important, what does Jesus Himself have to say
      about the Scriptures? After all, He—the Lord Himself—would have,
      no doubt, the final word on the final Word.

     The Word of the Lord
        The Bible writers made incredible claims about the books they were
     writing. Phrases used to describe the original sources of their mes-
     sages were expressed as “the Lord has spoken” (Isa. 1:2, NIV), “this
     is what the Lord says” (Amos 1:3, NIV), “the word of the Lord that
     came . . .” (Mic. 1:1), or “ ‘this is what the Lord has revealed to me’ ”
     (Jer. 38:21, NIV).
        The Old Testament writers testify that their messages came directly
     from God. It is “the word of the Lord” that came to such Old
     Testament writers as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Amos, and others (Jer.
     1:1, 2, 9; Ezek. 1:3).

Read 2 Samuel 23:2; Ezekiel 2:2; 11:5, 24; Micah 3:8. What com-
     mon thread runs through these texts?

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Scattered over the long centuries, all these men, regardless of the
     vast differences in their circumstances and background, testified to the
     same thing: that the messages they were writing weren’t their own but
     that they were moved by the power of God, who commanded them to
     write what He was telling them.

      If we believe the prophets, that they were inspired by God, what
      practical implications does that belief have for our daily lives?
      That is, how well does your life reflect your belief in the author-
      ity of Scripture? What things, if any, have you done in the past
      24 hours that violated the clear teaching of the Bible?
                                                                           15

     God-breathed
Read 2 Timothy 3:16. Where does Paul place the origin and author-
     ity of Scripture?


        The Greek word for “inspiration” in 2 Timothy 3:16 means literally
     “God-breathed.” It clearly indicates that the Scriptures originated
     from God. God enabled His messengers, prophets, and apostles to
     grasp and then communicate that which He revealed to them in a
     trustworthy and authoritative fashion.

Keeping in mind the above text, especially the definition of “in-
     spiration,” read Genesis 2:7 and Psalm 33:6. What commonality
     do you find between these texts? What message should this give to
     us about the authority of the Bible?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       The same creative power that brought the world into existence was
     also behind the origins of Scripture! Dwell on the implications of this
     amazing truth.
       The Lord communicated His Word through various means. Besides
     revealing Himself in visions and dreams, He sent messages in the
     form of direct appearance (Exod. 3:2-7), through an angel (Dan. 8:15,
     16), or through eyewitnesses (1 John 1:1-3).
       Regardless of how God communicated to them, the writers of the
     Bible were not acting merely as writing machines. God did not push
     them as He would keys on a typewriter to produce His message. Each
     writer had his own writing style; these differences are seen all through
     the Bible. The crucial point is that these messages were not their own;
     they were writing down what was delivered to them by God. They
     were His messages, not their messages (2 Sam. 23:2, Amos 3:8).
       As a result of this divine revelation, the Bible also is called “the
     book of the Lord” (Isa. 34:16), “the gospel of God” (Rom. 1:1), “the
     oracles of God” (Rom. 3:2), “the word of Christ” (Col. 3:16), and “the
     good word of God” (Heb. 6:5).

      Compare the various writing styles found in Scripture. For
      example, compare Paul to John, Isaiah to Moses, or Isaiah to
      John. Does one speak more clearly to you than others? If so,
      why? Also, what might be God’s reason for allowing the author’s
      own writing style to come through in what is His Word?

     Christ’s View of the Scriptures
        Today there are all sorts of views about Scripture, about its author-
     ity, validity, role, and so forth. Unfortunately, many within
     Christianity don’t view the Bible as the kind of authority it ought to
     be.
        What authority is that? Well, let’s go to the ultimate Authority
     Himself, Jesus. How did He view Scripture?

What do the following texts tell us about how Christ viewed the
     authority of Scripture? Matt. 4:4-10; 21:42; 22:29; 26:54, 56; Mark
     2:25; 12:36; Luke 4:21.

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       Those texts are but a few that reveal how truthful and authoritative
     Jesus’ view of Scripture was. Jesus believed in the story of Creation
     (Mark 10:6), of Noah and the Flood (Matt. 24:37-39), and of Jonah
     and the large fish (Matt. 12:39-41). He also referred to the creation of
     the first couple (Matt. 19:4), and He quoted Genesis 2:24 in Matthew
     19:5, which speaks about the original purpose of marriage.

Read Luke 24:25-27 and John 10:35. What did He say about His
     endorsement and acceptance of the Old Testament as a whole?


        Jesus Himself verified His own mission by using scriptures. “ ‘For
     if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.
     But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My
     words?’ ” (John 5:46, 47, NKJV). After His resurrection, on the road
     to Emmaus, Jesus quoted Scripture to clarify the importance of His
     ministry. “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He
     expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning
     Himself ” (Luke 24:27, NKJV). Throughout His life on earth, Jesus
     used Scripture, spoke from Scripture, promoted Scripture, uplifted
     Scripture, and interpreted Scripture. “Jesus is the true Interpreter of
     Holy Scripture. His message is our key to unlock the correct meaning
     of the Old Testament. . . . Christ’s use of Israel’s Scriptures is our
     model of biblical interpretation. Our guiding principle is based on the
     conviction that the redemptive activity of God in the history of Israel
     reached its fulfillment in Christ.”—Hans LaRondelle, How to
     Understand the End-Time Prophecies of the Bible (Sarasota, Fla.: First
     Impressions, 1997), p. 13.

                                                                         17

     Apostles and the Scriptures
       The New Testament writers also showed full confidence in the
     Scriptures.

Read James 2. In what ways does he show his belief in the authority
     of the Old Testament?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        In the book of Romans alone, Paul quotes more than forty times
     directly from the Old Testament, and chapters are essentially built upon
     quotations or allusions from the Old Testament scriptures. He quotes
     from Isaiah at least twenty-five times. Peter did the same thing in his
     books. All the epistles have a strong foundation in the Old Testament
     scriptures (see also Matt. 1:23, 3:3, Heb. 10:7, 1 John 3:12).
        The New Testament authors have confidently assured us of their
     conviction regarding the authority of Scripture (2 Tim. 3:16). In his
     admonition to the rich, as stated in James 1:11, James used Isaiah
     40:6, 7 and Psalm 103:15. The apostle Peter expressed his confidence
     in the Old Testament prophecies with emphatic words in 2 Peter 1:21.
     He was alluding to the Old Testament (Exod. 12:5) when he said in
     1 Peter 1:19 that we are redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.
        When Paul spoke about the gospel in Romans 1:17, he used the
     underlying principle of the gospel as found in Habakkuk 2:4. In
     describing humanity’s sinful nature (Rom. 3:10-12), the apostle makes
     reference to Psalm 14:1-3. When Paul spoke to the Jews in Rome, he
     said, “ ‘The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through
     Isaiah the prophet . . .’ ” (Acts 28:25, RSV).
        The apostles were solidly convicted that the Scriptures were the
     Word of God. At Pentecost Peter said, “ ‘This Scripture had to be ful-
     filled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David’ ”
     (Acts 1:16, NKJV). Paul also said, “When you received the word of
     God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of
     men, but as it is in truth, the word of God” (1 Thess. 2:13, NKJV).

      What forces exist in your culture that work against having the
      kind of trust in the Scriptures as depicted in today’s and yester-
      day’s lessons? How can you recognize those forces? Even more
      important, what can you do to help protect yourself, and others,
      against them?

       Unity Amid Diversity
Read 2 Peter 3:16. What is Peter referring to as Scripture?
     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       With Peter’s reference to Paul’s writings as Scripture, we see inter-
     nal evidence for the validity of both Testaments; both were considered
     the Word of God (see also 1 Thess. 2:13). And despite some vast dif-
     ferences in the backgrounds and authors of the Bible, there’s also an
     incredible unity found within both.
       A span of a thousand years covers the writings of the Old
     Testament. There was, then, a gap of about five hundred years when
     no Bible books were written, at least not until the birth of the New
     Testament church. The books of the New Testament were started and
     completed in the last half of the first century A.D. Thus, the Bible took
     more than a millennium and a half to be completed.

Read the following texts: Leviticus 19:18, Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew
     22:36-40, John 13:35, 1 Corinthians 13. What great unifying
     theme appears here?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        One of the strongest evidences that the Bible was prepared under
     divine direction is its unity. Although the writers came from diversified
     backgrounds, its content has one predominant purpose. The Bible was
     written by kings, a prime minister, shepherds, fishermen, prophets,
     priests, a publican, a physician, and many other people with different
     occupations—but all of them wrote about the same God. Some books
     are historical; some are prophetic. Some writers wrote in poetry; oth-
     ers in prose. Some books are missionary reports; others are church let-
     ters or personal correspondence. However, each speaks about the same
     loving and caring God; each one informs us about the same plan of sal-
     vation; and each one uplifts the same standard of righteousness. All
     look forward to the same eternal reward. This is not coincidence. It all
     shows that the Bible writers have one Source of inspiration.

      What common theme in Scripture is your favorite? Which
      speaks to your heart the best? Go through a few books in both
      Testaments and pull out texts that share this common theme.
      Bring them to class on Sabbath.

           “The Bible is written by inspired men, but it is not God’s mode of
         thought and expression. It is that of humanity. God, as a writer, is not
         represented. . . . The writers of the Bible were God’s penmen, not His
         pen. Look at the different writers. It is not the words of the Bible that
         are inspired, but the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the
1
         man’s words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under the
         influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words
         receive the impress of the individual mind. The divine mind is dif-
         fused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human mind and
         will; thus the utterances of the man are the word of God.”—Ellen G.
         White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 21.

           “The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human
         hands; and in the varied style of its different books it presents the
         characteristics of the several writers.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
         Controversy, p. v.

          ●3 No doubt there are some things in Scripture that are difficult
          to understand. Why should that not be surprising when one con-

Breaking Satan’s Chains: Part 1
by OLEG FARKHUTDINOV
   I was serving a sentence in a maximum security prison for crimes I had
committed. I hated myself for being in prison, for committing the crimes
that I had. At age 30 I had spent nearly a third of my life in prison. Alcohol
and drugs had dulled my sense of right and wrong. But sometimes, in my
deepest and most thoughtful moments, my conscience spoke to me. But
the words I heard were neither comforting nor reassuring.
   When I was released from prison, I returned to my wife and young son.
But the joy of reunion could not bring peace to my heart or stop the down-
ward spiral of my life. Hardly had I spoken the promise to quit drinking
and taking drugs when I found myself searching for any drink or a drug to
dull the ache and forget the pain. When I tried to quit, the addictions
roared back, enslaving me. And when my wife tried to stop me from get-
ting drugs, I beat her.
   Once again I awoke in a stinking prison. What crime am I accused of
now? Which part of my past have they uncovered this time? I wondered.
When the judge sentenced me to three more years of prison, I wondered
what other crimes they would discover even as I paid for this crime.
   My fear turned my mind to God, and I pleaded, “God, help me!”
Someone gave me a New Testament, and I began reading it. There I found
some answers to my search for meaning. Sometimes as I read I cried like
a child and rejoiced like an adult. Then one day I gave up. I turned my
life—whatever was left of it—over to God.
   Jesus freed me from the fear that had dogged my past and replaced it
with hope that He had good things planned for my future. Prison became
my Bethel; here I saw a staircase to heaven and here I got sick in Christ,
died with Him and came to live in Him.
   Then my mother came to visit. She was crying when I entered the visi-
tors’ area. “Poor Mother! I have brought you so much grief. How many
prisons have you had to visit because of me?” My words only made her
cry even more. She told me that she had saved her pension for four months
to bring me some money, but two days earlier someone broke in and took
the money. She started sobbing again.
   Suddenly the spirit of revenge made my blood boil. I wanted to get out
of prison and find the people who had hurt my mother. I wanted revenge.

                                                            (Continued next week)

      Bible Prophecy Fulfilled




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 52:13–53:12, Daniel
      2, Matt. 24:24, John 13:19.

Memory Text: “ ‘Remember the former things, those of long
      ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none
      like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient
      times, what is still to come. I say: My purpose will stand, and I will
      do all that I please’ ” (Isaiah 46:9, 10, NIV).
Key Thought: Biblical prophecy remains a powerful factor in
      helping establish our faith.
             very year people seek expert advice on how various stocks will do.

      E      Yet, in the end the experts can tell them everything about the stock
             except the one thing everyone wants to know: what it will do in
      the future.
        God, though, knows the future. He has proved that to us, again and
      again, by some of the incredible prophecies in the Bible. Many of these
      prophecies were written well in advance of the predicted events. And,
      sure enough, time and again the events happened just as the Lord said in
      the prophecy. We know this because today, looking back over history, we
      see the prediction in the Bible, and then we can see that the prediction
      came true. “Surely the Lord God does nothing, unless He reveals His
      secret to His servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7, NKJV).
        Having seen that these past predictions were so accurate, we can trust
      the Lord on the prophecies yet future, such as the greatest future
      prophecy of all: the second coming of Jesus.
        This week we’ll take a look at some of the great prophecies in
      Scripture. What can we learn from them? What is the principle behind
      prophecy? How does prophecy help us learn to trust in the Bible as the
      Word of God?

     Prophetic License
       In Hebrew the verb naba means “to prophesy.” It carries the idea of
     someone pouring forth words with fervor or inspiration. The noun
     nabi means a spokesperson, a prophet, a person authorized to speak
     for another (see Exod. 6:28-30, 7:1). Another word used in the Bible
     for someone with the prophetic gift is seer, translated from two dif-
     ferent Hebrew words, each with the meaning “to see.” Prophets, it
     seems, have been given the ability to prophesy regarding things that
     ordinary people might not see. Thus, not only do prophets see what
     others might not—they are called by God to speak those things, often
     with fervor and might, as well.

Read Matthew 24:24. What warning about prophets is Jesus giving to
     us? What’s implied in those words?


        Jesus’ warning about false prophets can be understood to contain
     the idea that true ones will exist, as well. After all, if we were to reject
     all prophets—that is, reject the gift altogether—there would be no
     need of the warning about false ones.

Read Matthew 24:32, 33 and John 13:19. What principle about how
     prophecy should work is revealed here?

       With these verses Jesus showed us that prophecy is not just about
     being able to tell the future. Instead, prophecy is given to strengthen
     our faith in God and His Word after the events have occurred. The
     more we see the fulfillment of the prophecy, the more we believe that
     the Bible really comes from the Lord.
       There are various kinds of prophecies. One kind has to do with the
     predictions of a coming Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. Others have
     to do with the future of the Israelites and of various nations; others
     deal with the end of the world, and even beyond.

      Think over the role that prophecy has played in your own walk
      with the Lord. What lessons about prophecy have you learned
      over time? What words of advice or caution would you give to a
      new Christian or to someone studying prophecy for the first
      time, regarding this wonderful gift?



                                                                             23

     Early Prophecies
       “Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe
     his prophets, so shall ye prosper” (2 Chron. 20:20).

       Beginning even in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, we can see
     that prophecy plays an important role in the history of God’s work
     with fallen humanity.

Look up the following texts. What was prophesied, and how and when
     were those prophecies fulfilled?
     Gen. 3:15

       It’s easy for us now, looking back, to see just how accurately those
     prophecies were fulfilled. But place yourself in the position, say, of
     Noah, who was told that water from the sky was going to wipe out the
     earth, even though, according to Ellen White, prior to that time it had
     never even rained! (See Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 96, 97.) Or of
     Abraham and Sarah, that she would one day be the mother of their
     child when she was long past child-bearing age. It was surely a great
     test of faith on their part (Heb. 11:8-11) to trust God concerning the
     events that He said would come to pass.

      What promises of God are you waiting to see fulfilled? What
      lessons can you learn from past examples of Bible characters
      who trusted in God’s promises that can help you learn to trust
      Him, as well?

     The Prophecy of Daniel 2
Review the prophecy of Daniel 2. What does it teach us about the
     power of God to foretell the future?


        World history supports the accuracy of this amazing prophecy.
     Babylon’s golden kingdom ruled the world from 605 to 539 B.C.
     Babylon’s influence was greatly extended, and it became the dominant
     power in the ancient Near East. Today the ruins of the city of Babylon
     are located in Iraq, 70 miles south of Baghdad. Not only did the Bible
     predict the fall of Babylon (Jer. 51:49, 53), it clearly stated who was
     to direct the campaign against Babylon (Isa. 45:1-4). Cyrus and his
     army were at the gates of Babylon about one hundred seventy-five
     years after the prophecy was given.
        The Medes and Persians ruled the world from 539 B.C. to 331 B.C.
     But then God said in Daniel 2:39, “ ‘Next, a third kingdom, one of
     bronze, will rule over the whole earth’ ” (NIV). Daniel 8:21 clearly
     explained that Greece was the third kingdom. Within a short time the
     Greek armies, led by Alexander the Great, conquered the world.
     Wearing bronze breastplates and helmets, they carried bronze shields
     and swords. What a fitting symbol for Greece.
        The Greek Empire was then conquered by the iron monarchy of
     Rome in 168 B.C., another dramatic fulfillment of the prophecy. Rome
     had the longest reign of any other world power. For more than five
     hundred years Rome was dominant; from the British Isles to the
     Arabian Gulf, from the North Sea to the Sahara, and from the Atlantic
     to the Euphrates, Rome held sway.
        But as Daniel said, “ ‘The kingdom shall be divided’ ” (Dan. 2:41,
     NKJV). Rome was divided into independent kingdoms that later
     became the nations of modern Europe, nations that would “not cleave
     one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay” (vs. 43). We, today,
     are living in the time of those feet and toes of the statue.
        The next kingdom to come is the final one, God’s eternal kingdom.
     Daniel was so right on all the others. How foolish it would be to not
     trust him on this, the last one.

      Think about this amazing prophecy: Daniel, living more than
      five hundred years before Christ, described Europe even as it
      exists today! How could he have done this other than by the
      power of God? Is your faith wavering? Are you sometimes hav-
      ing trouble trusting in the Lord? Go back over this prophecy or
      others that have been fulfilled, asking the Lord to use them to
      help build your faith.


                                                                          25

     The Messiah in Prophecy
        Of all the prophecies in the Old Testament, the ones concerning the
     first coming of Jesus are among the most powerful. There are about
     sixty Old Testament prophecies regarding the coming Messiah. One of
     the most powerful is found in Isaiah.

Read Isaiah 52:13–53:12. What characteristics of the Messiah do you
     see here? How did Jesus fulfill them?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        This has to be one of the most powerful examples of predictive
     prophecy in the Bible. It is full of contingencies that could not be
     rigged in advance in an attempt to produce fulfillment. This prophecy
     has been and still continues to be powerful proof for the Christian faith.

Below are a few Old Testament prophecies about Jesus and their New
     Testament fulfillment. What can we learn from these about the
     trustworthiness of God’s Word?
                Old Testament                New Testament
                Prophecy                     Fulfillment
                Isaiah 7:14                  Matthew 1:23
                Micah 5:2                    Luke 2:4-7
                Daniel 9:25                  Luke 3:1-23
                Hosea 11:1                   Matthew 2:14
        It is exciting to study how Jesus also refers to the predictive proph-
     ecies about Himself and their fulfillment after His resurrection. He
     told two disciples on the road to Emmaus, “ ‘Did not the Christ have
     to suffer these things and then enter his glory?’ And beginning with
     Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was said in all
     the Scriptures concerning himself ” (Luke 24:26, 27, NIV). The things
     concerning Himself may have included His birth (Isa. 7:14), ministry
     (Isa. 9:1, 2), His being rejected (Isa. 53:3), His hands and feet pierced
     (Ps. 22:16), His being mocked and insulted (vss. 6-8), His crucifixion
     with sinners (Isa. 53:12), and His resurrection (Ps. 16:10).

      Because of what Jesus did in fulfilling these prophecies, you can
      stand forgiven before God right now, regardless of your past,
      simply by claiming His work in your behalf. How should this
      great truth, that of salvation by faith, change your life? How has
      it changed it already? What other changes need to come, as well?

      The Second Coming
         As we have been seeing all week, so many of the prophecies about past
      events have been fulfilled, just as predicted, and often in an amazing way.
      But these were all prophecies fulfilled in the past. The Bible, however,
      talks about prophecies yet to take place. Among the most important of
      these are, of course, the prophecies about Christ’s second coming.

If all the prophecies about His first coming were so accurately fulfilled,
      what should that tell us regarding the certainty of the ones about
      the Second Coming?

      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Before leaving His disciples, Jesus had promised them concerning
      the certainty of His coming: “ ‘And if I go and prepare a place for you,
      I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where
      I am’ ” (John 14:3, NIV). Peter, one of the closest disciples of Jesus,
      wrote, “But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a
      new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness” (2 Pet. 3:13,
      NIV).
         The Bible not only reveals the manner and the characteristics of the
      second coming of Christ but also describes the signs of His second
      coming. Read the following prophecies concerning the signs of His
      coming, and mark an X by the areas that are seeing fulfillment:

          1. Increase of knowledge (Dan. 12:4)
          2. False messiahs (Matt. 24:4, 5)
          3. Wars and rumors of wars (Matt. 24:6, 7a)
          4. Famine (Matt. 24:7b)
          5. Earthquakes (Matt. 24:7b)
          6. Preaching of the gospel (Matt. 24:14)
          7. Pestilence (Luke 21:11)
          8. Signs and wonders (Luke 21:11)
          9. People living in fear (Luke 21:26)
         10. Social problems (2 Tim. 3:1-5)
         11. Increase of skepticism (2 Pet. 3:3, 4)

         A pretty accurate description of our world, is it not? Amazing, too,
      if you consider that the passages were written many long centuries
      ago. Hence, even more proof that we can trust the Bible.

       If you believed that Jesus were coming back tomorrow, would
       that thought make you happy or fearful? What does your
       answer tell you about yourself and your relationship to God?
                                                                             27

           “It is the voice of Christ that speaks through patriarchs and
        prophets, from the days of Adam even to the closing scenes of time.
        The Saviour is revealed in the Old Testament as clearly as in the New.
        It is the light from the prophetic past that brings out the life of Christ
        and the teachings of the New Testament with clearness and beauty.
1       The miracles of Christ are a proof of His divinity; but a stronger proof
        that He is the world’s Redeemer is found in comparing the prophecies
        of the Old Testament with the history of the New.”—Ellen G. White,
        The Desire of Ages, p. 799.
           “Every nation that has come upon the stage of action has been per-
        mitted to occupy its place on the earth, that the fact might be deter-
2       mined whether it would fulfill the purposes of the Watcher and the
        Holy One. Prophecy has traced the rise and progress of the world’s
        great empires—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each
        of these, as with the nations of less power, history has repeated itself.
        Each has had its period of test; each has failed, its glory faded, its
        power departed.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 535.

Breaking Satan’s Chains: Part 2
by OLEG FARKHUTDINOV
   My mother sat across from me in the prison visiting room and cried as
she told me how someone had broken into her home and stolen her pen-
sion. As I listened to her tearful account, the spirit of revenge welled up
inside me. I wanted to get out of prison and find the people who had hurt
my mother. I wanted revenge.
   Then I remembered the time my sister had lost an entire summer’s
wages when thieves stole her bag. I had told her she needed to be more
careful with her money. But suddenly I realized the grief I had caused peo-
ple when I had stolen from them. God was showing me my own faults
through my mother’s loss. “Dear Mother,” I said. “Forgive me; it’s my
fault.”
   I began to understand the words of the apostle Paul to the Galatians:
“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows”
(Gal. 6:7, NIV). I asked God’s forgiveness and embraced His command-
ments in my life, especially the commandment that says, “You shall not
steal” (Exod. 20:15, NIV).
   From that day forward, God prepared me for release from prison. The
Lord and I fought against the habits and vices that had chained me in a
prison far darker than the ones with bars. He healed my body and my spirit
and turned my heart and mind around. I once had thought that honesty and
morality did not exist, that there was no such thing as an honest person;
therefore it was not immoral to steal, especially from the government. But
God made me realize that stealing anything—goods, ideas, or time—is a
sin in His eyes.
   By the time I was released from prison, I was a changed man. Fear was
gone, and in its place was a desire to make right all the wrongs I had com-
mitted over the years, to apologize to those whom I had wounded and to
reimburse their losses.
   God took me back to my family, and the changes He had wrought in my
heart touched my wife’s heart as well. Our roles had changed. It was I who
wept and prayed for her, just as she had begged me to change years before.
God answered my prayers, and my wife gave her life to Jesus. Now
together we pray and work for others.
   The Lord took a crooked, empty heart and filled it with His love while
I was in prison. Now I find no greater joy than to help other prisoners find
peace and forgiveness and freedom in Christ. Thank you for supporting
ministry to prisoners through your mission offerings.

      The Bible Is Reliable




         SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 5:17, 18; 24:35;
      John 10:34, 35; Rom. 8:34; 1 Cor. 15:6, 12-19; Gal. 3:22; 2 Tim.
      3:16; James 2:23; 1 Pet. 1:25.

Memory Text: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
      truth” (John 17:17).

Key Thought: Why would God give us His Word and not give us
      evidence that enables us to trust it?

                 ark Twain once said that rumors of his death had been greatly

      M          exaggerated. One could make the same claim about the Bible.
                 More than once people have declared that the Book one day
      would be deemed dead, a relic from a bygone era.
         The Bible continues to come under attack. Interestingly enough, the
      critics come and go, but the Bible remains. Critical ideas about the
      Bible, once deemed cutting edge and revolutionary, have been long
      forgotten, but the Bible remains. Men deemed great scholars, whose
      work questioned the authenticity of the writings of Moses or Isaiah,
      are barely known anymore, while Moses and Isaiah are still being read
      all over the world.
         For the past few weeks we have looked at elements that should give us
      confidence in the Bible. This week we continue to look at reliability.
      Thousands of years ago copy machines and digital scanners did not exist.
      How accurate are the manuscripts we have today? Why do we trust them?
         Let’s find some answers.

     The Evidence
       From the start, Satan always has hated the Bible. After all, it reveals
     the whole plan of salvation, from start to finish. In it everyone can
     find the path to eternal life. No wonder Satan hates it.
       Many have been his attempts over the centuries to destroy it. When,
     finally, because of massive circulation, the destruction of the Bible
     became impossible, Satan tried a new tact: If he couldn’t destroy the
     Scriptures themselves, then he could do the next best thing: destroy
     their credibility. Hence, the arrival of what’s known as higher criti-
     cism, which has been very successful in destroying faith in the Bible
     as the Word of God. For many scholars, the Bible is just another
     ancient text, a Jewish version of, for instance, the Egyptian Book of
     the Dead. Full of historical interest, for sure, but not divinely inspired.

Look up Matthew 5:17, 18; 24:35; John 10:34, 35; 1 Peter 1:25. What
     do they say to us about the reliability of the Bible?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

       There is, however, one problem here. We are using what the Bible
     says about itself to verify the reliability of the Bible. That’s circular
     reasoning. How can we use the Bible to verify itself when it’s the reli-
     ability of the Bible itself that is coming into question? It’s like defin-
     ing by using that word itself in the definition.
       On the other hand, God has given us plenty of reasons to trust in the
     reliability of the Bible. We have been given enough internal and exter-
     nal evidence so that we can trust what it says. We don’t have to believe
     just because it tells us to believe. God gives us reasons to trust in the
     Bible as His Word, even though, in the end, we have to go by faith. The
     bottom line, however, is that we can trust the Bible because God has
     given us many good reasons 10.

      Suppose someone were to ask you, “Why do you trust the Bible?
      Why do you think the Bible is the Word of God? Why do you live
      according to what the Bible says?” How would you answer, and
      why?



                                                                            31

     The Old Testament
Read Mark 15:28; Luke 4:21; John 13:18; 17:12; 19:24; Galatians
     3:22; 2 Timothy 3:16; James 2:23. What do these texts tell us
     about how the Old Testament was viewed by the writers of the
     New Testament? What message is in these words for us?

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

     ____________________________________________________________________

        As we saw last week, there are amazing prophecies in the Bible that
     give powerful testimony to its accuracy in both the Old and the New
     Testaments. The fulfillment of these prophecies shows how both
     Testaments are reliable; each one works to help establish the validity
     of the other.
        But there’s even more. For many years higher critical scholars have
     told us that the Bible can’t be trusted. After all, there are no complete
     copies of the Hebrew Old Testament dated earlier than around A.D. 900.
     Certainly, with no copy machines around, many errors got into the
     texts. Thus, how can the Old Testament be trusted?
        Then, in early 1947, the world learned about what has been called
     “the greatest archaeological discovery of the century.” In caves near
     the Dead Sea, ancient jars were discovered containing the now famous
     Dead Sea Scrolls, many of them dated from about 150 B.C. to A.D. 70,
     which means these biblical texts were more than one thousand years
     older than many of the other known texts. The find included the ear-
     liest manuscript copy yet known of the complete book of Isaiah and
     fragments of almost every book in the Old Testament. The books of
     Samuel, in a tattered copy, were also found, along with two complete
     chapters of Habakkuk.
        In comparing the Dead Seas Scrolls with the other manuscripts,
     scholars were amazed to find just how accurate our modern Bibles
     are. In most cases there were just minor spelling differences. The dis-
     covery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has given us great external evidence
     on just how reliable the text of the Old Testament is.

      How much sense would it make for God to give us His Word and
      it not be reliable? Or for Him not to give us reasons to trust its
      reliability? Should we not be able to trust the Bible in the same
      way that we trust in the God of the Bible?

     The New Testament
Read Revelation 22:18, 19. What message about just how seriously
     the Lord takes the words of the Bible is found here?


       “I’ll be honest with you. . . . When I first found out that there are no
     surviving originals of the New Testament, I was really skeptical. I
     thought, If all we have are copies of copies of copies, how can I have
     any confidence that the New Testament we have today bears any
     resemblance whatsoever to what was originally written?”—Lee
     Strobel, The Case for Christ (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1998),
     pp. 58, 59.
       Good question. Here, too, we have to ask ourselves: Would God not
     leave us a reliable source to know His will? Even more so, would He
     not give us reasons to trust in whatever sources He left us?
       Yesterday’s lesson showed that the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls
     is important for us to see the accuracy and reliability of the Old
     Testament. Can we find the same evidence for the New Testament?
       One of the most amazing things about the New Testament, some-
     thing that gives us incredible evidence for its reliability, comes from
     the fact that so many copies of its manuscripts are still in existence, so
     many more than other ancient manuscripts. The Lord has left us with a
     wealth of manuscript evidence that attests to the accuracy of the New
     Testament that we have today. According to scholars Norman Geisler
     and William Nix: “The New Testament, then, has not only survived in
     more manuscripts than any other book from antiquity, but it has sur-
     vived in a purer form than any other great book—a form that is 99.5
     percent pure.”—Strobel, p. 65.
       Then, too, there is so much external evidence; that is, there are many
     quotations and excerpts from the early copies of the New Testament
     found in commentaries, sermons, and letters of the early Church
     Fathers. The Apostolic Fathers, writing mostly between A.D. 90 and
     160, showed great familiarity with most of the books of the New
     Testament. This external evidence, called the lectionaries, were the
     reading lessons used in public church services. By the middle of the
     twentieth century, more than eighteen hundred of these reading lessons
     had been classified. Because they so closely reflect the New Testament
     as we have it today, these early church manuscripts also give us many
     reasons to trust in the reliability of the New Testament texts as handed
     down through the years.

      How firm is your faith in the Bible as the Word of God? Also, ask
      yourself this question: “If I can’t trust the Bible, what can I
      trust?” What’s left?

      Internal Evidence: Part 1
       What other evidence can help us trust in the Bible as the Word of
      God, besides what we’ve looked at in the past few days?
Think about the New Testament story of Jesus. Of all the things that
      happened to Him, which event is not only the most incredible (in
      that it is not something that happens very often) but has a great
      deal of importance to the whole Christian faith? See Rom. 8:34,
      1 Cor. 15:12-19.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 makes it very clear how central the resur-
      rection of Jesus is to our faith. In other words, even though Christ died
      for our sins, even though He was our Substitute, it all would have
      come to naught had He not been resurrected. That shows how impor-
      tant this event is to all that we believe.
         Of course, it’s one thing for a Jew to have been crucified by the
      Romans. That happened all the time. It’s wholly another for that Jew
      to have been resurrected from the dead. And yet that’s exactly what the
      New Testament writers declared happened to Jesus.
Read Matthew 27:51–28:20, Mark 16:9-14, Luke 24:35-53, John
      20:19-31. What do all these accounts have in common?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         Whatever the differences in the Gospel accounts (in that some writ-
      ers recorded things that others didn’t), one thing all have in common
      is that all testified to the resurrection of Jesus from the grave.
         Now, some reject the idea that someone, anyone, could be raised
      from the dead after three days. It’s crazy, they say—the product of a
      sick mind, of someone having hallucinations.
         Now, that might be a reasonable assumption if only one person were
      making the claim that Jesus rose from the dead. But in this case, there
      were four! It’s one thing for all four Gospel writers to be crazy. But for
      all four to be crazy in the same way? Hardly sounds as if the halluci-
      nation theory makes any sense.
       Read again 1 Corinthians 15:12-19. Why is the resurrection of
       Christ so central to our faith? Now ask yourself this question:
       “Would God ask us to believe in something like this and not give
       us plenty of evidence to believe it?” Explain your answer.

     Internal Evidence: Part 2
       As we saw yesterday, the idea that the resurrection of Jesus was
     based on the claim that the disciples were crazy made no sense.
     Realizing that this idea wasn’t too sensible, others claimed that the
     disciples conspired to make up the story of Christ’s resurrection.

From what you know about the life and fate of those early followers
     of Jesus, why does the conspiracy theory make no sense either?
     See Luke 21:16, 17; John 16:2.


        What reason would they have for making up this story? Power?
     Prestige? Money? Please! Shunned by their own people, rejected by
     the religious leaders, and mercilessly persecuted by just about every-
     one, the disciples never gained worldly power, influence, or money as
     a result of the Resurrection. On the contrary! They lost everything the
     world had to offer because of their insistence on it.
        Some have argued that though the disciples had conspired in hopes
     of personal advantage, things went awry concerning their plans.
     However, because they already had committed themselves to the story
     of the Resurrection, they had no choice but to keep promoting it. The
     only problem is that the Gospels were not written until many years
     after the Resurrection. If the disciples had hopes that through the fab-
     ricated story of Jesus’ resurrection they were going to get rich or pow-
     erful, they learned early that this was a vain hope. Why, decades later,
     long after they had had plenty of time to disassociate themselves from
     the whole failed endeavor, did they cling to it anyway—even at such
     a great personal cost?

Read 1 Corinthians 15:6 (NIV). What is Paul saying here that gives
     even more evidence for the resurrection of Jesus?


        Paul is telling people that Jesus, after the Resurrection, appeared to
     more than five hundred people, “most of whom are still living.” In
     other words, Paul is so confident about the resurrection of Jesus that
     he is all but inviting people to talk to those among the 500 who are
     still alive and ask them to tell them what they saw. And, of course, one
     reason that Paul was certain of their testimony was because he, him-
     self, had been a witness to the resurrected Jesus (Acts 9:1-8).

      Go over in your own life and experience the reasons you have for
      your faith in Jesus. What things can you do to strengthen that
      faith? At the same time, what activities tend to weaken it?


                                                                          35

    Further Study: “The Languages, Manuscripts, and Canon of the
         Old Testament,” pp. 25–45 in The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1.

           “God has faithful witnesses, to whom He committed the truth, and
         who preserved the Word of God. The manuscripts of the Hebrew and
         Greek Scriptures have been preserved through the ages by a miracle
         of God.”— Ellen G. White, Letter 32, 1899.
           Aside from the Dead Sea Scrolls, there are two other ancient wit-
         nesses that attest to the accuracy of the copyists of the Old Testament.
         One of these is the Greek translation of the Old Testament, called the
         Septuagint; another is the text that was preserved by the Samaritans
1        that live today in Nablus, Palestine. No wonder R. Laird Harris, an
         Old Testament scholar, concluded: “We can now be sure that copyists
         worked with great care and accuracy on the Old Testament, even back
         to 225 B.C. At that time there were two or three types of text available
         for copying. These types differed among themselves so little, however,
         that we can infer that still earlier copyists had also faithfully and care-
2        fully transmitted the Old Testament text. Indeed, it would be rash
         skepticism that would now deny that we have our Old Testament in a
         form very close to that used by Ezra when he taught the Law to those
         who had returned from the Babylonian captivity.”—R. Laird Harris,
         Can I Trust My Bible? (Chicago: Moody Press, 1963), p. 124.

          1 Russian Leo Tolstoy wrote the great novel Anna Karenina.
          Could you imagine Tolstoy willing to face persecution, rejection,
          jail, and maybe even death, because he insisted that the whole
          story was true, even though he knew he had made it all up? How
          does this analogy help us understand why the disciples wouldn’t
          have made up the story of Christ’s resurrection?

New Name, New Heart
by EMMANUEL A. ALLOTEY
   Sabbah lives in a town in central Ghana. When she was 17 years old,
some of her friends invited her to attend evangelistic meetings near her
home. Sabbah wanted to go to the meetings, but she knew that her father
would object, for he hated Christians. She decided it was best not to tell
her parents where she was going each night, so she arranged to meet her
girlfriends at their homes and walk to the meetings with them.
   Sabbah was touched by what she learned about God. She gave her heart
to God and asked to be baptized. But her father learned of her plans and
forbade her to be baptized. He threatened to beat her and disown her if she
even attended a Christian function. Sadly, Sabbah did not take part in the
first baptism. But she was not willing to give up her love for Jesus just
because her father said she must, and she continued attending worship
services whenever she could.
   When her father learned of Sabbah’s continued interest in Christianity,
he drove her from her home. However, Sabbah’s mother had secretly
encouraged her daughter’s decision to become a Christian, and she tried to
encourage her daughter’s faith. When Sabbah’s father learned of her
mother’s actions, she too was forced to leave her home.
   On her baptismal day, Sabbah changed her name to Christine* to reflect
her new faith.
   Christine passed her junior high school exams and could enter high
school, but without her parents’ financial support, she had no way to con-
tinue her studies. As her pastor, I encouraged her to trust in the Lord and
pray for a sponsor.
   Not long after this conversation, I received a telephone call inviting me
to the conference office. There I met a couple from overseas who wanted
to sponsor Christine to finish her education. She could continue her stud-
ies!
   Christine has done well in her high school years and wants to serve God
in whatever capacity He leads her. She is thankful for those who have
helped her finish her education, but is even more grateful for those who
made it possible for her to be introduced to her Savior, Jesus Christ. Your
mission offerings help make evangelism possible in Ghana and around the
world. Thank you.

  * Not her real name.

      When the Rocks Cry
      Out


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 20:1, Nah. 3:2-7,
      Luke 19:40, John 20:24-31, Heb. 11:24-27.

Memory Text: “By faith Moses, when he was come to years,
      refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; choosing
      rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
      pleasures of sin for a season” (Hebrews 11:24, 25).

Key Thought: Archaeology has played a key role in affirming
      the veracity of the Old Testament.

              t the beginning of the nineteenth century the Bible faced an

      A       onslaught of attacks from many sources. The greatest were
              coming from, sad to say, Bible scholars themselves, who
      argued that we just couldn’t trust the Bible and its historical accounts.
      All sorts of new theories were proposed to explain the origin of the
      Bible, and though varying one from another, they had one major point
      in common: All brought the biblical accounts into disrepute.
      Interestingly enough, when these attacks were at the strongest, archae-
      ologists began making startling discoveries, and, bit by bit, challenges
      against the Bible were being answered.
        “In light of past discoveries,” wrote a well-known Bible scholar,
      “one may expect that future archaeological finds will continue to sup-
      port the biblical traditions.”—Edwin Yamauchi, The Stone and the
      Scriptures (London: InterVarsity Press, 1973), p. 168.
        This week we’ll take a quick look at some discoveries and how they
      have answered some challenges.

Faith and Archaeology
  “ ‘I tell you,’ he replied, ‘if they keep quiet, the stones will cry
out’ ” (Luke 19:40, NIV).

   Though Jesus probably wasn’t talking about archaeology when He
made the above statement, He might as well have. Over the years vari-
ous archaeological discoveries, such as the Rosetta Stone and the
Behistun inscription, have done much to help confirm the Bible record.
   Don’t, however, take our word for it. Read the few quotes below by
these archaeologists:
   Dr. W. F. Albright, perhaps the most famous archaeologist of the
twentieth century, said: “There can be no doubt that archaeology has
confirmed the substantial historicity of Old Testament tradition.”
—Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (Baltimore, Md.: The Johns
Hopkins University Press, 1942), p. 176.
   Millar Burrows, from Yale: “On the whole, however, archaeological
work has unquestionably strengthened confidence in the reliability of
the Scriptural record. More than one archaeologist has found his respect
for the Bible increased by the experience of excavation in Palestine.”
—What Mean These Stones? (New Haven, Conn.: American Schools of
Oriental Research, 1941), p. 1.
   K. A. Kitchen: “In terms of general reliability. . . . the Old Testament
comes out remarkably well, so long as its writings and writers are treated
fairly and evenhandedly.”—On the Reliability of the Old Testament
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2003), p. 500.
   However nice it is to have these quotes and others, we mustn’t base
our faith on archaeology, because, like all disciplines, it is still a human
endeavor. People have to interpret the evidence, and so a subjective ele-
ment always arises. Also, what happens when someone makes a find
that some scholars interpret as contradicting the biblical account? Is our
faith then shattered? Though it’s nice when archaeological interpreta-
tions fit what we believe, our faith must rest, not on rocks and inscrip-
tions, but on the promises of God as revealed to us in Jesus Christ.

 Read John 20:24-31. What principle that has application in our
 own experience of faith in Jesus is revealed here? What lessons
 can you draw from this account, particularly verse 29, that helps
 us understand what faith is about?

      Some Prophecies Confirmed
         The Bible, as we know, is filled with prophecies, many of them
      already fulfilled. It’s exciting, from our standpoint, to look back and
      see how archaeology shows us that these prophecies were fulfilled as
      the Bible said they would be.
         For example, Nineveh was the capital of Assyria at the height of its
      power and glory. It was one of the centers of the world. From its
      administrative offices governors were dispatched to rule over a vast
      empire, reaching from Persia and Arabia in the east to the green shores
      of the Mediterranean in the west, and from the border of Ethiopia in
      the south to the Black Sea in the north. Yet, according to the Bible, it
      wasn’t going to last.

According to Nahum, what was going to happen to this great city
      Nineveh? See Nah. 3:2-7.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Through the combined forces of the Medes and the Babylonians,
      the city was destroyed in 612 B.C. The palaces were burned, its tem-
      ples were broken down, and its strong fortifications were demolished.

Read Isaiah 13:19-22. What was to be the fate of another great king-
      dom, Babylon?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        Archaeological discoveries over the years have revealed that
      Babylon was once, indeed, a magnificent city that had, among other
      things, (1) a wall about the main city more than 11 miles long and 85
      feet thick; (2) many gates, including the Ishtar Gate with its enam-
      eled bricks showing 575 dragons and bulls and 120 lions; and (3) the
      gorgeously decorated palace of Nebuchadnezzar with its banquet hall
      and throne room, 57 feet wide and 168 feet long. Yet, whatever its
      ancient glory, as affirmed by archaeology, the city today remains in
      ruins.

       Babylon in ruins? Nineveh in ruins? Today it would be compa-
       rable if someone said that the United States would be in ruins.
       What lesson should there be here for us about how fleeting any-
       thing earthly is? What should our priorities in life be?

     More Affirmations
Look up the following texts: Genesis 15:20, Exodus 3:8, Joshua 1:4,
     1 Kings 10:29, and 2 Chronicles 1:17.

What nation is mentioned in each of these texts?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        These were just a few times, out of dozens, that the Hittites were
     mentioned in the Bible. For many years, however, this was seen as evi-
     dence that the Bible couldn’t be trusted historically. Why? Because no
     other ancient sources referred to the Hittites. Thus, some saw this lack
     of other sources as proof that the Bible couldn’t be trusted. The
     Hittites were deemed a mythical people, or, at most, an insignificant
     tribe occupying a village or two. Thanks to numerous archaeological
     discoveries, however, we now know that the Hittites once ruled the
     greater part of Asia Minor, from the Mediterranean Sea to the
     Euphrates River, and that their power was scarcely inferior to that of
     Assyria or Egypt. It was only when the empire ended around 1200 B.C.
     that they finally vanished from history, though small city-states
     remained. Again, the rocks have cried out testifying to the accuracy of
     the Bible.

Another biblical record also confirmed is the relationship between
     Israel and Moab. How does the Bible depict that relationship?
     2 Kings 3:4-27.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        In a little village eastward from the Dead Sea the Moabite stone, a
     stone inscribed by King Mesha, was found. It tells of Moab’s oppres-
     sion by the nation of Israel, as depicted in the Bible. This stone is now
     in the Louvre museum in Paris. It is regarded as very precious since
     its writing differs very little from early Hebrew. It was engraved about
     850 B.C.

      Suppose no Moabite stone had ever been found. It’s not hard to
      imagine critics saying, “Oh, more proof that the Bible is unreli-
      able,” just as they did with the Hittites. What lessons can we learn
      from this about what faith should and should not be based on?


                                                                          41

     Ebla and Other Discoveries
        Another important discovery was the Ebla Tablets, found in the Syrian
     city of Ebla (Tell Mardikh) in the 1970s. These were a whole library of
     clay tablets, about fifteen thousand of them, dated from about twenty-
     three hundred years before Christ. The Ebla Tablets are “now considered
     more significant for elucidating ancient history and the early back-
     ground of the Bible than any other archaeological discovery ever
     unearthed.”—Thompson Chain Reference Bible, pp. 1653, 1654.

Read Isaiah 20:1. What king is mentioned there?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       For years it was claimed that there was no such king, and thus the
     Bible wasn’t trustworthy. But in the 1840s, archaeological discoveries
     uncovered a palace with a statue and inscription telling all about Sargon,
     king of Assyria. The Bible was, again, confirmed by archaeology.

What tragic end came to Sennacherib, king of Assyria, who took the
     throne after Sargon? 2 Kings 19:36, 37.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Interestingly enough, an unearthed Assyrian record says that on the
     twentieth day of the month Tebet, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was
     killed by his son in a revolt.
        The discovery of the law code of Hammurabi in 1901–1902 in Susa
     and the excavation in Nuzi have shown that some of the practices of
     the patriarchs—such as the experience of Sarah giving her slave girl
     to Abraham (Gen. 16:1-3), the selling of the birthright for food (Gen.
     25:33), and married daughters receiving a handmaid (Gen. 29:24,
     29)—were common practices in the ancient world.

      Whether in archaeology, science, history, or whatever, it’s always
      nice when things affirm what we believe, and we should be thank-
      ful for these affirmations. At the same time, what message is
      found in Hebrews 11:1 that is so important for us to remember?

Read Hebrews 11:24-27. According to these texts, what did Moses give
      up for his God?

         What might have been some of those treasures that Moses left
      behind? In 1922 Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamen,
      who lived in the fourteenth century B.C. Carter’s discovery helps us
      better understand the text regarding Moses and the treasures of Egypt.
      There are more than seventeen hundred objects on display in the Cairo
      Museum that were found in Tutankhamen’s tomb. These include the
      king’s mask of pure gold, a golden death boat, 143 jewels, and many
      other precious ornaments. This one tomb alone has a multimillion dol-
      lar treasure that dazzles the senses. Again, this is just one tomb of one
      pharaoh. Yet, according to the Bible, Moses left those precious treas-
      ures because “he saw him who is invisible” (Heb. 11:27, NIV).
         Siegfried Horn said that the discovery of Tutankhamen’s tomb also
      has answered the Bible critics who said that “the mentioning of iron
      in the stories of the books of Joshua and Judges is strong proof of a
      late date for these books, because it was thought that iron had not been
      used before the twelfth century B.C. The iron objects of King
      Tutankhamen’s tomb however, show that the critics were wrong and
      that iron objects were used in that very age.”—The Spade Confirms
      the Book (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald® Pub. Assn., 1957),

      of the Bible stories.
Read 1 Samuel 15:2, 3. What did God tell the Israelites to do?

        Many find such texts as these disturbing. During the years, however,
      archaeology has added some light that can help us better understand
      what was going on. Some archaeologists have argued that the
      Canaanite religion was exceedingly cruel and bloodthirsty, and it led
      the Canaanites to violent and degrading acts. If this is true, it could
      help explain why the Lord used the Israelites to bring judgment upon
      them. Meanwhile, Genesis 15:16 unveils a principle that can help us
      better understand what was happening here.

       Why is it so important for us to trust in the Lord and His good-
       ness, despite such hard texts to understand, such as 1 Samuel
       15:2, 3? Go over in your own mind examples of God’s love,
       mercy, and forgiveness. Ask the Lord to give you faith to trust,
       despite things that are hard to understand.

    Further Study: “Archeology and the Recovery of Ancient History,”
         pp. 99–132 in The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1.

            “Skepticism toward ancient writings, well founded in many cases,
         was then also extended to the writings of the Bible. Many people
         thought that the Biblical records about this world’s ancient history, and
         the stories about the patriarchs, prophets, judges, and kings, were in
1
         most cases just as legendary as those of other ancient peoples which
         had come down to us through Greek and Latin writings. The most
         famous historians and theologians of the 19th century were the great-
         est doubters of the veracity of the stories of the Bible, and were among
         its most vigorous critics.
            “This attitude has greatly changed since the turn of the [twentieth]
2
         century. Much more respect is now shown toward the Old Testament,
         its narratives, and its teachings than was shown a few decades ago.
         The results of explorations in the Near East have done more than any-
         thing else to bring this about.
            “In the flood of light thrown by archeology upon the ancient civi-
         lizations the Old Testament stands forth not only as historically reli-
         able but also as unique in scope, power, and lofty ideals in compari-
         son with the best products of the ancient world.”—The SDA Bible

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 As a class, talk about the whole question of faith in God. What
          is faith? Where does it come from? What causes people to lose it?
          What role can archaeology have in our faith? At the same time,
          why must we not put too much emphasis on it, or any other dis-
          cipline, such as science? What can we do to help strengthen each
          other’s faith?

          ●
          2 Suppose evidence for the existence of the Hittites had never
          been found. Critics still would be using that lack of evidence to
          attack the Bible, despite the fact that the Hittites really did exist.
          In other words, just because proof isn’t readily available doesn’t
          mean something isn’t true. What lessons can we learn from this
          account about what our faith needs to be based on and what we
          shouldn’t base it on?

Margarita’s Mission
by JEANE ZACHARY
  In a village outside Tijuana, Mexico, a small company of Adventist
believers are building a church. The first thing they built was the baptistry.
These members were serious about leading people to Jesus.
  One member, Margarita Carrillo, joined the Adventist Church four
years earlier. Margarita has a passion to fill the church. And she is.
  While other members were busy giving Bible studies and preaching,
Margarita felt she couldn’t. She could not read or write. Her husband and
children tried to teach her, and slowly, painstakingly, she sounded out each
syllable of a word. Then God showed Margarita she had other gifts she
could use.
  A family in the village had a 13-year-old daughter who was troubled by
an evil spirit. The family was desperate to find a cure for their child.
Margarita organized prayer vigils on behalf of the girl and her family.
They prayed that God would drive out the evil spirit. Little by little they
saw changes in the girl’s life.
  As neighbors also saw the difference, they began asking questions
about God and the Bible. Some began studying with church members,
and a few months later 14 people were baptized. Later another 16 people
were baptized.
  As Margarita saw these people make their decisions for Christ, she
sensed God’s power at work. She had felt that she could not be a leader
unless she could read, but she stepped out in faith and began leading the
weekly prayer meetings, memorizing the Bible texts she would need to
share with the congregation.
  The believers continue building their church. Some make the bricks,
                              others lay the bricks, and another has begun
                               building a pulpit. Meanwhile, the congrega-
                               tion continues to grow. And Margarita con-
                               tinues to experience God’s power growing in
                               her. And in spite of her difficulty reading, she
                               gladly shares God’s love with those she
                               meets.
                                  Our mission offerings help congregations
                               such as Margarita’s buy Bible study guides
                               and other materials to teach and nurture their
                               new believers.

          LESSON            6       *May 5-11



      The Bible and Science




        SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:1; 2:1, 2; 7:11-24;
      Deut. 4:32; Pss. 100:3; 139:14; Isa. 42:5; 45:18; Jer. 33:22; John
      1:1-3; Heb. 1:2.

Memory Text: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowl-
      edge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline” (Proverbs 1:7, NIV).

Key Thought: Though often viewed as in opposition to the Bible,
      science can help strengthen our faith in the Word of God.

          n the earliest years of the scientific revolution (the seventeenth

      I   century), science was viewed as a way to understand God. All the
          early giants (Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus, Newton)
      believed their work was revealing the handiwork of the Creator.
      Kepler, talking about his achievements, wrote: “I am stealing the
      golden vessels of the Egyptians to build a tabernacle to my God from
      them. . . . I cast the die, and I write the book. Whether it is to be read
      by the people of the present or of the future makes no difference: let
      it await its reader for a hundred years, if God himself has stood ready
      for six thousand years for one to study him.” Over time, however, sci-
      ence started moving away from the idea of God, choosing instead to
      work in a purely materialistic, atheistic paradigm. This, of course, led
      to the struggle between faith and science that we often hear about
      today.
         Though we certainly acknowledge the challenges that science can
      present, this week we’ll focus on places where science has, indeed,
      given us reasons for our trust in the Bible.

     Anthropic Coincidences
Look up Genesis 1:1; 2:1, 2; Deuteronomy 4:32; Psalm 100:3; Isaiah
     42:5; 45:18; John 1:1-3; Colossians 1:16; Hebrews 1:2; Revelation
     10:6; 14:7. What’s the one point that all these texts have in com-
     mon?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        For many years, much of science worked on the presupposition that
     all existence, including human life, was the result of pure chance. We
     are just a big accident, nothing more.
        Now, though, science seems to be moving in another direction. In
     fact, a new phrase has been coined: “anthropic coincidences,” from
     the Greek word anthropos, meaning “man.” Science reveals that many
     factors in the universe are so finely tuned that even the slightest vari-
     ation would create an environment unfit for human existence. It’s
     almost as though the universe was created with the existence of
     humanity in mind!
        What are some of these “anthropic coincidences”?
        For starters, if the rate of expansion after the creation of the universe
     had been smaller by one part in a hundred million, the universe would
     have collapsed in on itself. On the other hand, had it been greater by
     one part in a hundred million, the universe would have expanded too
     rapidly for stars or planets to form.
        Also, one of the known basic forces in nature is called the strong
     nuclear force. Had it been slightly weaker, there would have been only
     hydrogen in the universe; had it been slightly stronger, there would
     have been only helium. In either environment, humanity as we know
     it could never have been formed.
        There are many other examples, enough to get even someone like
     the famed Stephen Hawking (hardly a biblical creationist) to admit:
     “The odds against a universe like ours emerging out of something like
     the Big Bang are enormous. . . . I think there are clearly religious
     implications.”—Quoted in Ian Barbour, When Science Meets Religion
     (New York: Harper Collins, 2000), p. 58.

      American poet Walt Whitman once wrote: “And the narrowest
      hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery.” What other
      examples from nature put “to scorn all machinery”? What does
      this complexity and design say to us about a Creator? Be pre-
      pared to talk about your examples in class.




                                                                             47

     Astronomy
       Have you ever stood outside on a clear night and looked at the stars?
     How many could you count? Though there are a lot, there are not more
     than can be counted, at least with the naked eye, which is how the
     Bible writers saw them.

Read Jeremiah 33:22. How many stars does he say are out there?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Ptolemy many centuries ago counted about 1,056 stars; Tyco Brahe
     counted up to 777; Kepler, 1,005. Before the invention of the telescope
     in the seventeenth century, people believed that the number of stars was
     5,119. The telescope, of course, changed all this dramatically. Today,
     especially with the Hubble Space Telescope, the number of stars seems
     beyond counting. It is estimated that there are hundreds of billions of
     stars in our galaxy alone. Astronomers have estimated that there are
     about 1022 (that is, 10 thousand billion billion) stars in the universe. If
     one could count even as many as 10 different numbers per second, it
     would take at least 100 million billion years to count up to 1022. And
     over time, who knows how many more will be discovered?

Read Job 22:12. What else is Eliphaz saying about the stars?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Many ancient people believed the stars were various distances away,
     from a few kilometers to a few hundred at most. Science over the past
     few centuries has shown just how far they really are. The sun is 93
     million miles away, our closest star; others, even if we traveled at the
     speed of light (300,000 kilometers per second), would take us hun-
     dreds, thousands, even millions of years to reach! And though Eliphaz
     probably wasn’t thinking about astronomy, he, nevertheless, made a
     statement that science certainly has proven correct.


      Though it’s good when science seems to affirm our faith, why
      must we be careful in not putting too much stock in science
      when it comes to matters of faith? Why, too, is it important to
      remember that science is still only a human endeavor? See Jer.
      17:9, 1 Cor. 1:21, 3:19.

     Fearfully and Wonderfully Made
       Though possibly a bit overstated, the following quote tells us some-
     thing about the complexity of the human brain. “There are trillions of
     neurons in a human brain; the number of possible ways of connecting
     them is greater than the number of atoms in the universe.”—Ian
     Barbour, When Science Meets Religion (New York: Harper Collins,
     2000), p. 62.

With that above quote in mind, read Psalm 139:14. How has science
     affirmed the truth of this text?


        As we said in Sunday’s lesson, more and more science has been
     moving away from the chance argument to explain the existence of
     human life. And no wonder. Over the years, as science has advanced
     steadily, as we learn more and more about the wonders of creation, the
     evidence for design gets only stronger and stronger. It’s so strong, in
     fact, that recently one vocal opponent of intelligent design (and the
     implications of a Creator behind it) argued that the universe is a thing
     that simply appears to be designed even though, of course, it isn’t. In
     other words, it just looks that way.
        Meanwhile Francis Crick, probably the most famous biologist of the
     twentieth century and a vehement atheist, concluded that life was too
     complicated to have arisen in the supposed billions of years between
     the cooling off of the earth and the rapid emergence of life forms.
     Crick speculated, therefore, that life must have started somewhere else
     and was then brought here, perhaps by space aliens who wanted to see
     the earth (see again 1 Cor. 3:19 and Ps. 14:1).
        Another exciting development came from the work of biochemist
     Michael Behe. Charles Darwin partially based his theory of evolution
     on the idea that changes came over time to species through a series of
     small, successive modifications. If, Darwin said, any complex organ
     could be shown not to have gone through these steps, his theory would
     break down.
        Behe, not a biblical creationist, showed various aspects of the
     human body—the cilia, the eye, and blood clotting—that could not
     have arisen according to the basic evolutionary schema. According to
     Behe, they couldn’t have arisen over time because, in order for the
     organ to function at all, all the pieces already had to be in place at
     once. If one part, or even one step, wasn’t there from the beginning,
     the organ or process could not exist at all. His evidence presents a
     strong challenge to the evolutionary model of creation. The question,
     therefore, remains: If these things didn’t come by chance, through the
     evolutionary processes, then how did they arise (John 1:1-4, Acts
     17:28)?
                                                                         49

     A Merry Heart, a Broken Spirit
Read Proverbs 17:22. What simple and yet, at the same time, pro-
     found message is found in this text? In what ways have you your-
     self experienced the truth of these principles?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Is it really true that a merry heart does good like a medicine? Over
     the years scientists more and more understand the inseparable link
     between the mind and the body. What impacts one impacts the other.
     Research shows that, for instance, something as simple as a hearty
     laugh exercises the lungs, stimulates the circulatory system, and
     increases oxygen intake. It also stimulates the sympathetic nervous
     system to make endorphins, the body’s natural opiates, which can
     soothe and relax the mind and may even increase the activity of the
     immune cells.
        On the other hand, there’s the last half of the text, which implies
     that depression can impact the body in a negative manner.
        “In recent years, however, evidence has accumulated that psychol-
     ogy can indeed affect biology. Studies have found, for example, that
     people who suffer from depression are at higher risk for heart disease
     and other illnesses. Other research has shown that wounds take longer
     to heal in women who care for patients with Alzheimer’s disease than
     in other women who are not similarly stressed. And people under
     stress have been found to be more susceptible to colds and flu, and to
     have more severe symptoms after they fall ill.”—Erica Goode, “Power
     of Positive Thinking May Have a Health Benefit, Study Says,” New
     York Times, Sept. 2, 2003.
        Moreover, a recent study from the University of Wisconsin shows
     that “the activation of brain regions associated with negative emotions
     appears to weaken people’s immune response to a flu vaccine.”—Ibid.

      What’s the message for us in Philippians 4:6-8? Though we
      often tend to view these passages in light of the spiritual aspect
      only, what kind of physical benefits can we get from Paul’s
      words here, as well? What changes do you need to make in the
      things you read and watch and listen to in order to better real-
      ize the promises found in these texts?

     Science and the Flood
Read Genesis 7:11-24. What kind of devastation would this Flood
     have wreaked on the earth?

        If the Hebrew phrase “the great deep” (Gen. 7:11, NIV) refers to the
     ocean(s), then the implication is that on the first day of the Flood,
     when the rain began to fall, the ocean floor may have been disrupted
     by the bursting forth of “all the springs” (vs. 11, NIV). Such a cata-
     strophic global event as the Flood should have left worldwide evi-
     dence of its occurrence. Science shows that, indeed, it did. There are
     global deposits in the layers of rock quite consistent with (though not
     proof of) the Genesis Flood. These deposits contribute to the way in
     which the rock layers are identified and defined. Gigantic sequences
     of sandstone covered by shale and limestone in what are called
     Cambrian rocks; massive, transported limestone found in certain rock
     levels; as well as coal and oil deposits found throughout these levels—
     all these deposits are consistent with the Flood.
           Furthermore, the destruction of life on this earth during the
     Genesis Flood was extensive, as described in Genesis 7:21 and 22. In
     our modern world there is little preservation of plants and animals that
     die. These organisms are decomposed and recycled to provide the
     nutrients necessary for life to continue. However, buried within the
     earth are extensive fossil concentrations with evidence of a wide vari-
     ety of plants and animals that do not exist in our world today, again
     evidence consistent with the Flood story.
        Other evidence is the rapid, massive deposition of rocks, sands, and
     muds. There are layers of rock throughout the earth that have been
     deposited so quickly that there is no evidence of erosion between the
     layers. And though the geologic community often argues that these
     layers needed millions of years to form, the rocks show no direct evi-
     dence that such time has passed. These rock layers do not, however,
     resolve all of the time issues; thus, the dating methods and sequences
     of fossils in the rock record remain debatable, at least for now.

      Though God gives us reasons for our faith, there is always room
      for doubt. How can you live in a way that feeds faith rather than
      doubt? That is, what practical daily things can you do to help
      strengthen yourself in what we believe?

         he brings these ideas to the test of the unerring standard. He knows
         that in true science there can be nothing contrary to the teaching of the
         word; since both have the same Author, a correct understanding of
2
         both will prove them to be in harmony. Whatever in so-called scien-
         tific teaching contradicts the testimony of God’s word is mere human
         guesswork.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 462.
            “God is the foundation of everything. All true science is in harmony
         with His works; all true education leads to obedience to His govern-
         ment. Science opens new wonders to our view; she soars high, and
         explores new depths; but she brings nothing from her research that
         conflicts with divine revelation. Ignorance may seek to support false
3
         views of God by appeals to science, but the book of nature and the
         written word shed light upon each other. We are thus led to adore the
         Creator and to have an intelligent trust in His word.”—Ellen G. White,

          3 If willing, share with the class some of your own personal
          experiences with the power of the mind over the body and health.
          What have you learned that could help others? What role can
          prayer, Bible study, witnessing, and ministering to the needs of
          others play in helping you heal mentally and even physically?

The Faithful Brothers
by ALFRED SIMUKOKO
   Stewart and Jomo are brothers. They grew up in a small village in north-
ern Malawi. When they were young teenagers, the boys attended evange-
listic meetings being held nearby, even though their parents objected. The
boys were touched by the message of God’s love and gave their lives to
Christ. Their parents learned that they planned to be baptized and warned
the brothers that if they went through with the baptism, they would be
killed. Stewart and Jomo chose to be baptized anyway. When the brothers
returned home later that day, their parents forced them to leave.
   Stewart and Jomo built a simple mud hut to sleep in, but their parents
destroyed it and again chased their sons from home. The brothers went to
the village chief to complain, but the chief had little sympathy for boys
who disobey their parents. “Give up this church,” he said. “Go home and
submit yourselves to your parents.”
   “We cannot do that, sir,” they explained. “We must obey God.”
   The boys built another hut, and again their parents destroyed it.
   Frustrated and stranded, they turned to their pastor for help. The pastor
took them in. Both boys had passed their primary school exams and
wanted to study in secondary school, but the pastor could not afford to pay
their school fees. He arranged for the field office and secondary school to
pay the brothers’ fees so that they could continue their studies.
   The brothers soon will complete their secondary school education. During
school vacations, the boys stay at the school and work to earn a little
money for their personal needs.
   One day a package arrived at the school for the boys. In it they found a
suitcase—an empty suitcase. The brothers investigated and learned that
their parents had sent the suitcase to them, perhaps as a gesture of recon-
ciliation, a way of saying, “We were wrong.” The brothers returned home
to their village to visit their parents. The family talked in peace. “We
thought you were disobeying us,” their father said, “but you were really
obeying God.”
   Stewart and Jomo pray that their parents will step beyond reconciliation
with them and will be reconciled with God. They ask other believers to
join them in praying for their parents’ salvation.
   Your mission offerings helped provide the funds that led Stewart and
Jomo to Christ; your mission offerings can help bring their parents to God
as well.

      The Word in Our Lives




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Pss. 19:7-11; 119:105; Rom.
      10:17; 2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 4:24; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 4:12; 1 Pet. 2:24.

Memory Text: “For the word of God is living and active.
      Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to divid-
      ing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and
      attitudes of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12, NIV.)

Key Thought: The Bible must change how we live our lives.

            am Tannyhill was sentenced to death for murder. While in prison

      S     he was visited by two Seventh-day Adventists who gave him a
            Bible. Sam, angry, threw it against the wall. But one night, filled
      with guilt, fear, and bitterness, he wanted something to divert his
      thoughts, and so he picked up the Bible. At first, not understanding
      what he read, he tore it apart. But then he started reading again, and
      the more he read the more he came to know the Christ of the Bible.
      Sam found Jesus Christ as his Savior in a lonely prison cell as he read
      the Scriptures. His life completely turned around, right there in jail.
      The bitterness and anger that dogged him his whole life left. Sam
      knelt and sobbed. He said, “God, if You’ll have me, I’m Yours. Tonight
      I come. I want Your forgiveness, Your peace, Your power. Lord, change
      me.” He did, and Sam went with peace and assurance to his death.
         What is it about the Bible that can so change even the worst among
      us? Maybe not all stories are so dramatic, but millions can testify to
      the impact that this Book has had in turning around their lives.

     The Bible, Agent of Change
Read 2 Corinthians 5:17. How have you experienced the promise
     found in that text?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        The Bible paints a pretty dim picture of human nature in general
     (Isa. 59:2-4; Jer. 13:23; Rom. 3:10-12). And though that view often
     comes under attack by critics of the Bible, even the most cursory
     review of history proves the assertion right. Even worse, so often well-
     meaning attempts to improve our lot fail. Many of the great “isms” of
     the past few centuries, often predicated on the idea of changing
     humanity for the better, make things worse.
        But there is hope, hope for us as individuals, hope for anyone who
     wants to be changed. And that’s because the Bible points us to Jesus
     Christ, our Creator and Redeemer, and in Him we have been given
     wonderful life-changing promises.
        By studying the Bible, a sinner can get acquainted with Jesus, who
     is the Truth and who has the creative and redemptive and healing
     power to change us.

Read Psalm 19:7, John 17:17, Romans 6:4, Ephesians 4:24, Hebrews
     4:12, and 1 Peter 2:24. What promises are found in here for us?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        There’s no question: God’s Word can change our lives. Scripture
     pours out a flood of light on us, pushing back spiritual darkness and
     revealing to the world the truth about a loving, powerful God who seeks
     to transform the lives of all who come to Him in faith. Millions of peo-
     ple can testify to the power of the Word of God and what it has done to
     their lives. All who surrender themselves in faith and obedience to the
     God revealed in the Bible will experience for themselves just what a
     dramatic change can be wrought, even in the worst of sinners.

      Pick one specific area in which your life has been changed
      through reading the Word. What is that area, what changes have
      come, and what changes are you still hoping to see?




                                                                         57

      Doers of the Word
        Who of us hasn’t, at one time or another, echoed the words of Paul:
      “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of
      death?” (Rom. 7:24, NIV). Fortunately, in the next verse, Paul provides
      the answer: Jesus Christ alone will rescue us.
        Jesus is the Source of our salvation. “For it is by grace you have
      been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift
      of God—not by works, so that no one can boast” (Eph. 2:8, 9, NIV).
      And though faith is a gift of God, how do we receive it?

Read Romans 10:17. What role does the Bible have in the way we
      receive faith?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

        The more we read the Bible, the more we know Jesus and the more
      faith we shall have. The more we listen to the Words of God, the more
      our faith in Him will increase and the more we will experience the
      power of God to change our lives.
        Many, though, read the Bible, and it does nothing for them. Some
      scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ time were well versed in Scripture, but
      what good did it do them?

Read John 5:39, 40. What important spiritual principle is seen here?
      See also James 1:22.


         Knowledge, even of biblical truth, doesn’t automatically change us
      for the good. A teachable spirit and a heart open to the leading of the
      Holy Spirit are crucial in the study of the Scriptures. It’s not more
      information we need, not even more information about the Bible; it’s
      instead a willingness to obey the Bible’s teaching. It is not those who
      hear the Word of God who will be blessed but those who follow it
      (Matt. 7:24-29). We need to approach the Bible with a desire to apply
      it to our lives and to adjust our lives according to its teaching. If we
      come to the Scriptures with humility and the desire to do His will, God
      will give us a life-changing faith that will permeate all that we do.

       Do you pick up the Bible with a humble and teachable heart or
       with a critical eye, an attitude of resistance, or a lack of trust?
       If the latter, why not begin right now, opening the Word with a
       prayerful heart, pleading for the Lord to reveal to you His will
       and to give you faith and power to follow it? That’s the only way
       your life will change for the better.

      Principles of Life
Read Psalms 19:7-11; 119:105; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. What promises are
      found here regarding how the Bible should guide how we live?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         Every day we are confronted with difficult decisions on how to live.
      How do we know how to make the right choices, especially when so
      many moral theories exist? One ethicist even has developed a moral-
      ity urging that we kill old people who have become a burden, even
      though he also argues against killing animals for food!
         God, though, has given us His Word as a guide for how we should
      live. Whether sacred biographies, the life and teachings of Jesus, or
      specific direct biblical instructions—the Word gives us principles to
      guide our lives.

Read Genesis 39:7-14; John 8:3-11; and Philippians 2:3, 4. How might
      one take the principles found in these texts and apply them to real-
      life situations today? Be prepared to share your answers in class
      on Sabbath.

         Though the Bible does not pretend to give instruction on every
      problem known to humanity, it does give us wonderful principles that
      we can apply to our daily lives. Using these principles, along with
      sanctified common sense and guided by the Holy Spirit, we can learn
      to walk in the Spirit and be sensitive to the leading of God. Learning
      the example of biblical heroes or following the guidelines of the Bible
      will change our lives.
         We must see the Bible as more than a compilation of historical or
      even spiritual facts. We need to see it as the will of God, who desires
      the best for our lives. For that reason the Bible can educate our ethics
      and tell us what God expects us to do. God has shown us in His Word
      how to live. When we follow divine guidance for our happiness, our
      lives will be changed by His divine power.

                                                                          59

     What Saith the Word of God?
       Yesterday we looked at some Bible texts that offered principles on
     how the Lord would have us live. Today let’s look at situations people
     might find themselves in and ask, What help does the Bible offer, if
     any, in these situations? Which texts could you use to give guidance
     in the following scenarios?

A fellow co-worker, in desperate straits, is stealing money
     from the place where you both work. What should you do? Ignore
     it? Turn the person in? What saith the Word of God?

      How easy did you find these things to answer? Was the Bible

      your answers have been? Be prepared to share your answers in

     Revival and Reformation
       So far we’ve been looking at the power of God’s Word to work in
     our individual lives. But what about us as a church? What should the
     Word of God do for us corporately?

Read 2 Kings 22:8–23:25. What happened here? What role did the
     Bible have in the unfolding of this story?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

        There was a great reformation in Judah based on the Word of God.
     It was a corporate experience, something that impacted the entire
     nation.
        “Thus Josiah, from his earliest manhood, had endeavored to take
     advantage of his position as king to exalt the principles of God’s holy
     law. And now, while Shaphan the scribe was reading to him out of the
     book of the law, the king discerned in this volume a treasure of knowl-
     edge, a powerful ally, in the work of reform he so much desired to see
     wrought in the land. He resolved to walk in the light of its counsels,
     and also to do all in his power to acquaint his people with its teach-
     ings and to lead them, if possible, to cultivate reverence and love for
     the law of heaven.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 398.
        Another example can be found in the time of King Jehoshaphat,
     who sent Bible teachers to teach the law of God. “And they taught in
     Judah, and had the book of the law of the Lord with them, and went
     about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people”
     (2 Chron. 17:9). Although the Bible doesn’t say which specific book
     or books were used, the point is that the Written Word, the Scriptures,
     was at the basis of this revival and reformation.
        Jehoshaphat himself brought about the judicial reforms in harmony
     with the moral values expressed in the Bible. By studying
     2 Chronicles 19:4-11, we can see the reformation being made in the
     judicial system of Jehoshaphat: “ ‘Consider carefully what you do’ ”
     (2 Chron. 19:6, NIV), “ ‘judge carefully’ ” (vs. 7, NIV), “ ‘no injustice
     or partiality or bribery’ ” (vs. 7, NIV), “ ‘serve faithfully’ ” (vs. 9,
     NIV), “ ‘warn them not to sin against the Lord’ ” (vs. 10, NIV), and
     “ ‘act with courage’ ” (vs. 11, NIV). All these principles are found in
     the Bible.

      How easily apostasy from God’s Word can come to the church
      as a whole! What can we do to protect our church from making
      the same mistakes as ancient Israel did?



                                                                          61

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “Jehoshaphat,” pp. 190–203;
         “Hezekiah,” pp. 331–339 in Prophets and Kings; “Revival and
         Reformation,” pp. 119–152 in Selected Messages, book 1.

           “When the heart is brought into harmony with the word, a new life
         will spring up within you, a new light will shine upon every line of the
         word, and it will become the voice of God to your soul.”—Ellen G.
         White, Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 183.
           “In the Bible are found the only safe principles of action. It is a tran-
1        script of the will of God, an expression of divine wisdom. It opens to
         man’s understanding the great problems of life, and to all who heed its
         precepts it will prove an unerring guide, keeping them from wasting
         their lives in misdirected effort.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
         Apostles, p. 506.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●1 Knowing the importance of studying the Bible in order to
          bring change to our lives and to promote revival and reformation
          among God’s people, how can we renew our emphasis on Bible
          study? How can we bring the revival and reformation that we
          need as individuals and as a church?

3         ●
          2 As a class go over the questions presented in Tuesday’s and
          Wednesday’s lesson. How similar were your answers to the oth-
          ers? How different? What can we learn from one another’s
          responses?

          ●3 Do you sense a need for the Word of God to have a greater
          impact in our lives, not just as individuals, but as a church? As a
          class, put together a midweek Bible study and invite as many
          members as possible.

          ●
          4 Let members of the class give a testimony to the power of the
          Word and what it has done in each of their lives.

          ●5 How can you help someone who seeks to have the Bible change
          their life and yet nothing seems to be happening? What counsel
          would you give?

My Faithful Son: Part 1
by GANTULGA TSEDEN
   A few years ago life in Mongolia was simple—difficult, but simple.
Then our country was flooded with new ideas, new activities. Young peo-
ple, such as my son, Enkhtaivan [ENK-tai-van], discovered video games.
He spent hours playing these games with his friends. But I feared the
changes that these new ideas would bring to our country. I saw my sweet
teenage son begin to stay out very late playing video games with his
friends, and I worried.
   Then someone gave my son a book about a man called Jesus. Then a
friend invited him to a Christian church meeting, and he went. One day he
told me that he had become a Christian.
   I knew little about the Christian God and nothing about the church he
was attending. But I had seen a story in the newspaper about some people
who called themselves Christians who were doing crazy things such as
jumping off a high building. I was frightened. Had my son joined a group
such as this?
   I began seeing changes in my son. He no longer stayed out late with his
friends, but came home early. He obeyed and became so good to me!
Christianity could not be all bad, I thought.
   Then he invited me to go to church with him. “It will be good for you,
Mother,” he said. “You need to change some things in your life, and God
will help you do that.” I thought I was fine and didn’t need to change any-
thing, so I resisted his invitations for several months. But finally I went
with him. He was so excited!
   The church met in a rented room, but that did not matter. I was touched
by the speaker’s message. After church the speaker invited me to a small
group Bible study that week. I finished my work early so I could go. I went
                              to the health expo and evangelistic meetings
                              that followed, and I enjoyed it all. As we
                              prayed and studied the Bible together, I real-
                              ized that Christianity was not just a story;
                              Jesus died for me! Several months later I was
                              baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist
                              Church. It was just in time, for some terrible
                              trials were heading our way.

      Revelation of Hope




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for this Week’s Study: Pss. 34:7, 91:4, Rom. 3:26,
      1 Cor. 15:51-58, Col. 1:14, 2:13, 1 Thess. 4:13-18, 1 Pet. 3:18, 1 John
      1:9, 2:12.
Memory Text: “For everything that was written in the past was
      written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encourage-
      ment of the Scriptures we might have hope” (Romans 15:4, NIV).

Key Thought: The Bible reveals to us a world of hope and prom-
      ise.
            our World War II fliers, shot down, floated for 21 days on a

      F     small life raft in the middle of the Pacific. They had no water or
            food. However, when their thirst got so bad, it rained, and they
      caught the rain and drank it; when their hunger became unbearable,
      seagulls landed on the rafts, and they caught the birds and ate them.
        When finally rescued, they were interviewed, separately, and each
      was asked the same question: “To whom do you attribute your sur-
      vival?” All the men gave basically the same answer: There was a New
      Testament in the raft, which they read every day. And that book gave
      them the hope to press on, even when things looked hopeless.
        In the Bible, hope isn’t used in the popular sense of the word, a wish
      with little basis in fact. In the Word, hope is presented as the truth
      about a loving, omnipotent God who cares about us, who will provide
      for us, and who offers us the promise of new existence in a new world.
        This week we’ll look at the revelation of hope given to us in the
      Word of God.

      The “Comfort of the Scriptures”
        “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
      our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scrip-
      tures might have hope” (Rom. 15:4).

Paul, in the above verse, talked about the “comfort of the scriptures”
      that would lead to hope. What particular things have you found in
      the Bible that give you, personally, hope?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

        The Bible speaks about the condition of humanity, that we all are
      sinners (Rom. 3:10) and that the wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23).
      The struggle for humanity’s salvation is expressed by Paul when he
      said, “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body
      of death?” (Rom. 7:24, NIV). The answer is found in Jesus Christ our
      Lord (Rom. 6:23). Because of His love, Christ was willing to come to
      this world, live as a human being, and die the death that we should die.
      The Bible points us to the hope of salvation that we can have in Jesus
      because of His sacrifice in our behalf.

What hope is presented to us in these texts?

      1. Rom. 3:26, 1 Pet. 3:18

       At the cross, Jesus, the One through whom all things were made
       (Col. 1:16), bore in Himself the penalty for our sins. Jesus died
       in our place, suffered in our stead, all for us. Why would Christ
       have gone through so much, for us, if there wasn’t something
       incredibly worthwhile at the end of it for us? What is at the end,
       and what hope does it offer to us?

     Hope of Forgiveness
       A woman had been brutally murdered. Police psychologists, after
     examining the case, devised a plan to catch the killer. They placed a
     hidden microphone and video camera in the ground at her grave. And
     they waited. One night a man came to the grave, got on his knees, and
     begged the woman for forgiveness. The police got it all on tape.
       What drove the man back to his victim? There’s only one answer:
     guilt.
       As fallen beings, as sinners, we all have done wrong. Even people
     who don’t believe in the Bible, who don’t understand the concept of
     sin as we do, have a sense of right and wrong, and often feel guilty
     when they do wrong. For some people the sense of guilt is over-
     whelming. It’s the foundational emotion that drives all that they do.
     For many it has led to incredible despair, not only for themselves but
     for those who often suffer because of the guilty one’s aberrant behav-
     ior.
       But there’s hope, and it’s revealed to us in the Scriptures, because in
     the Scriptures we are given the story of Jesus and His death on our
     behalf.

What do Acts 26:18, Ephesians 1:7, 4:32, Colossians 1:14, 2:13, and
     1 John 1:9, 2:12 tell us about the forgiveness offered to everyone
     through Jesus?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

       Yes, the Bible is clear that through Jesus we have forgiveness. As to
     the extent of forgiveness, Scripture represents God as saying that He
     has removed our sins from us as far as the east is from the west (Ps.
     103:12); that He has cast them into the depths of the sea (Mic. 7:19)
     or behind His back (Isa. 38:17); that He has blotted them out or swept
     them away (Ps. 51:1, 9; Isa. 43:25; 44:22) and that He will remem-
     ber them no more (Jer. 31:34). Indeed, it was for the sins of the whole
     world that Christ died as an atoning sacrifice, efficacious through
     faith (Rom. 3:25, NIV). No matter who you are or what you have done,
     your sins can be forgiven by God if you just claim His promises of for-
     giveness for yourself.

      Are you still struggling with guilt? If so, go back over some of
      the texts presented today. Read them, pray over them, and pour
      out your heart to God, asking Him to give you the assurance
      that these promises are for you, regardless of whatever you
      might have done.

     Hope to Overcome Sin
Read Proverbs 24:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:57. What hope is found in
     those verses?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

       Although we may fall, there is hope—hope that we can rise again
     and again if need be, hope that we are not cast away by God. And
     though we might sin, Jesus will defend us as our Mediator (Heb. 7:25,
     1 John 2:1). Moreover, the Bible also says that through the power of
     Jesus we can have victory over sin.
       It’s one thing to claim God’s promises of forgiveness. And there are
     many. But what about His promises of victory over sin? Are they not
     just as real? Are they not just as important? How crucial, then, that we
     make these promises our own and experience their reality in our own
     walk with Jesus.
       Some members may be struggling to overcome their weaknesses,
     whatever they are. The following Scripture-based steps can lead us to
     victory:
       1. Recognize your weaknesses and that you can’t overcome them in
     your own strength (see John 15:5).
       2. Claim God’s promises of victory; make them your own (see Phil.
     4:13).
       3. Believe that the Lord has given you the victory to overcome those
     weaknesses and thank Him for the victory (see 1 Cor. 10:13).
       4. Claim the promise of “death” to self in Christ (see Rom. 6:11).
       5. Take concrete and practical steps to avoid the things that lead you
     into sin (see Rom. 13:14).
       6. Live your life in an attitude of praise and prayer to the Lord, who
     gives you the power to overcome your weaknesses (see 1 Cor. 15:57).

      What about you? You have claimed the Bible promises of for-
      giveness, but now are you struggling to get victory? Are you fail-
      ing despite all the promises of victory found in the Bible? What
      changes do you need to make in order to better apply these
      above steps in your own walk with the Lord?




                                                                         67

      Provision and Protection
      “I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous
      forsaken or their children begging bread” (Ps. 37:25, NIV).

Read Matthew 6:25-34. What hope does Jesus offer us in these verses?
      What is He saying to each of us?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         As Creator of the universe, the Lord certainly has filled the earth
      with His wonderful bounties. The ravages of sin, however, have taken
      their loathsome toll, and so not everyone has access to these bounties.
      Yet, even amid rampant wealth or abject poverty, we have the prom-
      ises of God that He will provide what we need.
         At the same time, God also gives us the hope of protection. We are
      not under what has been called “the tyranny of chance,” meaning that
      our life is ruled by unconscious forces that have no purpose in mind.
      Though bad things do happen, those who love God have wonderful
      promises that can give us great hope despite calamity.

Read Psalms 46:1-3, 34:7, 91:4, 125:2, and Matthew 28:20. What hope
      do you find in these texts?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         The Lord has given us wonderful promises regarding His loving
      care and protection. We can find many examples in the Bible of just
      how wonderfully, even miraculously, the Lord protected His people.
      Yet, we can also find examples of God’s people suffering, even dying,
      while faithful (see Matt. 14:10, Acts 7:59, Heb. 11:35-39). Did the
      promise of God fail in those examples? Or, instead, can we—because
      of these promises—know that when bad things happen we can trust
      that the Lord is still in control and can have hope for the future despite
      trials and suffering?

       How have you experienced the reality of these promises in your
       own life? What have you learned from your own trials and suf-
       fering that could help someone going through a hard situation
       right now?

     Hope of Everlasting Life
       No matter who we are, how rich, how powerful, how beautiful, how
     famous, we all face death. Medicine, diet, and exercise only can delay
     the inevitable. No matter our backgrounds, our education, our race,
     creed, or color, death always gets us. Life here, in and of itself, is
     always a losing proposition. Kind of tough, if you think about it: going
     through life, struggling with trials, tragedy, sickness, disappointment,
     only to have the one thing we fear the most, death, be the only sure
     way to end those trials.
       Fortunately, the Bible shows us what nature, science, history, and
     philosophy never can: that death does not have the final word. On the
     contrary, thanks to Jesus, life, eternal life, is how the story ends for
     those who accept Christ as their Lord and Savior.

Read 1 Corinthians 15:51-58 and 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. In your
     own words, write down what promise and hope are found for us in
     these verses.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________________________

       In this world, itself offering no answer to death, it’s nice to know
     that there is an answer, and it’s found in Jesus. It’s nice to know that
     death is not the end; it’s not a long dreaded night that never comes to
     a morning. The grave is not a prison from which there’s no deliver-
     ance. Jesus Christ went into the grave and came out triumphant; and,
     thanks to His triumph over death, we will triumph over it too. That’s
     how powerful Christ’s ministry was, that’s how efficacious it is for us;
     even death can’t beat it.
       This is the hope that we find in the Bible, where the story of Jesus
     and what He has done for us, and what He will do for us, is found. In
     the Bible we find the answer to life’s hardest question, and that is
     death. Even more so, in the Bible we find the hope that death doesn’t
     have to be the last stop.

      Imagine what life would be like if you believed that everything
      ended, forever, at death. How differently would your life be
      now? How differently would you act? What reasons could you
      give for going on living if, in the end, you knew it would all come
      to nothing? How should the hope of eternal life influence how
      you live now?

                                                                         69

            “In the word of God there are gracious promises, from which those

         and hope and encouragement.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Health,

         These words do not bring to our minds the picture of hasty transit, but
         of quiet rest. There are many professing Christians who are anxious
         and depressed, many who are so full of busy activity that they cannot
         find time to rest quietly in the promises of God, who act as if they
         could not afford to have peace and quietness. To all such Christ’s invi-
         tation is, ‘Come unto me, . . . and I will give you rest.’ Matthew

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Why, despite the promises in the Bible, are there still so many
          suffering people? Why does the Lord allow all these things to
          happen? How can we use the Bible to give comfort and hope to
          those who are suffering?
3         ●
          2 As a class, discuss the role of the church and how the Lord
          uses it to help bring to people the hope found in the promises of
          God. How can your local church be better used by the Lord to
          bring some of these promises to pass in the lives of those who
          claim them in the name of Jesus?

          ●
          3 Despite so many clear and unambiguous promises about vic-
          tory over sin, why do church members often have so much trou-
          ble overcoming? As a class, talk about what steps can be taken to
          help each other find the victories that can be so elusive.

          ●
          4 Have people go around the class and share a Bible text that
          gives them hope and let each one explain why that text means so
          much to him or her.

My Faithful Son: Part 2
by GANTULGA TSEDEN
   I thank God that my teenage son, Enkhtaivan [ENK-tai-van], met some
faithful Adventist Christians who led him to the Lord. I am even more
thankful that my son shared his faith in God with me. For two days after
my baptism, my husband had a stroke.
   As I sat in the hospital waiting for the doctors to tell me what was
wrong, I felt an incredible peace. Instead of blaming God for what hap-
pened to my husband, I was praising God that He had saved me before this
crisis. Even after the doctors told me there was little hope for my husband,
still I felt at peace. I know if I had not met God before this happened, I
would have been so traumatized.
   I stayed with my husband in the hospital for 40 days. Many people asked
me how I survived the ordeal, and I told them, “I was not alone; God was
with me. He gives me strength to carry on.” The members of our church
joined us in prayer for my husband, and slowly he recovered. He can walk
a little now, and when he feels better he wants to come to church with us.
He too believes that God saved his life, and now he wants to worship God
with us in church.
   My son started a small group meeting in our home. Having Christians
come to our home has helped us all, especially my husband. My son has
encouraged me a lot. He keeps telling me that God won’t let us go. “Don’t
worry, Mom,” he says. “God will bless us. We have a big family now that
supports us.”
   My husband cannot work, so I support the family. Life is difficult, but
God is with us, just as He was when my husband had his stroke. I will
not—cannot—let go of Jesus’ hand.
   God is stretching our faith as He expands our ministry. Our little home
has just three rooms—a bedroom, a kitchen, and a living room. But God
has sent 11 young people from the countryside who want to study here in
Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. Some of these students are
Adventists, and some are not. We have divided the kitchen to make
another room, and somehow we crowd everyone in. We invite all the
young people who live with us to worship God with us, and they do.
   Only one thing matters in our life, and that is God and our Lord Jesus.
We want to spend time with Him and share His love with others.
   Just think, if you had not given mission offerings to send missionaries
to Mongolia, we might never have known that Jesus loves us! Thank you!

      The Bible and Health




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 4:23; Luke 4:16-21;
      Rom. 6:4, 9-11; Phil. 4:4-9; Col. 1:20, 21; 3:8-10.

Memory Text: “ ‘I am the Lord, who heals you’” (Exodus 15:26, NIV).
Key Thought: The Word of God gives us good reasons to take
      care of our health.

             he Bible endorses the value of the physical body; after all, it was

      T      created by God. The believer should, therefore, seek to under-
             stand and intentionally put into practice measures that enhance
      health. Care for one’s health is a moral matter, evidence of loyalty and
      responsible service to God. At the practical level the condition of one’s
      health largely determines whether a person can carry out effective
      service for the Lord or for anyone they feel called to serve.
        Although the foundational goals and values of health from a bibli-
      cal perspective are conveyed through God’s Word, the exact means of
      achieving these goals has come largely from medical science, which
      often validates many of the principles of health found in the Bible.
        It is incumbent on all Christians to do what they can to take care of
      their health. Health-building activities, including exercise, wholesome
      diet, proper systematic rest, practical satisfying work, avoidance of
      damaging substances or practices, good habits of cleanliness, culti-
      vated efforts to live in peace with and help others, and a profound trust
      in God make the best possible use of the life God has given us. Our
      bodies are sacred gifts to us from God; we have the responsibility to
      take care of them the best we know how.
        This week let’s take a look at what the Bible says about health and
      the principles found in its pages.

     To Be in Health
       “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
     be in health, even as thy soul prospereth” (3 John 2).

       We tend to think of the Bible as dealing only with the spiritual side,
     yet, that’s not the case. Scripture shows that God cares also about our
     physical being and that our spiritual side is linked with the physical.
     We can find in the Bible good reasons for taking care of our health.

Look up the following texts and write out what reasons you can find
     in them that would call us to take care of our health:
     Rom. 12:1

     ____________________________________________________________________
     3 John 2
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Scripture makes it clear that God does care about health, our physi-
     cal well-being. That makes sense, of course. After all, what loving par-
     ent doesn’t care about the health, mental and physical, of their child?
     How much more so would the Lord care about ours?

      It’s been said that we never care about our health until we lose
      it. If healthy, do you take your health for granted? Talk to some-
      one struggling with health problems. More than likely, you’ll
      better understand why our health should be carefully guarded.

      Health and Restoration
        In the beginning God, our Creator, created us healthy, without sick-
      ness and disease. The plan of salvation is God’s divine way to bring us
      back to what we originally lost. He wants to restore us to what we once
      had.

Read Romans 6:4; 9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:51-57; 2 Corinthians 5:18-20;
      Colossians 1:20, 21; 3:8-10; 1 John 3:2. What essential message is
      given to us from these texts? What hope do they offer?

         Healing and restoration often are talked about in the Bible. God’s
      promises to restore Israel spill forth in language filled with healing
      and curative terms (Jer. 30:12-17, 33:6, Ezek. 47:12, Mal. 4:2). So
      clear is the affinity in the New Testament that one of its principal
      words for healing (soteria) may be translated as either “healing” or
      “salvation.” Salvation, then, may include not only rescue from sin and
      its consequences but also restoration, healing of the whole person.
         All biblical teachings are predicated on the basis that, in the end,
      what was lost when sin entered will be restored when the One who cre-
      ated becomes the One who restores His creation. Having healed our
      wounds and borne our transgressions at Calvary, He appears at last in
      the book of Revelation as Christus Victor, in triumph over Satan and
      the forces of evil (Rev. 20:14, 21:8). Those who love and serve God
      will be restored to the perfect condition that once was; all that is evil,
      meanwhile, will be destroyed, never to rise again. In both Old
      Testament and New Testament prophecies this new earth is foreseen as
      free from sickness, pain, and death (Isa. 33:24, Rev. 21:4). The apostle
      Paul rejoices in Christ’s resurrection as proof that He is Victor over all
      evil forces. Christ’s victory has become ours (1 Thess. 4:14-17).

       As Adventists we have been given precious light on health and
       health principles, all designed to give us a lifestyle that will pre-
       vent disease. How seriously do you follow these principles? How
       well do you even know them? Why wait until you get sick to start
       following principles that could help prevent sickness to begin
       with?

      Jesus, the Great Healer
        We often hear of Jesus as the Great Physician. And no wonder.
      Roughly calculated, approximately 20 percent of the Gospels is dedi-
      cated to His restoring sick people to health. Although in some cases
      duplication occurs, the four Gospels report 35 specific instances,
      alongside the general reports.

How central was healing to Jesus’ earthly ministry? (Matt. 4:23, Luke
      6:7-19, 9:11).
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         Through the miraculous healings Jesus gave great evidence regard-
      ing His role as the Savior. But He did so much more, as well. As
      humans, we have been damaged spiritually, emotionally, and physi-
      cally by sin. The whole plan of salvation centers on restoring to us
      what we had once lost. In the beginning there was no sickness and no
      death; in the end there won’t be either (see Rev. 21:4). By healing,
      Jesus was showing the world the power of God to bring about restora-
      tion, to bring about what was lost by sin. The healings weren’t an end
      in themselves; they were all to point to something greater: salvation in
      Jesus.

Read Luke 4:16-21. What do these texts reveal to us about the pur-
      pose and ministry of Jesus?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

        Jesus’ primary task was to proclaim that God is receiving His sin-
      ful, suffering creatures in a sweeping act of grace and love. His actions
      were evidence of final deliverance from a world of sin. He had come
      to deliver, to seek and to save, to forgive, to proclaim the day of God’s
      mercy, to confer life everlasting, and to be the Restorer of all that was
      lost. He was first of all the Savior, and physical healings were evi-
      dences of His authority.

       Whatever our illness, whatever our sicknesses, we have wonder-
       ful promises in the Bible of healing and restoration; that is,
       complete healing and complete restoration. Dwell on this, our
       greatest hope. Pray for more faith to believe in those promises.
       If you know someone struggling with sickness, point that person
       to this hope.


                                                                           75

      Moderation in All Things
Read Philippians 4:4-9. What practical principles can you find in these
      texts that can have a positive impact on our physical well-being?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

Read 1 Corinthians 9:25, Galatians 5:23, and Titus 1:8, 2:2. What
      practical admonitions are found in these texts that can have a
      definite bearing on our physical health?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         The Greek word used in many of these verses for “temperate”
      comes from a word often used in the context of athletic training, of an
      athlete who, in preparation for an event such as a race, takes special
      care to abstain from that which can hurt his or her body. How much
      more so should this principle apply to us as Christians in the race that
      we are running (1 Cor. 9:24-27, Heb. 12:1)?
         We all know about health problems that can come from the use of
      liquor, illegal drugs, and so forth. Those are the obvious ones. Yet, so
      often bad health comes by overindulging in the gifts that God has
      given us to enjoy. Contrary to popular caricatures of biblical religion,
      it’s not sinful to enjoy the pleasures of the flesh. God made us to enjoy
      these things, but only in their proper sphere, and in moderation and
      with temperance, as so clearly shown in the Bible.

       “True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with every-
       thing hurtful, and to use judiciously that which is healthful.
       There are few who realize as they should how much their habits
       of diet have to do with their health, their character, their use-
       fulness in this world, and their eternal destiny. The appetite
       should ever be in subjection to the moral and intellectual pow-
       ers.”—Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, p. 398. How much sense
       Ellen White’s words make! Examine yourself. How moderate
       and temperate are you, even with that which is good? What
       changes might you need to make?

     Healthy Relationships
       Again and again the Bible speaks about the need of loving one
     another. Jesus said that it is the greatest of all commandments (Matt.
     22:37-40). When Paul speaks about Christian virtues, such as faith,
     hope, and love, he says that the greatest is love (1 Cor. 13:13, NIV).
     No wonder Jesus said that one significant characteristic of His fol-
     lowers is that they love one another (John 13:35).

How do the following texts characterize Christian love?
     1 Cor. 13:4-7
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     1 John 4:7
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     1 John 4:18
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        Study after study shows how family love—a close loving relation-
     ship between parents and children—can stem a tide of evils in young
     people, evils that can bear terrible fruit in adulthood.
        As God’s people we need to love one another (1 Thess. 3:2), serve one
     another (Gal. 5:13), bear with one another (Eph. 4:2), be kind to one
     another (Eph. 4:32), admonish one another (Rom. 15:14), be tender-
     hearted and forgiving to one another (Eph. 4:32), comfort one another
     (1 Thess. 4:18), show compassion to one another (1 Pet. 3:8), be
     hospitable to one another (1 Pet. 4:9), and pray for one another (James
     5:16). These commands, so clearly outlined in the Word, will help us
     to be connected with one another as God’s people and will strengthen
     family relationships, which ultimately protect our youth from high-risk
     behavior. Through forming close bonds and thus giving and receiving
     love and care and concern, we can have such a positive moral, spir-
     itual, and physical influence on one another. The Scriptures are so
     right in showing how important good relationships are for us, not just
     spiritually but physically, as well.

      Review some of your most basic relationships. From your end,
      what motivates these relationships: self-serving or self-giving,
      greed or love, a desire for personal gain or a desire to be a bless-
      ing? Think about the good you have done for others. Were the
      principles elucidated in today’s lesson the motivating force
      behind your relationships?

         240; “Diet and Health,” pp. 295–310 in The Ministry of Healing;
         “The Health Reform,” pp. 271–296 in Selected Messages, book 3.

            “The relation that exists between the mind and the body is very inti-
         mate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condition of
         the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many realize.
         Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result of mental
         depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, all tend
         to break down the life forces and to invite decay and death. . . .
1           “Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and prolong
         life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the body and
         strength to the soul.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Health, p. 344.
            “Many of those who came to Christ for help had brought disease
         upon themselves, yet He did not refuse to heal them. And when virtue
         from Him entered into these souls, they were convicted of sin, and
2        many were healed of their spiritual disease as well as of their physical
         maladies.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 73.

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 Jesus’ healing ministry formed a crucial component of His
          work of leading people to salvation. How can your local church
          better use the light we have on health and healing as part of its
3         outreach to the world?

          ●
          2 As a class, talk about what the Bible says about such things as
          diet, use of alcohol, rest, and so forth. What health principles on
          these topics do you find in the Bible? To the best of your knowl-
          edge, how has modern science validated these principles? How
          have members personally benefited from following what the
          Bible has to say on these things?

          ●
          3 As a class, take time to visit any members who are sick or
          hurting. Bring Bible promises to share with them. At the same
          time, in what practical ways can you minister to them and help
          relieve their sufferings?

The Pot-and-Pan Evangelist
by JOTA WASHINGTON F. ALVES
   Geraldina Alves works in a small factory that makes household goods
in eastern Brazil. She is a faithful Seventh-day Adventist who loves the
Lord and wants to share her faith with others. But she wasn’t sure how she
could reach people outside her circle of friends. Then God showed her one
way that was, quite literally, right under her nose.
   “God inspired me to put a tract inside each pot or pan, each plate or cup
we sell,” she said. “We send out up to four thousand items a day; I could
share that many tracts each day.”
   Geraldina spoke to the factory’s owner, who gave her permission to
include the tracts. She began inserting a tract on top of each pot, so it
would be the first thing the new owners would see when they opened the
box. Often during the day as Geraldina placed the tracts into the boxes, she
prayed for the people who would find them. She doubted that she ever
would know the outcome of her missionary adventure, but she was happy
to do what she could for God.
   In another city, Maria da Silva suffered from depression. Her life felt
dark, and she could see little hope for her future. Then her husband bought
her a pressure cooker from Geraldina’s factory. As Maria opened the box,
a colorful tract fell out. Picking it up, she looked at it.
   As Maria read the tract, a glimmer of hope flickered across her heart.
“God loves me?” she said to herself, trying to capture the truth of the state-
ment. She forgot her new pan as she read the tract carefully. She found an
address on the back where she could write for more information and to
request Bible studies.
   Maybe there is hope for me, she thought. She wrote to the address on
the tract, and a few weeks later, she received her first Bible study lessons.
Maria showed them to her family, and together they began studying God’s
Word in depth. In time the entire family was baptized together.
   A few months later Geraldina Alves, the “pot evangelist” met Maria da
Silva and her family on Adventist television’s Novo Tempo. “Even though
you did not know me, you and your tract saved my life,” Maria told
Geraldina.
   Mission takes many forms. Sometimes it’s a sacrificial offering or a car-
ing visit with someone who needs to hear of God’s love. And other times
it’s a tract in a pot.

        LESSON             10 *June 2-8
      The Bible and
      Happiness


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 21:36, John 8:32,
      1 Cor. 10:13, Phil. 2:3, Col. 3:13, 1 Pet. 3:15, 4:12-14, 1 John 1:4.

Memory Text: “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to
      kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that
      they might have it more abundantly” (John 10:10).

Key Thought: The Bible offers us answers for one of life’s most
      elusive goals: happiness.

             verybody wants to be happy, yet, few know how to achieve it.

      E      The world offers all sorts of enticements that promise happiness
             but always prove in the end to be shallow, fleeting, and empty.
         Can we find happiness in this sinful world? We can, but only by
      going back to the Source of all happiness: God. Pain, suffering, and
      unhappiness are the result of our separation from God; only to the
      degree, then, that we return to Him can we find the happiness that we
      all long for but that the world itself doesn’t offer.
         This week we’ll look at some biblical principles regarding happiness.
      We’ll also focus, at least for a few days, on the family unit itself, for here
      is where so much of our happiness or unhappiness originates. The Bible
      offers us wonderful principles that, if applied, can protect our families
      from so many things that all but guarantee misery and suffering. And
      regardless of the past, regardless of the mistakes made that have hurt us
      or that we have made that have hurt others, God, through His Word, offers
      us promises that can bring healing and happiness. “They will enter Zion
      with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will
      overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away” (Isa. 35:10, NIV).

      Life, Abundantly
      “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
      I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it
      more abundantly” (John 10:10).

Read the above text.What is Jesus saying to us? How do we understand
      the idea of having life “more abundantly”? What do you think
      that includes? What does it not include?
      ____________________________________________________________________

         At the foundation of all that we believe and hope for as Christians
      is the promise of eternal life (1 John 2:25). Without that, whatever
      else Jesus does for us, even now, is all in vain (1 Cor. 15:16-19).
         Yet, the promises that God has given to us in the Bible aren’t all
      other-worldly; they don’t all pertain to life in a new heaven and a new
      earth without sin, suffering, and death. The Word of God promises us
      many things here and now, things that can greatly help us know now
      what Jesus means when He talked about giving us life “more abun-
      dantly.”

Look up John 8:32, 1 Corinthians 10:13, Ephesians 2:8, 1 Peter 3:15,
      and 1 John 1:4. What promises are found in these texts? What do
      they offer us in this life, here and now?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________________________

         God loves us; and because He loves us, He wants us to be happy. He
      wants what’s best for us. Through His Word, God has revealed Himself
      to us and has shown us what He is willing to do for us if we will but
      allow Him 10. How often we, ourselves, are the biggest hindrance to
      our own happiness.

       What things of your own doing stand in the way of your “more
       abundantly” enjoying life offered to us through Jesus? Once you
       admit what these things are, how can you get rid of them?


                                                                         81

      Rejoice Before the Lord
         “God created the earth to be the abode of holy, happy beings.”
      —Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 540. That happiness, of
      course, was disrupted by sin (Gen. 3:16-18); and not until sin finally
      is eradicated will we enjoy the full happiness that only sinless beings
      in a sinless world can enjoy.
         Meanwhile, even in this sinful world, God has provided the means
      by which we can achieve a certain amount of happiness, contentment,
      and joy in this life.

What promises did God make to Israel, provided, of course, they were
      obedient? Lev. 23:40; Deut. 12:7, 12, 18; 16:11?
      ____________________________________________________________________

      ____________________________________________________________________

         Study after study shows that in regard to the kinds of factors that
      give an indication of “happiness,” those who have faith in God come
      out better than those who live with no faith. After all, as Christians,
      think about what the Word has revealed to us: that we have a loving,
      caring God who loved us so much that He came down to earth, took
      on human flesh (Rom. 8:3), and in that flesh died for our sin (Rom.
      5:8), and that because of His death we have the promise of eternal life
      in a world made new (Rev. 21:1). We have the hope that this life isn’t
      all that there is. Meanwhile, we have from Him many precious prom-
      ises about Him being with us (Matt. 28:20), guiding us (John 16:13),
      helping us (Heb. 4:16), never leaving or forsaking us (Heb. 13:5), and
      so forth. No wonder we should be happier than those who know noth-
      ing about these promises.

Look up Exodus 20:1-17; Proverbs 3:5; Luke 21:36; Philippians 2:3;
      Colossians 3:13; 1 Peter 4:1, 2; and 2 John 1:5, and note the prin-
      ciples found in them. How would each one, in its own way, add to
      our happiness here if we were to obey what they say? Ask yourself,
      too: “How well am I seeking to follow the principles found in these
      texts?”

     The Family Foundation: Part 1
       The Bible says the world was created by the word of God and that
     He created humankind in His own image (Gen. 1:26, 27). He designed
     man and woman, He blessed the first marriage, and He made marriage
     the foundation of the family. And, as we all know so well, a strong, sta-
     ble family is a crucial component in creating happy lives. As the
     psalmist says, “Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in
     vain” (Ps. 127:1, NIV). In the family we can experience love and hap-
     piness. It is for this reason that the Word clearly says, “ ‘Therefore
     what God has joined together, let man not separate’ ” (Matt. 19:6,
     NIV). The Lord desires His children to understand that if they marry,
     they have made a covenant to be faithful to each other for as long as
     they live. The Word also explains how this marriage relationship can
     be strengthened: marry only another believer (2 Cor. 6:14-16), be
     completely loyal to each other (Heb. 13:4), and express love and
     appreciation for each other (Song of Sol. 7:1-9). The family that
     abides by the Word of God will experience the joy of His presence as
     they follow His commandments.

     The Family Foundation: Part 2
        The family is the foundation of everything human; destroy or even
     weaken that foundation, and so much else crumbles with it. How cru-
     cial, as Christians, that we do everything we can to protect the sanc-
     tity of our homes (and “home” includes everything from living by our-
     selves to being part of a large family).

Go back over the Ten Commandments. How many of those command-
     ments are directly related to family concerns, and how are they
     related? Why would families be stronger and more secure if all
     these commands were followed?

        A crucial aspect of family life deals with responsibility. The Bible
     says that each person—husband, wife, or child—must bear respon-
     sibility for the choices they make (2 Cor. 5:10). If each individual
     knows and accepts his or her responsibility as spelled out by the Word,
     the family ties will be greatly strengthened. The Word gives guidelines
     about the responsibility of each individual. The Word says that
     Abraham commanded “his children and his household after him to
     keep the way of the Lord” (Gen. 18:19, NIV). To parents, the Word
     says, “Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he
     will not turn from it” (Prov. 22:6, NIV). The Word also admonishes
     parents to avoid treating their children in a way that will cause them
     to become discouraged (Col. 3:21). To the children, the Word says,
     “ ‘Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the
     land the Lord your God is giving you’ ” (Exod. 20:12, NIV), and
     “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right” (Eph. 6:1,
     NIV). To the husbands, the Word says, “love your wives, just as Christ
     loved the church and gave himself up for her” (Eph. 5:25, NIV), and
     to the wives, “Submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For the hus-
     band is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his
     body” (vs. 22, 23, NIV).

      What are your own responsibilities in regard to your family?
      How well are you meeting those responsibilities? Are you doing
      anything that can damage the happiness and sanctity of your
      family? Which areas in your family relationships need improve-
      ment?

      “Not As the World Giveth”
        As we’ve said all week, God loves us and wants us to be happy. At
      the same time, we must remember that we are in a world of sin, of
      death, of suffering, a world in the midst of a war between good and
      evil. And as in all wars, there are casualties. In fact, we all have suf-
      fered in this war, one way or another. Thus, despite the many promises
      that we have in the Bible, promises that offer us much comfort and
      hope, we all are destined to suffer in this life.

Think about the lives of Abraham, David, Jesus, and Paul. Would you
      characterize them as “happy”? Defend your answer.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         One of the crucial things to consider is how we understand happi-
      ness. Jesus Himself gives a key when He said, “Peace I leave with you,
      my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let
      not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:27). In
      other words, we have to realize that worldly ideas of peace or even
      happiness aren’t the same as biblical ideas. Worldly happiness can be
      based on fleeting and temporal things, things that in their time and
      place can be good. But sooner or later all these things vanish, and to
      build our hope and happiness on them is to build on sand. For the
      Christian, happiness has to be based on something deeper than the
      fleeting and uncertain joys of this life. That we can enjoy these things,
      and derive some pleasure and happiness from them, is important; but
      we must keep our hope based “where neither moth nor rust doth cor-
      rupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal” (Matt. 6:20).

Read Luke 10:20, John 14:27, Philippians 3:7-11, 4:6-13, and 1 Peter
      4:12-14. What principles are found in these texts that can help us
      better understand what it means to be “happy” in this life, even
      amid inevitable suffering and sorrow? Also, as you read them, ask
      yourself, “How well am I applying these principles to my own
      life?”

            “This feeling of guiltiness must be laid at the foot of the cross of
         Calvary. The sense of sinfulness has poisoned the springs of life and
         true happiness. Now Jesus says, ‘Lay it all on Me; I will take your sin,
1
         I will give you peace. Destroy no longer your self-respect, for I have
         bought you with the price of My own blood. You are Mine, your weak-
         ened will I will strengthen; your remorse for sin, I will remove.’ Then
         turn your grateful heart, trembling with uncertainty, and lay hold upon
         the hope set before you. God accepts your broken contrite heart. He
         offers you free pardon. He offers to adopt you into His family with His
2
         grace to help your weakness, and the dear Jesus will lead you on step
         by step, if you will only put your hand in His and let Him guide
         you.”—Ellen G. White, This Day With God, p. 63.
            “The children of God may rejoice in all things and at all times.
         When troubles and difficulties come, believing in the wise provi-
         dences of God, you may rejoice. You need not wait for a happy flight
         of feeling, but by faith you may lay hold of the promises, and lift up a
         hymn of thanksgiving to God. When Satan tempts you, breathe not a
3
         word of doubt or darkness.”—Ellen G. White, The Advent Review and

    Discussion Questions:
          ●
          1 As a class, talk about this whole idea of happiness. What are
          your definitions of happiness? Should we expect to be happy all
          the time? Is there something wrong with our walk with the Lord
          if we don’t feel happy? How can happiness be used as a ploy by
          Satan to deceive us? At the same time, how can God use unhap-
          piness as a means of reaching people?

          ●
          2 What do you say to a Christian who admits that he or she is
          not happy? What counsel would you give that person?

          ●
          3 As a class, discuss this thought: Can a person in the Lord be
          happy even while suffering for Christ’s sake?

Holding Back Elephants and
Rain
by ALAGAPPAN KATHAPERUMAL PILLAI
   I must admit, I was dubious. I had been asked to conduct evangelistic
meetings in a remote area of Sri Lanka, high in the hilly heart of this island
nation. The region where we would hold the meetings was remote, with-
out telephone or radio. How would we let people know of the meetings?
Besides this, the meetings were scheduled for the rainy season, and we
would meet outdoors. Finally, the pastor warned us that this area was home
to a band of some twenty wild elephants, which are capable of killing
people who get in their way.
   My wife and I boarded a bus to take us into the hills. There we met our
driver, who would take us to our destination. Along the roadside, our
driver pointed to uprooted trees and bushes. “The elephants,” he
explained. “People in this area fear them and will not come to our meet-
ings if the elephants are nearby. And if you see one, you must run and hide
behind a large rock. If an elephant sees you in his path, he’ll kill you.” I
prayed earnestly that God would send the elephants away.
   When we arrived at our destination, we were told that the elephants had
been seen leaving the area, but we still prayed that they would not come
near our meetings and would not keep anyone from coming to the meet-
ings.
   Then there was the problem of rain. During the rainy season, we could
expect it to rain all day and all night. Again we prayed that God would
keep the rain away. The morning of our first meeting dawned rainy. Rain
fell until mid-afternoon, then it stopped until the meetings ended. Not
once during the meetings did it rain! And not once did we see an elephant!
The one hundred or so people who came to the meetings noticed these
miracles, and their faith was strengthened.
   On the final Sabbath, we planned an all-day celebration. We met near a
stream for Sabbath School and worship service, celebrated the baptism of
22 new believers, and had an afternoon praise service. Not once during
this time did it rain, not even a drop. But about 7:00 P.M. it began raining
and poured all night and most of the next day.
   We thank God for keeping the rain and the elephants at bay so that His
children could come and listen to God’s precious truths without fear.
   Your mission offerings help fund such evangelistic efforts and help pay
for the Global Mission worker who is following up the interests and nur-
turing the new believers in this area. Thank God, and thank you.

      Daily Wisdom




      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Pss. 19:7-14; 119:98-105;
      Prov. 3:13-16; 30:8, 9; Matt. 13:22; 16:26; Rom. 12:17, 18; 13:1-4.

Memory Text: “From infancy you have known the holy Scrip-
      tures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith
      in Christ Jesus” (2 Timothy 3:15, NIV).

Key Thought: Scripture provides us with a lot of wisdom for
      our daily lives.

              s we’ve been studying, though the Bible deals with grand

      A       themes of universal importance, such as the great controversy,
              the fall of Lucifer, and the death of Jesus as a sacrifice for the
      sins of the world, it’s also a book of practical wisdom. In it, we are
      given guidance for daily life. Though the Bible might not be specific
      (how could it?), the Lord through His Word has given us wonderful
      principles that—if followed and obeyed—will make a great difference
      in how we live, because it will impact the choices we make.
        How important that when confronted with choices—whether about
      family relationships, social relationships, work, money, or leadership
      responsibilities—we have divine guidance. And why not? The God
      who knows when a sparrow falls (Matt. 10:29) obviously cares about
      us and wants what’s best for us; thus, we can be sure that if we are
      open to His leading, if we are willing to open His Word with rever-
      ence, submission, and faith, He will guide us.
        This week we’ll look more at the wisdom God shares with us
      through His Word.

     The Source of Wisdom
       Everyone, every day, is confronted with choices, with decisions that
     must be made. As we all know, wrong choices are made every day too.
     Often selfishness is at the core of these choices, because—as fallen
     beings—we are, above all, selfish beings. How often, too, our wrong
     choices bring pain and suffering upon ourselves and others.

Think back about some wrong choices you have made and their dread-
     ful consequences, not to berate yourself (there is forgiveness and
     healing at the Cross!) but simply to enforce the point that wrong
     decisions can be costly.

       The good news is that God has given us His Word as a light and
     guide for us sinful, selfish beings (Ps. 119:105).
       In the Bible we can find principles that can give us the wisdom we
     need to make the right decisions, particularly on moral issues.

Read Psalms 19:7-14, 119:98-105, Proverbs 3:13-16, and John 17:17.
     What promises and principles are found in these texts that can
     help us correctly make important moral decisions?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       It’s one thing to read about biblical principles; it’s wholly another to
     follow them. As the psalmist said: “And in keeping of them there is
     great reward” (Ps. 19:11). The wisdom found in the Bible is useless
     unless applied. There are a lot of people out there who, though know-
     ing the biblical principles, act contrary to them anyway. As Christians
     not only do we need to know what the Bible says; we need to obey
     what it says. Only then can we truly have the wisdom available to us
     through God’s Word. A wise person isn’t someone who simply has
     head knowledge or who can recite text after text; a wise person is
     someone who acts upon the truths given to us through Scripture.

      What important decisions are you facing? Have you consulted
      the Scriptures as you face these decisions? Think through care-
      fully the consequences of your choices. What Bible promises can
      you claim as you seek to make the right decision regarding your
      choices?




                                                                           89

      Social Wisdom
         As humans we have our private lives, the lives we live at home
      behind closed doors; at the same time, we are also social creatures,
      living in a society with other people who do not share with us our pri-
      vacy and intimacy.
         Indeed, we are not only private persons but public citizens. Here,
      too, we can find wisdom in God’s Word on how we can best live in our
      various communities.

In an earlier lesson, we looked at how obedience to the Ten Command-
      ments could impact our family relationships. Read them again
      (Exod. 20:1-17) and ask yourself how following these principles
      will contribute to better social relationships, as well.

        It has been estimated that throughout the centuries humanity has
      enacted more than thirty-two million laws, all in an effort to regulate
      human conduct. Often these laws are changed and abrogated in order
      to be kept up to date. Not so with the Ten Commandments; the prin-
      ciples behind them are unchanging and eternal, principles that can
      guide us in our private and public lives.
        The Bible gives us wisdom regarding how we can best live as citi-
      zens within the larger community. Scripture provides us with more
      principles that, if followed, can make us better citizens and better wit-
      nesses for the Lord in the public arena.

What wisdom do you find in Jeremiah 29:7; Romans 12:17, 18; 13:1-4;
      and 1 Peter 2:13, 14, 17, that will help us better function in soci-
      ety? What other texts can you think of? As you read these verses,
      ask yourself: How am I best able to apply these words to the par-
      ticular society in which I live?

     Wisdom in the Workplace
        Scripture acknowledges the reality and need of human work. Adam
     and Eve, as soon as they were created, were asked to dress and keep the
     Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:15). Even after the devastation of sin (Gen. 3:
     17-19), work was designed to be a blessing for humanity (Eccles. 3:22).
     Furthermore, the Bible recorded the teaching of Paul, who said that if a
     man refused to work, he had no right to eat (2 Thess. 3:10). Jesus was no
     less than 30 years of age when He emerged into public life (Luke 3:23),
     and the Bible says that people knew Him as a carpenter (Mark 6:3).
        We know that obeying God’s will is related to obeying His written
     Word. When we obey God’s Word, we are obeying His will. But where
     the Bible reflects His general will, His will for our lives is specific.
     Though the Lord presents general principles on how to live, we can
     use those principles to guide us in the more specific areas of our lives,
     such as in our work.
        Inasmuch as the Bible speaks about the need for humans to work,
     and that working is a major activity of human beings, it’s no surprise
     that the Bible gives us wisdom regarding work.
What principles found in the following texts can apply to our work
     situation?
     Eccles. 9:10

       The Bible shows some specific attitudes and characteristics of a
     good worker, which includes good use of time (Matt. 25:14-28), dili-
     gence (Prov. 12:24), integrity, and respect for authority (Eph. 6:5, 6).
     Most important, we should be honest in all our dealings, either as an
     employee or as an employer (Prov. 11:1).
      What areas do you struggle with the most in your job, at least
      as far as following biblical principles? What’s the reason for
      your struggles? What practical choices can you make to better
      follow biblical principles regarding work?

     The Bible and Wealth
       “ ‘Give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily
     bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say,
     “Who is the Lord?” Or I may become poor and steal, and so dis-
     honor the name of my God’ ” (Prov. 30:8, 9, NIV).

Read the above text. What wisdom is found here that can help us all
     deal with the topic of money and wealth?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

       Time and again we read in the Bible about how dangerous wealth can
     be to the spiritual well-being of the followers of the Lord. In His divine
     foresight the Lord saw the coming apostasy of ancient Israel, saying,
     “and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat” (Deut.
     31:20; see also Deut. 32:15), and in that state they will turn away from
     Him and serve other gods. At the same time, the Bible talks about the
     slothfulness and laziness that can lead to poverty, which can in its own
     way lead to sin and ruin. Both pitfalls need to be avoided.

Read Matthew 13:22, 16:26, 19:24, and 1 Timothy 6:10. What do these
     texts say about the potential dangers of wealth?

        Money can do strange things to people. Unlike food, water, or rest,
     no matter how much money people make, it never seems enough.
     Sometimes, in fact, the richer people are, the greedier they become.
     Scripture, however, gives us principles that can help us better under-
     stand how we should relate to money and the gathering of wealth. In
     our desire for money, how crucial that we remember that in the end,
     the only treasure that lasts is the “treasure in heaven” (Mark 10:21).

      What do you think the Bible means when it talks about “treas-
      ure in heaven”? What is this treasure in heaven, how do we get
      it, and how can focusing on it help protect us from the pitfalls of
      seeking too much treasure here on earth?

     Wise Leadership
       Let’s face it: In this world, as it exists now, there will always be a
     place and a role for leaders of one kind or another.
       Unfortunately, oftentimes people who rise to the level of leadership
     will seize the opportunity to serve themselves without thinking of the
     people they are leading. The Bible gives examples of unselfish and
     successful leaders such as Moses, as well as dangerous and immoral
     ones, such as King Herod.

Read Matthew 20:25-27. What important principle about leadership
     comes from these verses?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

Look at Matthew 20:28. How did Jesus manifest this principle of a
     leader serving others in His own life? What can we take from His
     example for ourselves?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        According to Robert Greenleaf, a servant-leader is one who is a serv-
     ant first. “It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to
     serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The
     difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant—first to
     make sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served.
     The best test is: Do those served grow as persons; do they, while being
     served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely
     themselves to become servants?”—The Power of Servant Leadership
     (San Francisco: Berrett-Kochler Publishers, Inc., 1998), p. 4.
        If all leaders in the past two thousand years had followed the lead-
     ership style of Jesus, how different human history would have been!
        Of course, leaders who are willing to serve are few and far between.
     But as Christians, we should be in the forefront of showing just how
     it can be done.

      Are you in any kind of leadership role at all? If so, how well are
      you reflecting the principle about leadership revealed here

    Discussion Questions:
3         ●
          1 How can faithfulness in paying tithes and giving offerings help
          protect us against the dangers of greed?

          ●2 How seriously do we in our daily lives go to the Bible for wis-
          dom in making decisions? As a class, talk about how, in a practi-
          cal way, we can do that. Pick a few examples, such as Should I
          marry this person? Should I take this job? Should I move? How
          can you find in the Bible answers to these specific questions? Or
          can you?

          ●
          3 Discuss the question of leadership, and how easy it is for lead-
          ers to become selfish and use their power for selfish instead of
          selfless reasons. What have been some class members’ experi-
          ences in this area? What have you learned that could be of bene-
          fit to others?

A Better Way
by LUKA INDI
  John and Nora Omanga live in southern Sudan, where they belonged to
the major Protestant church in the area. One day Luka, a friend from their
church, came to visit.
  “I have found a better way,” he said. “I have found God’s true church.”
John and Nora listened as Luka explained. “I wondered why our church
kept Sunday and asked our priest. He said that in Greek the word Sabbath
means Sunday. But now I have learned the truth.” Luka opened his Bible,
written in the Moro language, and translated it for John and Nora.
  The couple listened to Luka and wondered if what he said was true. The
two men began studying the Bible together. John had no Bible of his own,
so he tried to memorize what Luka read.
  One day two Global Mission pioneers came to their area. They helped
people work in their gardens in order to get to know them. When the pio-
neers learned of John and Nora’s interest in the Bible, they offered to study
with them. Eagerly the couple agreed. Three months later John and Nora
joined the Adventist Church.
  The chief had given the pioneers permission to live in the area, but when
the local priest learned what they were doing, he angrily demanded that
the chief send the pioneers away. The chief had given his word and could
not make them leave, but he threatened to cane anyone who became an
Adventist.
  When the chief learned that John and Nora had become Seventh-day
Adventists, he cursed them, saying that deadly snakes would strike them.
  One day as John worked in his garden, a large viper leaped at him. He
managed to kill it before it struck him, but John remembered the curse and
prayed earnestly for God’s protection.
  On a hot sticky night some weeks later, the family slept outside their hut
to avoid the mosquitoes that swarmed inside. Later, a noise awoke them,
and they found their hut engulfed in flames. The family lost nearly every-
thing, but they were safe. “For once we were glad that mosquitoes had
driven us out of the house,” John said.
  Recently believers in their area have received the first Bibles in
Avokaya, their own language. Now they can explain Bible truths to others
in their own language.
  Our mission offerings support Global Mission pioneers and other evan-
gelistic outreaches in Sudan and other countries around the world.

        LESSON            12 *June 16-22
      Growing Through the
      Word


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt 22:37, 38; Gal.
      2:20; 5:14; Eph. 4:14, 15; Heb. 4:2; 5:12-14.

Memory Text: “We will no longer be infants. . . . We will in all
      things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ”
      (Ephesians 4:14, 15, NIV).

Key Thought: The Bible plays a pivotal role in our spiritual
      growth.

             he Bible makes it clear that our walk with Christ doesn’t end on

      T      the day of conversion. On the contrary, when people give them-
             selves totally to Christ, they begin a whole new life, a whole
      new existence (Rom. 6:4). It’s not that a new Christian has to work to
      reach salvation, as in other faiths; instead, because he or she already
      has salvation, already stands perfect and accepted in God, the
      Christian begins to live a life that reveals and reflects that salvation.
      Sure, we are saved by faith, but what kind of faith? A faith that is
      expressed in a life that reveals a commitment to Jesus Christ.
        Central to our new life in Christ is spiritual growth. As Christians,
      we can’t remain static: We are always in the process of change as we
      should better reflect the image of Jesus Christ. And crucial to the
      whole growth process is the Word of God, which shows us how and
      why we must “grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
      Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 3:18, NIV).
        This week we’ll study about what it means to grow in Christ, and
      we’ll see the pivotal role the Word of God must play in that growth.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, June 23.

     The Need for Growth
       When Nicodemus went to see Jesus by night and asked Him how to
     have eternal life, Jesus immediately answered by saying that we need
     to be born again (John 3:3, 5). This condition indicates that a
     Christian life begins as a baby. When the beginning of Christian life is
     portrayed as a new birth, and the new believer is considered a babe in
     Christ, it’s important for every Christian to be nurtured and have
     opportunity to grow into spiritual maturity.
       Peter appealed to the believers to “grow in the grace and knowledge
     of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 3:18, NIV). Earlier, after
     using a new-birth illustration (1 Pet. 1:23), Peter urged those to whom
     he was writing to desire the “milk of the word” by which they would
     grow (1 Pet. 2:1-3).

Read Hebrews 5:12-14. What point is Paul making here about spir-
     itual growth? How does he define spiritual immaturity, and how
     does he contrast it to spiritual maturity?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

        In 2 Corinthians 7:1, Paul shows that accepting Jesus isn’t the end
     of our spiritual walk but the beginning. There is a need for growth.
     “Perfecting holiness” means to bring it to completion. He also in
     Ephesians admonished followers of Christ to lead a life worthy of
     their calling (Eph. 4:1).
        It’s clear from the Word that though we are saved by faith, though
     our acceptance with God is based on the righteousness of Jesus cred-
     ited to us by grace through faith alone, the Christian life is one of spir-
     itual and moral progress. We are to change, and for the better; we are
     to reflect more and more the character of God (see 1 Pet. 1:14-16).

      Look over your life as a Christian, regardless of how long you
      have been one. In what areas have you seen much spiritual growth
      and maturity? What are the weaker areas? Why, as you seek to
      advance in the Christian life, must your hope of salvation rest not
      on yourself but only on Jesus and the merits of His righteousness?

     Growing in Faith
       In Hebrews 3 and 4 Paul talked about the children of Israel, who,
     after escaping from Egypt, had wandered in the desert for 40 years.
     What’s most fascinating, however, is what Paul said about them in
     Hebrews 4:2.
Read Hebrews 4:2. What was the problem with the children of Israel?
     What crucial element was lacking?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

       What makes the answer so troubling is the fact that this generation
     had so much evidence of God’s leading. Go back over the story of the
     Exodus and of what happened to them in the desert. God performed
     miracle after miracle, everything from the parting of the Red Sea to
     the daily provision of the manna. And yet, they still lacked faith!

What lessons about faith, about what it means to have faith, can we
     draw from this account? See Heb. 3:12.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

       So often people think that if only they had more signs, more evi-
     dence, their faith in God would grow. But it doesn’t work that way.
     Faith, or the lack thereof, isn’t an intellectual matter, or even a matter
     of signs and wonders. It’s a matter of the heart. We can grow in faith
     only to the degree that we surrender our hearts and souls to the Lord;
     we can grow in faith only through exercising our faith; we can grow in
     faith only to the degree that we study God’s Word with a heart open to
     learn from Him.
       God is the Source of faith, but we must put our trust in Him. Faith
     grows through study of the Word (Rom. 10:17), but we must take the
     time and put forth the effort for that study. The more we study, with a
     heart and mind surrendered to the Lord, the more we know about our
     loving God. And the more we know Him, the more we love and trust
     Him. The more we can trust Him, the more we do whatever He wants
     us to do. Study of the Word of God is absolutely essential if we want
     our faith to grow.
      A number of years ago a scholar left Christianity. He told some-
      one later, “Had I kept up reading my Bible, studying it, and apply-
      ing it to my life, I probably wouldn’t have lost my faith.” How pre-
      cious is your faith to you? You can know the answer by this simple
      question: How carefully do you guard and nurture that faith?

     Growing in Love
        The Scriptures say that we are to love God with all our heart, soul, and
     mind, and love our neighbors as ourselves. We are to love our enemies
     and our fellow believers. These are God’s commands, and they aren’t
     always easy to follow, because we are by nature selfish sinners who love
     self above and beyond everything else. If you love someone, usually it
     is someone who loves you back. But the Scriptures say that’s not enough
     (Matt. 5:44). It really takes growing in the Lord to be able to love, not
     only those who don’t love you, but those who are your enemies.

Read 1 Corinthians 13:8. What point is Paul making? Why is that
     point so important? What does that point tell us about the impor-
     tance and power of love? See also Matt. 22:37, 38; Gal. 5:14; 1 John
     3:14; 4:7, 8, 16.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

        The word love is used so often that it is easy to lose sight of what it
     actually means. Biblical examples show that love is something we do
     rather than simply an emotion. Scripture speaks about love as attitude
     and actions (1 Corinthians 13). We know that love will motivate us to
     action. The Bible clearly gives an example of what true love really is:
     “This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for
     us” (1 John 3:16, NIV). To love at this level, we need to get beyond
     our own rights, our own interests, and our own hurts; and we can do
     this only through the power of God, only as we grow in Him and His
     grace.
        How often have you ever been wrong, wrong about theology, wrong
     about doctrine, wrong about the motives of other people? And yet,
     love never fails; that is, whatever errors and mistakes we make, we can
     never go wrong when we love others. We might make a million mis-
     takes, but love can never be one, not when we are commanded to love
     even our enemies. It’s hard to imagine what our witness would be like
     if all who professed the name of Christ loved the way Christ loved.

      Look at your recent actions toward the people you frequently
      come in contact with. What do your actions say about how well
      you love these people, if at all? What do these actions say to you
      about your own need to learn more about how to love as God
      would have us love?


                                                                            99

      Growing in Christ
Read Ephesians 4:14, 15. How does Paul here describe growth in
      Christ?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

        Considering that the Bible is our final authority on all doctrine, how
      crucial then that studying the Word is for us to grow in Christ. Only
      through knowing the Word and what it teaches can we be protected
      from the “sleight of men.”
        Yet, it’s not enough just to read the Bible. It needs to be obeyed. We
      need to follow what it says; otherwise, it will effect no change in us.
      By obeying, by seeking to be like Christ in our words, in acts, and
      even in our minds, we will grow in Him.
        Paul wrote to the Romans that we are called to be like Christ (Rom.
      8:28, 29), and that should be in every way possible, especially in our
      thoughts (2 Cor. 10:5), because if our thoughts are right, our words
      and actions and attitudes will be too. By keeping our hearts pure, our
      words and actions will be, as well.

Read Galatians 2:20. What crucial element about how we can grow
      in the Lord is revealed here?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         We can never grow in Christ, into Christian maturity, without a sur-
      render of self. Paul talked about his being crucified so that Jesus could
      live in him instead. We are no longer to follow the whims and the pas-
      sions of the flesh but, rather, the commands of God. Our decisions are
      no longer based only on just what we think; rather, Christ is now Lord
      of our lives, and our actions should reveal His Lordship in us. This
      surrender is a day-by-day process, something that must be part of our
      walk with Christ. The moment we start letting self rule, sin lies at the
      door, and sin leads to death.

       What are some of your own experiences with surrendering to
       Christ? What happens? How do you feel? What are the results?
       What have you learned that you could share with others who are
       seeking the same experience? Share your answers with your
       class on Sabbath.

      Growing in the Spirit
        Jesus told Nicodemus that “ ‘no one can enter the kingdom of God
      unless he is born of water and the Spirit’ ” (John 3:5, NIV). Born of
      water means baptism, and born of the Spirit is conversion, which
      means that the Holy Spirit comes within us at the moment of spiritual
      birth. As a baby needs to grow, the newly baptized member needs to
      grow in the Spirit. “ ‘When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide
      you into all truth’ ” (John 16:13, NIV). This means that the Spirit has
      a very important role to guide every Christian into all truth by remind-
      ing us of the things that the Bible says, because the truth is the Word
      of God (John 17:17). The Spirit also has the role of convicting us
      about our own spiritual condition (see John 16:8).
        As we grow in Christian living, we need to grow in the Spirit.
      Growing in the Spirit means that we are more and more sensitive to
      His leading; we know that He is talking to us because we know the
      Word of God, and the Spirit will guide us to the Word.

How can we grow in the Spirit? Read the texts listed below. What prin-
      ciples needed for spiritual growth are found there?

        Jesus in Luke 11:13 makes it clear how readily available the Holy
      Spirit is for those who want Him. Yet, God never forces Himself upon
      us. He has shown us who He is and what He has done for us. We, our-
      selves, in our hearts, have to make the daily choices—choices of faith,
      obedience, surrender, confession—that will enable us to grow in grace
      and in the Spirit or that will lead us toward eternal ruin.
       Is there anything in your life, such as what you read or watch or
       do, that could be desensitizing you to the influence of the Holy
       Spirit? What might those things be? Why not let the Holy Spirit,
       right now, convict you about what you need to do regarding
       these things? After all, the longer you wait, the harder it will
       become even to heed His voice.

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “Growing Up Into Christ,”
          pp. 67–75 in Steps to Christ.

             “The Author of this spiritual life is unseen, and the exact method by
          which that life is imparted and sustained, it is beyond the power of
          human philosophy to explain. Yet the operations of the Spirit are
          always in harmony with the written word. As in the natural, so in the
          spiritual world. The natural life is preserved moment by moment by
          divine power; yet it is not sustained by a direct miracle, but through
          the use of blessings placed within our reach. So the spiritual life is
1         sustained by the use of those means that Providence has supplied. If
          the follower of Christ would grow up ‘unto a perfect man, unto the
          measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ’ (Ephesians 4:13), he
          must eat of the bread of life and drink of the water of salvation. He
          must watch and pray and work, in all things giving heed to the instruc-
          tions of God in His word.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles,
2         pp. 284, 285.
             “The work of educating the mind and manners may be carried for-
          ward to perfection. If those who profess the truth do not now improve
          their privileges and opportunities to grow up to the full stature of men
          and women in Christ Jesus, they will be no honor to the cause of truth,
          no honor to Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
          vol. 4, pp. 358, 359.

Joining the Opposition
  Moshe lives in an isolated village in eastern India. One day Sattepondu,
a Bible worker, and a pastor arrived in Moshe’s village. The men visited
homes, introducing themselves and offering to teach the people about
Jesus. Some villagers objected to having Christians in their village. They
threw stones at the men and tried to chase them out of the village. But the
men did not leave.
  Sattepondu began studying with those who wanted to know about
Christ, and soon 25 villagers came to his little study group.
  But Moshe and most of the other villagers wanted nothing to do with
Christians. Moshe threw stones at Sattepondu and told the district police
that Christians were disturbing his village. The police took Sattepondu to
the station for questioning. Angry villagers filed complaints. “If these
people don’t want you in their village, why do you stay and force your reli-
gion on them?” the officer asked.
  Sattepondu answered, “I am not forcing religion on these people. I sim-
ply teach those who want to learn.”
  Meanwhile, when the new believers learned of Sattepondu’s arrest, they
marched to the police station to demand his release. After eight hours of
questioning, Sattepondu was released.
  More villagers joined the Bible study group. When Sattepondu
announced evangelistic meetings, Moshe and his friends did not object. In
fact, Moshe attended the meetings to see what these Christians taught. He
saw the positive changes these Christians were making in the village, and
he listened to the sermons. At the end of the meetings some seventy peo-
ple were baptized, but Moshe was not among them.
  While the new believers started building a small church, Sattepondu
visited those who had attended the meetings and invited them to come to
Christ. Finally Moshe stopped fighting and accepted Jesus as his Lord.
  Other villagers opposed the new church and again asked the police to
stop the building. But this time Moshe stood with the Christians. He
pleaded with officials on behalf of the church and the believers in his vil-
lage. Some noticed that Moshe had switched sides and asked him why.
Moshe answered, “I have met Jesus. I know this God is the true God.”
  Moshe’s village now has a small church, and the villagers once more live
in peace. Moshe once opposed Christians, but now he leads them as the
local elder of his church. Most of his family have become Christians. Today
in Moshe’s village, one out of five people is a Seventh-day Adventist.

        LESSON            13 *June 23-29
      The Word of God
      Endures


      SABBATH AFTERNOON
Read for This Week’s Study: Mic. 6:8, John 3:14-17,
      10:10, Rom. 4:21, Eph. 2:8, Phil. 4:7, 2 Pet. 3:9.

Memory Text: “ ‘All men are like grass, and all their glory is
      like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
      but the word of the Lord stands forever’ ” (1 Peter 1:24, 25, NIV).

Key Thought: The relevance of the Bible is for us today.

                any ancient texts are still in existence, everything from the

      M         Egyptian Book of the Dead to the Ugaritic legend of Keret
                to the writings of Aristotle, Epictetus, and Julius Caesar. But
      none of these command the kind of influence, power, and authority
      that the Bible has had and still continues to have today.
        Yes, the Word of God endures, even in a world of space shuttles,
      high-definition television, cell phones, and laptops. And that’s
      because, regardless of the many advances in science and technology,
      and art and culture, we are still human beings struggling with the
      same issues that humans have struggled with from the beginning.
      Issues about life, death, happiness, health, morals, family—these
      remain essentially unchanged across time. And the Bible’s answers to
      them remains essentially unchanged, as well.
        This week, our final week in this quarter, we’ll look more at why the
      Word of God endures.

     The Word of God Today
       For many people, the Bible has no relevance now. Their reasons,
     though varied, can be boiled down to (1) the Book is so old; (2) the
     Book came from a relatively small group of people, the Jews; (3) the
     world is so different today than in the days that the Book was written
     that it can’t possibly be relevant anymore.

How would you answer those objections?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     ____________________________________________________________________

        The problem with those arguments can be boiled down to one thing:
     the premise upon which they are founded. If one believes that the
     Bible is merely a human book, a book composed only by humans
     expressing their own cultural ideas, then the argument would be valid.
        However, as Christians, we reject that premise. We believe that the
     Bible is the Word of God; we believe that God, the Creator, has spo-
     ken to us through the Bible. We believe that He has revealed His will
     to all humanity through the Book. That it was written long ago or writ-
     ten by a small group of people or written in a world vastly different
     from today—all these things make no difference if we believe that
     God has spoken to us through the Bible.

Below are some texts that address issues found in the Bible. As you
     read these texts, ask yourself: (1) What issues are being
     addressed? (2) How relevant are those issues to us today?

     Mic. 6:8
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 10:10
     ____________________________________________________________________

     John 17:3
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Acts 17:31
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Phil. 4:7
     ____________________________________________________________________

      Think about each of the topics listed above; if we didn’t have the
      Bible, what answers would we have to these issues? Think how
      different your life would be were you left without the guidance,
      hope, and promises offered us in the Bible. Meanwhile, what can
      you do to help make what the Bible offers you more real for
      yourself?

                                                                       105
                 M ONDAY June 25

      God’s Everlasting Plan
        “But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of
      his heart through all generations” (Ps. 33:11, NIV).

What important principle found in that text helps us understand the
      relevancy of the Bible today?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

What are the purposes of God’s heart? See John 3:14-17, 1 Tim. 2:4,
      2 Pet. 3:9.
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________

         The Bible is relevant today because the plans of God are revealed in
      it; the plan of salvation has been made known to us through the Word,
      and that salvation is to be for all people in every generation. “Many
      are the plans in a man’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails”
      (Prov. 19:21, NIV).
         God is an eternal God (Deut. 33:27); He has an eternal kingdom
      (Dan. 2:44); His will for us as expressed in the Bible has not changed
      with the passing of time, for He never changes: “Jesus Christ is the
      same yesterday and today and forever” (Heb. 13:8, NIV). “ ‘You will
      roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you
      remain the same, and your years will never end’ ” (Heb. 1:12, NIV).
         Sure, times change, cultures change, attitudes change, and people
      change. Change is a fact of life; we see it all around us. But God
      Himself and His purposes for us remain the same.
         Hence, it makes no difference that the Bible was written many cen-
      turies ago, or in a different culture; what matters is that God’s love for
      us, and His desire for our salvation, remains the same, all through the
      ages.
         This, then, is the secret of the Bible: It’s relevant today because the
      God revealed in its pages is relevant today.

       Think about all the changes that take place, either in your own
       life or in the world around you or both. Look at how much insta-
       bility there is everywhere. Amid all this, what does it mean to
       you that the Lord’s love for us and plan for our salvation never
       changes? What hope and assurance can you draw from this
       important truth?

               T UESDAY June 26

     The Eternal Cross
        Perhaps the most significant reason the Bible is so relevant today is
     that it is God’s chosen means of revealing to us the most important
     truth we can ever know: Jesus dying on the cross and rising from the
     grave. As long as this great truth is taught to us, what does it matter
     how old the Bible is or who wrote it or under what circumstances?
     What matters is that through it God has revealed to us the great truth
     of salvation through Jesus, a truth that will endure through all eternity,
     long after this old earth has vanished and a new one created. Thus, as
     long as the Word of God reveals to us Christ and Him crucified, its rel-
     evance for our fallen world will never end.
Look up the following texts. What messages do they have for us? As
     you read them, ask yourself, “Were it not for the Bible, where else
     could I have learned the truths taught here?”

     Isa. 65:17
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Matt. 24:30
     ____________________________________________________________________

     1 Cor. 6:3

     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rev. 20:14
     ____________________________________________________________________

     Rev. 21:4
     ____________________________________________________________________

      Going over the texts listed above, write out the scenario pre-
      sented to us here. Look at what has been revealed to us in the
      Bible. These are the promises we have been given. Why should
      this mean so much to each of us? Share your response with your
      class on Sabbath.

                                                                          107

      Unbroken Promises
         “ ‘Praise be to the Lord, who has given rest to his people Israel
      just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good prom-
      ises he gave through his servant Moses’ ” (1 Kings 8:56, NIV).

        The Word of God exists forever because His promises never fail.
      Unlike human promises that are frequently broken, God always keeps
      His.

Read Romans 4:21. What hope is found in there for us? How have
      you experienced the reality of this text?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

Read John 16:33. What special promise is here for all of us? How have
      you experienced the reality of that promise in your own life?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

Read Matthew 28:20. How have you experienced the reality of this
      promise?
      ____________________________________________________________________
      ____________________________________________________________________
      _______________________________________________________________________

         God also has given us His promises for everlasting life (John 3:15),
      answers to prayer (Matt. 7:7), unlimited blessings (Mark 9:23),
      removal of obstacles (Luke 17:6), spiritual fullness (John 6:35), sal-
      vation (Rom. 1:16), help with temptation (Heb. 2:18), and victory
      (James 4:7). “It is in these promises that Christ communicates to us
      His grace and power. They are leaves from the tree that is ‘for the heal-
      ing of the nations.’ Rev. 22:2. Received, assimilated, they are to be the
      strength of the character, the inspiration and sustenance of the life.
      Nothing else can have such healing power.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Ministry of Healing, p. 122.

       What promises are you still waiting for to see fulfilled? How can
       you cling to the Lord in hope and trust in the meantime?

     The Bible Endures . . .
       Throughout history people have made predictions about the
     inevitable demise of the Bible, that it would soon fade into obscurity
     and be seen as nothing but an interesting historical relic of a bygone
     era, and on and on . . .
       How wrong those predictions have been!

Read Matthew 24:35. How, in a sense, did these words of Jesus pre-
     dict, many centuries ago, that the Bible would be around even to
     the last days?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

        Besides all the attempts to destroy the Bible through violence, the
     enemy of souls has tried to use science, philosophy, and higher criti-
     cism to eradicate the influence of the Bible. And yet, today, millions
     and millions of people believe in the Bible as God’s Word and seek to
     claim its promises and live by its commands. Should this be a sur-
     prise? Of course not! After all, as we have been told: “The grass with-
     ereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever”
     (Isa. 40:8).
        Meanwhile, according to the United Bible Societies: “At the start of
     the nineteenth century, Scriptures were available in just 68 languages.
     Today, Scriptures are available in no less than 2,303 languages, with
     the complete Bible having been translated into at least 405 languages,
     and the New Testament into some 1,034. In addition, portions of the
     Bible have been made available in some 864 languages.” (See
     www.biblesociety.org.)

Read 1 Peter 1:24, 25. Consider that these words were written about
     nearly two thousand years ago. What message is here for us,
     today? How should these words help us trust in the Bible, in its
     promises and in its warnings?
     ____________________________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________________________

      The Bible endures, now and forever. The question is, What has
      it done in our lives? The Word can be on our shelves, on our
      desks, and even in our minds, but unless we allow it into our
      hearts, what good does it do? Look at your life. What does it say
      about how you relate to the enduring Word?



                                                                       109

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “The Scriptures a Safeguard,”
          pp. 593–602, The Great Controversy.

            “God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and
          the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all
          reforms. The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science, the
          creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and dis-
          cordant as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the
1         majority—not one nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for
          or against any point of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine
          or precept, we should demand a plain ‘Thus saith the Lord’ in its sup-
          port.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 595.

            “The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the
2         redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will behold
          Christ crucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose power cre-
          ated and upheld the unnumbered worlds through the vast realms of
          space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom cherub
          and shining seraph delighted to adore—humbled Himself to uplift
          fallen man; that He bore the guilt and shame of sin, and the hiding of
          His Father’s face, till the woes of a lost world broke His heart and
          crushed out His life on Calvary’s cross. That the Maker of all worlds,
3         the Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory and humiliate
          Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and adoration
          of the universe.”—Page 651.

    Discussion Questions:
           ●
           1 As a class, go over your responses to Tuesday’s final question.
           What can you learn from each other?

           ●
           2 As a church family, what areas do you need to apply with more
           rigor the principles found in the Bible? How can you as a class
           help the church realize where it’s falling short and then help it
           reach a higher standard?

           ●3 Talk about the question of Bible promises that have yet to be
           fulfilled, or that look as if they can’t be fulfilled, at least as we
           would like. For example: Someone prayed for a sick friend or
           spouse or child who didn’t recover. How do we help each other
           grapple with these situations in light of the Word of God and the
           promises that we have in it?

“I Don’t Want to Go”
by ELSA VELASCO
   Inday is a natural leader among the students in our little school in the
mountains of the southern Philippines. She loved the Sabbath and loved
worshiping with us. Then one day she seemed sad. I could tell something
troubled her. Then she confided her problem to me. “My father does not
want me to waste an entire day in church on Sabbath,” she said, hanging
her head. “I do not dare disobey, or his fury will come down on me.”
On Sabbath morning Inday did not come to help me carry Sabbath School
materials to the church. I missed her sweet voice singing along the trails.
As my teammate and I walked toward the church carrying our materials,
we saw Inday walking quickly down the path behind her mother. She was
not dressed for church. We waved at her, but she ducked her head and hur-
ried on.
   I asked a neighbor child about Inday, and she said Inday’s father had
scolded her that morning. “Inday wanted to come to Sabbath School, but
her father said she had to go with her mother to the big town down the
mountain.” We all prayed that God would be with Inday that day.
   Later that evening Inday came to my hut. She told me that she and her
mother had planned to go to the city. They reached the next village where
they would catch a ride down the mountain. “But I was praying that God
would not send a jeep, so I would not dishonor the Sabbath,” Inday said
shyly. Normally several jeeps make the trip every day. But Inday and her
mother had waited all day, and no jeep came. Finally they gave up and
returned to the village empty-handed.
   “Father was angry because the whole day had been wasted,” Inday said.
“But I was glad. God answered my prayer, and I did not violate the
Sabbath.”
   God answered my young friend’s prayer. And He answered our prayers
for her, too. Pray that Inday’s parents will learn the importance of follow-
ing Jesus, just as their daughter has.
   Your mission offerings support Mountain View College, an Adventist
college, which sends young people such as me into the mountain villages
of southern Philippines to teach the people to read and write and give them
the good news that Jesus is their Savior.




When she wrote this, Elsa Velasco was a student missionary from Mountain View College
teaching in Bugahon Mission School in the southern Philippines.

2007    Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter

          This quarter’s study, For Better or Worse: Lessons From Old
       Testament Couples by Gordon and Rosenita Christo, will explore the
       relationships of various married couples in the Old Testament just as
       its title states. The consequences of sin cause more harm than imagi-
       nable. This is nowhere more evident than when it occurs in a mar-
       riage. God clearly intended marriage to be a great blessing to us. This
       quarter we will examine the lessons of faith, hope, trust, and love
       along with what it means to be a follower of Christ in this fallen world.
Lesson 1—Adam and Eve: The Intended Ideal
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: The Image of God (Gen. 1:27, Deut. 32:11, Hos. 13:8)
       MONDAY: A Suitable Helper (Gen. 2:18)
       TUESDAY: Husband and Wife (1 Cor. 11:11, 12)
       WEDNESDAY: Two Are Better Than One (Gen. 39:15, 18)
       THURSDAY: The Curse on the Relationship (Gen. 3:16)
       Memory Text—Genesis 2:24
       Sabbath Gem: The marriage of Adam and Eve began better than
       any fairy tale. God provided them with everything they needed.
       After sin entered into their lives, the fairy tale became far from per-
       fect. It is a powerful reminder of the detrimental cost of sin. A les-
       son that clearly demonstrates how deviation from God’s will can
       cause us great pain, and how our heavenly Father indeed knows how
       best to supply all of our needs if we trust completely in Him.
Lesson 2—Abraham and Sarah: Faith Tested and Tried
       The Week at a Glance:
       SUNDAY: Human Solutions for God’s Promise (Gen. 15:6, Rom. 4:3)
       MONDAY: Telling Lies (Gen. 12:11-13)
       TUESDAY: Laughing at God (Gen. 17:15-17)
       WEDNESDAY: Trouble Because of Unbelief (Gen. 16:1-6)
       THURSDAY: Ultimate Demonstration of Faith (Gen. 22:5)
       Memory Text—Hebrews 11:11
       Sabbath Gem: By delaying the birth of their promised child,
       God tested Abraham and Sarah’s faith. When the pair deviate from
       God’s plan for their family, serious consequences occur. Even
       though this couple was faithful, they too were flawed, providing us
       all hope for our relationships.
