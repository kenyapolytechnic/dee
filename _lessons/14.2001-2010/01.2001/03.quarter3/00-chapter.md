           EDITOR'S OVERVIEW
                 "A Chemical Scum"
    After the construction of a building at a famous university, some
 professors wanted these words, from an ancient Greek philosopher,
 placed on the main wall: "Man is the measure of all things." The
 president of the prestigious institution, however, had other notions, and
the sentence that went up instead was: "What is man, that thou art
mindful of him?"
    This story is a minor mirror of two contending world views. One
makes humanity the creator and subject of truth, the other places God
in that role. No middle ground exists between these two positions, no
possibility of compromise, no potential for synthesis. It's either one or
the other.
    As Adventists, there's no doubt which view we take. God is Creator
of truth, the Source of truth, and the Giver of truth. As humans, we
don't originate truth; we merely receive it as a gift . . . and the greatest
gift of truth, ever, was in the person of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer—the
One in whom "we live, and move, and have our being" (Acts 17:28),
the One "in whom we have redemption through his blood" (Eph. 1:7).
    If the Bible is the story of redemption, then it is also the story of
those who are redeemed, those who are on the receiving end of truth.
The Bible, therefore, doesn't center on God in a vacuum; it centers,
instead, on Him in His divine interaction with humankind, on those
redeemed at such an infinite cost to Himself. British astrophysicist
Stephen Hawking once said that humankind was nothing but "a chemi-
cal scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting round a very average star
in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies." He
couldn't be more wrong. Christ didn't die for "a chemical scum." He
died to save beings created in His own image, beings so precious that
they were bought with His own blood (1 Pet. 1:18, 19).
    Thus, however much the gospel is the work of God alone, it's
always the work of God for humankind. The gospel wouldn't be the
gospel were it not "good news" for human beings. To learn about the
gospel is to learn not only about God's unfailing love but about His
unfailing love for His failing and unloving creatures.
    This quarter's Bible Study Guide, Bible Biographies, deals with
numerous people on the receiving end of this unfailing love, even those
who failed in loving back. Special thanks to our principal contributor,
Dr. Wilma McClarty, of Southern Adventist University, who carefully
and thoughtfully looked at the question put on the college wall: "What
is man, that thou art mindful of him?"
    The answer, thanks to God's gift of His Son, is "good news" indeed.

 Bible Biographies: Actors in the Drama
           Called Planet Earth
    The Bible is the Word of God, the inspired account of the Lord's rescue
of fallen humanity. It's a book about God, humankind, and especially about
God's intervention with humankind. From the Genesis narrative of Eden
Lost to Revelation's promise of Eden Restored, the plan of redemption
unfolds through the lives of people.
    Birthed full-grown into the Garden, Adam and Eve, through sin, lost their
perfect environment. Were it not for the promise of salvation, they and their
descendants would have existed with no hope of anything beyond the grave,
which is no hope at all. Instead, through Christ and the promises fulfilled in Him,
these fallen beings have the hope and assurance of eternal life in a world without
sin and all its terrible consequences. They are, in a real sense, "children of the
promise" found in Jesus and the salvation He has secured for us (Rom. 9:8).
    Who are these children, and how have they responded to this promise of
salvation? Saints, sinners, slaves, sovereigns, princes, paupers, pagans, even
prophets—that's who they are. Lovely or loathsome, major or minor, coura-
geous or cowardly, they and their stories are all included in the Bible.
    Through sixty-six books that cover everything from the fall of Lucifer to
life on the new earth, the Bible introduces its readers to just a few hundred
characters out of possible millions. Some get scant treatment; others are
fleshed out in considerable detail. Joseph, for instance, merits twenty-one
chapters (Genesis 30 to 50); Job's wife, in contrast, gets only two verses
(Job 2:9, 10). Yet, lessons exist for us from them all.
     Of necessity, the Bible personalities selected for this quarter's study must
likewise be a sampling: The characters were chosen because they could
(sometimes) be paired with others who under comparable circumstances or in
similar relationships made different choices, choices not unlike those that we,
living on the same planet, often make.
    They, like us, are all part of the drama, the last act even now building
toward a spectacular climax. But no need for fearful suspense—the Bible
tells how the play will end. However, and most importantly, individual
destinies, including our own, await the final resolution.
    Because the last curtain has not yet gone down, because we still act out
our unscripted roles in the play ourselves, because we still can choose Christ
 or Satan, these lessons invite us all (1) to review the lives of the selected
 Bible personalities, (2) to analyze the reasons for their successes and fail-
 ures, (3) to assess our role in the great controversy, and then (4) to apply
what we learn to strengthen our own relationship with Jesus, who through
 His life and death has given us redemption.
    "Now these things happened to them as a warning, but they were written
 down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come" (1 Cor.
10:11, RSV).
     Though our lives are not recorded in Scripture, we are all characters in
 the same drama as those whose lives are revealed in the Book. Let us learn
 from both their triumphs and their failures. Because, in many ways, their
 stories are ours as well.
                                                                                  3

        Christ and Satan:
      Contenders for Control




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 1:1, 2; Ezek. 28:12-15;
Isa. 9:6; Rev. 12:9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And the Word became flesh and dwelt
   among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory,
   glory as of the only Son from the Father" (John 1:14, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The two forces contending for control of planet
Earth had both existed in heaven's perfect environment. Yet Satan's
jealousy over Christ's authority started a controversy that would in-
volve every member of the human race. Bible biographies are, in
essence, a holy record of the choices people made in this conflict and
of how God honored those choices, either for or against Him.

THE TWO FORCES DO BATTLE. Sin began in heaven, in Luci-
fer, whose pride and vanity pushed him into rebelling against the
authority and government of God. Beautiful, brilliant, highly regarded
in the heavenly courts, Lucifer nevertheless was not satisfied with all
that he had been given. He coveted what he could never have: the
authority of Christ Himself. And here, in heaven, with Lucifer, is the
place where all the trouble began.
     " 'How you are fallen from heaven, 0 Day Star, son of Dawn! . . .
You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of
God I will set my throne on high; . . . I will make myself like the Most
High" ' " (Isa. 14:12-14, RSV).
     Though this controversy started in heaven, it moved to the earth,
bringing a new set of characters (the human race) into the conflict—even
if, in the end, the basic issue is the same: Who will rule, Christ or Satan?

WHEN PERFECTION FAILED (Ezek. 28:12-15).

   "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast
perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till
iniquity was found in thee" (Ezek. 28:14, 15).

   The Bible says that Lucifer (depicted in this context under the
image of the king of Tyre) was created perfect. And yet iniquity was
found in him? How could a perfect being have iniquity, especially one
living in a perfect environment like heaven?
   The answer, of course, must be that "perfection" included the
potential for imperfection. Whatever Scripture meant when it said that
Lucifer was "perfect" in his ways, it didn't mean that the potential for
evil wasn't there. The potential must have been there because evil
eventually arose, even in a perfect creature living in a perfect environ-
ment. Whatever being "perfect" meant, it obviously didn't exclude the
possibility of doing wrong.

  How could sin arise in a perfect environment like the one that
existed in heaven?


    No one knows. In fact, to explain sin is, in a sense, to excuse it.
However, one point is clear: God is a God of love (see 1 John 4:8, 16),
and for love to be love, it can never be forced. In other words, even
God cannot force love; for the moment it is forced, it is no longer love.
In the same way that a triangle, in order to be a triangle, must have
three sides—love, to be love, by its very definition as love, must be
free. And if love is the foundation of the environment of heaven, then
it's clear that the potential for not loving, for not obeying, had to exist.
Thus, God created Lucifer free, and Lucifer, using that freedom, made
wrong choices.
    Likewise, we have the same free choices as well.

    God didn't force obedience in heaven. He doesn't force it
 here on earth as well. While in the flesh, Jesus never forced
 anyone to follow Him.
    What implications does that freedom have for us today? How
 can we use it for good or for evil?
    In what ways do we manifest that freedom every day of our
 lives? What are some of the potential dangers inherent in free-
 dom?


                                                                          7

FATHER OF TRUTH, FATHER OF LIES (John 8:44; John 14:6).

   Originally united in purpose, Christ and Satan forever diverged
when Lucifer rebelled. Christ remained the eternal way, the truth, and
the life (John 14:6), and Satan became the "father of lies" (John 8:44,
RSV). In fact, one of the earliest scriptural accounts of Satan estab-
lishes him as a liar: "But the serpent said to the woman, 'You will not
die' " (Gen. 3:4, RSV). These words were spoken in blatant contradic-
tion to the words of the Lord, who specifically warned that if Adam
ate of the forbidden fruit he would "surely die" (Gen. 2:17). Early on
in the Bible, then, the contrast between truth and lies is established.
    The father of lies has passed his perverted skill along to his follow-
ers, even tempting prophets to lie: " 'I have heard what the prophets
have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, "I have dreamed, I
have dreamed!" ' " (Jer. 23:25, NKJV).
    Lying is deemed so bad by God that its prohibition is placed in the
Ten Commandments, right along with warnings against adultery and
murder (Exod. 20:16). In other words, God cares about not just what
we do but what we say as well.

   Give some examples from the Bible of the devastation that believ-
ing and/or telling lies have wrought. Give some examples from mod-
ern life about the effects of lies. Isn't it easy to see just how damaging
this sin can be? Why do you think that even in non-Christian societies
lying is deemed an evil? How could any society or social unit exist if
lying were not deemed an evil to be avoided?

THE SAVIOR, THE ADVERSARY (1 John 2:1; 1 Pet. 5:8; Rev.
12:7-13).

    From His birth, Jesus was identified as Savior of the world: Mary
is told that she " 'will bear a son . . . you shall call his name Jesus, for
he will save his people from their sins' " (Matt. 1:21, RSV).
    In contrast, Revelation 12:7-13 establishes Satan early on as the
adversary to Christ and the accuser of humankind.

 The Hebrew verb stn, from which the name "Satan" is derived,
 means "to accuse," or "to act as an adversary."

   The clearest example of Satan's work as the "accuser" appears in
Zechariah 3. "Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing
before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to
accuse him" (Zech. 3:1, RSV). The verb translated "accuse" in the
text comes from the same three-consonant root (stn) as "Satan" itself.
Thus the name "Satan" means the "accuser." (For a fabulous commen-
tary on this story, and Christ's work in our behalf in meeting these
accusations, read "Joshua and the Angel," in Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 5, pp. 467-476).

  Why is the depiction of Satan as "Your adversary the devil
prowl [ing] around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour"
such an appropriate one? (1 Pet. 5:8, RSV). In what ways does
Satan seek to "devour" us?


   Even people who don't necessarily believe in a literal Satan often
sense a battle going on between good and evil. Centuries before
Christ, the Greek philosopher Empedocles wrote that there were two
forces contending in the world, "friendship and strife." American
jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote: "We are all soldiers in a
great campaign, the details of which are veiled from us" (Quoted in
Anchor Points [Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Publishing Assoc.,
1993], p. 59). Thus many people, even without the "details," sense the
existence of a conflict between good and evil.

    Even those people who sense a struggle between opposing
 forces often don't believe in a literal, supernatural struggle be-
 tween real forces. How do you make real to someone, particu-
 larly someone from a secular background, the reality of the
 battle between Christ and Satan? And though we ourselves be-
 lieve in the literalness of this struggle, how does our awareness
 of that reality impact our lives?

                                                                           9

DESCRIPTIVE NAMES (Isa. 9:6; Rev. 12:9).

   Biographers prefer to write about what they call "round charac-
ters," those with many-sided, complex personalities, rather than "flat
characters," those with limited change or development.
   Both Christ and Satan classify as round characters—which is prob-
ably why the Bible writers use dozens of different names to describe
them.

     Fill in the contrasting names:

     CHRIST                             SATAN
     1. John 10:11    Shepherd         1. John 10:12      Wolf

     2. Luke 7:34                     2. Matt. 13:39

     3. 1 Tim. 2:5                    3. Rev. 12:10

   What's in a Name? By definition, all metaphors compare two
things basically unalike. Hence, all metaphors fall short of completely
explaining anything. How could two different authors label Jesus so
differently, one calling Him a Lamb (1 Pet. 1:19) and another calling
Him a Lion? (Rev. 5:5). In fact, the same author, John, in Revelation
5:6, calls Jesus a Lamb, then calls Him a Lion in the next verse.

 It's fascinating that Jesus has so many different names. He is the
 Bread of life, the High Priest, the Second Adam, the Son of God, the
 Son of Man, the Savior, the Rock of Ages, the Lord our Righteous-
 ness, Immanuel (God with us), the Bright and Morning Star, our
 Advocate, the Anointed, the Author of our salvation, the Alpha and
 Omega, the Passover, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
 world, the Faithful Witness, the Good Shepherd. He is the Way, the
 Word of God, the Truth. He is our Creator, our Wonderful Counse-
 lor, the Cornerstone. He is the Redeemer and the Resurrection and
 the Life. He is the Vine, the Captain of our Salvation, and our
 Righteousness. He is also a King, a Lamb, and a Lion.

   What do all these names tell us about Christ and the work He
has done, is doing, and will do? Which names of Christ most
appeal to you personally? Because we are all so different and all
relate to our Lord differently, could these various names have
been given in order to help us each connect to the Lord in ways
that best suit our unique personhood? If so, what should that
tell us about not trying to force people into spiritual molds, one
size for all?

THE KING OF KINGS, THE FALSE GOD OF THIS WORLD
(Matt. 4:8, 9; Rev. 19:16).

   At the end of time, what a curtain call! The entire cast will be on
stage to witness the climax to the drama called Planet Earth. Each
actor will have supported one of the two, the false god of this world
(Matt. 4:8, 9) or the "Lord of lords and King of kings" (Rev. 19:16,
RSV).

  Contrast the two different fates of Christ and Satan at the
Second Coming:

Rev. 19:7

Rev. 20:2, 3


   If Christ is all-powerful, in what sense is the whole world "in the
power of the evil one"? (1 John 5:19, RSV).
   "He is called the 'god of this world' because it is his purpose to
secure complete control of this world and its inhabitants. He is the
`god of this world' because the world is largely under his control. He
rules in the hearts of most of its inhabitants (cf. Eph. 1:1, 2). The
world obeys his dictates, yields to his temptations, takes part in his
wicked ways and abominations. He is the author and instigator of all
sin, and the very embodiment of it. Willful sinners are said to be given
over to Satan (1 Cor. 5:5; cf. 1 Tim. 1:20). He is the 'god of this
world' because of his control, even though limited, of the forces of
nature, the elements of earth, sea, and sky."—The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 6, p. 854.
   Unconditional Defeat. One thing the Bible makes clear: At the end
of the age, sin, Satan, and evil will forever be destroyed. In this war,
there will be no compromise, no sort of middle ground, with each side
giving a little here and there in order to come to a truce. Instead, there
will be a complete and total victory of one contender, Christ, against
His enemy, Satan, who will be totally vanquished. It will be the same
with their followers: total victory for those with Christ, total defeat for
those with Satan.

    How should the finality of the great controversy between
 Christ and Satan influence our lives now, when we are so often
 faced with situations that seem to demand compromise?
    In other words, when all is done, evil will be given no place at
 all. What does that tell us about giving evil any place now?

                                                                        11

FURTHER STUDY: Temptations of Power. For a list of over one
hundred forty titles or names of Jesus, read Harold Monser, ed.,
Monser's Topical Index and Digest of the Bible (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Baker Book House, 1960), pp. 330-332. For additional names for
Satan, look up the references under "Satan" in The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 1142.
   Note: The great controversy started over pride, over the desire for
the power for supremacy. Satan may have been the first, but he
certainly was not the last to succumb to power's temptations. Like
Lucifer, Pilate knew he was wrong but did not resist its intoxicating
appeal. "Pilate trembled as he heard that Christ had risen. He could
not doubt the testimony given, and from that hour peace left him
forever. For the sake of worldly honor, for fear of losing his authority
and his life, he had delivered Jesus to die. He was now fully convinced
that it was not merely an innocent man of whose blood he was guilty,
but the Son of God. Miserable to its close was the life of Pilate.
Despair and anguish crushed every hopeful, joyful feeling. He refused
to be comforted and died a most miserable death."—Early Writings,
p. 185 (emphasis supplied).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Sunday's lesson discussed the freedom inherent in the no-
     tion of love. Did this freedom demand that sin come, or did
     it demand only an environment that would allow it? Ex-
     plain your answer. We are told that sin will never arise
     again. Does this mean that we will not be free to sin again in
     heaven? Or will it mean that after having seen the devasta-
     tion that sin has wrought, all those in heaven, though free,
     would never dare venture on that ground again? Read Early
     Writings, p. 40, where Ellen White talks about beings on
     another planet who have been forbidden from eating the
     fruit of a tree. What does that tell us about freedom in a
     sinless world?

     2. Satan wanted to be like God. His problem was one of au-
        thority. Though few of us make pretensions of wanting to
        be like God, when we make ourselves the final authority as
        opposed to God, are we not guilty of the same sin as Luci-
        fer? Discuss.


SUMMARY: Satan fell by abusing the freedom inherent in love; as a
result the great controversy started. As humans, we have that same
freedom. In the end, we must use it to make one of two choices:
eternal life in Christ or eternal destruction with Satan.

                    The Kidnappers, Part 1
                           Daryl Famisaran

    In the mountain village of Lapangon, on the island of Mindanao in
the southern Philippines, the villagers decided that their school needed
to be replaced. The old one was leaning dangerously and threatened to
collapse. The villagers wanted to build a school from materials that
would last more than a year. But to do this they needed to raise money
to hire a chainsaw operator to cut the trees and for the galvanized iron
roofing sheets.
    The adults began gathering and selling abacca fiber from which
hemp rope is manufactured. The children wanted to help raise money to
build their new school. Their mission teachers had taught them to sing,
and they wanted to present a concert to raise funds for their school.
    The children and their teachers, Romel and Rendy, student mis-
sionaries from Mountain View College, planned a fund-raising con-
cert tour in churches in the lowlands. The reluctant parents waved as
the excited children and their teachers started down the mountain
toward the city. The children, ranging from 9 to 12 years old, had never
left their mountain homes before, and their parents wondered if they
would ever see their children again.
    The children arrived at the bus terminal in the capital city. They
were curious about all the strange sights and sounds around them.
They wrinkled their foreheads in disbelief at the many people running
and shouting directions. They clutched their bundles of clothing and
stayed close to their teachers as they walked through the noisy termi-
nal. Most of the children were barefooted and many were dressed in
 rags, as they dress in the mountains.
    As Romel gave the children instructions on proper behavior on the bus,
 suddenly five policemen approached and spoke to Romel and Rendy.
                                 "You are kidnappers!" they accused.
                                    The children did not understand
                                 what the men were saying, but they
                                 sensed that something was terribly
                                 wrong.

          The Betrayers Peter
               and Judas




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 26:69-75; 27:1-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.
     And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said
     to him, 'Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three
     times' " (Luke 22:61, RSV).

  KEY THOUGHT: First the good news: Both Peter and Judas
were capable, aggressive members of Jesus' chosen twelve. Now the
bad news: Both betrayed (or denied) Jesus within hours of each other.

YOU TOO, PETER? YOU TOO, JUDAS? By anyone's calcula-
tions, Peter and Judas were recognized disciples of Christ. Even as
many Bible characters lie in obscurity, Peter and Judas remain two of
the best-known. Writers and speakers can allude to either with assur-
ance that the names will be recognized. Even those who read the Bible
as great literature only (and not as the Word of God) are familiar with
the failure of Peter and Judas.
   Historically, most cultures value loyalty of some kind—to family,
to country, to church, to friends. Hence, stories of a friend betraying a
friend compel universal interest. Julius Caesar's famous dying cry,
"Tu quoque, fill!" [Latin for, "And you, too, son!"], uttered in agoniz-
ing disbelief as he is stabbed by his so-called friend and adopted son,
Brutus, still haunts us two millennia later. How much more compelling
the betrayal of the Son of God by two close companions.
   There are lessons to be learned from their examples.

SOME POSITIVE CHARACTERISTICS.

  Read Luke 5:5-11 and think about it as you study the quotes
below.

   All of the numerous Bible texts that mention Judas are negative, but
Ellen White mentions that he had potential.
   Judas. He did respond to Jesus: "He [Judas] was not insensible to
the beauty of the character of Christ; and often, as he listened to the
Savior's words, conviction came to him.. . ."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 558.
   He wanted to change: "He [Judas] had sincerely desired a change in
himself, and had hoped to experience this through a union with Jesus. But
this desire did not become predominant."—Education, p. 91.
   He was multigifted: "When he [Judas] came into association with
Jesus, he had some precious traits of character that might have been
made a blessing to the church."—The Desire of Ages, p. 295.
    Peter. Peter also was multigifted: "Peter was prompt and zealous
in action, bold and uncompromising; and Christ saw in him material
that would be of great value to the church."—Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 4, p. 488.
    Peter did not want to see Christ humiliated: "Peter could not bear
to see his Lord, whom he believed to be the Son of God, acting the part
of a servant. His whole soul rose up against this humiliation."—The
Desire of Ages, pp. 645, 646.

 "Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
 number of the twelve" (Luke 22:3).

   Satan entered Judas, as opposed to Peter, though Jesus made it
clear that Satan wanted Peter as well (Luke 22:31). Obviously, there
was something in how these men, both possessing good traits, re-
sponded to Christ that made the crucial difference in their lives.
However similar their traits, their destinies couldn't be more different.
Both were sinners, both needed forgiveness, both failed their Mas-
ter—yet one went on to receive the promise of eternal life, the other
the promise of eternal damnation. How crucial that we understand the
difference between these two men!

    What can the story of Judas teach us about the need to
 surrender ourselves completely to Christ? Why does someone
 not need to do an act of treachery as blatant as Judas in order to
 manifest the same spirit toward Christ? What should the fact
 that Judas was "numbered among the twelve" tell us about
 assuming that church membership guarantees faithfulness?

                                                                       15

THE TWO BETRAYALS (Matt. 27:3, 4; Luke 22:54-62).

    Both Peter and Judas sinned knowingly: Judas, "Saying, 'I have
sinned in betraying innocent blood' " (Matt. 27:4, RSV); Peter, "And
he went out and wept bitterly" (Luke 22:62, RSV).
   Scripture is clear about the negative characteristics of Judas. His
repentance was, apparently, false (Matt. 27:3). He purposely, with
premeditation, worked with evil men to betray Jesus, and he openly
betrayed Him (Mark 14:45; John 18:2, 3). Thus, we see here some
reasons why Judas's betrayal of Christ was so different from Peter's
denial.

   Contrast the verses that talk about Judas's plan to betray Jesus
with Peter's words in Matthew 26:35: "Peter said unto him, Though
I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee." What do these
texts reveal about the difference between what Peter and Judas
did to Christ?


   It's obvious that Peter never intended to deny Christ; his act was
spontaneous, uttered in a moment of fear. In contrast, Scripture shows
that Judas acted with premeditation and foresight. In other words,
though both men did wrong, and both men revealed character weak-
nesses, and both men did, indeed, fail their Lord—one carried out his
deed with premeditation, while the other acted out of momentary
weakness.

  In what ways do the different motives of Peter and Judas help
explain their different destinies?


   Like Judas, Peter also displayed some very negative characteris-
tics. He cursed (Matt. 26:74), he had violent tendencies (John 18:10),
and he acted like a coward (Luke 22:57). Peter was very self-assured,
very self-confident, very convinced of his loyalty to Christ. However,
when the first real test came, he failed miserably.

    What do you say to someone who has openly, and with pre-
meditation, sinned against the Lord, as Judas did? In what ways
could you give him or her hope that the future does not have to
be hopeless? Give some biblical examples of those who have
sinned in the same open and planned way that Judas did, and
yet who found forgiveness with God. What Christian, at some
point in his or her experience, hasn't been able to relate to
Judas?

THE TWO BETRAYALS CONTINUED (Mark 14:10; Luke
22:60).

   One with curses, one with coins—the two disciples failed their best
Friend on the same day. Yet their acts did not come in a vacuum. Each
man had a history that clearly paved the way for his subsequent
actions.
    Judas: At some point, Judas saw that Christ was offering spiritual
promises rather than worldly gain. After hoping for worldly honor and
glory, Judas could finally see that Jesus would get no earthly honor or
glory for Himself; thus, it was clear to Judas that by following Jesus he
would get no honor and glory either. It was at this point that Judas
began to draw away from the Master.
   Christ bore long with Judas, seeking to save him. At the Last
Supper, however, Judas rejected mercy's pleading one last time. An-
gered at an implied rebuke and disappointed at the failure of his
dreams, he refused to surrender and, ultimately, gave his soul to the
demon of greed that had long been stalking him.

   What examples can we find from Judas's life that showed the
direction he had been moving in all along?


   Peter: In the same way as Judas, Peter's fall was not instantaneous;
it was gradual. Self-confidence led him to the belief that nothing could
turn him away from Christ. "Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both to
prison and to death" (Luke 22:33). His bold confession itself showed
just how self-deceived Peter was regarding his faith and his relation-
ship to Christ.
    In many ways, self-confidence has to be one of the most dangerous
sins for Christians because our faith is based on the notion of our own
utter helplessness and inability to save ourselves. Peter, obviously, did
not understand this principle yet, and so step after step he moved in the
path of self-confidence until that trait led him to an open denial of his
Lord.

   Salvation is found only in the righteousness of Christ, not in
 ourselves. Yet, what can we learn from the experience of Judas
 and Peter about the importance of not allowing Satan any in-
 road into our lives? How does Judas's experience reveal the
 danger of clinging to cherished sin?


     In the end, did Judas's sin drive Jesus away from him, or did
 it drive Judas away from Jesus? Explain your answer.

                                                                      17
Wednesday                                                April 11
THE AFTERMATH (Matt. 27:5; 1 Pet. 1:1).

   After he betrayed Christ, Judas hanged himself (Matt. 27:5). In
contrast, after he denied Christ, Peter became a trusted apostle (1 Pet.
1:1), a high-powered force leading the early Christian church, and a
writer leaving a testimony that would echo down through the centu-
ries. Yet both men outwardly showed repentance for their deeds! What
was the difference?
   Judas had the wrong type of repentance. Judas, after betraying
Christ, returned to the priests and exclaimed: "I have sinned in that I
have betrayed the innocent blood" (Matt. 27:4). But his confession
was not a true biblical confession, not one born out of true sorrow for
his actions but born instead only out of sorrow for the consequences of
his actions. The consequences, not the act itself, drew out this ac-
knowledgment of his sin, but there was (apparently) no deep, heart-
breaking grief in his soul over the evil he had done in betraying His
Lord.
   Peter's remorse was sincere. Peter denied His Lord during Christ's
time of greatest need and humiliation. But afterward, Peter repented
and was reconverted. He had true contrition of soul for the act itself,
not just the consequences. His repentance showed that the Holy Spirit
was able to work on his heart and change him. He was truly broken by
his sin, and out of that contrition of heart the Lord was able to bring
Peter to true repentance and conversion. "The sacrifices of God are a
broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not
despise" (Ps. 51:17).

  Name a Bible character who sinned greatly and then repented
and one who sinned greatly and did not repent.




   Antonio had committed terrible sins that brought a lot of
suffering to himself and his family. Though he loved God and
felt sorry for his actions, he wasn't sure if his repentance were
genuine, if he were truly sorry for his sins, or just for the terrible
consequences of them. What could someone do to help him come
to true repentance? (Hint: see Acts 5:31; 2 Tim 2:25.) What do
these verses say about the source of true repentance, and how
could this give someone like Antonio hope? How do we help such
people understand that repentance comes from God?

THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAVED (Luke 22:21, 31).

   "But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
the table" (Luke 22:21).

   Luke 22:21 shows that, though Jesus knew what Judas would
do, He still kept Judas in the group. What lessons, if any, can we
learn from Christ's act? Do you think that Judas could have
changed his mind and not betrayed Christ? Explain your answer.


   Though a question fraught with certain difficulties, free will is
clearly taught in the Bible. Little of what we believe as Christians,
much less Adventists, makes sense without free will. Though the
Lord knew that Judas would betray Him, God did not predetermine
that Judas would do it; otherwise, what sense would it make for
Judas to be punished for his betrayal of Christ? Judas obviously had
free will, and because the Bible says that the Lord wants all to come
to salvation (2 Pet. 3:9), Judas had a chance to be saved as well.
Thus, Jesus kept Judas around, not in order to give him ample
opportunity to betray Him but, more than likely, to give him ample
opportunity to be saved.
   Along with Judas, there was Peter, whom Christ wanted to be saved
as well. "And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired
to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee,
that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren" (Luke 22:31, 32, emphasis supplied). By these words, Jesus
revealed that He knew not only that Peter would one day be converted
but that he would be a powerful force in the church. As with Judas,
Christ's foreknowledge did not mean He predestined Peter to be this
great apostle; rather, Christ, with His foreknowledge, knew what Peter
and Judas would do with their free will. In both cases, each man was
given the opportunity to react to what Christ offered him. Their biog-
raphies reveal the choices they made.

     All of us who claim to follow Christ are in the same posi-
 tion as both Peter and Judas. We have been given opportuni-
 ties to make choices regarding how we will respond to the
 salvation Christ freely offers. Each of us ought to clearly ask
 ourselves What are we doing with these opportunities? In the
 end, only one of two eternal destinies awaits us: the one of
 Peter or the one of Judas. In what ways are our daily deci-
 sions moving us in the path of one or the other? What can we
 do if we see that perhaps our choices are indeed pointing us in
 the wrong direction?

                                                                    19

FURTHER STUDY: Lessons From Their Lives. What lessons can
we learn from these statements regarding the lives of both Peter and
Judas?
   "No man can tell how far he may go in sin when once he yields
himself to the power of the great deceiver. Satan entered into Judas
Iscariot and induced him to betray his Lord."—Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 5, p. 103.
   "At the reproof from Jesus his [Judas's] very spirit seemed turned
to gall. Wounded pride and desire for revenge broke down the bath-
ers, and the greed so long indulged held him in control. This will be
the experience of everyone who persists in tampering with sin."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 720.
   "The Saviour gave him [Peter] opportunity to regain the confi-
dence of his brethren, and, so far as possible, to remove the reproach
he had brought upon the gospel.
   "When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter! We
look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed upon the
Saviour. Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls.
Jesus did not bid Peter come to Him that he should perish; He does not
call us to follow Him, and then forsake us. 'Fear not,' He says; 'for I
have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.' "
—The Desire of Ages, p. 382.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The converted Peter healed the sick, evangelized both Jew
     and Gentile, and wrote epistles. Why mention that he so
     miserably failed Christ?

     2. The story of Judas is the story of someone who ultimately
        chose sin over Christ. All professed followers of Christ have
        to face that same struggle because every day we are con-
        fronted with temptations. What can we do to protect our-
        selves from falling into the same trap?

     3. In The Desire of Ages, the chapter titled "Judas," Ellen
        White writes how Judas actually thought he would be doing
        Christ a favor by betraying Him. What does that fact tell us
        about the power of sin to deceive us?

SUMMARY: Peter and Judas will forever be remembered for their
betrayals of Christ—Judas only for that act, Peter for that act plus
many positive ones. Both disciples had desirable and undesirable
character traits. The difference is that one responded to Jesus'
power, the other did not; one had genuine repentance, the other did
not.

                    The Kidnappers, Part 2
                            Daryl Famisaran

   The children from Lapangon Mission School had never been away
from their mountain homes before they traveled to the lowlands of
southern Philippines to raise money to build a new school. Their ner-
vous parents feared for their safety.
   As the children boarded a bus in the capital city, five policemen
approached and accused the teachers of kidnapping the children.
   "We are not kidnappers," Romel answered. "We are missionaries.
We are on a field trip, and the children will present a concert."
   "Look at the rags these children are wearing," the police officer
roared. "How can you say that these children are singers?"
   The two student missionaries showed the police their student mis-
sionary identification cards, but the police were not convinced. Romel
prayed silently, Lord, please make this police officer understand
   "Do we look like kidnappers?" asked Romel. "These children are
our pupils at a government recognized mission school in Lapangon
village. They have come to the city to raise money to build a new
school."
   "Prove it!" one police officer ordered. "Have them sing one song."
   Romel turned to the children, who had entered the bus, and spoke a
few words. Immediately the bus was filled with the sound of trained
young voices. They sang a song in Cebuan, the language the police
officers could understand. A crowd gathered to listen to the unlikely
looking choir.
   After the melody faded away, the head officer spoke with a voice
choked with tears. "I am sorry to hold you. You may go now."
    Rendy and Romel breathed a silent prayer of thanks to the Holy Spirit
v ho had turned a difficult situation into an opportunity to witness for
                                 Christ.
                                    Pray that the villagers will raise the
                                 needed funds to build their new school.
                                 And pray for the student missionaries
                                 who teach Manobo children in a dozen
                                 mission schools scattered through the
                                 mountains of southern Philippines.

      Grace Under Pressure
          Noah and Job




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 6:22; Job 1.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Then Job answered the Lord: 'I know that
     thou canst do all things, and that no purpose of thine can be
     thwarted' " (Job 42:1, 2, RSV).

    KEY THOUGHT: No matter how long, intense, or varied our
trials, faith in God can provide the resources for experiencing what
has been called "grace under pressure." Perhaps we've all, in one way
or another, known what "grace under pressure" means.

ANCIENT STORIES WITH MODERN MESSAGES. Noah-and-
the-ark is thought of as almost one word. Likewise, Job-and-his-trials
are four words that melt into one. So compelling are the ark and trial
portions of their lives that we think of little else when we think of
these two men; and no wonder, because those incidents are about the
only portions of their lives the Bible dwells upon.
   Although Noah lived 950 years, the mention of his name generally
conjures up ark images—scoffers, animals in pairs, a rainbow, a dove,
an olive leaf, and water (a lot of it). Likewise, Job lived many years
after his tribulations, yet the mention of his name compels exclusively
suffering images—critical friends, a carping wife, loathsome sores,
dirty ashes, verbal battles, and a God who speaks out of a whirlwind.
   No matter how ancient, the stories of Noah and Job and their struggles
and challenges still resonate today. However different our circum-
stances from theirs, we still struggle with the same issues of faith, hope,
and grace in a world that, at times, can seem wired against all three.

Sunday                                                   April 15
THE STORIES' SETTINGS (Gen. 6:13, 17; Job 1:8-12).

   Settings involve the historical backgrounds, the facts about when,
where, and who, along with the philosophical environments in which
the stories occur. For the biographies of Noah and Job, the settings
must be understood before the plot makes sense.

   The Bible gives background information for Noah's story: "The
Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually" (Gen. 6:5, RSV); for Job's narrative: "Now there was
a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
Lord, and Satan also came among them" (Job 1:6, RSV). How do
these two texts help explain the stories' plots?


   The fascinating thing about both these stories is that, however
much of the drama takes place on the earth, heaven sets the real
background. Genesis states more than once that God (who dwells in
heaven) saw what was going on and decided to do something about it.
In the book of Job, there is a conflict between God and Satan—in
heaven—that winds up on earth. What's taking place on earth has its
origins in what's taking place in heaven. In fact, only by understand-
ing that heavenly background can the earthly stories make better
sense. What this reality shows is that there is often an unseen, cosmic
dimension behind things that we can see and experience ourselves, a
dimension that in many ways provides the best explanation for what's
going on here. The Bible helps reveal to us this cosmic dimension.


 Many people believe that the book of Job was written by Moses
 and that it was the first book of the Bible ever written, even before
 Genesis. The book of Job gives one of the clearest explanations
 about how evil could exist in a world created by an all-loving, all-
 powerful God. It makes a lot of sense for Job to be the first book
 because, for many earnest people, the question of evil raises the
 first and often the hardest question to be answered about the
 existence of God. Job helps answer that question (even if it still
 leaves many unanswered).


    How could a knowledge of the cosmic battle between Christ
 and Satan help us deal with the struggles we face? Can a knowl-
 edge of this unseen reality help give meaning to trials that might,
 otherwise, seem so meaningless? If so, how?

                                                                    23

NOAH: END-TIME "FANATIC" (Gen. 6:3).

   Genesis 6:3 indicates that the Lord would give humanity a 120-
year grace period. Then "probation" would close—and the world
would be destroyed by a flood. Only those who would accept this
present-truth message of "salvation," offered in that particular con-
text, would be saved.
   Scripture doesn't say exactly how long Noah worked on the ark
during that 120-year period. Considering the massive size of the
structure, the amount of time must have been immense, even for those
who, like Noah, measured their lives by centuries. However long the
actual building took, it must have been a real testing time for Noah's
faith. "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the
which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness
which is by faith" (Heb. 11:7, emphasis supplied).

 "In Noah's day the inhabitants of the old world laughed to scorn
 what they termed the superstitious fears and forebodings of the
 preacher of righteousness. He was denounced as a visionary char-
 acter, a fanatic, an alarmist. 'As it was in the days of Noah, so
 shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.' Men will reject the
 solemn message of warning in our day, as they did in Noah's
 time. "—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 308.

     Noah had to remain faithful for other time periods as well.

     How long was he in the ark before water fell? (Gen. 7:10).


     How long did the Flood continue? (Gen. 7:17).


     How long was it before the waters abated? (Gen. 8:3).


   Though these other time periods were much shorter than the many
years Noah worked on the ark, it would be easy to imagine that Noah's
faith must have come under intense pressure during these periods as
well.

   Consider some of the other long time periods in the Bible,
 such as the 1260 years of Daniel 7 or the 70 years of Babylonian
 captivity. What can these long time periods teach us about en-
 during "lengthy" trials in our own lives?

THE TORMENT OF JOB (Job 19:2).

   Pain comes in many shapes. Match the types of torment with
the text—economic, emotional, parental, physical, social, and spiri-
tual:

          " 'The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside
them; and the Sabeans .. . slew the servants with the edge of the
sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you' " (Job 1:14, 15, RSV).

          " 'Your sons and daughters were eating and drink-
ing wine ... and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell
you' " (Job 1:18, 19, RSV).

          "And when they saw him from afar, they did not recog-
nize him" (Job 2:12, RSV).

         "There is no umpire between us, who might lay his
hand upon us both" (Job 9:33, RSV).

           " 'Why didst thou bring me forth from the womb? Would
that I had died before any eye had seen me' " (Job 10:18, RSV).

         "My kinsfolk and my close friends have failed me" (Job
19:14, RSV).

  It has been said that times of intense suffering don't develop
character but just reveal it. Explain why you agree or disagree.


   Job's experience is a reflection, however exaggerated, of all fallen
humanity. All, like Job, have had their positive moments; all, like Job,
have had their moments of utter despair. However intense Job's suf-
ferings, all have gone through something similar. And, no doubt, even
people of faith, people who love God and believe in the wonderful
promise of salvation in Christ, have, like Job, questioned the provi-
dence of God who has allowed these trials to come. What Job shows is
that questioning is part of what faith is all about.


   Carla, a devout Christian, lost both her husband and her only
 child in a house fire. In the midst of her anguish, she had some
 moments of raw doubt about even the existence of God. Why is
 such a reaction normal, and what can we learn from the story of
 Job to help someone like her?

                                                                     25
Wednesday                                                  April 18
FAITH—THE SOURCE OF PERSISTENCE (Heb. 11:7; Job 19:25).

   Noah's persistent faith earned him the title of "a herald of
righteousness" (2 Pet. 2:5, RSV). Job's persistent faith allowed
him to proclaim, "I know that my Redeemer lives" (Job 19:25,
RSV).
   For Noah to be a "herald of righteousness," he had to be preach-
ing about the righteousness of Christ, which is the righteousness of
God Himself, the only righteousness that can save us. "But now the
righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being wit-
nessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of God
which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that
believe" (Rom. 3:21, 22; see also Rom. 10:3-6; Rom. 3:17). Job's
words affirming the existence of His Redeemer (Job 19:25) show,
too, that he had some understanding of salvation and that it is
obtained not by man but by God in behalf of man. "This text
represents one of the OT revelations of God as man's redeemer, a
profound truth that was fully revealed to men in the person and
mission of Jesus Christ."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
p. 549.

  Why, especially in times of trial, is it crucial to understand that
our hope of salvation exists not in ourselves but only in Christ?


    Anyone who has ever walked with God knows that the closer we
come to Christ, the more sinful we'll appear in our own eyes. Indeed,
anyone who has experienced the reality of the human condition and
the saving grace of Christ will understand the biblical truth that "All
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23). Our
sinful condition can be a terrible source of personal discouragement.
This is particularly true for a person going through a trial when the
tendency is to think that his or her own sin has brought about this trial
to begin with. How important, then, especially in hard times, that we
ground our hope not in ourselves or in any righteousness found in us
but only in Christ and His righteousness, which is credited to us by
faith.

   What other ways (besides what's mentioned above) can an
understanding of our righteousness being found only in Christ,
and not in ourselves or our works, be a great source of comfort
for a Christian going through a hard time?
   In what way can you help a person to see the wonderful
truth of Christ as our righteousness, as our hope, and as our
salvation?

THE VINDICATIONS (Gen. 9:1-3; Job 42:10-17).

   "And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, 'Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. The fear of you and the
dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon
every bird of the air, upon everything that creeps on the ground
and all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered. Every
moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and as I gave you
green plants, I give you everything' " (Gen. 9:1-3).

    Not all biographers can write happy endings and still be true to the
fact. And though one can seriously question whether the word happy
is the right word to describe the endings of these stories, it is true that
after their lengthy and intense trials, both Noah and Job enjoyed
several forms of vindication.

   Compare these types of vindication for Job with the types of
trials he endured (see Tuesday's lesson):

           "The Lord said 'for you have not spoken of me what is
right, as my servant Job has' " (Job 42:7, RSV).

         "Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all
who had known him before ... " (Job 42:11, RSV).

          "Fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thou-
sand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses" (Job 42:12, RSV).

            "He had also seven sons and three daughters" (Job 42:13,
RSV).

            "And Job died, an old man, and full of days" (Job 42:17,
RSV).

   Noah, however, found vindication in another way: The Flood that
he had warned about for so long finally came, exactly as he had said.
His faith, enduring years of taunts, ridicule, and maybe even his own
moment of doubt (he was, after all, human) was radically vindicated.
He lived to see the results of living and acting by faith, not by sight.

    Noah and Job both lived long enough to see their trials come
 to a "happy" ending. Not all those who go through trials have
 the same experience, at least in this life. Why, then, must our
 ultimate hope of vindication not rest in this life? When and
 where will vindication finally come?

                                                                        27
Friday                                                    April 20
FURTHER STUDY: Noah, Job, and Us. Read the book of Job in
poetic format, the RSV, for example. Also read about the three great
races that sprang from Noah's three sons (Patriarchs and Prophets,
pp. 117, 118).


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In any discussion about the existence of an all-loving, all-
     powerful God, the inevitable question of evil arises. As one
     writer expressed it: "If God is perfectly loving, He must
     wish to abolish evil; and if He is all powerful, He must be
     able to abolish evil. But evil exists, therefore God cannot be
     both omnipotent and loving." (Quoted in Philosophy: An
     Introduction Through Literature [New York: Kleiman and
     Lewis Paragon House, 19921, p. 457). How can we, as Chris-
     tians (particularly as Adventists with the understanding of
     the great controversy between Christ and Satan), help deal
     with that idea? What kind of responses can you give? Are
     there any answers, this side of eternity, that can perfectly
     address this issue?

     2. Read the great faith chapter, Hebrews 11. You will notice a
        constant reference to the promises of God. You will also
        notice that this promise is, ultimately, not of anything in
        this life but the promise of a new existence altogether. "These
        all died in faith, not having received the promises, but hav-
        ing seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and
        embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
        pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare
        plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been
        mindful of that country from whence they came out, they
        might have had opportunity to have returned. But now
        they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore
        God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath
        prepared for them a city" (Heb. 11:13-16). In the context of
        this week's lesson, that of intense suffering, why are prom-
        ises like this so crucial? In what ways can we live our lives
        to help us—and others—develop the kind of faith needed to
        cling to these promises?

SUMMARY: Noah and Job survived a variety of very long and very
intense trials. Some of the most difficult times involved their being
misunderstood and, consequently, maligned by those who should have
been supporters. A persistent faith kept them clinging to God's grace
under the most severe of pressures.

                             J. H. Zachary

   Warren Uziah lives in his wife's family village in North Nev‘
Georgia, Solomon Islands. Although he comes from a strong
Protestant background, Uziah had recently become interested in
his wife's religion, Seventh-day Adventism.
   Uziah decided to visit his father, who is chief in another vil-
lage. Before he left he asked his mother-in-law for some books
and literature to take along to share in his village. She gave him
some copies of The Desire of Ages, Steps to Christ, and The Great
Controversy, as well as some magazines and tracts.
   During his visit Uziah gave the books and tracts to people who
seemed interested. And when he returned home, he gave his mother-
in-law a list of people who wanted to take Bible studies by corre-
spondence. She happily enrolled them in the Voice of Prophecy
course.
   One person who received a book from Uziah was his cousin,
Ron Kanga. As Kanga began reading the book, he discovered
several new ideas that caught his attention. The book gave him a
clearer picture of God's plan for the universe and for his own life.
By the time he finished reading the book, his life was changed.
    Kanga was so excited by what he had discovered that he began
visiting people to share what he had learned. He began studying
the Bible with several of his friends and relatives. Soon he was
studying regularly with 20 people in the village. Sometimes his
studies lasted until long after midnight.
   Kanga wanted to be baptized. He knew that the book that had
changed his life was published by the Seventh-day Adventist
Church, so he contacted the nearest mission and asked for some-
one to come and baptize him. A pastor came to visit him and
question him about his knowledge of Bible truth. Kanga and his
wife were baptized late in 1998.
    Kanga told the pastor that several of the people he was studying
with in his village would soon be ready for baptism as well. The
pastor asked Kanga what he was using for Bible study materials.
Kanga answered simply, "Just these." And he held up his Bible and
 The Great Controversy. The pastor is confident that with Kanga's
zeal, soon his village will have an Adventist congregation.

              Wives as Advisers




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Prov. 20:18.

     MEMORY TEXT: "`And who knows whether you have not come
     to the kingdom for such a time as this?'" (Esther 4:14b, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: So lovingly intimate is the ideal relationship
between husband and wife that the Bible uses a bride and groom as a
metaphor, or symbol, for Christ and His church. Although men (often
husbands) dominate the Scriptures, women (often wives) play a few
major and many minor roles. Scattered throughout the Bible are occa-
sional brief stories describing wives as advisers to their husbands.

WIVES FUNCTIONED AS UNOFFICIAL ADVISERS. Bible bi-
ographies tell mainly of men—young and old, good and bad, king or
slave, prophet or rebel. No doubt, many reasons for this exist, one
being, simply, that the society in which the Bible stories took place
was overtly dominated by men. In fact, only two books of the Bible
are even titled with a woman's name. Yet women have had crucial
roles to play in this great drama called Planet Earth, roles that will
continue until the close of time.
   This week we study wives who gave advice, both good and bad, to
their husbands, thus advancing from a customary domestic role to that
of spiritual, political, and moral counselor. What kind of advice did
they give, and how effective was it? Did the husbands listen, and what
happened when they did? What happened, on the other hand, when
they did not? What lessons are here in the stories both for husbands
and for wives? How little some basic things change, even after many
centuries.

GOOD ADVICE FOLLOWED (1 Sam. 25:24, 25; Esther 8:4-6).

   Biographers analyze people or events that impacted the lives of
those they write about, often seeing great importance in brief en-
counters or experiences. These experiences, and how the people
respond to them, are what make them worthy of biography. Both
King Ahasuerus and David had high-voltage advice given to them by
two very shrewd, prudent, and courageous women, Esther and Abigail,
whose stories were deemed important enough to be placed in the
biblical canon. Esther jeopardized her position as queen by instigat-
ing the events that led up to the advice she gave the king; by
contrast, Abigail's advice to David resulted in her being chosen as a
wife.
   Foolish men, wise women. Both of these stories tell of men who
were not acting with great wisdom but who allowed greed, jealousy,
and anger to dominate their actions. In contrast, the stories also
showed women who worked hard, even at great personal risk, to
avert the bad consequences that could have come about because of
these men.

   Scan 1 Samuel 25 to get the background for the story of Abigail
and how she worked with tact, shrewdness, sensitivity, and risk to
try and mitigate something that a foolish man had done. In verse
24, when she approached David, she said, "Upon me, my lord,
upon me let this iniquity be." What principle do we see in opera-
tion here, where an innocent person is willing to take the punish-
ment for the guilty?


   Esther, too, had to work with tact, sensitivity, and risk to prevent a
calamity that could have been caused by a man who was allowing
passion and anger to dominate. In her case, however, the issues at
stake were much greater than in Abigail's, for the safety of her people
was endangered. Haman had planned to wipe out the whole Jewish
population simply because of his pride and arrogance.
   Like Abigail, though, she was willing to take a great risk in order to
give advice to her husband. Indeed, she had to stand before him, at the
risk of death. The king listened to her advice, and Haman's foul plot
was stopped.

    These two accounts reveal remarkable women who took great
 risks to attempt to avert evil. In both cases, they acted, in a
 sense, as intercessors, or even as saviors (with a small "s"). In
 what ways was what these women had done similar to what
 Christ has done for us?

GOOD ADVICE IGNORED (Esther 6:13; Matt. 27:19).

   If Haman had heeded his wife's words, he probably would
have spared himself an untimely and ignoble death: "Then his
wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, 'If Mordecai, before
whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will
not prevail against him but will surely fall before him'" (Esther
6:13b, RSV).

   Given Haman's attitude toward Mordecai, why do you think he
refused to heed the advice of his wife? Why do you think she was
able to see what Haman himself couldn't? What lessons can we
learn from Haman's blindness about allowing emotions to over-
rule common sense and good advice?


   In the same way, if Pilate had followed his wife's advice, he would
have saved himself a lot of grief: "'Have nothing to do with that
righteous man,"' she said to him, "`for I have suffered much over him
today in a dream'" (Matt. 27:19b, RSV).
   The story of Pilate's wife's dream becomes especially poign-
ant because of the insights of another woman who heeded the
voice of God. Look at what Ellen White adds to our understand-
ing of what Pilate's wife saw in her dream: "In answer to Christ's
prayer, the wife of Pilate had been visited by an angel from
heaven, and in a dream she had beheld the Saviour and conversed
with Him. Pilate's wife was not a Jew, but as she looked upon
Jesus in her dream, she had no doubt of His character or mission.
She knew Him to be the Prince of God. She saw Him on trial in
the judgment hall. She saw the hands tightly bound as the hands
of a criminal. . . . Still another scene met her gaze. She saw Christ
seated upon the great white cloud, while the earth reeled in space,
and His murderers fled from the presence of His glory."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 732.

   Augustine once said: "Sin is to nature what blindness is to an
eye." In this context, why do you think Pilate refused to listen to
the advice of his wife? What reasons, in comparison to Haman,
did he have for his refusal? Isn't it easy to see how some of the
same things that blinded Haman and Pilate to good counsel
(indeed, some came directly from the Lord Himself!) can blind
us as well? What steps can we take to prevent ourselves from
falling into the same trap as these two unfortunate men? In
other words, what things exist in our lives that are blinding us
from seeing what we need to see?

BAD ADVICE FOLLOWED (Gen. 3:6; Gen. 16:1, 2).

   The closeness of the husband-and-wife relationship does not guar-
antee good advice. The familiar story of the original Fall leaves no
doubt as to Eve's guilt—and Adam's. Likewise, Abram and Sarai both
sinned when he took Hagar as a wife. The lesson is clear: Those who
influence others to sin are themselves sinning.
   Sin in bunches. A single sin is hard to commit. It seems, as if
by its demonic nature, sin rarely goes solo but instead clusters
with other sins, each one feeding off the other. The case of Eve
and the Fall exemplifies this principle. Her first error was wan-
dering away from her husband's side. Next, she lingered around
the forbidden tree. She then listened to the voice of the serpent,
even daring to doubt God's words about not eating from the tree.
Trusting her own judgment and sight—as opposed to the clear
command of God—Eve ate from the tree. Then "she offered the
fruit to her husband, thereby tempting him."—Early Writings,
pp. 147, 148.

   After both fell, what was their first reaction? "The man said,
`The woman whom thou gayest to be with me, she gave me fruit of
the tree, and I ate.' Then the Lord God said to the woman, 'What
is this that you have done?' The woman said, 'The serpent be-
guiled me, and I ate" (Gen. 3:12, 13, RSV). Why is it so natural
for us to blame others for our sin?


   What modern story can compete with the tale of the love triangle
between the rich and influential Abraham, the beautiful but barren
Sarah, and an Egyptian maid? The determined characters, the intrigu-
ing plot, the oriental setting, the conniving, and then backfiring—all
captivate the imagination.
   The narrative started millennia ago with a wife's wrong advice:
"And Sarai said to Abram, 'Behold now, the Lord has prevented me
from bearing children; go in to my maid; it may be that I shall obtain
children by her.' And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai" (Gen.
16:2, RSV).

    Both Eve and Sarai (even Adam and Abram) made the same
 fatal mistake: They trusted their sight, their reason, and their
 emotions over a clear thus saith the Lord. Why is it so easy to
 make the same mistake? How can we learn to trust God despite
 what our senses, or even reason, sometimes tell us, especially
 when our senses and our reason can so easily deceive us?


                                                                   33

BAD ADVICE REJECTED AND BAD ADVICE FOLLOWED
(Job 2:9, 10; Mark 6:24).

   Only two verses mention her. She merits no name except Job's
wife. Yet the world knows her well, even if the Bible records just a
few quick words she uttered in sheer pain: "'Do you still hold fast
your integrity? Curse God, and die" (Job 2:9b, RSV). In many ways,
the poor woman has received bad press. Remember—all her posses-
sions were just taken away too, all her children were killed, and that
was her husband who was reduced from being "the greatest of all the
men of the east" (Job 1:3) to a diseased, whining wreck left on a pile
of rubble.
   While her reaction wasn't right—it certainly is understandable!

   Job responded to his wife like this: "You speak as one of the
foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good at the hand of
God, and shall we not receive evil?" (Job 2:10, RSV). Though
both his and her sufferings were terrible, what was the main
difference in their reaction? What, possibly, could have caused
the difference?


   Job, clearly, had a hold on God that his wife, at least at the time,
didn't—which is why he overtly rejected her "advice." Though we
are given no more information about his wife, other than her painful
cry, the Bible does depict Job as a righteous, faithful man who
continually worshiped the Lord (Job 1:1-5). No doubt his relation-
ship to God and past faithfulness was able to sustain him during this
crisis.
   Job's wife uttered her words in the midst of a spontaneous
outburst of pain, but Herod's wife's advice was calculated, cold,
and pure evil. At first, Herod refused Herodias's sinister plot to kill
John the Baptist, because he knew "that he was a righteous and
holy man" (Mark 6:20, RSV). Unfortunately, in the midst of a
decadent party (Mark 6:17-29), Herod gave in to his wife's words
and had John beheaded, even though it went deeply against his
conscience.

   Herod's story, in particular, shows how powerful the emo-
tions and senses can be, even when pitted against conscience and
reason. No wonder Scripture talks so much about keeping our
bodies and sensual pleasures under control. Think of areas in
your own life that could leave you open to the same disastrous
mistake Herod made and ask yourself, What can I do to avoid
the same folly?

THE PRINCIPLE OF PRINCIPLE (Esther 1:9-12; Gen. 39:12).

    The Bible is not a book that ignores human flaws; on the contrary,
it exposes them—if not with lucid detail, then certainly with no gloss.
Scripture makes no pretense to hide our faults, even the faults of the
heroes of faith. How nice, then, when we're given examples of those
who, despite the traps of lust, vanity, and pride, stand firm for prin-
ciple.
    The setting (read Esther 1, RSV). King Ahasuerus gives a seven-
day banquet—lavish, long, and decadent—for his court.
    The point of contention. Gorgeous Queen Vashti refuses to flaunt
her beauty as commanded to the drunken audience. The refusal esca-
lates to a national crisis: "For this deed of the queen will be made
known to all women, causing them to look with contempt upon their
husbands, since they will say, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Queen
Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come" (vs. 17).
    The result. Vashti, standing on principle despite great personal
cost to herself, lost her position as queen.

   Little is known about this remarkable woman, Vashti, who, even
in such a male-dominated culture, refused to compromise her mod-
esty. In what ways could she have easily rationalized a decision to
obey the king's order? Write down a few "good" reasons.



   2.


   In comparison, there's also the story of Joseph and his master's
wife:
   The setting (Gen. 39). "So Joseph found favor in his [Potiphar's]
sight and attended him, and he . . . put him in charge of all that he had"
(vs. 4, RSV).
   The point of contention. Because Joseph was "handsome and
good-looking" (vs. 6), Potiphar's wife lusted for the appealing youth.
"And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen
to her, to lie with her or to be with her" (vs. 10, RSV).
    The result. Potiphar's wife told lies about Joseph that caused him
to be imprisoned.

     In both cases, those who stood for principle suffered painful
 consequences. Think of people today who, because they refused
 to compromise truth, have suffered terribly. What lessons can
 we draw from their experiences?

                                                                       35

FURTHER STUDY: Wives as Cooperators (Study passages
below).

   The following couples illustrate husbands and wives who func-
tioned in agreement. Although the Bible records no explicit in-
struction the wife gave her husband, what is described suggests
that there must have been intense discussions preceding their
activities.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
    Some couples united in evil-doing; others united in doing God's
 will. Discuss the possible rationale that each couple could have used
 in making the decision that they did; at the same time what rationale
 could they have used to have acted differently?

  United in evil: Ahab and Jezebel.
   1 Kings 16:31: Ahab marries Jezebel.
   1 Kings 18:4: Jezebel persecutes God's prophets.
   1 Kings 18:17: Ahab asks Elijah if Elijah is the one who is
troubling Israel.
   1 Kings 19:1, 2: Ahab tells Jezebel about Elijah; she then vows to
take Elijah's life.

  United in evil: Ananias and Sapphira.
   Acts 5:1: The couple sells a piece of property.
   Acts 5:2, RSV: "and with his wife's knowledge he kept back
some of the proceeds, and brought only a part and laid it at the
apostles' feet."
   Acts 5:3-5: Peter questions Ananias; then Ananias dies. Acts 5:7-
10: Peter questions Sapphira; then she dies.

     United for good: Joseph and Mary.
      Luke 1:26-56: Mary believes incredible information.
      Matt. 1:18-25: Joseph follows wondrous instructions.
      Luke 2:7: Jesus is born.

SUMMARY: If you think of witnessing as an activity you do alone,
reflect on the couples studied this week, contemplating the compound
impact each pair made. Their actions influenced others—for good or
for evil—at the time they were initially done, and their behaviors still
witness, either for good or for evil, as their Bible records continue to
be studied by millions.

                Blessings Amid Terror, Part 1
                             J. H. Zachary

   Indonesia has been wracked with economic and political turmoil.
Riots in the city of Solo left dozens dead and countless homes and
businesses destroyed. However, God has brought good out of terror
and destruction.
   Melly had worked hard to build a profitable electronics business.
Her customers liked her gentle ways and honest dealings. As the
business grew, she spent more and more time in the shop.
   "All I could think of was business, business, business," Melly said.
She even became reluctant to leave her store closed while she attended
church on Sunday. Often during worship service she found herself
watching the clock and thinking about the customers that would be
waiting for her to open the store.
    Then the riots hit. Mobs of angry protestors ran through the city
streets looting and burning automobiles, businesses, homes, and gov-
ernment offices.
    Melly was not home at the time. She received a phone call from her
frantic sister saying, "Don't come home! Everything is gone." Melly's
electronics store, along with her home above it, was one of more than
200 businesses destroyed during the riots.
    Out of work, Melly had a lot of time to think. She turned to God for
answers and consolation. When she received an invitation to attend
evangelistic meetings, she went. Night after night she sat on the front
row listening, looking up Bible verses, and taking careful notes.
    After several nights she testified, "I now understand that the loss of
my business was a blessing. Now I have time for God; now I can study
the Bible; now I have peace in my heart. I want to be baptized."
    A few days later she joyfully announced that her sister, whom she
                                  had invited to attend with her, also
                                  asked to be baptized.

                                                (continued next week)

                                    Melly (left) lost everything in the
                                 riots, but she found a new relationship
                                 with her Savior. J. H. Zachary is

 Joseph: From Pit to Palace




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Read (as much as possible) the
Joseph saga in Genesis 30-50.

     MEMORY TEXT: "'How then can I do this great wickedness,
     and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9b, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: As one of the most detailed biographies in
Scripture, the narrative of Joseph highlights his life, from birth to
death. From a biographer's viewpoint, he is a complex character, a
first-magnitude star who deserves all the space given him in Scripture.
There are a lot of lessons, subtle and not so subtle, to be learned from
the Joseph saga.

WHAT A STORY! What novelist could invent such a tale? A
biographer of Joseph need only record the facts to unravel a
fascinating narrative. His story contains it all—the tensions of
his birth; the jealous dealings of his older brothers; the sus-
penseful murder plot; the fabricated cover-up; the terrifying trip
to Egypt (with time to reflect on his altered circumstances from
indulged favorite to slave); the politics of Potiphar's household
and the subsequent seduction attempt; the despair of the prison;
the rise to power as an interpreter of dreams; the years of plenty
and the years of famine; the fight for emotional control at the
sight of his brothers; the money planted in the sacks and the
missing cup; the tests of the brothers' reformed characters; the
revelation as to who Joseph was; the unbelievable reunion of
father and son.
   Truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction.

THE EARLY YEARS (Gen. 30:22-24).

   Two sisters are married to one husband who loves one sister notice-
ably more than the other. Hardly a formula for a happy home, to say
the least. But the animosity heightens when the lesser-loved wife,
Leah, has six sons—and Rachel, the other wife, has none.
   "'Give me children, or I shall die!"' Rachel finally cries out in
desperation (Gen. 30:1, RSV). Then, when Joseph finally is born, the
jubilant Rachel asks for another son (Gen. 30:24), whom she gets.

   In what ironic way is this request answered? Gen. 35:16-20.


   Brought forth into a troubled household, then left motherless at
Benjamin's birth, Joseph next appears in Scripture as a seventeen-
year-old shepherding flocks with his older brothers. The relation be-
tween Joseph and his brothers is not presented as healthy, to be sure.
See Genesis 37:2.
   The tensions heighten when Jacob demonstrates his partiality to
Joseph by tailoring him a special robe: "But when his brothers saw that
their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and
could not speak peaceably to him" (Gen. 37:4, RSV). The situation
worsens when Joseph decides to tell his brothers of a dream that he had.

  What contents of the dream particularly offend the brothers?
Gen. 37:5-8.


   If that were not offensive enough, Joseph dreams again, and this
time even his indulgent father becomes irritated: "`What is this dream
that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers
indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?" (Gen.
37:10, RSV).

 The story of Joseph's early years reveals the importance of a good
 family life, especially for children. In fact, how we're raised as
 children radically impacts who we are as adults. Indeed, often by
 the time we are five or six, our characters for life are formed. How
 crucial, then, for parents to do all they can to love, nurture, and
 provide all the emotional stability possible for a child.

    Jessica was raised in an abusive home; the emotional scars
 followed her into adulthood. What biblical promises can you
 hold out to someone like her about the power of God to heal,
 even when the damage goes so deep?

                                                                     39

THE DREAMER COMETH (Gen. 37:19-25).

   Evidently neither Jacob nor Joseph realized the intensity of the
brothers' hatred, or Jacob never would have sent Joseph to them
(Gen. 37:14). So deep was their feeling that they, actually, "con-
spired against him to slay him" (vs. 18). It's hard to imagine a family
so dysfunctional that brothers would conspire to kill one of their
own. Fortunately, one son suggested an alternative: just throw the
boy in a pit (as a ploy to later save him from death). Though the plan
kept Joseph alive, it still didn't save him from being sold into
slavery.

  What fact helped the brothers decide it would be best not to kill
Joseph? Gen. 37:27.


   Biographers stress single life-changing events. Often when famous
people are interviewed, the interviewer seeks to find out about a single
event that radically impacted the person's life. Rarely, however, are
such single events as dramatic as Joseph's transition from favored son
to slave! And yet, even in this calamity, the Bible says that "The Lord
was with Joseph" (Gen. 39:2).

  How does one reconcile the text that says "the Lord was with
Joseph" with the fact that the boy was still taken into captivity?
Why couldn't the Lord have spared him from such a trauma?
What does this incident teach us about assuming that, when trag-
edy comes, the Lord has forsaken us?



   Though many people in Joseph's situation could have become
bitter and angry over their fate, blaming everyone else (including
God) for their problems, inspiration says that this "one day's
experience had been the turning point in Joseph's life. Its terrible
calamity had transformed him from a petted child to a man,
thoughtful, courageous, and self-possessed."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 214.

   Though true that tragedies can, at times, make people noble,
strong, and even into more faithful Christians, it's also true that
tragedies can also break people, make them hateful, and cause
them to lose faith. While it's easy to draw inspiration and cour-
age from the former, how can we help the latter, those whose
tragedies hardly have turned them into a Joseph?

THE SEDUCTRESS (Gen. 39:6-23).

    In fifth century B.c., Sophocles wrote a play called Antigone, in
which the heroine, Antigone, chooses to face death rather than obey
King Creon's decree forbidding her to give a proper burial to her
brother, killed in a revolt. Antigone's words, in which she said that if
burying her brother "were a crime, then it's a crime that God de-
mands," have been cited as one of the world's first accounts of people
seeking to obey a higher, unwritten law over any man-made decree or
demand. Yet in Joseph's refusal to succumb to the advances of his
master's wife, another example of the same principle was found—
maybe a thousand years before Antigone was written!

  What was it in Joseph's response to her advances that showed
he was acting out of a higher law than even any man-made law
against adultery? See Gen. 39:9.


   Had Joseph succumbed to her advances, he would have sinned
against himself, against his master, and even against his master's
wife. And yet, in his cry, he expressed concern about sinning
"against God." Joseph, apparently, understood something of the
nature of sin as it relates to God Himself. Many centuries later,
David, after committing adultery and murder, lamented in his
prayer of confession to the Lord that "against thee, thee only,
have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight" (Ps. 51:4)—even
though he took another man's wife and then killed the man! Each
of these sinners realized the heinous nature of sin and that his sin
reached even to heaven.

   In what ways, when we commit sin, are we sinning against
God? What does that mean, and why would David and Joseph
stress that aspect of their sin over other aspects?


   Joseph, again, through no fault of his own, found himself in a bad
situation: this time in a dungeon, where according to Psalm 105:18,
his "feet" were "hurt with fetters," and "he was laid in iron." How
easy it would have been for him to succumb to discouragement and
bitterness.

    Joseph took a stand that cost him dearly. When was the last
 time you took a stand that cost you something? And if you
 haven't, is it because no "opportunity" came, or is it because
 when you did, you chose the easy way out?

                                                                     41

FROM PRISON TO PALACE (Gen. 41:39-45).

   Even in prison, Joseph's talents blossomed: "And the keeper of the
prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the
prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it; the keeper
of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph's care,
because the Lord was with him; and whatever he did, the Lord made it
prosper" (Gen. 39:22, 23, RSV).
   "The part which Joseph acted in connection with the scenes of the
gloomy prison, was that which raised him finally to prosperity and
honor. God designed that he should obtain an experience by tempta-
tions, adversity, and hardships, to prepare him to fill an exalted posi-
tion."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 146 (emphasis supplied).

   Review the stories of the butler's, baker's, and Pharaoh's dreams
(Genesis 40; 41). Though the butler ignored Joseph's request, only
when it became self-serving to mention Joseph did he do so (Gen.
41:8-14). What does this episode teach us about how the Lord can
use selfish actions for good?


   How ironic—having angered his brothers with his dream and inter-
pretations, Joseph was thrown into a pit; now he was being taken out
of a prison pit because he could interpret dreams!
   Wisely, Joseph's interpretation of the seven fat and seven lean
years dream came with a proposal: "Now therefore let Pharaoh select
a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt," gather-
ing food from the years of plenty to provide for the years of famine
(Gen. 41:33-36, RSV). The man picked for that task was Joseph.
Thus, he went from being a despised prisoner to one of the most
powerful and honored and influential men in all Egypt. See Genesis
41:39-43.

   There is no doubt that Joseph maintained his integrity in
times of adversity and hardship. Now, as he was going to a
position of great wealth, power, and prestige, he would face a
whole new set of trials and temptations. In what ways would
Joseph's new position pose a greater danger to his walk with
God than he previously faced? What examples do we find in the
Bible of great people corrupted by wealth and power?

THE DREAM FULFILLED (Gen. 45:1-4).

  "Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain,
because the famine was severe over all the earth" (Gen. 41:57,
RSV).

    So came the brothers of Joseph as well. And though they had sold
Joseph into slavery many years earlier—their first thought after
Joseph put them in jail was that this trial was a punishment for their
sin!
    "And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. And
Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not
sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also
his blood is required" (Gen. 42:21, 22, emphasis supplied).

   What does this incident show about the power of a guilty con-
science, even so long after the sin was first committed? What other
examples are found in Scripture that show the power of a guilty
conscience? Judas is one, Herod is another. What others can you
think of?


   Joseph could have revealed himself to his brothers right away.
Instead, he put them through a painful trial in order to test their
character, to see if they had changed (see Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 225). Especially poignant was the plea of Judah, willing to stay in
bondage in Egypt rather than leave his younger brother Benjamin
there to suffer that fate (Gen. 44:33). Joseph, satisfied about their
change, then revealed himself to them (Gen. 45:3).
   Though, no doubt, the happy turn of events for Joseph certainly
could have helped him forgive, it would be understandable, at least
from a human perspective, if he had extracted revenge on his brothers.
Instead of seeking revenge, he sought, instead, to teach his brothers a
few lessons for their own good. Joseph's actions show the grace of
God working in his life, even as he stood at the pinnacle of power in
an overtly heathen land.

    One of the greatest struggles we deal with is the question of
 forgiveness. All of us, to some degree or another, have suffered
 unfairly at the hands of others. What can we learn from the
 Joseph story about the power of forgiveness? Also, why does
 forgiveness often bring more benefits to the one forgiving than
 to the one forgiven?

                                                                    43

FURTHER STUDY: Joseph, a Type of Christ (Gen. 50:20, 21).

   In addition to the extensive references in Genesis, Joseph merits
mention in twelve other books of the Bible. But what an even greater
distinction to be a symbolic Christ figure: "The integrity of Joseph and
his wonderful work in preserving the lives of the whole Egyptian
people were a representation of the life of Christ."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 286.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In what ways do the following excerpts suggest parallels
     between the life of Christ and of Joseph? "By his wisdom
     and justice, by the purity and benevolence of his daily life,
     by his devotion to the interests of the people . . . Joseph
     was a representative of Christ."—Testimonies for the Church,
     vol. 6, pp. 219, 220. "When Joseph's brethren acknowl-
     edged their sin before him, he freely forgave them, and
     showed by his acts of benevolence and love that he har-
     bored no resentful feelings for their former cruel conduct
     toward him."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 176 (emphasis sup-
     plied).

     2. Though his brothers meant evil to Joseph, the Lord turned
        it into good (Gen. 50:20). Suppose, however, Joseph's situ-
        ation had turned out very differently, in that he didn't
        prosper in Egypt but suffered terribly the whole time.
        Would he have been so likely to forgive? What evidence
        does the Bible (or Spirit of Prophecy) give regarding Joseph's
        life and character that could help us answer this specula-
        tive question?

SUMMARY: Not only is Joseph a Christ-figure, but his whole life
duplicates the pattern of the human race: starting out in the bliss of
Eden, humanity soon plunged into the pits of evil, now thousands of
years later still looking for the deliverance promised in Revelation.
Likewise Joseph's favored-child existence ended in a literal pit, mi-
raculously surviving that ordeal to experience the trials and triumphs
of life in Egypt, the land of sojourn. He ultimately lived a prominent,
fulfilled, godly life. We must remind ourselves of the glorious truth
the story illustrates: God's love still saves abandoned sinners from the
pit of hopelessness!

              Blessings Amid Terror, Part 2
                            J. H. Zachary

   Dr. Rudyanto is an Adventist physician and businessman living in
Solo, Indonesia. One morning he awoke to the sounds of angry
shouting and stones bouncing off the metal doors of his furniture
shop that adjoined his home. From his window he could see flames
devour a business across the street.
   The police were powerless to stop the rampaging mobs. The
family gathered to ask for God's protection.
   The hail of stones increased. Then the doctor heard someone
trying to break through the heavy iron doors that protected the
building. If the rioters succeeded, the doctor's family would be in
serious danger.
   Suddenly another group of voices began shouting in front of the
building. Dr. Rudyanto watched amazed as some 25 Muslim men
pushed their way through the mob and refused to let the rioters
destroy the building. Dr. Rudyanto recognized the men; they lived in
a small settlement of poor families nearby. He had treated many of
their medical needs, often for free if they could not pay.
   Now these neighbors stood between the rioters and the doctor's
family, shouting, "Please leave! The doctor is a good man; he is our
friend. Do not harm his property!" After the mob moved on, the
Muslim men remained to guard the building as other rioters stormed
down the street, stealing and destroying everything they could.
   One of their Muslim friends urged the Rudyanto family to come to
their home, where they would be safer. The family slipped out the
rear door and followed the man home. They remained in the home of
their friend until the riots ended.
   Why did these Muslims risk their lives to protect a Christian
family? "They are our friends," one man answered. "When we are
sick or in need, they help us."
   Although no Adventists were reported killed during the riots,
some lost everything they owned. Please pray for Indonesia and for
                                      the Adventist believers there.

                   Sibling Rivalry




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Read in context the text, or
texts, at the beginning of each day's study.

     MEMORY TEXT: "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is
     born for adversity" (Proverbs 17:17, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The devil delights to pollute whatever has the
greatest potential for good. Aware of the comfort that God intends an
ideal sibling relationship could bring, Satan encourages contention to
counter any positive benefits.

SIBLING REFERENCES PERMEATE THE SCRIPTURES.
Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible lists about five hundred
texts that reference brothers or sisters, suggesting that the relationship
is important to document. One famous text stresses, by implication,
the power of this genetic bond: "There are friends who pretend to be
friends, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother" (Prov.
18:24, RSV). The proverb says, as it were, "Can you believe that in
spite of the fact that fake friends do exist, it is still entirely possible to
have a friend who will be more loyal than even a brother!" Notwith-
standing the close genetic and environmental ties siblings share, many
corrupt the relationship with strife. Even twins contend.
    Using the tools of psychology, biographers debate the causes of
sibling rivalry: gender issues, age differences, birth order, parental
favorites, physical characteristics, personality types, natural talents,
and spiritual orientations.
    As you study the siblings discussed this week, analyze the causes
of the contention. Then ask, "Was the one sibling totally right and the
other completely wrong?"

CAIN AND ABEL (Gen. 4:9; 1 John 3:12).

   There's an incredible irony in the Cain and Abel story, an irony
brought out in Hebrews 11:4: "By faith Abel offered unto God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he
was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
speaketh." Though Hebrews 11 is the great faith chapter, in most
every instance, faith is made manifest by works. Even Abel's offering
of an animal sacrifice, as opposed to Cain's offering of the "fruit of
the ground," is represented as a work of faith, a deed expressing his
dependence upon Another's righteousness for his own salvation. In
contrast, Cain's fruit offering is rejected, not being an act of faith but
an act borne out of self-dependence and self-righteousness and the
idea being that our works are good enough to make us acceptable to
God.

   How is the gospel expressed in the Cain-and-Abel story?
   Why would Abel, trusting in the coming Sacrifice in his behalf,
be described as having righteous works? (1 John 3:12). Did his
works make him righteous, or were they merely an expression of
the righteousness he had by faith?


    Except for three negative New Testament references (Heb. 11:4;
1 John 3:12; Jude 11), Cain is mentioned only in Genesis 4. One chap-
ter, one deed . . . how tragic to be defined for eternity by an action that
probably took less than a minute.
    By comparison, except for four positive New Testament references
(Matt. 23:35; Luke 11:51; Heb. 11:4; Heb. 12:24), Abel is also men-
tioned only in Genesis 4, where he's depicted as the victim of a
vindictive and guilty sibling.

 Scripture doesn't detail the story of Cain and Abel; it focuses
 mostly on the murder. Yet the murder didn't happen in a vacuum:
 many other less dramatic things preceded this sad climax. In other
 words, years of events led up to each brother playing his distinct
 role. Read as much as possible the chapter "Cain and Abel Tested"
 in Patriarchs and Prophets (pp. 71-79), to see just how this prin-
 ciple was manifested in this tragic tale.

   Cain and Abel symbolize two classes of people: the saved and
 the lost. What aspects of Cain do you see in yourself? What
 aspects of Abel? Remembering that sooner or later one aspect
 will ultimately rule over the other, what right choices can you
 make now to ensure you're symbolized more by Abel, not Cain?

                                                                        47

JACOB AND ESAU—THE TWINS (Gen. 25:27).

   "The first came forth red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so
they called his name Esau. Afterward his brother came forth, and
his hand had taken hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called
Jacob" (Gen. 25:25, 26a, RSV).

   Their differences showed early, as did the parental preferences:
"When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the
field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Isaac loved
Esau, because he ate of his game; but Rebekah loved Jacob" (Gen.
25:27, 28, RSV).

   Though we can't do anything about genetics, environment—to
a large degree—has a big role to play in child development. What
mistakes did the parents make that led to such a rift?


   Review the details of the plot Rebekah and Jacob devised to trick
Isaac (Gen. 27:5-29). When Jacob expressed disdain for the plot, his
mother said, " 'Let your curse be on me, my son' " (Gen. 27:13, NKJV).
When the plot didn't turn out as planned, she later on cried out, " 'Why
should I be bereft of you both in one day?"' (Gen. 27:45, RSV).
Though Rebekah managed to spare Jacob's life by urging him to flee,
she probably never saw him again. What a sad price a doting mother
had to pay for her deceit!

  Give other examples from the Bible where those who sought to
obtain blessings through deceit reaped only sorrow.


   Safely away from Esau, Jacob's problem goes on hold for twenty
years; however, the inevitable reunion with his brother comes. Review
the account of their meeting, as depicted in Genesis 32 and 33, looking
specifically at Jacob's night of wrestling with the Angel (32:22-32)
and discuss the ways in which that incident helped prepare Jacob for
the meeting with his brother (read "The Night of Wrestling" in Patri-
archs and Prophets, pp. 195-203). What elements caused this story to
have a happy ending? In many ways, it's a testimony to the grace of
God working in the lives of repentant sinners.

   Few people ever escape the grip of guilt, especially when their
sin causes pain to others. What lessons can we learn from the
story of Esau and Jacob to help those struggling with guilt
because of sin?

TWO AGAINST ONE: MIRIAM AND AARON VERSUS MOSES
(Num. 12:1, 2).

   Though this lesson focuses on an unfortunate incident between
Moses and his siblings, prior to that time the Bible shows them in
moments of great harmony. Look at the courage of Miriam in saving
the life of her baby brother (Exod. 2:1-10). Likewise, Aaron and
Moses did great things together: "And the Lord said to Moses, 'See,
I make you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your
prophet. You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your
brother shall tell Pharaoh to let the people of Israel go out of his
land'" (Exod. 7:1, 2, RSV). Also it was Miriam, now a prophetess,
who led out with music and dance in celebration of the great victory
over the Egyptians at the Red Sea. And it was Aaron who held up
Moses' tired hands during battle (Exod. 15, 16, and 17).

   Unfortunately, as in all relationships, the good times don't
always last. See Numbers 12:1, 2. Though Aaron and Miriam
spoke against Moses' wife, a deeper issue comes to the surface in
this confrontation. What is it, and why is it so bad?


   We tend to think of sibling rivalry as something that happens
between children, not married adults; yet, clearly, in this incident both
Aaron and Miriam show jealousy regarding Moses' exalted position.
What made their actions even worse was that both had already been
greatly favored by the Lord. Yet even amid all the miraculous events,
Aaron and Miriam allowed themselves to be caught up in the original
sin (Lucifer was jealous of Christ's position). In contrast, see what
Numbers 12:3 says about Moses and his character. In many ways this
simple verse explains why Moses, not Aaron nor Miriam, was chosen
for the exalted position he held.

    When the Lord decided to punish Miriam by giving her lep-
 rosy, who interceded for her? Moses—the one whom they origi-
 nally sinned against. "So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying,
 `Please heal her, 0 God, I pray!'" (Num. 12:13, NKJV). What
 lessons can we learn here about forgiveness of those who sin
 against us?


    What was it about Moses that enabled him, immediately
 after being so offended, to nevertheless seek forgiveness for
 his sister? In what ways was Moses acting as a "type" for
 Christ?

                                                                      49

MARY AND MARTHA (Luke 10:40).

  "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus" (John
11:5, RSV).

   Through the brief account of the minor contention between Martha
and Mary during one of Jesus' visits to their home, an important
spiritual lesson is given.

   Read Luke 10:38-42 carefully before noting these comments
that flesh out the significance of the brief story.
   Verse 38: "Though Luke does not name it here, the 'village' was
clearly Bethany (see John 11:1), and this was Jesus' first visit to it (see
DA 525).
   Verse 39: "Whereas Martha, being in charge of the home, was by
nature of a practical turn of mind, Mary was less concerned with
material things than with spiritual things.
   Verse 40: "Martha probably realized from past experience that
nothing would be gained by an appeal to Mary directly. . . . In
appealing to Jesus, Martha not only blamed Mary but indirectly cen-
sured Jesus as well. The real trouble, she implied, lay in the fact that
He did "not care" about the situation or intend to do anything about
it—that He was more pleased to have Mary listen to Him than to have
her assist in preparing the meal.
   Verse 41: "Repetition of a name implies affection and sometimes
concern. . . . Those who become followers of Jesus should avoid the
spirit of anxious care that moved Martha in her petulant appeal to
Jesus.
   Verse 42: "Martha was diligent, prompt, and energetic, but lacked
the calm, devotional spirit of her sister Mary (see DA 525). She had
not learned the lesson set forth in Matt. 6:33, of making the kingdom
of God first in her interests and endeavors, and of allotting material
things a subordinate role (see vs. 24-34). . . . The material things in
which Martha interested herself could be taken away (see chs. 12:13-
21; 16:25, 26). Mary was storing up 'treasure in the heavens that
faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth' (Luke
12:33; see on Matt. 6:19-21)."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
pp. 785, 786.

   Martha was attempting to serve the Lord by being diligent at
 work. Yet she was the one whom Jesus had to correct. How can we
 avoid being so busy "working for the Lord" that we neglect other
 important matters (such as family)? On the other hand, think of a
 parable or biblical story in which those who neglect the Lord's
 work are rebuked. How do we find the proper balance?

THE PRODIGAL SON AND THE ELDER BROTHER (Luke
15:29, 30).

   One of the most moving sections in all Scripture is the story of the
prodigal son. What a powerful representation of God's love for repen-
tant sinners.
   Yet there's also another message found there; it comes from the
words and attitude of the elder brother, who is determined to squash
the joyous celebration of his younger brother's return. Confronting his
father, the older brother lets loose with a list of complaints (Luke
15:29, 30, RSV):
   "Lo, these many years I have served you"—the argument of length
of service.
   "I never disobeyed your command"—the argument of obeyed or-
ders.
   "Yet you never gave me a kid"—the argument of unequal remu-
neration.
   "But when this son of yours came [note he does not refer to him as
his brother], who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for
him the fatted calf!"—the argument of not only did I not get equal
remuneration, but the scoundrel who deserved to get less instead got
more.

 From a human perspective, the brother had many valid complaints.
 What the father did was not, in a sense, fair. Yet this is precisely
 what the gospel is about, that of God not being "fair." After all, a
 person suffering for the misdeeds of another is hardly what one
 would call fair. And yet that is exactly what Christ did—suffer for
 the sin of others. We should be thankful; for because if God were
  yair" and gave us what we deserved, what would be our fate?

   The complaints of the elder brother were natural, if not right. How
easy it is to throw in the faces of sinners their sins. Those who have
erred often (but not always) need pity, help, sympathy—not stern
rebuke. If ever there were a time to reflect the character of Christ, it is
in showing mercy to those who have fallen short because we all have
fallen short ourselves.

    Anders has sinned grievously against his wife, his children,
 his church, and His Lord. Though he showed true repentance
 for his sin and was forgiven by all involved, when told that he
 could not retain his previous church position, he bitterly com-
 plained that the forgiveness given him was not true forgiveness.
 Explain how a person can be truly forgiven and yet still bear
 certain consequences of his or her sin.

                                                                        51

FURTHER STUDY: Other Contentious Pairs (study in context
the scriptural references below).

     Additional siblings in contention:

Jotham and
Abimelech
(Judg. 9:21)
Ammon, Tamar,
and Absalom
(2 Sam. 13:14, 15, 32)

   We have studied genetic siblings. By spiritualizing the relation-
ship, Jesus enlarges the definition of brother and sister to include more
than blood relatives:
   "And he [Jesus] replied, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?'
And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, 'Here are my
mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother,
and sister, and mother"' (Mark 3:33-35, RSV).
   "If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of
you says to them, 'Go in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving
them the things needed for the body, what does it profit? So faith by
itself, if it has no works, is dead" (James 2:15, 16, RSV).

 Discussion Question:
  In how many of the relationships studied this week were the
  contentions settled according to Jesus' command? "'If your
  brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you
  and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
  But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you,
  that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or
  three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the
  church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be
  to you as a Gentile and a tax collector" (Matt. 18:15-17, RSV).

SUMMARY: Family quarrels seldom impact just the two people in
contention. The negative outcomes ripple out, impacting numerous
other lives, sometimes for generations.

                      Cristita Bandalan Garnado

   My father was much feared in our mountain village in the Philip-
pines. Nobody dared cross him. A datu (chief) and a fierce head-
hunter, he often joined in bloody tribal conflicts with other Manobo
villages. I remember my father hiding by the window in our hut and
shooting passersby with his bow and arrows. When he hit one, he
would laugh with pleasure as the victim crawled away in pain. To
my father, this was a game. His family did not escape his heartless
ways. We children trembled when he roared at us like a lion.
    Then student missionaries from Mountain View College came to
our village to open a school and teach the children to read and write.
My father was not interested in the school or the missionaries, but
other villagers were glad for a school to teach their children.
    Eagerly the villagers worked to build the schoolhouse. Women
and children gathered grass for the roof, and the men cut wood for
the walls. It took us just a week to finish our school.
    Our new teachers did not smoke like most lowlanders, and they
loved to sing. They made school fun, and we learned many things. I
was so shy that I hid in the corner of the school room during classes,
but I listened attentively to the lessons and Bible stories they told. I
admired the teachers for their good example and kindness to us.
Secretly I dreamed of becoming a teacher one day.
    When my brothers and sisters and I wanted to be baptized, we
had to ask our father. To our surprise, he did not object.
    My father objected when I wanted to go away to high school,
but my mother persuaded him to let me go. On my visits home I
began to sense changes in my father. He seemed gentler, and his
prejudice against the missionaries was fading. At my graduation
he stood proudly beside me, and on the way home he told me he
wanted to be baptized. What a miracle God has performed to
transform him from a fierce headhunter to a follower of gentle
Jesus!
    I enrolled at Mountain View College, where our school's mis-
sionary teachers had attended. I studied hard while there and gradu-
ated with a degree in education. I have dedicated my life to teach my
own people about the transforming love of Christ. Today I am a
 missionary teacher in another Manobo village that is just now hear-
 ing the good news of Jesus Christ.

mission school in the mountains of southern Philippines.

Floyd Greenleaf, is the quintessential history of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church. Greenleaf, a professor of history at Southern
Adventist University, takes Richard W. Schwarz's classic Light Bearers
                         to the Remnant and adds the exciting develop-
                                              ments in Adventism since the
                                               earlier edition was published
                                               more than twenty years ago.
                                              The result is a carefully
                                              researched, contemporary
                                             history of the Church that
                                             shows how continuity despite
                                            change, unity in diversity, and
                                            singleness of purpose amid an
                                           expanding breadth of activity
                                           have combined to produce an
                                          Adventist world that the pioneers
                                          could never have imagined.

          Children Showcased




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Prov. 22:6; plus, as time
permits, read the daily Bible texts in context.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Even a child is known by his doings,
     whether his work be pure, and whether it be right" (Prov-
     erbs 20:11).

   KEY THOUGHT: Biblical history testifies to the impact children
can exert, for good or evil. In turn, the influence that adults have on
impressionable young minds makes all the difference in determining
what kind of adults children become. How crucial, then, that children
be given the right training.

JESUS IDENTIFIED WITH CHILDREN. Unlike Adam and Eve,
Jesus was born a dependent infant. His earthly parents honored Heaven's
trust in them; Joseph and Mary provided an environment for Jesus to
flourish. "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor
with God and man" (Luke 2:52, RSV). As an adult, Jesus constantly
ministered to the needs of children. Once a child Himself, He knew
what children experienced and was therefore able to relate to the
young ones brought to Him.
    Such is the kingdom of heaven. When the Hebrew mothers brought
their babes to be blessed by Christ, the disciples tried to send them
away. But Jesus, checking His disciples, said, "Suffer little children,
and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of
heaven" (Matt. 19:14). Something about children made them ex-
amples of what's needed to be in the kingdom of heaven. Thus, this
week we learn from children what, perhaps, adults could never teach
us.

SAMUEL AND ELI'S SONS: A STUDY IN CONTRAST (1 Sam.
2:26; 2:12).

   One of the most enlightening parts of this story is the contrast
between the character of Samuel, son of Hannah, and the characters of
Phinehas and Hophni, the sons of Eli (Eli was a leader in Israel).
   "And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
Lord, and also with men" (1 Sam. 2:26). "Now the sons of Eli were
corrupt; they did not know the Lord" (1 Sam. 2:12, NKJV).

  What was the sin of Eli's two sons? See 1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22.


   Eli's sons used their office as priests to indulge their lusts and
passions. Though Scripture records Eli rebuking them (1 Sam.
2:22-25), his disciplinary measures came way too late (see Patri-
archs and Prophets, pp. 575-579). The Lord warned Eli that a great
punishment would come upon him and his house because of his
sons. In fact, the first prophecy given to young Samuel occurred
when the Lord told him that He would "perform against Eli all I
have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end" (1 Sam.
3:12, NKJV).

   What does the fact that the Lord punished Eli for the sins of his
children say about how seriously the Lord takes parental respon-
sibility?
   Are wayward children always the fault of bad parenting? Ex-
plain whichever answer you give with reasons why.


 Hannah worked very hard to give young Samuel good training;
 she succeeded where Eli obviously failed (we're told nothing about
 Eli's wife). Scripture gives a hint about what might have been one
 of Eli's mistakes. After Eli had been told that the Philistines took
 the ark of the covenant and killed his two sons, Scripture says that
 at the "mention of the ark of God" (1 Sam. 4:18), Eli keeled over
 and died. In other words—he seemed to show more concern about
 the ark than the death of his own sons! Though God needs to come
 first, even before family, could Eli have been too busy serving God
 that he neglected his own sons?


   Samuel grew up to be a great man of God. Yet he also didn't
 do too well with his children (see 1 Sam. 8:1-3). What lessons can
 parents learn from these unfortunate stories?

                                                                   57

DAVID: APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING (1 Sam. 17:49).

    No matter how often the story of David and Goliath is told to
children, there's an adult lesson there, not just about faith but about
prejudging those whom we might deem unsuitable for certain tasks.

   What were the objections that these people gave about David's
plans to battle Goliath?

     His eldest brother Eliab: 1 Sam. 17:28

     King Saul: 1 Sam. 17:33

     Goliath: 1 Sam. 17:42-44

   On the surface, the objections didn't seem totally unreasonable. The
problem, however, was that when we deal with issues of faith and God,
we shouldn't be limited by reason alone. Reason would have said that
David was unsuitable to take on such a task. Yet the God we serve is a
God whose wisdom, might, and power extend far beyond the limits of
human reason. Thus, we shouldn't be surprised when through Him
people are able to perform tasks that reason would say are impossible.

   What other examples in Scripture tell of someone who ac-
complished great things, despite his or her youth and supposed
inexperience?


The year was 1762, and a boy had just turned five. That morning he
received his first violin. When the father's friends came over to play
their violins together, the child wanted to join in. "No, son," said his
father, "you cannot possibly play with us until you at least have had
some lessons." Tearfully, the child left but was called back after one
of the friends, Mr. Schachtner, persuaded the father to let the child
play. "OK," said the father, "just play softly so no one hears you."
After a few minutes all the violins were silenced, except the child's;
everyone listened in astonishment. How could this child—with no
lessons or experience!—play such complicated music so beauti-
fully? Mr. Mozart was, indeed, shocked at young Wolfgang's musi-
cal ability. Thus, even with secular things, we need to be careful
about prejudging youth and inexperience.

  Consider Ellen White: sickly, a girl, little education, and barely
out of her teens! Yet called to the prophetic ministry. In what ways
does her experience parallel what David experienced with Goliath?

THE CHILDREN AND THE BEARS (2 Kings 2:23, 24).

   "He [Elisha] went up from there to Bethel; and while he was
going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and
jeered at him, saying, 'Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
(2 Kings 2:23, RSV).

   Elisha had dedicated his life to the spiritual needs of his nation.
Yet, as he was entering upon this mission, a number of youth came out
of Bethel to mock him. Their words about him going "up" showed that
they knew something of the ascension of Elijah, a solemn and sacred
event (it's not every day someone is translated without seeing death!).
With Elijah gone, they turned their taunts to Elisha, derisively calling
upon him also to make his ascent.

   Their behavior can be traced to two sources:
   The devil. "The young men were inspired by Satan, who was seek-
ing to do what he could to counteract the effect of the solemn event that
had occurred and that could not but leave a deep impression upon the
people of the land."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 856.
   The parents. "Elijah had been translated to heaven, and his mantle
had fallen upon Elisha. Then wicked youth, who had learned from
their parents to despise the man of God, followed Elisha, and mock-
ingly cried, 'Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.' "—Early
Writings, pp. 247, 248.

  How did Elisha respond to their taunts? Did he pray for them?
Did he turn his cheek? Did he try encouraging them to repent?
2 Kings 2:24.


   "The awful judgment that came upon them was of God. After this,
Elisha had no further trouble in his mission. For fifty years he passed
in and out of the gate of Bethel, and went to and fro from city to city,
passing through crowds of the worst and rudest of idle, dissolute
youth, but no one ever mocked him or made light of his qualifications
as the prophet of the Most High. This one instance of terrible severity
in the commencement of his career was sufficient to command respect
through his whole life."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 44.

   However harsh their judgment might seem, however much
 about their tragic fate we still might not understand, this story
 can serve as a powerful warning against those who scorn holi-
 ness or who mock those called of God. In what ways can we,
 even today, be guilty of the same sin?

                                                                      59

THE LITTLE MAID: SHE WITNESSES (2 Kings 5:2-4).

   Naaman, a great military leader, is afflicted with a loathsome
disease for which he can find no cure. Along comes a "little maid,"
a child taken captive by his victorious armies, who knows where he
can get help. "If only my master were with the prophet who is in
Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy" (2 Kings 5:3,
NKJV). Look at the incredible confidence this child displayed in
the power of her God, even after she had been taken away as a
captive by the invading Syrians, a calamity that could have easily
caused her to doubt the power, and even the existence, of the God
she served.

   Were risks involved in the "little maid's" advice? Suppose after
humbling himself to where he sought help from a "foreign" God,
he weren't healed? How might Naaman have responded?


   Not only did the Little Maid witness to Naaman and his cohorts,
but she remains a symbol today of those who keep faithful and posi-
tive in spite of extreme adversity:
   "A marauding band from Syria had swooped down upon her
helpless nation, and she, through no fault of her own, had been
one of the victims. She had been carried away into a strange land.
Thus she had been robbed in a single day of her home, of her
father and mother, of her brothers and sisters, of every outward
possession that heretofore had enriched her life. And to crown
all, she had been robbed of her freedom. . . . But though she had
been robbed of every outward possession, there were some trea-
sures to which she still clung. There are values, thank God, that
physical force and violence cannot touch. Life can do harsh and
horrible things to us. . . . But she also knew through her experi-
ence another and a finer fact; she knew that there are treasures of
which no force however great and however cruel can rob us."
—Covis G. Chappell, Feminine Faces (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Baker Book House, 1974), pp. 91, 92. See also Prophets and
Kings, pp. 244-250.

    Somehow, even amid adversity, this child, not even named in
Scripture, adhered to the faith she had been raised on. Though
little detail is given, what factors could have played a role in
shaping her so that, despite outward circumstances, she not only
kept her faith but witnessed in a powerful way for that faith?
What are we doing so that our children could do the same?
Could we do the same?

JOSIAH—HE RULES (2 Kings 22:1, 2).

  "Before him there was no king like him, who turned to the Lord
with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might,
according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after
him" (2 Kings 23:25, RSV).

   Though Josiah was only eight years old when he began to reign, the
Hebrew nation never had a king quite like him. Almost the whole
account of his 31-year rule, as depicted in 2 Kings, deals with his
attempt to eradicate pagan influence and restore the true worship of
God. Second Kings 23:3 states that the king made a covenant with the
Lord to "keep his commandments and his testimonies and his stat-
utes."

   What does the people's reaction to Josiah's pledge (vs. 3) teach
about the great influence that leaders have on the spirituality of
those they lead?


 Even a quick read in 2 Kings 23 about the reforms Josiah instituted
 can be sobering. Look at the pagan customs that had so infiltrated
 the nation, at every level! There were articles for the worship of
 pagan gods in the temple itself (vs. 4); there were priests who burned
 incense to pagan gods, including the sun and moon and stars (vs. 5).
 How could the chosen nation, with such clear warnings, have fallen
 into such blatant apostasy? Do you think this apostasy happened all
 at once, or slowly? Can you see this same happening in our church
 today? And are we just as blind to it?

   According to 1 Kings 22, the "book of the law" inspired Josiah to
institute radical change. When the book of the law was first read to
him, Josiah "tore his clothes" (vs. 11). Obviously, what the Lord had
commanded in the book of the law was not, he saw, being practiced by
the people, and therefore calamity awaited. Thus, using the Word of
God as his basis, he instituted radical reforms through the whole
nation. No doubt, many people, particularly those who were accus-
tomed to pagan worship, did not like what was happening. Yet, that
opposition didn't stop Josiah from doing what was right, no matter the
outcome.

    In the end, Josiah's reforms failed to avert catastrophe. He was
 even told beforehand that they wouldn't (2 Kings 22:18-20). Nev-
 ertheless, this reality didn't stop him from initiating reform. What
 lessons can we learn about obeying God, whatever the outcome?

                                                                     61
Friday                                                    May 18
FURTHER STUDY: Read the following familiar passage:
   "At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, 'Who is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?' And calling to him a child, he put
him in the midst of them, and said, 'Truly, I say to you, unless you
turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of
heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in
the kingdom of heaven'" (Matt. 18:1-4, RSV).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Jesus didn't say that it is a "good idea" to become like little
     children. He said that we must become like them, or we can
     never enter the kingdom of God. Those are strong words.
     What was He talking about? Why is it so crucial for us,
     then, to become like children?

     2. All analogies, or comparisons, break down at some point.
        In what ways might the admonition to be like a child not be
        advisable? Could, in fact, some of the aspects of being a
        child that are laudable become problems if taken too far?
        What characteristics of children would, in fact, be danger-
        ous for a Christian to manifest?

     3. Looking at the children in this week's lesson, do you think
        they were impacted more by hereditary or environmental
        influences? Of course, nothing can be done about heredity
        and, as often in the case of children—little, if anything, can
        be done about environment. As adults, environment can be
        controlled, at least to a degree. Discuss ways in which adults
        can seek to give children the best spiritual environment
        possible.

     4. Because it's an established principle that we are heavily
        influenced by what we hear, see, and read, how crucial is it
        that parents do their best to monitor the sources influenc-
        ing their children? What practical steps can parents take to
        ensure that their children are not being filled with things
        that will make spiritual growth difficult, especially when
        these children reach the age of accountability and have to
        make their own spiritual choices?

SUMMARY: Parents can take their children from the cradle to the
Cross, but no further. At the Cross, each individual has to make his or
her own choice. This week's lesson shows the power of parents in
creating influences that can impact what, finally, must always be a
personal decision.

                    I'm Going Back! Part 1
                        Charlotte Ishkanian
    Tania was starting her first assignment as a missionary nurse. She
would help reopen a mission hospital and train midwives and health
care workers.
    A pastor and his wife also had been assigned to serve in the area,
where most of the people are Adventists. The only pastor serving the
area was old and lacked transportation to visit all the churches.
    Tania surveyed the mission. Except for the church, the mission lay in
ruins. One home had been made liveable for the missionaries.
    People had heard that a nurse was coming and were waiting for
treatment. Tania began treating malaria, tropical sores, and diarrhea
with the few supplies she had. There was so much to do, and every night
she fell into bed exhausted but satisfied.
    One night she awoke to the sound of breaking glass. Someone was
breaking their windows! The pastor took his flashlight and went to the
door to see what he could do. "We want you!" some men shouted.
Instinctively Tania knew that this was not a medical emergency. Fright-
ened, she stumbled in the dark toward the pastor's room.
    The mob beat down the door, and when the pastor tried to calm the
angry men, they began beating him. The women cowered in the bed-
room praying and crying as the pastor suffered blow after blow. Some
men ran into the bedroom and began hitting Tania and the pastor's wife.
Would they kill them—or worse? Tania could do nothing but pray. The
mob tore up the rooms looking for valuables. One man accused the
missionaries of being government spies.
    When the invaders finally left, Tania and the pastor's wife lay still,
listening for sounds. They could hear the pastor's groans as he stumbled
toward the bedroom. He had been severely beaten, but in the darkness
there was little they could do. Together they waited for the dawn.
    As dawn lighted the sky, Tania treated the pastor's injuries. He
needed a doctor, but the mission was 13 hours by car from the nearest
city. They had no way to contact the outside world, and the pastor
needed help. But Tania did not want to leave. She had been there only 10
days, but she had seen the immense needs of the people. "There's so
much to do here," she said. "We can't quit!"
    The missionaries heard someone outside. It was the old pastor. He
had heard the mob's shouts and had tried to come and help them, but the
 mob would not let him through. He feared that they had been killed.
                                                (continued next week)

           The Personal Factor




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Eccles. 4:10; Matt. 9:37;
Matt. 10:7, 8; Matt. 11:4; 2 Cor. 1:11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the
     feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace"
     (Isaiah 52:7).

   KEY THOUGHT: Too often Christians prefer the easy way of
sharing: throw out some tracts, donate money to buy a mission launch,
give a quick witness on a bus or airplane, whatever. And then they feel
so good about themselves for having done the Lord's work.
   But to go out and physically bring people to Jesus, to cut deep into
personal time, to take away from the things they want to do for
themselves, and to use that time to lead a soul to Christ—that's not
often so attractive a choice.

THE HARD WORK OF EVANGELISM. A German immigrant working
near Otsego, Michigan, went into town one Saturday to get his hair cut.
To his astonishment, the only barbershop in town was closed, the sign
stating plainly, "Open Monday-Friday." So when he returned, he asked—
with a heavy German brogue he never lost—why the shop was closed
on the busiest day of the week. "I'm a Seventh-day Adventist—and a
German immigrant too" was the unexpected answer.
   Now, the barber could have handed the man a leaflet as he left the
shop, or he could have mentioned some meetings that were coming to
town and invited him to attend. But he witnessed by the most effective
technique—he invited the man home for dinner. He gave of himself,
his time, his energy. A friendship ensued, and the man was eventually
baptized.
   That's true witnessing!

HE DESCENDED THROUGH THE ROOF (Mark 2:1-12).

   "And when they could not get near him [Jesus] because of the
crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had
made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic
lay" (Mark 2:4, RSV).

   According to Mark, there were four men who, knowing that Jesus
was in the house, brought the paralytic to Him. Yet almost nothing has
been revealed about these men. Who were they? In what way were
they related to the paralytic? Family? Friends? Yet so determined
were they to get help, not for themselves, but for the discouraged
paralytic (see The Desire of Ages, p. 267), that they climbed onto the
roof of the house, broke through it, and then dropped the man down at
the feet of Jesus.
   Talk about friends! Talk about the personal factor! Talk about a
desire to bring someone to Jesus. Imagine if all who believed in Christ
were that determined to bring everyone to Him.

   Notice what Mark says in verse 5. "When Jesus saw their faith"
(emphasis supplied). Jesus was impressed by the faith of those
four unnamed men. In response, He said to the paralytic, "Son,
thy sins be forgiven thee." Analyze what's going on here. Accord-
ing to the text itself, it was the faith of these men as well (not just
the sick one) that promoted Jesus to move in behalf of the para-
lytic. What does this incident teach us about the role we have in
making God real to others?


 "At his suggestion his friends bore him to the top of the house and,
 breaking up the roof, let him down at the feet of Jesus. The
 discourse was interrupted. The Saviour looked upon the mournful
 countenance, and saw the pleading eyes fixed upon Him. He
 understood the case; He had drawn to Himself that perplexed and
 doubting spirit. While the paralytic was yet at home, the Saviour
 had brought conviction to his conscience. . . . Jesus had watched
 the first glimmer of faith grow into a belief that He was the
 sinner's only helper, and had seen it grow stronger with every
 effort to come into His presence. "—The Desire of Ages, p. 268.


    In this incident three factors are at work: the friends, who
 bring the person to Jesus; the paralytic, who was open to Christ;
 and Christ, who alone does the saving and the healing. In what
 ways does the story exemplify the work of evangelism?

                                                                     65

THE BETHESDA CRIPPLE (John 5:2-18).

   "Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these
lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered,
waiting for the moving of the water. And a certain man was there,
which had an infirmity thirty and eight years" (John 5:2, 3, 5).

   Hard to imagine, 38 years with a debilitating disease— and yet no
one to help him into the water! The fact that he would be left, trampled
by others wanting to get there first, says so much about sinful, selfish
humanity. Here is one man who could have used the four friends that
the paralytic had in Mark 2. In this case, however, when there was no
one to help him, Jesus Himself, the Great Physician, came along
instead.

   The cripple didn't have anyone to bring Him to Jesus; so Jesus
came to him. Does this fact in any way lessen our responsibility in
the work of evangelism? If we fail to do our part, do we have any
assurance that the Lord will seek people out Himself, without us?
Explain your answer.


   After healing the man, Jesus told him to "Rise, take up thy bed, and
walk" (vs. 8), even though it was the Sabbath day. When the leaders
saw him carrying his bed, they accused him of breaking the law. "It is
the sabbath day," they said, "it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed."
(vs. 10). Rather than be amazed about him being healed, or even
happy for him who had been sick for so long, they were more con-
cerned about "the law." Though Scripture doesn't say, it certainly
would be easy to imagine those who had accused him of violating the
Sabbath as being the same ones who would ignore him and let him lay
there, without trying to bring him to the water.
   How easy it is for us to be concerned with the forms of religion
while ignoring the most important things.

   In what ways is it possible for us, as Seventh-day Adventists,
to act like those who accused the man of violating the law? We
should each look at our lives and ask ourselves In what ways are
we facilitators, working to help souls find or better know Christ;
and in what ways are we like those who are so involved with
sticking to the law that we, in fact, use the law to hinder a
person's understanding of Christ and what Christ has done for
him or her?

THE PERSONAL FACTOR—COUSIN, BROTHER, FRIEND
(John 1).

  " 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
world!'" (John 1:29b, RSV).

  Newly introduced to Jesus, His earliest followers could not be
constrained. . . We have found the Messiah! . . . We have found the
Messiah! . . . We have found the Messiah!

   Fill in the blanks, noting the rapid transfer of the good news
from person to person:
   "The next day again John was standing with two of his dis-
ciples; and he looked at           as he walked, and said, 'Behold,
the Lamb of God!" (vss. 35, 36). Then               , one of the two,
searched out his brother               and told him (vs. 41). "The
next day Jesus ... found                 (vs. 43). Next, Philip found
             and said to him, " 'We have found him of whom Moses
in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son
of Joseph" (vs. 45).

  Not everyone in the time of Christ reacted so positively to Him.
The same miracles that converted some people turned others even
harder against Christ (see John 11). What causes people to have
such divergent reactions to the same message?


   This account of those who first accepted Christ shows how impor-
tant personal witnessing is. Many of those who had met Jesus immedi-
ately told others about Him.
   In fact, when Christ was here on earth, people could meet Him in
the flesh. Since then, the vast majority of souls who have come to
know Christ have not seen Him personally, as did the disciples.
Instead, they have come to Him through the power of the Spirit and
the Word of God. Yet even in many of these cases, it was the work of
personal witnessing that first introduced these souls to Christ. Those
who want to know about Jesus have to be told about Him, and Chris-
tians have been given the commission to do just that.

    A young man found Christ and the Adventist message through
 the personal witness of a man who, two years later, abandoned
 Christianity and became an active atheist. What does a story
 like this tell us about the limits of personal witnessing? In other
 words, however important the personal factor is, at what point
 does its crucial role end, if ever?

                                                                   67

THE DEMON CHILD (Mark 9:17-29).

   "Jesus said to him, 'If you can believe, all things are possible to
him who believes.'
   "Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with
tears, 'Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!' " (Mark 9:23, 24, NKJV).

   What an incredible cry, full of irony, even paradox: "Lord, I be-
lieve; help my unbelief." In other words, "I believe, sort of, but help
me believe and trust more than I do."

     To whom did the father first go for help? See Mark 9:18.


Note to whom Jesus' response of "0 faithless generation" was
probably directed: "It does not seem likely that Jesus had the father
of the demon possessed boy in mind as He spoke these words, for
the father's faith was not the only obstacle in the way of the healing
of his son. Because the disciples themselves were primarily at fault
(see on Mark 9:29), it would almost seem that the Saviour had them
in mind particularly."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 633.

    Answered and unanswered prayer. This story can cause per-
plexity if not understood in the context of all Scripture. How many
faithful Christians have had prayers for healing (including the
apostle Paul [2 Cor. 12]) and others requests not answered as they
had hoped? The logical question, in the context of this account
alone, would be, "Is it somehow my fault, for not having enough
faith?"
    Jesus said that "All things are possible to him who believes," (Mark
9:23, RSV, emphasis supplied), not that "all things are guaranteed to
him who believes." That's a big difference. He's talking about poten-
tial, not guaranteed actuality. Though Scripture talks about the impor-
tance of belief, belief doesn't guarantee that prayer will always be
answered as we want. In this case, though the immediate context is the
demon-possessed child, Jesus seems to be dealing with the broader
issue of faith and commitment as a whole; what He's not promising is
that if you have enough faith all your prayers will always be answered
as you wish.

    A praying, Christian family lost a small child to a disease,
 even after much prayer and tears were offered in her behalf.
 How can you help them, especially the parents, not to blame
 themselves for the death because of lack of faith?

MISGUIDED FACILITATORS (Matt. 9:37, 38).

   The command is obvious, but the laborers who respond do not
always work with the most effective strategies or with the highest
integrity, tact, or sensitivity.
   Christian history, sadly, shows just how real the problem is. One
twentieth-century Jewish writer, talking about church persecution of
Jews (often in the context of trying to convert them to Christ) said,
"Wouldn't it be something if Jesus did turn out to be the Messiah, but
you Christians have kept us from him!"
   The Bible itself also has various examples of personal witnessing
that have not been very effective.

   What group was discriminated against in Mark 10:13?


   Note Jesus' reaction: "'Let the children come to me, do not hinder them;
for to such belongs the kingdom of God.' .. . And he took them in his arms
and blessed them, laying his hands upon them" (Mark 10:14, 16, RSV).

   What impassioned request did the Canaanite woman ask of
Jesus in Matthew 15:22?


   Note the disciples' reaction: "And his disciples came and begged
him, saying,' Send her away, for she is crying after us.' " In spite of the
disciples' request, "Jesus answered her, '0 woman, great is your faith!
Be it done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed
instantly" (vss. 23b, 28, RSV).

  Driven desperate by his hopeless condition, the blind beggar
Bartimaeus squatted by the road. When he sensed that Jesus was
near, what did he cry out? (see Mark 10:47).


   Again, those who should have been helping, hindered instead. He who
most needed Jesus was told to shut up: "And many rebuked him, telling
him to be silent; but he cried out all the more, 'Son of David, have mercy
on me!' And Jesus stopped and said, 'Call him' " (vss. 48, 49b, RSV).
Once again, Jesus overrides those who were supposed to be helping Him.

   As Seventh-day Adventist Christians, called to be personal
 witnesses for Christ, do we sometimes, unwittingly, get in the
 way of Christ, as did some of those in today's lesson?


                                                                        69

FURTHER STUDY: The War Against Powerful Personal Witness-
ing. Study the following passages to glean reasons why the powers of
darkness do all they can to thwart effective personal witnessing.

   Reason one: Anyone brought to Jesus was healed both physically
and spiritually; consequently, Satan did whatever necessary to keep
people away: "And he [Jesus] answered them, 'Go and tell John what
you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor
have good news preached to them"' (Luke 7:22, RSV).

   Reason two: Those brought to Jesus not only were healed, but they
learned about Jesus and consequently about God: " 'I bear witness to
myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me' " (John 8:18,
RSV).

   Reason three: Review the story of the cleansed leper as told in
Mark 1:40-45. As this incident illustrates, it is impossible to be quiet
about what Jesus has done for us. Even though Jesus had instructed
the healed man to tell no one, "he went out and began to talk freely
about it, and to spread the news" (vs. 45b, RSV).

   In Thursday's lesson we studied misguided witnesses who pre-
vented people from accessing Jesus. There is, however, an even more
evil category—those who brought people to Jesus for malicious mo-
tives.

   Example one: Review the story of Judas' betrayal in Mark 14:43-
46. "Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, 'The one I shall
kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away safely' " (vs. 44, RSV).

   Example two: Reread the story of the woman taken in adultery as
told in John 8:1-11: "Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such
should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him
[Jesus], that they might have to accuse him" (vss. 5, 6a). These
religious leaders brought someone to Jesus alright, but for what hei-
nous intent.

SUMMARY: Christians have been given the greatest privilege ever
given to mortals: that of cooperating with Christ in bringing souls to
salvation. How crucial it is that they take this job seriously. Even more
importantly, how crucial that they not stand in the way.

                    I'm Going Back! Part 2
                          Charlotte Ishkanian

   Tania Batista, a nurse, cowered with the pastor and his wife in their
home following a nighttime attack by a mob. The pastor had been
severely beaten and needed a doctor.
   The elderly pastor who lived in the area sent a church member by
motorcycle 120 miles to the nearest city. Another church member rode
his bicycle 60 miles to another outpost.
   As the sun set that Friday evening, several church members arrived
to protect the three missionaries that night. Sabbath morning found
hundreds of believers sitting outside the house. They had heard that
their new pastor could not attend church, so they had come to pray and
sing and study with him.
   A few days later the three workers were evacuated. It was six
months before Tania and a doctor could return to the mission to train
health care workers and midwives and to treat up to 200 patients a day.
   Then guerrilla soldiers attacked a neighboring village. Tania and the
doctor were warned to leave immediately. Church members hid them
in their village for protection, while other believers guarded the mis-
sion hospital. The next day survivors of the attack came for help. Some
needed immediate hospital care. As Tania and the doctor prepared to
evacuate them, Tania knew that they would not be able to return.
   Tania's heart was torn. She longed to return and complete the
midwife training program, but it was months before the area was safe
enough to return. This time she returned alone and for six weeks only.
She still had no electricity, and often she awoke at night hearing noises.
But from sunrise to sunset she worked for the people.
    The UN troops did not allow her to leave the mission grounds, so
she prayed that God would bring the midwives to her. And they came.
As she taught them and cared for the sick, she thought of the good she
could do if she could remain. But when her six weeks ended, she had to
leave. As her car drove out of the mission, the midwives she had
trained walked along beside it, bidding her a tearful farewell.
                                 Tania is determined to return to Africa
                              as a missionary nurse. It is what she has
                              always wanted to do.

                                Tania Batista (left) is preparing to return
                            to the mission field. Charlotte Ishkanian is

              Powerful Pray-ers




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Kings 20:1-21; Exod. 32:3-
35; Dan. 9:1-19; Psalm 51; Acts 12:1-17.

     MEMORY TEXT: "You also must help us by prayer, so that
     many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us
     in answer to many prayers" (2 Corinthians 1:11, RSV).

    KEY THOUGHT: However difficult it is for sinful humans to
understand all the principles of prayer, we are nevertheless admonished
in Scripture to pray and pray—and pray. Passionately and frequently,
faithful men and women did indeed pray—for healing, for intercession,
for liberation, for forgiveness, for prison release. And the Lord, in His
wisdom and timing, answered according to His will, as He does today.

SUCCESS TIP! A group of success-oriented professionals invited a
well-known Adventist minister to speak on strategies for living the
Christian life. "Don't give us any of that read-the-Bible-and-pray
stuff," a participant said. "Give us some practical suggestions in-
stead." The preacher replied, "Sorry. Those are the only tips I have.
There are no other successful ones."
   How crucial for us to realize that earnest, persevering prayer is our
source of power for the Christian life. Without that, we have nothing.
Supplication to God—offered by a soul understanding his or her own
helplessness and need for entire dependence upon Him—can alone
bring to men and women the power of the Holy Spirit, their only
adequate source of strength in the daily battle against self, sin, and the
principalities and powers in high places. To fight against these things
alone, without prayer leading us to the power of God, is like trying to
shoot down a missile with a slingshot.

AND HEZEKIAH PRAYED—"EXTEND MY LIFE!" (2 Kings
20:1-21).

   "And it came about before Isaiah had gone out of the middle
court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 'Return and
say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, "Thus says the Lord, the
God of your father David, 'I have heard your prayer, I have seen
your tears; behold, I will heal you' " ' " (2 Kings 20:4, 5a, NASB).

   Hezekiah came to the throne determined to do all in his power to
save Judah from the terrible fate overtaking the northern kingdom
because of its apostasy. He quickly instituted needed reforms in the
southern kingdom, beginning with a restoration of the long-neglected
temple services. However, as so often happens for reasons we so often
don't understand, illness struck. "In those days Hezekiah became sick
and was at the point of death" (2 Kings 20: I a, RSV). In fact, he was
given a message from the Lord that he would die.

   Though told by God Himself that "you shall die" (2 Kings
20:1), Hezekiah prayed anyway that he would be healed. Was it
presumptuous on his part to ask God to change His mind about
something He had already declared? What does this incident tell
us about the power of prayer?


 Second Kings 20 tells not only of Hezekiah's miraculous recovery
 but of the incident with the Babylonian ambassadors. These men,
 bearing a gift to Hezekiah, came on a diplomatic visit At one point,
 full of "pride and vanity" (Prophets and Kings, p. 344), Hezekiah
 showed them "all the house of his treasures. . . . There was nothing
 in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show
 them" (vs. 13, NKJV). This act—which Scripture says happened
 because "his heart was lifted up" (2 Chron. 32:25)—resulted in
 God's warning of a future calamity that would fall upon the nation.
 How ironic that Hezekiah, given this miraculous reprieve by God,
 would use his extra time to make such a calamitous blunder.


   God answered Hezekiah's prayer in a miraculous way. Yet
 how soon Hezekiah forgot just how dependent upon God He
 was. Though most of us might not have had such a miraculous
 experience as Hezekiah, we are all just as dependent upon God,
 even if we are just as prone to forget. What practical things can
 we do to help us never to lose sight of this dependence, thus
 avoiding, in our own ways, Hezekiah's mistake?

                                                                    73

AND MOSES PRAYED—"SAVE MY PEOPLE!" (Exod. 32:7-
35).

  " 'But now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—and if not, blot me, I
pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written" (Exod. 32:32,
RSV).

   The original Hebrew in this verse yields a wonderful truth regard-
ing salvation. The word translated "forgive" comes from a common
Hebrew word in the Bible (nasa) that means "to bear" or "to carry."
In fact, Isaiah, talking specifically about Christ's death on the cross,
twice uses a form of that same word: "Surely he has borne (from
nasa) our griefs . . . and he bare (from nasa) the sin of many" (Isa.
53:4, 12).
   Thus, in this famous prayer of Moses, the prophet is saying to the
Lord, "But now, if thou wilt bear (from nasa) their sin. . . ."
Moses—understanding the plan of salvation, understanding the prin-
ciple of the cross of Christ—asked God Himself to bear the sins of
His people. Yes! Talk about clear depiction of the gospel! Here,
many centuries before the Cross, even before the earthly sanctuary
was built, we are given a powerful depiction of the principle of
substitution, in which God Himself pays the penalty for the sins of
His created beings. This is the foundation of the great hope all
Christians have.

   When, and how, was Moses' prayer answered? When, and how,
did God bear their sin? What Bible verses can you find to back up
your response?


   Many biblical commentators have viewed Moses in this particular
role as a type of intercessor, similar to Christ in His role as Interces-
sor. (See Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25.) When Moses came down from the
mountain, after interceding for Israel, his face was glowing: "That
divine illumination symbolized the glory of the dispensation of which
Moses was the visible mediator, a representative of the one true
Intercessor."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 330.

    Think about what it means that God Himself, in the person of
 Jesus Christ, bore the penalty of our sins! What does that act
 show us about the futility of trying to save ourselves?
    If it were possible for us to save ourselves, would Christ have
 died in our stead? Why should this great truth of God, bearing
 our sins, be so humbling to us? Why should it cause us to change
 our lives and bring us into obedience?

AND DANIEL PRAYED—"RETURN THY PEOPLE!" (Dan. 9:1-
19).

   " 'And now, 0 Lord our God, who didst bring thy people out of
the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee a name,
as at this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly. 0 Lord,
according to all thy righteous acts, let thy anger and thy wrath
turn away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy hill; because for our
sins . . . Jerusalem and thy people have become a byword among
all who are round about us" (Dan. 9:15, 16, RSV).

   Health promoter, dream interpreter, lion tamer, astute statesman,
brilliant writer, handwriting-code breaker—Daniel, first and foremost,
was a man of prayer.
   One of the most powerful and illuminating prayers in all Scripture is
recorded in Daniel 9, when Daniel was interceding in behalf of his nation,
which had been taken into captivity and whose holy temple was destroyed.

   What first prompted Daniel to pray this prayer? See Dan 9:1, 2.


   Besides being a man of prayer, Daniel was also a man of the Word
of God. It was from his reading of Scripture that Daniel knew what to
pray for, in this case the restoration of His people and the nation. Here
is one simple example of the need for both prayer and the study of the
Word. Each enhances the practice of the other.
   Notice, too, the essence of Daniel's prayer. Though Daniel himself is
never recorded as having any moral lapses (unlike many other Bible
characters), his prayer is constantly in the first person plural. In other
words, all through the prayer he identifies himself with the sins of his
nation, even though he was a great man of God and a prophet. "We have
sinned. . . . We have not heeded your prophets. . . . We have rebelled. . . .
We have not made our prayer before the Lord our God. . . . We have
sinned against Him."
    Why did he pray this way? Perhaps Daniel simply so identified him-
self with his nation that he automatically linked their fate with his. Or
more likely, Daniel understood the principle that all have sinned and
come short of the glory of God. He understood that all humans are guilty
before God. This second option makes even more sense, considering that
the 70-week prophecy concerning Jesus—who came as a cure for all
humanity's guilt—immediately followed his prayer of repentance.

    It's so easy to look at the faults of the church and point
 fingers of blame at this leader or that pastor or whomever. What
 does Daniel's prayer teach us about our own guilt as well?

                                                                          75

AND DAVID PRAYED—"FORGIVE MY GREAT SIN!" (Ps. 51).

   "Have mercy on me, 0 God, according to thy steadfast love;
according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my
sin"! (Ps. 51:1, 2, RSV).

   Psalm 51, known as a penitential psalm, was composed by David
after his great sin with Bathsheba, in which (among other things) he
committed adultery and murder. It was written in anguish and self-
abhorrence, brought upon Him by the power of the Holy Spirit upon a
soul open to God's leading.

"It is a prayer for forgiveness and for sanctification through the
Holy Spirit. Accompanying the petition are vows of gratitude for
God's mercy and promises for the future. Perhaps no other OT
passage draws so clear a picture of the truly repentant sinner
trusting in God's power to forgive and restore, as this portrait of
David's experience of transgression. "—The SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 3, p. 755.

  What verses in the psalm show David's repentance? How is
repentance related to forgiveness?


    Though repentance contains no merit in and of itself, it's about all
we can bring to God—for it's our acknowledgment that we, really,
have nothing to bring to Him. In other words, there are no works we
can do to save ourselves; all we can do is acknowledge our sins and
seek forgiveness for them. That's repentance. Without it, God can do
nothing to save us, not because the penalty for our sins hasn't
already been paid but because repentance shows that we have real-
ized our utter helplessness and need for God to save us. Repentance
is, in many ways, sinners admitting their great need of God doing for
them what they can never, in any way, do for themselves. True
repentance expresses a person's understanding of salvation by faith
alone.

    The first sin was not adultery, lust, or greed but self-exalta-
 tion and pride. It remains, today, one of the most dangerous
 sins, because, unlike many other sins, it is socially acceptable
 (people are disciplined in the church for adultery—not pride!).
 In the context of today's lesson, why are pride and self-exalta-
 tion so dangerous? How likely is a proud person, full of self-
 righteousness, to have true repentance?

AND THE CHURCH PRAYED—"GET PETER OUT OF
PRISON!" (Acts 12:1-17).

  "So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was
made to God by the church" (Acts 12:5, RSV).

   According to Scripture, Peter's supernatural deliverance from prison
was a direct result of the church's prayers. And if anyone did need
prayer at that time, it was Peter.
   First, the same Herod who locked up Peter had just killed
James "with the sword" (Acts 12:2), so Peter's future didn't
look too bright. Second, besides being locked in a dungeon,
Peter was "bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the
guards before the door were keeping the prison" (vs. 6, NKJV),
so the chance of escape looked bleak. Third, Herod was holding
him until the Passover ended, when he intended to "bring him
before the people" (vs. 4), and that time was fast approaching
(vs. 6).

   Despite the gloomy situation, Acts depicts Peter in prison do-
ing something quite interesting. What was it—what does it reveal
about Peter's faith?


   Peter, trusting in the Lord for deliverance—didn't expect it quite
like this. Only after the angel brought him out of prison and he was in
the street did he finally "come to himself," realizing that what hap-
pened wasn't a vision (vss. 9-11).
   How interesting, too, that he seemed so astonished by this miracle.
After all, here is a man who spent three and a half years with Jesus as
one of His closest disciples. Peter had seen the dead raised, the blind
given sight, the sick miraculously healed, the demon-possessed lib-
erated, and so forth—miracles that, in many ways, were more in-
credible than what he had just experienced. And yet he was still
astonished!

    Peter, of course, wasn't the only one astonished. Imagine
 the poor guards who, at some point, found their captive freed.
 As a result, these men were commanded to be put to death
 (vs. 19)—all as a result of God answering the prayers of His
 people.


   How does one understand his or her unfortunate fate from a
 Christian perspective?

FURTHER STUDY: And Jesus Prayed—"God Save the World!"
Read this book: Roger J. Morneau, Incredible Answers to Prayer
(Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Pub. Assoc., 1990).
   Jesus' most famous prayer is recorded in Matthew 6:9-13, KJV:
"After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our
debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever. Amen."


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Notice how simple this prayer is. What points stand out
     that help us understand the above principles of prayer—
     points that could help us in our own prayer life?

     2. Prayer is in many ways one of the great mysteries of the
        Christian faith. We are told to pray; those who pray
        know that it works, and prayer has indeed brought about
        many wonderful results. Yet, what are some of the things
        about prayer that we don't understand? Discuss some of
        these questions, with the realization that—along with many
        secular things—we can engage in activities that we know
        are effective even if we don't always fully understand
        how.

     3. What can we learn about prayer from this quote: "Christ
        was continually receiving from the Father that He might
        communicate to us. 'The word which ye hear,' He said, 'is
        not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me.' John 14:24.
        `The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister.' Matt. 20:28. Not for Himself, but for others, He
        lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God
        He came forth morning by morning, to bring the light of
        heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the
        Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord
        awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His
        lips were anointed with grace, that He might impart to
        others."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 139.

SUMMARY: Whatever the mysteries of prayer, the Word of God is
clear: Prayer works, and we should be doing more of it—both as a
church and as individuals.

               The Thief That Could Not Run
                             David L. Lin

   Many Chinese Christians have little access to Christian books or
even the Bible, but God honors their faith as they put into practice the
teachings of Christ.
   The peasant woman always locked her door when she left home.
But one Sabbath she returned from worship and found her door wide
open. She saw a man standing beside her rice bin with an empty cloth
bag in his hand. She realized he must be a thief trying to steal her rice.
   She could have called out to the neighbors for help, but when the
thief did not move, she felt impressed to pray for him instead. She
remembered that the Bible taught that Christians must love their
enemies and pray for those who mistreat them. She knelt in the
doorway of her home and prayed. "Lord," she said, "this man must be
hungry, for he has come to get some of my rice. Please forgive him for
breaking into my house and help him to find work so that he will not
have to steal."
   She rose from her knees and walked to where the man was stand-
ing. She spoke kindly to him, telling the would-be thief about Jesus,
who would forgive his sins if he confessed them. Then she invited him
to worship with her at church the following Sabbath. The man was so
touched by her sermon and prayer that he agreed to go with her to
worship God the following Sabbath. Then he told her why he did not
run when she came to the door.
   The would-be thief had filled his bag with rice from her rice bin and
 hoisted the bag onto his shoulder. He turned to leave, but his feet
would not move. He thought that the rice bag was too heavy, so he
poured some rice back into the bin. Again he tried to leave, but he
could not move his feet. He poured more rice back, and still he could
                                not take a step. Finally he poured all of
                                the rice back into the bin, but his feet
                                remained glued to the spot. He was still
                                standing beside the rice bin when the
                                woman came home from church and
                                found him.
                                   This woman who practiced the truth
                                that she had learned from the Bible
                                won him to Christ.

             Martyrs and Their
                Murderers




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Chron. 24:17-22; Jer. 26:20-
23; Matt. 14:1-11; Acts 7:54-8:2; John 21:18, 19.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for
     righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matt.
     5:10, RSV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The Greek word for "martyr" comes from the
same word also translated "witness." Preferring death to dishonoring
God makes a Christian martyr the ultimate witness, for he or she has
made the ultimate sacrifice.

WHY STUDY MARTYRS? Skip the wax museum at Niagara Falls
devoted to torture. Bypass the exhibit in Rothenburg, Germany, fea-
turing medieval torture. Don't bother to read Foxe's Book of Martyrs.
Who needs such graphic reminders of our race's penchant for evil?
   "History," said James Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, "is a nightmare
from which I am trying to awake." Sadly, the inhumanity of human
history is not a dream but a reality.
     What advantage, then, can it be for us to study biblical martyrs?
After all, Paul admonishes, "If I give away all I have, and if I deliver
my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3,
RSV). Why not study love instead?
    Because the scriptural references are there, that's why. The record
stretches from Genesis to Revelation, from the death of the righteous Abel
(Gen. 4:8) to the harlot woman "drunk with the blood of the saints and the
blood of the martyrs of Jesus" (Rev. 17:6b, RSV). If it's in Scripture,
there's reason for it. This week we'll see if we can find out why.

ZECHARIAH—STONED TO DEATH (2 Chron. 24:17-22).

   "But they conspired against him, and by command of the king
they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord"
(2 Chron. 24:21, RSV).

   The background to the story of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada (not
Zechariah the minor prophet) is tragically simple. King Joash, seven-
years old when he came to the throne, was influenced for good by the
priest Jehoiada. However, after Jehoiada died, the king was turned in
the wrong direction by the princes of Judah. "Now after the death of
Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and did obeisance to the king; then
the king hearkened to them. And they [the princes] forsook the house
of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the
idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt"
(vss. 17, 18, RSV).

    These wicked princes came and "did obeisance" to the king, as
if they were to learn and be subject to him. Yet who ultimately
ended up listening to whom? What's the lesson there?


   As always, the Lord did not sit by while His people destroyed
themselves. "He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the Lord;
and they testified against them, but they would not listen" (vs. 19,
NRSV). Eventually Zechariah, "the son of Jehoiada the priest" (vs. 20),
was sent with a message that called them back to the commands that the
Lord had given them. In verse 20, Zechariah says that their disobedi-
ence was making it impossible for the Lord to prosper them. "Why do
you transgress the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot
prosper?" (RSV).
   In other words, at the heart of the prophet's message is the same
message given time and again by God to His people, which is to obey
and thus live and prosper in Me. Yet, time and again, God's people,
showing lack of faith, don't listen, thinking they can do it better on
their own. How tragic the consequences have been and, in fact, will
always be when God's professed people take that course.

    Perhaps the most frightening aspect of this story is that it was
 a people truly called out by God who, refusing to listen to the
 prophet, ordered his death. What lessons can we, also as a
 church called out by God, learn from this story?

    What are the ways in which we today can, in a sense, "stone
 the prophet"?

                                                                    81

URIAH—KILLED WITH A SWORD (Jer. 26).

   "There was another man who prophesied in the name of the
Lord, Uriah. . . . And when King Jehoiakim . . . heard his words,
the king sought to put him to death. . . . Then . . . certain men . . .
fetched Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim,
who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the
burial place of the common people" (Jer. 26:20-23b, RSV).

   Though little is said about Uriah (not Bathsheba's husband), his
death needs to be studied in the context of Jeremiah's ministry. Before
Uriah is even mentioned, the chapter deals with Jeremiah's message to
Judah about repentance and obedience. However, the message didn't
ring well with the priests and the prophets, who said "to the princes
and to all the people, 'This man deserves the sentence of death,
because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with
your own ears'" (vs. 11, RSV).

   What significance is there that it was the "priests and the
prophets" who were speaking against Jeremiah? What other ex-
amples in Scripture show those who are supposed to be servants of
the Lord working against Him?


   Jeremiah then launches into an impassioned argument for his case.
   Point one: The Lord is the One who sent me (vs. 12).
   Point two: If you mend your ways, the Lord " 'will repent of the
evil which he has pronounced against you' " (vs. 13, RSV).
   Point three: " 'But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with
me as seems good and right to you' " (vs. 14, RSV).
   Point four: But one thing is certain: If you kill me, " 'you will
bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its
inhabitants.' " It was God who sent me (vs. 15, RSV).
   Evidently, Jeremiah's persuasion prevailed, because the vote was not
to put him to death; however, these men still hadn't changed their evil
ways. Indeed, Uriah "prophesied against this city and against this land
in words like those of Jeremiah" (vs. 21, RSV), for which he was killed.

   Jeremiah was spared, Uriah wasn't; yet Scripture gives no
explanation, or excuses, justifying this outcome. How often do
things happen in our lives in which we get no explanation or
justification?

   How can this story help us learn to trust God even when given
 no explanation or justification for tragedy?

JOHN THE BAPTIST—BEHEADED (Matt. 14:1-11).

  "At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of
Jesus; and he said to his servants, 'This is John the Baptist, he has
been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in
him.' For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in
prison, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because
John said to him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her' " (Matt.
14:1-4, RSV).

   Consider the situation of John the Baptist. Here was a man speak-
ing for God, a man clearly moved by the Holy Spirit. Even before
John's birth, the Lord had marked him for a special ministry. "For he
shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor
strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his
mother's womb" (Luke 1:15). Look at what Jesus said about him: "For
I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a
greater prophet than John the Baptist" (Luke 7:28).
   And, yet, not only was he taken prisoner by a wicked king—he was
then put to death due to the anger and lusts of a depraved woman and
her daughter. Hardly the most noble reason to die. Hardly something
that would instill faith in those who believed that John was serving the
Lord.

 "Jesus did not interpose to deliver His servant. He knew that John
 would bear the test. Gladly would the Saviour have come to John,
 to brighten the dungeon gloom with His own presence. But He was
 not to place Himself in the hands of enemies and imperil His own
 mission. Gladly would He have delivered His faithful servant. But
 for the sake of thousands who in after years must pass from prison
 to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom. As the followers
 of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish by the sword, the
 rack, or the fagot, . . . what a stay to their hearts would be the
 thought that John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness Christ Him-
 self had borne witness, had passed through a similar experience!"
 —The Desire of Ages, p. 224.


    It's easy to look back and judge how people should act. How-
 ever, if you were one of either John's or Christ's disciples, how
 easy it would have been for John's imprisonment and then death
 to bring discouragement and doubt. In what ways do we allow
 similar things that happen to us to cause the same questions, the
 same doubts in our minds? What can we learn from the story of
 John that will help us keep trusting God in all situations?

                                                                       83

STEPHEN, THE FIRST CHRISTIAN MARTYR—STONED TO
DEATH (Acts 7:54-8:2).

  "Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the
witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man
named Saul" (Acts 7:58, RSV).

    As background to his stoning, read Stephen's response to the high
priest's accusation that Stephen had spoken against Moses, God, the
Holy Place, and the law (see Acts 7:1-53).
     Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of deep
piety and faith. Though Jewish, he spoke Greek and was familiar with
the customs and manners of the Greeks. He was very active in the
cause of Christ and so good at what he did that people "were not able
to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake" (Acts 6:10). His
success, in many ways, helped seal his doom. If he were weak, vacil-
lating, ineffective, he probably would have been spared.

   Summarize Stephen's most forceful accusations. See verses 51-
53. Why do you think the leaders were so enraged?


     Could it be because they knew the truth of his words?


   Look at the difference between the death of John the Baptist and
Stephen. John, rotting in a dank, dark, and lonely dungeon, is killed as
a result of a drunken oath; in contrast, Stephen, speaking before a
massive crowd and offering a powerful, public testimony to Christ, is
just before his death "full of the Holy Spirit," who gives him a vision
of "heaven . . . and . . . the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right
hand of God" (Acts 7:55, 56, RSV). Stephen, in one sense, went out
"in a blaze of glory," as compared to John's rather "ignoble" demise.
Ellen White wrote that Stephen's godly demeanor in death greatly
impacted Saul of Tarsus, who eventually became the apostle Paul. Yet
however different the circumstances of their deaths, both John and
Stephen were faithful servants of Christ.

    Elisabeth Elliott's missionary husband was killed by Indians
 in South America. Elisabeth responded by converting to Christ
 the very natives who had martyred her husband. In many ways,
 the deaths of martyrs takes on a significance according to the
 way we react to them. How does our reaction to Christian mar-
 tyrs (or any tragedy) give them a meaning they otherwise might
 not have?

PETER—CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN (John 21:18,19).

  " 'Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girded
yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old, you
will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry
you where you do not wish to go' " (John 21:18, RSV).

  This text is the only reference to the way Peter died, a statement by
Christ foretelling the manner of Peter's death (John 21:19).

   Through His words to Peter, Christ showed that He knew not
only that Peter would die for Him but how. Nevertheless, Jesus
still said to him, "Follow me." What does this tell us about how
much serving Christ can cost?


 "Stretch forth thy hands. An obvious reference to crucifixion (see
 vs. 19). According to tradition, . . . Peter met death by crucifixion
 with his head down, on the plea that to be crucified like his Master
 was too great an honor for the one who had denied his Lord (see
 AA 537, 538). "—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1072.

   Peter was highly chosen and favored among the disciples. Then,
three times, he denied his Lord. He was eventually restored to favor,
even becoming one of the authors of the New Testament. Finally, he
died a martyr's death.
   Despite his eventual victory in Christ, Peter did have spiritual lows.
Even after being restored to favor with Christ, he still blundered. (See
Gal. 2:11-20).
   Yet Peter endured, even to the end, which is not surprising, espe-
cially when you read his epistles. In them, Peter showed he under-
stood the trials that those who served Christ would face and how little
these trials were in contrast to the reward that awaits the faithful at the
Second Coming. "Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a sea-
son, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that
perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 1:6, 7).

    English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson once wrote: "If there is no
 immortality, I will throw myself into the sea." In so many words,
 he expressed the futility of life without the hope of eternity. Though
 we might never face a martyr's death, in what ways does the hope
 of eternity help us endure the trials we face here?


                                                                        85

FURTHER STUDY: Thwarted Murderers and Their Targets.
This week's lesson reviewed the martyrdoms of five of God's messen-
gers. But not all persecutors of God's people claimed success. The
Bible record testifies to many who were spared death, their would-be
murderers thwarted.
   Notice the references in 2 Peter 2:4-8 that Peter uses as support for
his assertion that God can both protect the righteous and punish the
wicked:

         God Can Preserve                   God Can Destroy

           Penitent humans                    Evil angels
                Noah                       The ancient world
                 Lot                      Sodom and Gomorrah

   These examples prove, consequently, that "the Lord knows how to
rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punish-
ment until the day of judgment, and especially those who indulge in
the lust of defiling passion and despise authority" (2 Pet. 2:9, 10,
RSV).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Sometimes God intervenes in marvelous ways, other times
     nature, or even evil itself, seems to be allowed to run its
     course. Considering the stories read this week, why must we
     be very careful about judging someone's spiritual walk by his
     or her fate? In other words, how easy it would be, for in-
     stance, to think that John the Baptist did something evil to
     deserve his fate?

     2. Though this week's lesson dealt with those who were
        martyrs for Christ, it has been said that "It's easier to
        die for God than live for Him." What does that mean?

     3. As mentioned at the beginning of the week, the word martyr
        comes from the same word as witness. Martyrs do, indeed,
        witness for their faith. What about those who die in obscu-
        rity for the Lord? In what ways are they witnesses? To
        whom do they witness, and when?


SUMMARY: Those called to serve Christ might have to do so at
the cost of their lives. Considering the reward, the price is cheap
enough.

                       1 Must Obey, Part 1
                         Charlotte IshIcani an

    Joseph Wilba was a busy advisor to the former prime minister of
Chad. His work was fulfilling, but he felt spiritually empty. He needed a
relationship with God, but church attendance disappointed him.
    One day while driving to an appointment, the need to seek God
became so overwhelming that Wilba ordered his driver to stop the car.
"God has called me, and I must obey!" he said later. He returned home a
different man. His only desire was to find God. He fasted and prayed
that God would show him a church that follows the Bible.
    One day he met a man selling books on the street. He asked the man
what church he represented, and the man named the Adventist church.
Wilba knew nothing about this church, but something about this man
impressed him. Wilba invited him to his home.
    The man invited Wilba's family to visit the Adventist church, but
Wilba hesitated. However, his wife urged him to give the church a try.
    Wilba found the worship service compelling. The people sang with
such enthusiasm, and the sermon was straight from the Bible. But the
fellowship among believers touched him most. The family decided to
return.
    When the pastor visited the family the following week, Wilba asked
him, "Why do you worship on Saturday instead of Sunday?" The pastor
showed Wilba Bible texts regarding the Sabbath. As they studied, God
opened Wilba's eyes. He wondered how so many could be wrong when
the Bible was so clear. In the face of the evidence, Wilba knew he must
obey. He quit working on Saturdays so he could attend church.
    Wilba's boss, the prime minister, asked him why he no longer
attended meetings on Saturdays. Wilba explained that God commands
 His followers to worship Him on the seventh day, the Sabbath, and he
had to obey.
    The prime minister told him that if he wished to worship God on
 Saturday he should quit his job. Then he watched Wilba's reaction.
 Would he obey God's commands if it meant losing his job? But Wilba
 had already made his decision. He told the prime minister, "I must obey
 God, and if that means losing my job, then I am willing to trust God to
 provide another job."
    Silence filled the room. The prime minister, seeing that Wilba was
 serious, gave him permission to worship God on Saturday and keep his
 job. Three months later Wilba, his wife, and daughter were baptized.
                                                   (continued next week)
   Joseph Wilba was advisor to the former prime minister of Chad and a
local elder in the Adventist church in N'Djamena, Chad.

                 Giants of Faith




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Hebrews 11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped
     for, the conviction of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Though hardly perfect and needing correction,
rebuke, and—most importantly—grace, the men and women recorded
in Hebrews 11 all share one common trait: They learned to live
beyond the narrow spectrum of what is seen, and they grasped instead,
by faith, the promise of the unseen.

PERFECT FAITH—SEEING THE UNSEEN. In his harshly anti-
religious play, Waiting for Godot, French playwright Samuel Beckett
depicted two hobos living on a road, waiting day after day for this
mysterious Mr. Godot, who keeps promising to come but never does.
This play was Beckett's metaphorical mocking of the Christian faith,
the belief in something promised that never appears, at least not yet.
   Beckett's problem, however, isn't the problem for the cast of char-
acters listed in Hebrews 11, these giants of faith who have learned to
see beyond the limited world of sight alone. From Abel to Abraham,
Samson to Samuel, Isaac to the Israelites, Jacob and Joseph, and
more—all these people grasped by faith the promises of God, prom-
ises of something not yet seen but guaranteed by the blood of Christ, a
promise of something so much better than this world could ever offer.
   "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth" (vs. 13).

ABEL—SACRIFICE OF FAITH (Heb. 11:4).

   "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous,
God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh"
(Heb. 11:4).

   It's rather interesting that Abel would be listed among those
who exercised faith. Inspiration is clear that God interacted with
him in a close, personal way. Genesis 4:4 says that "Abel also
brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord
respected Abel and his offering" (NKJV). Ellen White wrote that
after Abel brought his offering, "fire flashed from heaven and
consumed the sacrifice."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 71. How
many of us would struggle for faith if, after each time we sacrificed
an animal, fire flashed down from heaven and consumed it? Never-
theless, Abel is listed, first even, among those who are considered
exemplars of faith.

   If faith is believing in what we don't see, what was Abel show-
ing faith over by offering sacrifices?


   Abel's faith wasn't so much regarding the existence of God (which
must have been pretty clear to him) but regarding salvation in Christ.
His sacrifices symbolized his trust in, and understanding of, the great
plan of redemption, in which God Himself would pay the penalty for
our transgression of His holy law and thus free us from the condemna-
tion that our transgression has brought. "There is therefore now no
condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk
according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit" (Rom. 8:1, NKJV).
   By his "more excellent sacrifice," Abel showed his total depen-
dence upon the merits of the promised Savior, who had not yet come.
In fact, it takes more faith to trust, not in our own good works or in
anything we do, but in the works of someone else, in this case Jesus
Christ.
   How interesting, too, that by this "work" of offering a sacri-
fice—which itself symbolizes just how futile our works are for
salvation—Abel "obtained witness that he was righteous."

    Where did Abel's righteousness come from? Was it from
 offering the sacrifice? Or did it come from the righteousness of
 the One symbolized by that sacrifice?
    Explain your answer in the context of what Christ has done at
 the cross.

                                                                    89

ENOCH—THE MAN WHO WALKED WITH GOD (Heb. 11:5, 6).

    "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
and was not found, because God had translated him: for before
his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God" (Heb.
11:5).

   Genesis 5:24 says that "Enoch walked with God: and he was not;
for God took him." The verb "walked" here appears in a relatively
uncommon Hebrew verb form that gives the idea of continuity; it's the
same form used in Job 1:7, when Satan, asked by God what he was
doing, said that he was "walking up and down" upon the earth. Thus
the idea in Genesis, and expanded in Hebrews, is that Enoch's life was
one of continual faith and obedience to the Lord.

   Hebrews 11:6 says: "And without faith it is impossible to please
him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he
exists and that he rewards those who seek him" (RSV). What do
you think this verse means?


    Without faith it is impossible to please God because without faith
it's impossible to know God, and knowing God is crucial for a religion
whose most important command is to, indeed, "love God" (after all,
how can you love what you don't know?).
    Through the years, philosophers and theologians have devised
many sophisticated arguments for the existence of God (with such
fancy names as the cosmological, the teleological, and the ontologi-
cal arguments). Yet however far these arguments go, they never go
far enough. God is so far beyond our fallen minds that there is
always the need for faith, which is belief in something we don't
totally see or understand. If we could totally see it or understand it,
then there would be no room for faith. We don't need faith to believe
that the sky is over our heads. We can look up and see it. Faith is
needed, instead, to believe in the God who lives beyond that sky,
because we can't see Him.

   Alfonso has a college professor, an avowed atheist, who never
misses a chance to tell Alfonso that Christian faith is blind.
What kind of answers can Alfonso give to show that Christians
have many good reasons for their faith? Also, can you give
examples of how we exercise faith—that is, belief in things we
don't see or totally understand—in the everyday secular realm
of our lives?

SACRIFICE OF THE "ONLY BEGOTTEN SON" (Heb. 11:17-19).

  "By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and
he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
son" (Heb. 11:17).

   Unquestionably, the most moving, powerful, and illuminating rep-
resentation of the gospel appeared in the incredible story of Abraham
and Isaac on Mount Moriah (Genesis 22), where Abraham was called
to offer "his only begotten son" as a sacrifice for sin. What parent,
even under normal circumstances, could have shown the faith that
Abraham did, under circumstances so far from normal? What a pain-
ful, even frightful, lesson about just how costly our redemption was!

  Hebrews 11:17 says that Abraham was called to offer "his only
begotten son." What other well-known verse talks about an "only
begotten son" offered for the world?


   The big difference, of course, between John 3:16 and the story of
Isaac and Abraham on Moriah is that Isaac was spared; Jesus wasn't.
If we were to be saved, Christ had to die. There was no way around it.
"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of man be lifted up" (John 3:14; emphasis supplied). However
painful the process for both Isaac and his father—how much worse it
must have been for Jesus and His Father at the Cross.

  Even before the angel stopped Abraham from slaying his son,
which promise (Heb. 11:19) gave him hope that even if Isaac died,
Abraham would see him again?


   Abraham's hope ultimately must be the final hope of all of us: the
resurrection of the dead at the second coming of Christ and the
inauguration of a whole new existence. This is the great promise, the
promise all these people depicted in Hebrews 11 died in faith hoping
for, even if they didn't yet see it (Heb. 11:13). Anything short of that
promise leaves us, really, with nothing at all to hope for but this life
with its pains, sufferings, and disappointments.

   Someone once said that without the promise of the Second
 Coming, Christ's death at the first coming was a waste of time.
 Do you agree or disagree with that concept? Explain your an-
 swer.


                                                                     91

RAHAB, THE UNLIKELY ACCOMPLICE (Heb. 11:31).

   "By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that be-
lieved not, when she had received the spies with peace" (Heb.
11:31).

    A heathen harlot who lied and who committed what only could be
called "treason" is listed in this roster of faith along with such Bible
stars as Sarah (the only other woman mentioned in Hebrews 11),
Enoch, and Abel. How could that be? The answer is simple: it's called
the grace of God.
   Joshua 2 gives answers that greatly help unravel this mystery.
Rahab, whatever her seamy background, was moved by the power-
ful witness of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and defeating
enemy kings. In other words, she realized that only the living God,
the true God, could have given such a miraculous deliverance. She
said to the spies: "For we have heard how the Lord dried up the
water of the Red Sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what
ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other
side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed" (Josh.
2:10).

    The key, however, to understanding Rahab is found in verse 11
of Joshua 2. What does she say there that shows her faith?


   Rahab confessed with her mouth the reality of the true God, a faith
that was manifested by her works, in this case risking her life to help
the spies. Like the rest of the characters mentioned in Hebrews, her
faith had been manifested in works. "Yea, a man may say, Thou bast
faith, and I have works; shew me thy faith without thy works, and I
will shew thee my faith by my works" (James 2:18).
   The writer of Hebrews, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
believed that her faith was genuine; she was not just switching sides
in the middle of the game in order to be with the sure winners.
Rahab, obviously, manifested true faith, which is why she—a prosti-
tute—was placed where she was. God's grace extends even to pagan
harlots.

   Of course, the problem with using Rahab as an example of
faith is her lie about the spies. Does this incident justify lying?
Remember, here was a newly converted woman probably not
well-versed in the theology of ancient Israel, which is why using
her to justify lying isn't expedient. Was she being heralded in
Hebrews for her lie—or for her faith?

WE CAN'T FORGET THESE EITHER (Heb. 11:32).

  "And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the
prophets" (Heb. 11:32, RSV).

   "What shall I more say? The list might be extended indefinitely,
but enough illustrations have been provided to prove the principle that
faith and faithfulness are the essence of godly living."—The SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 477.
   In the first part of the chapter, the author of Hebrews defends each
person's choice, relating specific accomplishments they all made be-
cause of faith. Later he just records names with no supporting details
as to why he included them.

   Look up the scriptures most likely associated with these names
and list reasons why Paul probably included them in Hebrews 11.
(The texts are suggested by the editors of The SDA Bible Commen-
tary, pp. 477, 478.)

• Gideon (Judges 6 and 7)

• Barak (Judges 4 and 5)

• Samson (Judges 13 to 16)

• Jephthah (Judges 11)

• David (1 and 2 Samuel)

• Samuel (1 Samuel 2 to 25)

• The Prophets (Acts 7:52)

   "The writer's purpose was not to prepare a catalogue of all of
God's faithful . . . but only to illustrate his point that faith and
faithfulness are essential to patient waiting for the coming of the
Lord. . . ."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 477.

    Look at all the names listed in Hebrews and notice that all
 these men and women had faults, some rather bad ones. If these
 giants of faith were flawed, what kind of hope should that give to
 us, we who love God, have faith, and yet struggle with character
 defects, as well?

                                                                    93

FURTHER STUDY: Who Might These Have Been? (Read the
general categories in Hebrews 11:33-39).

   "Who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, re-
ceived promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched raging
fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness,
became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight . . . were
tortured ... suffered mocking and scourging ... were stoned ...
sawn in two . . . killed with the sword . . . destitute, afflicted, ill-
treated" (Heb. 11:33-37, RSV).

   First, the author gives names and reasons; then he just lists the
names. Finally, the last verses of Hebrews 11 explain the trials en-
dured but offer no specific characters who endured them.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Who are some of the other giants of faith who are not
     mentioned? What about Daniel or Ezra or Jeremiah? Draw
     up your own list, only this time name characters from New
     Testament times.

     2. Though Hebrews 11 is known as the great "faith" chapter,
        notice how closely works are tied in with faith. Noah (vs. 7)
        obeyed and built the ark, Abraham (vs. 8) obeyed and left
        his home, Moses obeyed and kept the passover (vs. 28), and
        so forth. In other words, though their faith is heralded in
        this chapter, it was their works that proved their faith.
        What lessons about the importance of works can be drawn
        from these examples? On the other hand, what lessons about
        the importance of works should not be drawn from it?

     3. Read Hebrews 11:40 and discuss what the author is saying
        there. What was this "something better" that we all are
        waiting for and all will receive together?

SUMMARY: Despite their faults, these giants of faith learned a
crucial lesson about living beyond the moment, living beyond the
mere temporary and, ultimately, unsatisfying things of this world
and, instead, reaching out on the promise of God, who through
Christ offers us "a better country, that is, an heavenly" (Heb.
11:16).

                      I Must Obey, Part 2
                         Charlotte Ishkanian

    Once Joseph Wilba had found the church he had prayed for, he did
not want to be anywhere else. He praised God for leading him to His
kingdom, and did not hesitate to share his faith with others. He invited
the prime minister and several other government ministers to the
church for special meetings, and several of them came.
    He served his church with the same fervor. On Sabbath evening
following a Week of Prayer, Wilba seemed unusually happy. His
response, as usual, was "Jesus is coming soon! We all must be ready!"
    On Sunday morning he surprised his wife when he came to break-
fast dressed in his Sabbath clothes. Questioned about his attire, he told
her, "I must obey my Father. I am going visiting. I must warn my
brothers, my friends, my relatives that there is no time to waste. Christ
is coming soon!" That day he visited many people he had worked with,
including the former prime minister, delivering his message of Jesus'
soon coming.
    He arrived at church in time to take part in the Sunday evening
youth program. After the program he boarded his motorcycle to go
home. A young boy begged Wilba to take him along, but the older man
responded gently, "You must wait for your own time." The boy waved
as his friend rode off down the dirt road toward home. He assumed the
man had meant, "Wait until you are old enough to own your own
motorcycle." But the remark did not sound like Wilba.
    As he neared his home, two men riding bicycles crossed his path.
He pressed hard on the hand brake to avoid hitting the bicyclists. The
motorcycle's wheels locked, and he was thrown off. He died instantly.
    The unexpected death of such a well-known man shocked the
capital city of Chad. Hundreds who attended his funeral heard the same
                                 testimony that Wilba had believed and
                                 practiced, that Jesus is indeed coming
                                 soon. For him it will be as if in an
                                 instant.

                                    Joseph Wilba (left) served as advisor
                                to the former prime minister of Chad
                                and was an active lay member of the
                                Adventist church in N'Djamena, Chad.

           Women in Scripture




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Read the texts for Deborah,
Esther, Ruth, Mary (Jesus' mother), and Mary Magdalene as given
for each day's study.

     MEMORY TEXT: "So God created man in his own image, in
     the image of God he created him; male and female he created
     them" (Genesis 1:27, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Although not as frequently mentioned as men,
women in the Bible nevertheless have played crucial roles in the
drama of God's church.

A VARIED ROSTER. "Evil or exemplary, elderly or young, well-known
or obscure, a little under 200 women are named in Scripture. Several
hundred others are referenced in categories: daughters (Methuselah's daughters;
Philip's daughters); wives (Noah's wife; Solomon's wives); mothers (Micah's
mother; Elisha's mother); widows (widow whose oil was multiplied; widow
of Nain . . . ); and other unnamed women (the nurse who let a child fall;
woman with seven husbands)."—Edith Deen, All of the Women of the Bible
(San Francisco: HarperCollins Pub., 1988), pp. xii-xv11.
    As Ms. Deen wrote this book, she testifies to the effect of this
vicarious contact: "These women of antiquity became my personal
friends and daily companions as I worked month after month from
5:00 a.m. until bedtime writing, rewriting and studying. Often it seemed
that such vivid personalities as Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah and
Mary, the Mother of Jesus, were actually in my sunny yellow study. I
discovered their stories are among the most exciting on record. Here
in this Bible portrait gallery—the greatest in all literature—are women
of our common humanity."—pp. xx, xxi.
    May this week's studies reward you likewise.

DEBORAH—WARRIOR OF FAITH (Judges 4-5).

  "And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go" (Judg. 4:8).

   Wife, counselor, judge, and war hero, Deborah remains one of the
most fascinating women in Scripture. Though not much is revealed
about her personally, the little told does show that she was highly
respected by the nation she judged.

  What was the "secret" of Deborah's success? The answer ap-
pears in various places throughout chapter 4, which deals with the
defeat of Sisera's army.


   One of the most interesting exchanges in all Old Testament history
appears in this story (Judg. 4:8). Israel, heavily oppressed by a foreign
power, cries out to the Lord. Deborah, speaking for the Lord, tells
Barak, a military commander, to take ten thousand men and fight, for
the Lord will give them victory under the command of Sisera (vss. 6,
7). Barak with a mighty army of his own and the promise of victory
given him by the Lord—nevertheless refuses to go unless . . . unless
Deborah will accompany him into battle.
   What was it about this woman that instilled such confidence that even a
military leader—given assurance by God of victory—refuses to fight
unless Deborah comes? The answer has to be that Deborah's faith in and
relationship to God was well-known; thus even an army, with all its carnal
weapons of warfare, was reluctant to move without her.

   Was Deborah herself the one whom he wanted there, or was it
what she represented that made Barak seek her presence? Or,
perhaps, did Barak, not utterly confident of victory, think that as
long as this woman of God was there, they could never lose?

   The story doesn't end with the defeat of the enemy army. Even
before the fighting began, Deborah told Barak that Sisera would be
delivered into "the hand of a woman" (vs. 9)—exactly what happened
when Jael, wife of Heber, drove a spike through his temple (vss. 17-
22). For whatever reasons, the Lord not only wanted to use women in
a special way to give Israel victory, but it seems He wanted the men to
know that He would be using women to accomplish His purposes.

   What does this story tell us about prejudging anyone's fit-
 ness, especially based on gender, in working for the Lord?


                                                                       97

ESTHER—RELUCTANT HEROINE (Esther 4:14).

   "And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom
for such a time as this?" (Esther 4:14b, RSV).

   The story of Esther has resonated through the centuries as an
example of a faithful, courageous woman working hard to save her
people from destruction. Yet it's not so simple. Instead, this is a story
that deals with a woman—pushed by circumstances beyond her con-
trol—having to choose between only bad options. Who hasn't also
found themselves in similar situations, with only bad choices before
them?

  Were Esther's actions totally selfless? What did Mordecai, her
uncle, say that motivated Esther to take the risk she did? See
Esther 4:13-15.


   If what Mordecai said were true—that if she kept silent, "relief and
deliverance will arise for the Jews from another quarter"(RSV), and
that she and her father's house would alone perish—then Esther's
actions, however successful, seem to have arisen from self-interest.
According to the story, she seemed reluctant to intervene with the king
because of the potential danger.
   Though we aren't privy to Esther's innermost thoughts, it apparently
took the harsh words of her uncle to motivate her. Whatever, ultimately,
her motives were, Esther's response—"And so will I go in unto the
king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish"
(4:16)—shows a person willing to step out in faith, no matter the cost to
herself. Indeed, that's the only kind of faith that really counts.

 As fallen beings, all that we do is tainted with sin. Our good works,
 even works done out of love and faith, are impure. The incense
 burned in the sanctuary symbolizes the righteousness of Christ,
 which needs to cover even our prayers, which in and of themselves
 are impure because they come from impure and fallen beings.
 What we can learn, perhaps, from the book of Esther is that,
 however important good motives might be, if we waited until our
 motives were perfect, totally selfless, and absolutely pure—we
 might not get anything done, even for the Lord.

    Is it possible to work for the Lord even if our motives are not
 perfect? Can fallen beings ever have perfectly pure motives?
 What can all this teach us about our utter need for the imputa-
 tion of Christ's righteousness over all that we do?

RUTH—THE PROGENITOR OF CHRIST (Ruth 1-4).

   "And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where
thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy
God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be
buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death
part thee and me" (Ruth 1:16, 17).

   Read the short book of Ruth to remind you of its plot: "The book of
Ruth is a short story mainly concerned to supply a link in the narrative
of the lineage of King David [and hence Christ]. . . . A grim stage has
been set. During the time of the judges famine lay hard on the land. A
native of Judah named Elimelech went abroad to Moab to try to
improve his luck. But he died young, leaving his widow, Naomi, with
two sons. The sons took Moabite wives, Ruth and Orpah, but the sons
also died. So the three women found themselves alone, without the
men they needed to be secure in a patriarchal society."—Denise Carmody,
Biblical Woman: Contemporary Reflections on Scriptural Texts (New
York: Crossroad Pub. Co., 1988), pp. 32, 33.
    When Naomi plans to return to Judah, both daughters-in-law offer
to go with her. Ultimately, Orpah stays but Ruth goes with Naomi.

   Though Ruth's expression of fidelity to Noami is often viewed
as an example of friendship, it goes much deeper. Ruth expresses
fidelity to Naomi's God, as well. One daughter returns to her own
people and her "own gods," the other stays with the Lord and the
Lord's people. What spiritual lessons can be learned from this
incident?


   The mother of all mothers-in-law: The mother-in-law and daugh-
ter-in-law relationship is not always the best; in fact it's often the
source of jokes. Yet something happened between these women
that caused each of the wives to love her mother-in law. Both
women at first even sought to remain with her after their husbands
died. "And they said to her, 'Surely we will return with you to your
people — (Ruth 1:10, NKJV). Something about Naomi drew them
to her.

    However beautiful and powerful the truths that God has
 given us, many people will be turned away because of bad in-
 terpersonal relationships. What can this story teach us about the
 power—and the limitations—of good relationships in soul-
 winning?

MARY—MOTHER OF JESUS (Luke 1:30, 31).

   "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you
have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your
womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus' " (Luke
1:30, 31, RSV).

    As the mother of Jesus, Mary stands apart from all women in all
history, for in her womb alone the Creator of the universe stepped into
humanity (an almost inconceivable concept!). No woman in the entire
history of the world has been so honored and revered, even to the
point of idolatry. No doubt, both her cousin and the angel Gabriel
were right when they said to her, "Blessed art thou among women"
(Luke 1:28, 42).

 When the angel first approached Mary, he said that she had
 found Vavor" with God. The Greek word for lavor," kairin, is
 the exact word the Septuagint (an early Greek translation of the
 Hebrew Bible) used in translating Genesis 6:8—"But Noah
 found grace (kairin) in the eyes of the Lord." Though, obvi-
 ously, both Noah and Mary had special characteristics that
 enabled the Lord to use them, what does the word kairin (grace
 or favor) imply, in terms of their deserving the roles that they
 had been given?

   Mary's response to the news that though she "knew" no man she
would nevertheless be pregnant by the Holy Spirit, in many ways
exemplifies the essence of living by faith. " 'Behold, I am the
handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word —
(Luke 1:38, RSV).
   Imagine yourself, as much as possible, in her position. An angel
comes and tells her that something utterly unbelievable will happen,
something that human rationality and reason and "science" say is im-
possible. Her own words in verse 34 show how hard it is for her,
logically, to grasp what was promised. Yet, though she doesn't fully
understand, she has been given enough evidence to trust anyway.
Here, in many ways, is the beauty of Mary and why the Lord was able
to use her for such a crucial task. Her childlike faith in the promises of
God makes her such a wonderful example to all who profess faith in
the same God.

    As Christians, in what ways do we need the same experience
 as Mary, that of trusting God in things that don't seem logical or
 possible? What practical steps can we take to develop that same
 kind of faith?

MARY—SINFUL WOMAN FORGIVEN (Luke 7:36-50).

  "And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
an alabaster box of ointment, and stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them
with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them
with the ointment" (Luke 7:37, 38).

   Though not named in the text itself, the woman here is Mary
Magdalene, the same woman who was among the first at the tomb on
the morning of the Resurrection (Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:1, 2). She was
also one of the first to inform the disciples of the Resurrection (Matt.
28:7, 8; Luke 24:1-10; John 20:18) and the first (or among the first) to
whom Jesus appeared after His resurrection (Matt. 28:1, 5, 6, 9). What
a long way she progressed from this sad scene in Luke 7!

  What was the main, and crucial, difference between Simon, the
Pharisee, and Mary, in terms of their relationship to Jesus? The
answer is found in the parable Jesus told in Luke 7:41, 42.


   Though no details are given, according to the story, Mary had been
quite a sinner. If one wanted to push the parable further, her sins were
10 times as manifold and as great as Simon's. Nevertheless Simon, not
Mary, is the one who's rebuked in the story, because he's the one who
didn't show true repentance and thankfulness, as Mary did. In many
ways, Simon represents those who in their own self-righteousness
don't see the need to fall broken and weeping at the feet of Christ,
even though Simon—as everyone else—is a condemned sinner who
has "nothing with which to repay" (vs. 44) his debt.

"The one who had fallen, and whose mind had been a habita-
tion of demons, was brought very near to the Saviour in fellow-
ship and ministry. It was Mary who sat at His feet and learned
 of Him. It was Mary who poured upon His head the precious
 anointing oil, and bathed His feet with her tears. Mary stood
 beside the cross, and followed Him to the sepulcher. Mary was
first at the tomb after His resurrection. "—The Desire of Ages,
p. 568.

   In what ways is Mary's experience a profound example of
 how the plan of salvation works, not only in forgiving sinners
 but in changing their lives?


                                                                    101

FURTHER STUDY: Feminine Images of the Deity. Although God
references Himself in male images such as father and brother, the
Scriptures contain both masculine and feminine metaphors to symbol-
ize Deity.

   — 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those
who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children
together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would
not!' " (Matt. 23:37, RSV).

  "I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver
you" (Isa. 46:4b).

  "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I
not forget thee" (Isa. 49:15).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What other feminine images are used in the Bible to
     describe God? What points are these images (or any others)
     trying to get across? In other words, the images aren't
     meant to be literal but figurative. Look at various meta-
     phors about God and try and see what the author is
     saying.

  2. Why do you think that God uses imagery, or symbols, to
     teach us about Himself?

  3. Feminine imagery isn't just used for God. Look at both
     Genesis 3:15 and Revelation 12:17. Why is God's church
     described with the imagery of a woman? What point is He
     making?

  4. The Lord has clearly used women throughout salvation
     history, often giving them crucial roles to play in the story
     of redemption. What lessons can we derive from these ex-
     amples that help us understand the role of women in the
     church today?

SUMMARY: Whether as queens, judges, prostitutes, or mothers,
women have certainly played crucial roles in the history of God's
people. We can all, male and female, learn from their examples, both
good and bad.

                           The Defiant Rudder
                                   Harry Gai*

    Five missionaries, including some students from Mountain View
 College joined me on a trip to visit several islands off the southern
 coast of Mindanao in the Philippines. This was the maiden voyage
 of our new boat, donated to help us extend our outreach to our
 Muslim friends.
    Our pilot was a sea gypsy, a man who had grown up on the sea.
 These people know the ocean well, and some even say they have
 an inner compass to guide them. It is said that the only time a sea
 gypsy sets foot on land is when he is buried.
    Before long I noticed that something was wrong. We were off
 course. I asked our pilot about it, and he replied that something
 must be wrong with the rudder; for he could not control the boat.
 The boat had been designed with an especially large rudder, so it
 would be more responsive, but instead it seemed to go its own way
 in spite of all the efforts put forth by the pilot.
    We came into view of an Adventist settlement of homes that
 stands on stilts in the shallow waters off a coral island. We de-
 cided to stop and try to repair the rudder. While we worked on the
 boat, we learned that one of the pioneer Adventists in the area, an
 old man, was very sick. The symptoms sounded as though he had
 malaria.
    I climbed the ladder to his home and prayed with him. Then we
 rubbed him with some rubbing alcohol, the only medicine we had
 with us. As we turned to leave, the man, a sea gypsy himself,
 struggled to sit up then gave us some advice. "If the rudder defies
 you, cancel your trip."
     We decided that was good advice and started back toward our
 base. Immediately the pilot noticed that the rudder responded
 properly, even though we had not fixed it.
     When we arrived at our base, we learned that a band of pirates
 had killed 21 people not far from our intended destination. Had we
 continued on our planned path, we would have been in the direct
 path of these pirates. As pioneer missionaries, we do not shrink
 from danger. But we are convinced that on that day God sent His
 angel to control our rudder and guide us safely away from the
 pirates.

      Tiny Sins, Huge Results




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 19:26; Lev. 10:1, 2; Judg.
16:17; 2 Kings 5:20-27; 1 Chronicles 13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Behold, how great a matter a little fire
   kindleth!" (James 3:5b).

   KEY THOUGHT: All sin—small, medium, or large—offends,
even greatly. Although in the memory text James refers specifically to
the tongue, elsewhere he stresses the necessity of abstaining from all
sin: "For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has
become guilty of all of it" (2:10, RSV).

TEENY, TINY SINS? A tempting fruit, a soothing voice—but out
Eve went, thrust from the Garden. Was that fair? A rowdy mob, a rock
struck in anger—and out Moses went, dying on a lonesome mountain,
denied his consuming passion of Canaan's possession. Was that fair?
A hidden golden wedge, some buried silver shekels, and a concealed
Babylonish garment—and out Achan went, stoned to death and then
burned. Was that fair? Such "insignificant" trespasses, such extreme
effects? Who gets pardoned? Who gets death? Sometimes it's hard to
understand.
   "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely
[sinful] players."—Shakespeare, As You Like It. All are sinners, so
why are some graciously forgiven, others instantly punished? How
can the same Jesus say to the adulterous woman "Go and sin no more"
but say to Eve, Moses, and Achan "You're out of here!"
   As you analyze this week's examples, perhaps you will get some
clear answers, perhaps not. However, as we look at these stories, even
the harder ones, we need to always understand them in the context of a
loving and merciful God who proved His love and mercy at the Cross.

LOT'S WIFE—IMMORTALITY LOST FOR A MATERIAL
WORLD (Gen. 19:15-26).

   "Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brim-
stone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; ... But his [Lot's] wife
looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt"
(Gen. 19:24, 26).

   "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36). It profits him nothing.
   One of the most vivid illustrations of this axiom lies in the Genesis
account of Lot's wife, who looked back to the city—where her home
and possessions and some of her family remained—and refused to
give it all up. As a result she lost not only what she coveted but
everything else, as well.

    How does the experience of Lot's wife relate, in principle, to
this hard saying of Jesus: "For whosoever hath, to him shall be
given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath
not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath"? (Matt.
13:12).


   As God will lead but not force us in the path of righteousness,
in like manner, the angels led Lot's wife out of the city but would
not change her heart. Physically, she had left the city, but emo-
tionally she was still a citizen. "Fifteen words in the Old Testa-
ment tell the story of Lot's wife. . . . The fifteen words are, 'But
his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
salt' (Gen. 19:26). . . . Can we not conjecture that the fifteen-
word Old Testament biography of Lot's wife was written for
those who love the things of the world more than the things of the
spirit, those who do not possess the pioneering courage to leave a
life of ease and comfort and position for a life of sacrifice,
hardship, and loneliness? Does not her biography also speak a
message to those who are unwilling to flee from iniquity when all
efforts to redeem iniquity have failed?"—Edith Deen, All of the
 Women of the Bible (San Francisco: HarperCollins Pub., 1955),
pp. 17, 18.

    God doesn't demand that we give up everything we have in
 order to serve Him, because not everything we have is bad.
 What He does demand is that we be willing to give up every-
 thing. Why is that willingness so crucial to the Christian life?
 Hint, see John 14:30.

                                                                     105

NADAB AND ABIHU—GONE IN A FLASH (Lev. 10:1, 2).

   "And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron . . . offered strange
fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. And there
went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died
before the Lord" (Lev. 10:1, 2).

   Notice the impressive company Nadab and Abihu kept: "And he
[God] said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron,
Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye
afar off" (Exod. 24:1). These two men had been especially honored by
the Lord, having been permitted with the seventy elders to behold
God's glory in the mount.
   "They had heard the voice of God; they had been with Moses and
Aaron in the mount of God; they had seen the God of Israel, and 'did
eat and drink' (Ex. 24:9-11). They had been greatly favored; but had
not profited by their opportunities."—The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 749.

   Did their exalted status, high position, and great privileges
have something to do with the extreme punishment they faced for
their grievous sin? If so, what does that tell us about the responsi-
bility any of us who have been given light, honor, or privileges
have before the Lord?


   For the modern, twenty-first century, it's hard to understand why
these two men should have faced such a radical punishment. After all,
fire is fire. What is the difference?
   The answer stems from the sacred nature of the sanctuary service
and the crucial mission God had given to ancient Israel. Important and
solemn truths were taught by the sanctuary service (indeed, the whole
plan of salvation was contained in it!). God, therefore, gave specific
instructions regarding its services. Had Nadab and Abihu, priests who
were drunk (see Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 361, 362), not been
punished for their sins, then the whole nation could have questioned
whether God was that serious in the commands He gave them. On the
other hand, if He would punish these men over the strange fire,
certainly He meant business with other commands, as well! No doubt,
after this incident, Israel understood that the Lord meant what He said.

   The idea is sometimes pushed that spiritual principles alone
 are important, not specifics. God cares just about the principle,
 nothing else. Does the story of Nadab and Abihu debunk that
 notion? Give reasons for your answer, either way.

SAMSON—EYELESS IN GAZA (Judg. 16:16-31).

   46 • • • And [Samson] said unto her [Delilah], There hath not

come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto
God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength
will go from me" (Judg. 16:17).

   Distinguished as one of only sixteen to be named in Hebrews 11,
the faith chapter, Samson had in fact been groomed for greatness from
before birth. His mother had been instructed to be temperate in order
to pave the way for Samson's calling. "For, lo, thou shalt conceive,
and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall
be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver
Israel out of the hand of the Philistines" (Judg. 13:5).

   How did someone so destined for greatness end up as he did, a
blind slave to the very people he had been raised up to help
conquer?


   In his famous play, Samson Agonistes, British poet John Milton
depicted Samson, blinded and enslaved by the Philistines, sitting in
the open air on a festival day and bemoaning his fate and the nasty
turn of events in his life. Instead of fulfilling the promise that he
"should deliver Israel from the Philistian yoke," he instead finds
himself "eyeless in Gaza" and lower "than a bond-slave."
   Yet, amid his sorrow, Milton's Samson says that he will not "rashly
call into doubt Divine prediction." Instead, he asks wether or not all
that had been foretold would have been fulfilled, except "through
mine own default." In other words, though the Lord had destined him
for greatness, by his own bad decisions, that greatness had not been
achieved. Though God could have great plans for us, we can—by
disobedience—keep those plans from being fulfilled.
   The story of Samson, in many ways, seems to depict the principle
regarding conditionality. God will do wonderful things for us, but
only if we allow Him to work in us "both to will and to do of his good
pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).
    Thus, how careful we all need to be, especially those who believe
that they have been called by God to work for Him. God can fullfil our
potential only as far as we allow Him 10.

   What other Bible characters had great potential to do won-
 derful things for the Lord but ruined it, or hampered it, by bad
 decisions? How can we learn from their mistakes in order to
 avoid these same pitfalls?

                                                                    107

GEHAZI—CONNIVING SERVANT (2 Kings 5:20-27).

   "The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper
as white as snow" (2 Kings 5:27, KJV).

    Naaman, a Syrian leader, is miraculously cured by the power of
Israel's God. "And he [Naaman] returned to the man of God, he and
all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold,
now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel" (2 Kings
5:15). What a powerful testimony from a pagan ruler!
    As a result of his being cured, Naaman wanted to pay Elisha. "Now
therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant," the Syrian said
to him (vs. 15). Naaman had, in fact, in anticipation of healing,
brought with him some material goods as payment (see vs. 5).

   How did Elisha respond to the offer? Why do you think he
responded that way? Would it have been wrong for him to have
taken it?


   Elisha was quite adamant about not taking the silver and gold. "As
the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none" (vs.16).
Meanwhile, Gehazi, his servant, saw Elisha's response, yet he be-
lieved they should have been paid. As a result, he goes to Naaman, lies
to get some payment, then goes back and lies to Elisha about what
happened.
   It's not that hard, however, to understand Gehazi's rationale. He
probably justified in his mind numerous reasons why they should have
been paid. After all, is not there the principle that "the labourer is
worthy of his reward"? Besides, Naaman had plenty of wealth, and they
didn't. Why shouldn't they get something for all the hard work they did?

Look at the insight that Ellen White gave regarding this incident:
"The course of Gehazi was such as to place a stumbling block in
the pathway of Naaman, upon whose mind had broken a wonder-
ful light, and who was favorably disposed toward the service of the
living God." —Prophets and Kings, p. 252.


   Though Gehazi's lies could not be justified, the greater sin
lies in how his actions could have been, as Ellen White said, "a
stumbling block" to Naaman. How crucial is it that all those who
seek to witness for the Lord be careful not to do anything that
could cause someone to question their motives.

UZZAH—THE TOUCH OF DEATH (2 Sam. 6:1-11).

   "And the anger of the Lord burned against Uzzah, and God
struck him down there for his irreverence; and he died there by
the ark of God" (2 Sam. 6:7, NASB).

   What was Uzzah's act of irreverence? See vs. 6.


   Of all the "insignificant" sins with high results we have studied—
no punishment seems less justified than what happened to Uzzah's.
What's going on here?
   To bring the ark back to Jerusalem and have this powerful symbol
of Divine presence in the city, David assembled 30,000 men. His
enthusiasm over the ark ignited a celebration. The ark, placed upon a
new cart and drawn by oxen, led the group: "David and all the house
of Israel played before the Lord . . . on harps, and on psalteries, and on
timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals" (vs. 5). Suddenly, the
exuberance ceased. Uzzah lay dead, struck down by God for touching
the ark. A sudden pall of fear must have fallen upon the throng.

  "To those accompanying Uzzah it might have seemed as if Uzzah's
 intentions were perfectly honorable—he was only trying to assist
 when he stretched forth his hand to steady the ark. But his heart
 was not right with God. His act of touching the ark was one of
 presumption. . . . Uzzah's death served as a warning to many that
 the Lord is a righteous God, who requires strict obedience from
 all. "—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, pp. 625, 626.

    Fortunately, the story of Uzzah is not the only story in the Bible. If
it were, one might really have cause to question God's fairness. The
fact is, however, that time and again the Lord has shown to humanity
his infinite love, mercy, grace, and care for fallen humanity. The same
God who struck Uzzah dead was the same God who suffered at
Calvary. Thus, when incidents like Uzzah are depicted in the Bible,
without much explanation, though it is not wrong to have questions,
it's wrong to use something like this to doubt God's love, justice, or
fairness. In most of these cases, there are simply many facts that have
not been revealed to us. We have to go on faith.

    How does one respond to skeptics who use incidents like this
 in Scripture to raise questions about God's love, justice, or
 fairness? And, however good the answers we might be able to
 give, why do we need to realize that many things will remain a
 mystery to us for now? See 1 Corinthians 4:5.

                                                                      109

   3. Not just in the Bible, but in "secular" life, we are faced with
      people who suffer terrible consequences for what seem to be
      little mistakes, while others who do grievous things don't
      seem to face the consequences. How do we make sense of
      this fact, or don't we? Considering this reality, why is it so
      important to put our final hope in Christ and in the prom-
      ises that He offers us of eternity in a world without sin and
      suffering?

Who directs your life?
   Saints and sinners, slaves and sovereigns, princes and paupers,
pagans and prophets, lovely or loathsome, major or minor, courageous
or cowardly, they've all been looked at this quarter.
   And though many lessons can be learned from these studies, per-
haps the most important is this: You, alone, are the key in determining
your destiny. You have, really, only two choices in whatever ultimate
destiny you face: either Christ and what He has planned for you or
Satan and what he has planned for you. There's no middle ground.
   Pray that these lessons can help you see how cruical the right
decision is as we move toward the final scenes of this drama called
Planet Earth.

SUMMARY: To conclude these thirteen lessons, reviewing the lives of
dozens of Bible personalities, Paul's admonition seems particularly
relevant: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so
closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that
was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated
at the right hand of the throne of God" (Heb. 12:1, 2, RSV).

           Forgotten Book Brings Rich Harvest
   While attending a birthday party for her brother, Jasia saw a
book that caught her attention. She asked her brother what the
book was about.
   "I have not read it," he answered. "But I think it is some kind of
history book.
   Jasia borrowed the book, The Great Controversy, and began
reading it. She was amazed to learn that most Christian churches had
drifted away from the teachings of the Bible. When she finished
reading the book she started over, this time checking each Scripture
reference in her own Bible.
   One day Jasia saw a man selling books at a table. She saw a book
with a familiar title, The Great Controversy. She picked up the
book and asked the man, "Who publishes this book?"
   The man told her the book is published by Seventh-day Adventists.
Then he added, "I am a Seventh-day Adventist."
    "Where do you people meet for worship?" she asked. The man
gave her the church's address. She wanted to visit the church, but
she was afraid to tell her husband. Finally she said she was going
shopping, then she set out to find the church. After her first worship
service she decided to return.
   When her husband learned that she was going to church, he
reacted so violently that Jasia had to call the police to restrain him.
Jasia took her two daughters to church with her, and in time all
three of them were baptized.

   The publishing house in Poland has struggled to keep up with the
demand for books by Ellen White, including The Great Contro-
versy. More than 40,000 copies were sold in just a few months,
while in previous years only about 2,500 copies were sold in a year.
   One man traveled 250 kilometers (about 160 miles) to visit the
publishing house and buy more books by Ellen White. Asked about
his interest in these books, the man answered, "This book, The
Great Controversy, saved my life. I have found so much help from
reading this book, that I have decided to share it with others who
have similar problems." The man purchased 300 books.
   The books that have been scattered across Poland, some long
forgotten, promise to bring a rich harvest as thousands of people
search for truth.

       Bible Study Guide for Third Quarter, 2001
   This quarter's study guide, Pillars of Our Faith, written by Dr.

       T Y GIBSON
   How many people have turned away from God because they
looked for Him in a person or a religious group and were disap-
pointed by what they saw? See With New Eyes, by Ty Gibson, is
about God. It's not about people or religions that claim to represent
God, but about God Himself, as He has represented Himself in the
One true portrait of His character.
   Through striking language and evocative illustrations, Ty shows
that God is exactly the kind of person we had hoped He would be.
But you must close your eyes and open your heart to see Him. This
book will help you close your eyes to the ugly pictures of deity so
prevalent in our world, and open your mind and emotions to the
crystal clear image of God in the person of Jesus Christ.
