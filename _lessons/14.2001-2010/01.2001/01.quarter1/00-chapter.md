     OU can do a splendid work with the visitors,
Y    callers, agents, and others who daily come to your
door. Just be prepared. Have one of those nice
little house racks conven-
iently located, and filled         I, •
with the current issues of                    L---
the Signs weekly. These
racks, by the way, also
contain little compart-
ments for tracts. Give a
copy of something each week to those who, like the
tradespeople, call regularly. This method, like all
others where readers are met face to face, is ideal.

  "A sewing machine agent called at our house one day. I had
no business for him, but, as is my habit with all callers, I gave
him a copy of the Signs weekly from the little rack that hangs
inside my front dcor, ready for all comers. We had just a few
words about current events, and he promised to read a certain
article I had marked in the paper. He returned a few days
later, requesting other literature, saying that a friend of his
wanted some. He came again, saying that he felt troubled over
some things. I arranged for him to come some evening and
study with my husband. He did so, and soon joined our church.
Now he is selling our books."         —From a busy Mother.

                           Notes
   1. The city of Philippi was named after Philip, king of
Macedon, and father of Alexander the Great. Philip seized
the city in 358 B. C., developed its strength, and named it
4           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 after himself because of its strategic value as protection
against the hostile Thracians to the east, because of its gold
 mines, and because of its location on the highway from
 Europe into Asia. Macedonia became a Roman province in
146 B. C., and in 42 B. C. Philippi witnessed the death struggle
 of the Roman republic in the defeat of the republican leaders
 Brutus and Cassius by Octavius (afterward Emperor Augus-
 tus) and Antony. The city soon afterward became a Roman
 colony, its inhabitants enjoying numerous rights of Roman
 citizenship. Paul first visited the city on his second mis-
 sionary tour, about 53 A. D., and raised up the church of
the Philippians.
     2. The remarkable leading of the Spirit that brought
 Paul to Philippi marks the first entrance of the gospel from
Asia into Europe. The wording of his call therefore becomes
eminently fitting to voice the appeal for gospel succor from
every land. The fact is worth noting here that at the present
writing, the Macedonian call to our people is being heard and
heeded. More than a hundred missionaries a year are be-
ing sent to the regions beyond. Many mission fields are be-
ing entered for the first time.
     3. The work of the gospel got a footing in Philippi
through faithful women of prayer, one of whom became to
Paul and Silas what Mary and Martha were to Jesus in the
way of devotion and hospitality. Let no one to-day speak
slightingly of a company of believers as being "all sisters."
The faithfulness of many a "sister," in both Bible and
modern times, has brought salvation to her household, and
even formed the nucleus of a church, as did that of Lydia.
It is significant that Satan opposed the work of Lydia through
another woman, the "damsel," causing her apparently to
commend the work of the apostles in order to confuse their
efforts with works of "divination."
    4. "Dispossessed of the evil spirit and restored to her right
mind, the woman chose to become a follower of Christ. Then
her masters were alarmed for their craft. . . . Many others
in the city were interested in gaining money through satanic
delusions. . . . Stirred by a frenzy of excitement, the multi-
tude rose against the disciples. A mob spirit prevailed, and
was sanctioned by the authorities, who tore the outer gar-
ments from the apostles, and commanded that they should be
scourged," and thrown into prison.—"Acts of the Apostles,"
page 213.
    5. "But while men were cruel and vindictive, or crimi-
nally negligent of the solemn responsibilities devolving upon
them, God had not forgotten to be gracious to His servants.
All heaven was interested in the men who were suffering for
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    5
Christ's sake, and angels were sent to visit the prison. At
their tread the earth trembled. The heavily bolted prison
doors were thrown open; the chains and fetters fell from the
hands and feet of the prisoners; and a bright light flooded
the prison."—/d., page 215.
    6. Among the charter members of the church in Philippi
were three notable characters: Lydia, the merchant-woman,
evidently a person of means and influence; the "damsel pos-
sessed with a spirit of divination." healed and converted; the
"keeper of the prison," cruel, relentless, desperate to the point
of taking his own life, but converted, baptized, rejoicing, and
"believing in God with all his house." Such were the first
believing Philippians. What wonder that they loved Paul
and ministered to him, and were so loved by him as to call
forth the most affectionate and joyful of all his epistles! In
the words of Doremus A. Hayes: "They gave to their own
dear apostle, but only that he might minister to others as
he had ministered to them. He was their living link with
the work in the mission field."




          Lesson 2 —Abovnding in Christ

      Verse 10, first part.

14. In what may we thus abound in Christ? Verse 11.

                            Notes
    1. While Paul includes Timothy in his greeting to the
Philippian church, obviously the letter is not jointly written.
After the salutation, the singular number of the pronoun
in the first person is used all the way through. Note the
frequent use of "I," "my," and "me."
    2. Timothy and Silas are definitely named; but that Luke
also was with them is indicated by the use of "we" in verses
10 to 13, Luke being generally conceded to be the writer of
the book of Acts.
    3. The mention of bonds, the palace, and Caesar's house-
hold, indicate that Paul was a prisoner in Rome for the first
time when he wrote the epistle. Timothy was with him as
companion and laborer, but not as prisoner. His previous
association with Paul in the work at Philippi made it very
fitting for him to be mentioned in Paul's greeting to the
Philippian believers.
    4. Paul speaks of himself and Timothy as "servants of
Jesus Christ." In other epistles, in which it was necessary
to reprove and set things in order, he refers to his position
of authority as an "apostle." In the Philippian epistle, there
being a complete absence of reproof, and so much of love and
joy and commendation and exhortation, the simple word
"servant" answers the purpose well.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  7
    The term "saints," used here and frequently elsewhere, has
the meaning of "holy ones"—accounted so by the acceptance
of Christ in harmony with the injunction, "Be ye holy, as I
am holy," and suggested by the complete phrase "saints in
Christ Jesus."
    The word "bishop" can hardly be understood as in its
present use among Christian denominations, but rather as
local "overseer," which the word means, or in modern terms,
"pastor" or "elder." This is indicated in this connection by
the plural form of the word. See 1 Tim. 3: 1-7.
    The term "deacon," which means attendant, or servant
 (not bond servant, as Paul calls himself and Timothy, but one
who assists), seems to have the meaning given it in Acts 6: 1-3
and 1 Tim. 3: 8-13, and retained in our present use of the
term. The word itself is virtually transferred to our lan-
guage from the Greek, and is often rendered elsewhere as
"minister" or "servant." See Matt. 20: 26; .1 Cor. 3: 5;
and John 12: 26; Rom. 16: 1.
    5. For about twelve years, the Philippian believers had
stood fast in the faith, even under severe persecution. They
had never forgotten Paul through it all, ministering often
to his physical needs and his spiritual comfort. Such con-
stant fellowship begets a spirit of unity in the bond of
peace.
    6: The word "perform" here is a strong term, meaning
literally, "carry through to completion."
    7. The use of the term "bowels" here and elsewhere in
the Scriptures, especially in the writings of Paul and Jere-
miah, grows out of the ancient conception that the seat of
the emotions is located in that region of the body, because of
certain physical sensations we all have experienced in cases
of fear, affection, pity, distress, and the like. It is an ex-
pression of intensity.

                         January 17, 1920

10. How was this principle further illustrated in the case of
      Daniel's three companions? Dan. 3: 16-18.
                             Notes
   1. Paul was no ordinary prisoner. His being in bonds
became known generally, even in the palace of the emperor.
But this was not all; for it was understood that he was in
bonds in Christ, that is, for Christ's sake, for the preaching
of Christ. This was the chief thing in Paul's estimation, and
affords his reason for saying that his imprisonment was fur-
thering the gospel. Whatever brought Christ to the atten-
tion of the people, was in the interests of spreading the
gospel.
   2. "There is a lesson for us in this experience of Paul's;
for it reveals God's way of working. The Lord can bring
victory out of that which may seem to us discomfiture and
defeat. We are in danger of forgetting God, of looking at the
things which are seen, instead of beholding by the eye of
faith the things which are unseen. When misfortune or
calamity comes, we are ready to charge God with neglect or
cruelty. If He sees fit to cut off our usefulness in some line,
we mourn, not stopping to think that thus God may be work-
ing for our good. We need to learn that .chastisement is a
part of His great plan, and that under the rod of affliction
the Christian may sometimes do more for the Master than
when engaged in active service."—"Acts of the Apostles,"
page 481.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                9
    3. That is, in the general discussion about Paul's im-
prisonment, some were talking against the Christ whose cause
he represented, or at least without full knowledge or ac-
ceptance of Him, while others were talking for Him in full
acceptance.
    4. Paul's bonds did not matter, the contention of the
people did not matter, just so Christ was preached. Oppo-
sition often promotes rather than hinders the teaching of
the gospel, "for we can do nothing against the truth, but for
the truth." 2 Cor. 13: 8.
    5. The word "salvation" here evidently refers to Paul's
safety or deliverance from prison. In the following verses,
he discusses the alternative of life or death; yet through it
all, as is easily seen, he really expects to be spared for fur-
ther labor.
    There is in this passage a remarkable spirit of resignation
to God's will, so far as life or death is concerned. Paul's
chief passion in either case was only that Christ might be
magnified. Only God knows whether we can glorify Him
more and serve His cause better by continued life or by
death. We can always leave that question entirely with Him,
and let our chief interest be to magnify Christ in either case.
    6. Paul was always concerned, and so may every Chris-
tian be, lest in some way he dishonor Christ, and so bring
himself into shame and disgrace in his own eyes. Failure to
witness for Christ is one way of doing this. Hence Paul
prayed for boldness—the word here meaning freedom and
frankness in speaking.

11. In what light does Peter put suffering for Christ? 1
       Peter 2:20, 21.
12. How had Peter and other apostles felt after being beaten
       for preaching Christ? Acts 5: 40, 41.

                               Notes
    1. Paul was  so  fully imbued   with the Christ life, and so
fully wrapped up in service for Christ, that life itself meant
Christ to him. A lengthening of his life would be so much
more of Christ and of service for Him.
    2. As Paul languished in prison, in his old age, more
closely guarded and with less liberty than at first, with his
life at the disposition of the cruel Nero, bearing upon his
body the scars of stoning and beating, and withal prepared
to meet his God, to die did indeed seem to him gain—release
from care and calumny and the buffeting of Satan. Wear-
ing labor and readiness to go sometimes make sweet indeed
the thought of sleeping in Jesus till the resurrection morning.
    3. By "the fruit of my labor," Paul evidently means the
magnifying of Christ. He did not know whether life or death
would be meted out to him; but of one thing he was sure—
that if he was to live, his life would mean the magnifying of
Christ through continued labor.
    4. The expression used here by Paul in reference to death
is often cited in an effort to prove that the soul is immortal
and goes to its reward or punishment at death. But the
apostle is so explicit on this point elsewhere in his writings
that no doubt is left that sleeping in Jesus embraces the en-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 11
tire man and is not interrupted till the resurrection day.
 (See his declaration on the rising of the dead in Christ, in
1 Thess. 4: 16, 17; on the time of receiving his own crown of
righteousness, in 1 Tim. 4: 8 and elsewhere, besides abundant
evidence given by other Bible writers.) In verse 23, Paul's
mind evidently bridges the gap of the unconscious state be-
tween the dissolution of the body and the future life with
Christ, and mentions the two as if they occurred together.
    5. The word "conversation" here, as in, Phil. 3: 20, means
manner of life, especially as a citizen or a member of society.
    6. The Philippians were doubtless under persecution at
this time. Hence Paul reminds them of what they had seen
him suffer formerly in Philippi, and here he was now suf-
fering at Rome. The last part of verse 28 and all of 29 are
really parenthetical, dealing with the general principle of
suffering for Christ.
    7. This passage is an impressive one, for it puts suffering
on an equal footing with believing, and in the light of a
privilege. The word "given" here means graciously given,
bestowed as a favor or an honor. It is rendered "forgave"
in Luke 7: 42, and is the basis of the word "gift" in the
enumeration of the spiritual gifts, in 1 Corinthians 12. In
modern Greek, it is the word used when making a present.

                        January 31, 1920

13. What should every tongue confess? Verse 11.

                             Notes
    1. The "if" used at the beginning of this verse is riot
intended to cast any doubt or uncertainty about the reality
of the believer's privileges in Christ, but it is an effective way
of making this remarkable series of virtues in Christ a
basis of appeal for unity among the Philippians. The "if"
is really equivalent in force to "since." Christ is the great
consoler of the grieved and sorrowing heart, of the afflicted
and buffeted soul.
    2. Unity is one of the greatest evidences that Christ is
dwelling with His people. Christ is the head of the church.
All draw strength and comfort from Him. As He ministers
grace to His followers, they enjoy the same things, think the
same things, talk the same things. Hearts and minds are
bound together in unity and loving communion.
    3. The tendency is for a man to think better of himself—
his ideas, his ways, his achievements—than of others. When
Christ really dwells in the heart, this is all reversed. The
man gets a new vision of himself. He really sees better
things in others than in himself, and esteems them more
than himself. Under such a condition, there is no place for
strife or for the vain sort of glory so natural to the human
heart.
    4. Observe that this verse does not forbid looking upon
one's own things, but upon these alone; one should look also
upon the things of others. This excludes selfishness. The
          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 13
whole duty of man to man is comprehended in that basic
law underlying the last six commandments: "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself." This is a vital test of genuine
Christianity.
     5. The things of His own on which Christ could look,
were no ordinary things. He was "in the form of God"—
His "express image" and likeness in every respect, possessing
His attributes, and one with Him. He was also "equal with
God." Yet with all this, He did not regard this blessed
estate as something to be clung to, to be prized above every
other consideration. He would look also upon the things of
others—the state of men created in the image of God, but
now eternally lost if left without a deliverer.
     6. The literal reading of "made Himself of no reputation"
is simply "emptied Himself." Wonderful thought!—gave
all He had, gave all He was—the form of God, the express
image of His Father, equality with God, and Himself with
 it all! He emptied is mind of every consideration of Him-
self, of His own things, and left even His position empty
while He went "to seek and to save that whicn was lost."
     "He voluntarily assumed human nature. It was His own
act, and by His own consent. He clothed His divinity with
 humanity. He was all the while as God, but He did not ap-
 pear as God.. He veiled the demonstrations of Deity, which
 had commanded the homage and called forth the admiration
 of the universe of God. He was God while upon earth, but
 He divested Himself of the form of God, and in its stead took
 the form and fashion of a man. He walked the earth as a
 man. For our sakes He became poor, that we through His
 poverty might be made rich. He laid aside His glory and
 His majesty. He was God, but the glories of the form of
 God He for a while relinquished. Though He walked among
 men in poverty, scattering His blessings wherever He went,
 at His word legions of angels would surround their Redeemer,
 and do Him homage. But He walked the earth unrecognized,
 unconfessed, with but few exceptions, by His creatures. The
 atmosphere was polluted with sin and curses, in place of the
 anthem of praise. His lot was poverty and humiliation. As
 He passed to and fro upon His mission of mercy to relieve
 the sick, to lift up the depressed, scarcely a solitary voice
 called Him blessed, and the very greatest of the nation
 passed Him by with disdain.
     "Contrast this with the riches of glory, the wealth of
  praise pouring forth from immortal tongues, the millions
  of rich voices in the universe of God in anthems of adora-
  tion. But He humbled Himself, , and took mortality upon
  Him. As a member of the human family, He was mortal;
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

but as a God, He was the fountain of life to the world. He
could, in His divine person, ever have withstood the advances
of death, and refused to come under its dominion; but He
voluntarily laid down His life, that in so doing le might
give life and bring immortality to light. He bore the sins
of the world and endured the penalty, which rolled like a
mountain upon His divine soul. He yielded up His life a
sacrifice, that man should not eternally die. He died, not
through being compelled to die, but by His own free will.
This was humility. The whole treasure of heaven was poured
out in one gift to save fallen man. He brought into His
human nature all the life-giving energies that human beings
will need and must receive.
   "Wondrous combination of man and God! He might have
helped His human nature to withstand the inroads of disease
by pouring from His divine nature vitality and undecaying
vigor to the human. But He humbled Himself to man's na-
ture. He did this that the Scripture might be fulfilled; and
the plan was entered into by the Son of God, knowing all the
steps in His humiliation, that He must descend to make an
expiation for the sins of a condemned, groaning world."—
Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, July 5, 1887.

10. How might the Philippians look upon the offering? Verse
     18. Note 6.
                           Notes
    1. Paul's joy in writing to the Philippians was not only
that they had accepted and obeyed the gospel while he was
with them, but, much more, that they had continued faith-
ful after he left them. Now he was anxious that they
go on to perfection. The salvation offered us through the
gospel is not merely a thing for acceptance, but it is to be
wrought out in patient continuance in well-doing. We must
fight out the good fight of faith. We must forge the steel
of character. We must press toward the mark—the full
stature of Christ.
    2. Here is the secret of success in working out our own
salvation: (literally) "God energizes us." When the will is
weak, His indwelling Spirit energizes it, and we can then
will what we ought to will. When we lack power to do, He
energizes us, and we can then do what we ought to do. Best
of all, His energizing is always in line with His pleasure, not
ours. It enables us always to say, "Not my will, but Thine,
be done." Oh, wonderful provision of grace! What wonder-
working power !
    3. One of the most blighting habits a person may fall into
is that of murmuring and complaining—"grumbling" is the
common word for it. If things don't go to suit you, grumble
about it. If somebody does a thing in his own way instead
of in yours, grumble at him! if it rains when you want it
to shine, grumble about it, and make yourself and those about
you as miserable as you can. If you don't like to do a thing,
do it, but grumble while you do it, and take all the .joy out
of life for yourself and your family. Paul therefore urges:
Do all things without grumbling. This will bring its own
reward.
    "Disputing" is another bad habit. Being always ready
to argue is a twin sister to grumbling. To be always ready
16           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
to see the other side, to have some better way of doing, to
dwell on the objections and the difficulties, to haggle over un-
important details—all these will be excluded from our spirit
and practice if we follow the apostle's counsel to do all
things without disputings.
    4. The expression, "If I be offered," reads literally, "If
I am being poured out as a libation." It was the heathen
custom, in offering a victim in sacrifice to the gods, to pour
unmixed wine upon the offering as a mark of honor. This
was called the libation, or pouring. Alluding to this cus-
tom, and to the possibility of his life's being taken by the
Roman authorities, Paul vividly and beautifully pictures
himself as possibly being already in the process of libation
by the shedding of the blood, upon the sacrifice of the faith
of the Philippians. The word "sacrifice" in the verse means
the victim offered; and the word "service," the religious
ceremony of offering the sacrifice. Such a rite would be the
expression of faith.
    5. The words "joy" and "rejoice" read literally: "I re-
joice and co-rejoice;" that is, I rejoice on my part, and I join
you all in rejoicing, that we are united in performing so holy
a service on the altar of Christ—you the sacrifice, I the liba-
tion. The wine of my libation is truly unmixed—pure,
genuine, undiluted. Your sacrifice is spotless and without
blemish. It is an offering of sweet savor, well pleasing to God.
    6. As Paul could look forward with joy to yielding up
his life for the gospel if God so willed, so, nobly, he prepares
the Philippians for his possible death by bidding them rejoice
with him that he should be counted worthy to suffer even the
extreme penalty for Christ. A willing sacrifice, an unmixed
libation! To such an extent does God energize us to will and
to do according to His good pleasure.

                           Notes
    1. The church at Philippi seems to have been the object
of much tender regard by the apostle Paul. The Philippians
were his first converts in "the regions beyond" Asia, that is,
in Europe. They were among the most substantial and
steadfast of the Christians. The epistle to them is more in
the style of a letter, not a treatise, than any other of his
epistle's. The apostle bore their welfare continually on his
heart, as they did also Paul's, ministering to his needs in a
substantial way. Paul had already been in Rome a con-
siderable length of time, besides being nearly a year on the
way there. He longed to know more of their welfare, and
decided to send Timothy to visit them, regardless of what
it would mean to himself to lose for months the companion-
ship of so valued an associate and worker.
    2. Paul declares that he had no other so well fitted as
Timothy to fulfill the mission. Luke had accompanied Paul
to Rome, and Aristarchus and Demas had been with him
18           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY.
there. These had probably gone before now, since otherwise
Paul would undoubtedly have mentioned them, especially
Luke, who was well known at Philippi, in this epistle, as he
did in that to the Colossians. See Col. 4: 12-14.
    3. The apostle here mentions a fault common even among
workers and believers—a disposition to think of themselves
and their own affairs first, even before the things of the
Lord. This was directly opposite to the counsel Paul gives
to the Philippian Christians in verses 4 and 5, citing Jesus
as their example. Timothy was so free from this fault, that
he could be trusted to fulfill this important mission for the
chief apostle shut up in prison.
    4. Not only was Timothy trusted by Paul, but he had the
confidence of the Philippian believers also. He had come to
Philippi with Paul the first time in response to the Mace-
donian call, and remained true through the severe experiences
of Paul and Silas in that city. Hence he would be warmly
received by the Philippian brethren.
    5. Epaphroditus was himself a Philippian, who had been
sent with gifts to Rome to minister to Paul's necessities. He
had not returned at once, but had labored in Rome until he
fell sick.

       part.
                             Notes
    1. There are many things in the course of life to enjoy
if our eyes are open to see and appreciate them. Rejoicing
in the Lord includes all these that are good, when He is
recognized as their Giver and is honored in their use. But
it includes much more than these. The child of God can re-
joice in tribulation, in hardship, in sorrow, in disappoint-
ment, in many things that ordinarily distress. In fact, aside
from sin, there can come to the Christian no experience
which he may not make an occasion for rejoicing in the
Lord.
    2. Paul appeared to be closing his epistle; but it occurs
to him to go over again some things he has already presented
to the Philippians, for the sake of their safety. He does not
tire of repeating if only he can get results.
    3. To the Jews, a dog was the symbol of uncleanness. The
term "evil workers" probably refers to grumblers and dis-
puters, and to those given to strife and vainglory. Concision,
or mutilation, appears to be a reflection upon those who per-
sisted in the rite of circumcision, which, since it was done
away in Christ, amounted to no more than mutilation of the
flesh.
     4. Paul could trace his lineage back to Jacob, whose
name was changed to "Israel," "the prevailer," which gave
the general name "Israelite" to the Jews. He was of the
tribe of Benjamin, a favorite son of Jacob--a tribe that did
 not revolt against the kingdom of Judah, nor pollute its
 worship with idolatry, as other tribes did. He was a Hebrew
 of pure blood on the side of both parents. He was a Pharisee,
 specially taught and skilled in all questions pertaining to
 the law. He had sat as a student at the feet of Gamaliel,
 perhaps the greatest teacher in Israel at that time.

      14. (Memorize verses 13 and 14.) Note 8.
                           Notes
   1. The word "excellency" should be taken quite literally-
that which excels in value, of surpassing worth in compari-
son with other things. This is exactly what Paul means.
There is nothing to be compared with experimental knowledge
of Christ in the life. It was this that enabled Paul to en-
dure so much hardness as an apostle of Christ. It was this
that enabled him, after nearly five years of continuous im-
prisonment, to write from his prison cell a letter in which he
used some form of the word "joy" or "rejoice" eighteen times,
besides other words of about the same meaning. The worth
of such knowledge cannot be estimated. It is excellent be-
yond all comparison.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21
    2. The word "win" means literally gain. All through
this balancing of values, Paul is using terms of the ac-
countant. All his own advantages of birth and education
were put in the column of gains before he knew Christ. But
now comes a new casting up of accounts, and these gains
pass into the column of losses, with Christ, the "hidden
treasure" he had found; on the credit side of his loss and
gain account. The balancing of the account shows that he
has gained Christ in the transaction.
    3. Paul's conception was that the individual Christian
must pass through essentially the same experience as Christ:
suffering, death, resurrection—first in a spiritual, and if
need be, in a physical sense. "Unto you it is given," he
says, "in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him,
but also to suffer for His sake." Phil. 1: 29. "I die daily,"
he declares in 1 Cor. 15: 31. At times, he seems almost
to court as a privilege the laying down of his life as Christ
had done. Certainly he was always willing to yield it. Thus
was Paul "conformable unto His death," while gladly pay-
ing any price in order that he might know—experience—
"the power of His resurrection."
    4. Resurrection to immortality is assured to those only
who know by experience "the power of His resurrection,"
which is "the power of an endless life," and whose lives are
"hid with Christ in God." To every such one, as was the case
with Christ, will be "loosed the pains of death," for it is "not
possible that he should be holden of it [death]." Acts 2: 24.
    5. The apostle adopts here the language of the athletic
foot race, with which the Philippians were familiar, and
continues it more or less through the fourteenth verse. The
 word "attain" in verse 11 means reach or arrive at, and
suggests the goal of the race. This is to say, Not that I have
already received the prize at the end, nor have already com-
 pleted the race, but I keep on pursuing.
    6. The language here suggests the chase, reading literally,
"But I pursue, that I may seize upon and hold that for which
 I was seized upon and held by Christ Jesus." The love of
 Christ pursued Paul on the way to Damascus; His power
 seized upon the mind and will of the apostle and held them
 fast. So Paul would pursue and lay hold upon the excel-
 lency of the knowledge of Christ and the power of His
 resurrection. Paul always regarded himself a bond servant
 of Christ,•and there may be in his language here an al-
 lusion also to his now being held in bonds as a prisoner for
 Christ. As he was held in willing bondage to the service of
 Christ, and was now securely held by the Roman authori-
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
ties, so would he lay hold upon and hold securely the prizes
of the Christian race.
    Jesus seized Paul and laid hold on him to make him His
own,—to serve, to suffer, to be an apostle, to carry the excel-
lency of the light and glory of Christ to the gentiles, to win
the crown of life. And Paul presses on through all to which
Christ calls him, that he may lay hold of all for which Christ
laid hold of him. The Master lays His hand upon every one
He calls. He has for each one a place, a part in His service.
There waits for each one the name, the crown, the inherit-
ance. The race course may lead through suffering and death,
but the one purpose should be to lay hold on all for which
Christ laid hold of us.
    7. Every Christian can look back with sorrow on the
mistakes and failures of the past. Some of these were re-
sults of weakness, like Peter's denial of his Lord; some came
from a misconception of duty, like Paul's persecution of
Christians before his conversion, when he verily thought he
was doing God service. But from whatever cause these
failures come, there is little comfort or encouragement in
looking back upon them, either in one's own life or in that
of his neighbor. It is infinitely better to "reach forth unto
those things which are before." God is willing to remember
our sins against us no more, and our neighbor's sins against
him no more. And does He not expect the same of us?
    8. The language is again borrowed from the athletic con-
test: "I pursue the race toward the goal for the prize."
The prize is the calling on high, the calling heavenward, of
God in Christ Jesus.

       Verse 17. Note 3.
  6. How do many about us walk? Verse 18.
 .7. On what plane of life do such live? What is their end?
       Verse 19.
8. Connecting the thought again with verse 17, where does
       Paul say our citizenship is? Verse 20. Note 4.
  9. What change will tne coming King effect in His people?
       Verse 21, first part. Note 5.
10. By what power is God able to accomplish this wonderful
       change? Verse 21, last part.
11. Since Christ lived and walked in the body of our humility,
       how ought we continually to walk? 1 John 2: 6.
12..Though living in the flesh, how is it our high Privilege to
       walk? Rom. 8: 1.
                             Notes
    1. The word "perfect" is hardly to be understood in its
usual sense of complete, with nothing more to reach after.
This would be inconsistent with verses 13 and 14. Its force
is rather that of mature or adult in understanding in con-
trast with childhood, as it is used in passages like Eph.
4: 13, 14 and 1 Cor. 14: 20. Some of the Philippian church
had been "in the truth" for ten years, and repeatedly visited
and instructed by Paul and other workers. They ought to
be mature enough in the faith to eat strong meat, and to
press forward toward Christian perfection.
    2. Paul's literal language is: "And if ye are thinking
otherwise in any respect, God will reveal this also to you,"
that is, God will open up this advanced way of looking upon
the Christian's duty and privilege.
    3. The exact language again helps: "Become ye co-imita-
tors of me, and observe those walking as ye have us as a
type." It might seem questionable for the gospel worker to
point to himself as an example for imitation. It is safe to
do so only as he walks in such close communion with Christ
that he becomes a real "ensample to the flock." The illus-
tration of grace in a human life is often an aid to the un-
derstanding of those who have made less growth. Paul's
full thought on this point is expressed in his epistle to the
Corinthians, Become imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
1 Cor. 11: 1.
24           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. The literal word "citizenship" was very expressive to
the Philippians. Philippi was a Roman colony at that time.
Its people enjoyed the full rights of Roman citizenship, as
did also Paul and Silas, who brought them the gospel. They
might well be proud, as they were, of these rights, which as-
sured them protection and justice from the empire that ruled
the world. But in contrast to those "who mind earthly
things," Paul reminded the Philippians that their citizenship
was now in heaven. Their emperor is the King of the uni-
verse. In due time, He will come and escort His subjects to
the wedding feast that is to usher in His eternal kingdom
of glory.
    5. The word "vile," in its modern use, does not convey the
right meaning here. The body is not something to be de-
spised, for it was made in the image of God, and as a marvel-
ous piece of workmanship. We are rather to glorify God in
our body as well as in our spirit, for both are God's (1 Cor.
6: 15-20). Phil. 4: 21 reads literally, "Who shall change
the body of our humility like unto the body of His glory."
Before glory, comes humility; but in God's plan, just• as
surely, after humility, comes glory.

       Note 5.
11. What will be the reward to doers of the Word? Verse
       9, last part.
12. By whose help shall we be able to stand fast in the Lord?
       Jude 24.
                             Notes
    1. The word "crown" here is not the diadem, a symbol of
kingly authority, but a wreath of olive or laurel, as a symbol
of victory or honor, such as was placed upon the head of a
winner in athletic or musical or oratorical contests among the
Greeks. Thus Paul looked upon the fruits of his labor in the
gospel as his crown of honor and of joy.
    2. Evidently there were some differences between these
two members of the church, which Paul feared might, if
not reconciled, have a bad influence. Hence he entreats that
these differences be taken before the Lord and composed in
Him. How often we find a similar situation in the church
to-day! Certain members of the church are at variance, per-
haps over small affairs. They hardly speak when they meet,
and they cherish hard feelings toward each other. Yet they
go to the same service, worship the same God, and hope to
live in the same heaven. Let all differences be composed
in the Lord.
    3. "Careful" means full of care, anxiety, worry. "Prayer"
—worshipful communion. "Supplication"—petition for
things needed. "Thanksgiving"—giving of thanks for what
has been received and is being enjoyed. "Made known ,unto
God"—tell God how much you love and reverence Him, what
you need, how much you value what He has given you.
    4. "Peace"—how opposite to corking care, to worry!
"Passeth all understanding"—(literally) surpasses every
mind; the mind cannot fathom the peace of God, tell how
it comes or how it works, but can only experience it. "Keep
your hearts and minds"—garrison your hearts and thoughts•
as in a fort or castle; no enemy can break through the wall
of peace with which God encircles His praying children. In
very truth, they can stand fast in the Lord.

    5. The particular word "do" used here does not mean,
as often, make or construct something, but to put into prac-
tice. It is indeed the word from which we get our word
"practice." The study of these lessons will benefit us nothing
if we do not put into practice the many good things we are
learning in them.

14. Through Christ, what had Paul been able to do for the
     gospel in Rome? Phil. 1: 14. Note 4.
15. Where did the converts in Cmsar's household take up their
     work for Christ? Note 5.
16. With what prayer does Paul close his letter to the Philip-
     pians? Phil. 4: 23.
                            Notes
    1. This is not the kind of "care" warned against in verse
6. That was overanxiety, worry. This is thoughtfulness, in-
terest in Paul's welfare.
    2. This verse should not be interpreted too broadly. Paul
is talking here chiefly of his temporal needs. Closely ren-
dered, the verse reads, "I have learned, under whatever cir-
cumstances I am, to be satisfied with what I have." In mat-
ters of external circumstance and bodily need, Paul had
learned the lesson of indifference; but in matters of spiritual
and mental attainment, he was never satisfied, but always
reaching out for more.
    3. "Nowhere could there exist an atmosphere more un-
congenial to Christianity than in the Roman court. Nerc
seemed to have obliterated from his soul the last traces of
the divine, and even of the human, and to bear the impress of
Satan. His attendants and courtiers were in general of the
same character as himself—fierce, debased, and corrupt. To
all appearance it would be impossible for Christianity to gain
a foothold in the court and palace of Nero. •
    "Yet in this case, as in so many others, was proved the
truth of Paul's assertion that the weapons of his warfare
were 'mighty through God to the pulling down of strong-
holds.' Even in Nero's household, trophies of the cross were
won. From the vile attendants of a viler king were gained
converts who became sons of God. These were not Christians
secretly, but openly. They were not ashamed of their faith."
—"Acts of the Apostles," pages 462, 463.
    4. "Paul's patience and cheerfulness during his long and
unjust imprisonment, his courage and faith, were a continual
sermon. His spirit, so unlike the spirit of the world, bore
witness that a power higher than that of earth was abiding
with him. And by his example, Christians were impelled to
greater energy as advocates of the cause from the public
labors of which Paul had been withdrawn. In these ways
were the apostle's bonds influential, so that when his power
and usefulness seemed cut off, and to all appearance he
could do the least, then it was that he gathered sheaves for
Christ in fields from which he seemed wholly excluded.
28           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   "Before the close of that two years' imprisonment, Paul
was able to say, 'My bonds in Christ are manifest in all the
palace, and in all other places;' and among those who sent
greetings to the Philippians he mentions chiefly them 'that
are of Cxsar's household.' "-Id., page 464.
   5. "Not only were converts won to the truth in Caesar's
household, but after their conversion they remained in that
household. They did not feel at liberty to abandon their
post of duty because their surroundings were no longer con-
genial. The truth had found them there, and there they re-
mained, by their changed life and character testifying to the
transforming power of the new faith."-Id., page 466.

                     IT1HE handing out of tracts and
                        papers at the door to, the
                     caller, the agent, and the trades-
                     man, is becoming one of the ac-
                     cepted and effectual means of
                     giving "the third angel's mes-
                     sage." For this purpose, there
                     has been prepared a small rack
(9% x 141/2 in.) made of strong binder's board and
covered with a dark green cloth. It has compart-
ments for holding the two sizes of tracts, and one for
papers and magazines. This rack may be hung at
the side or on the back of the door, where it is always
ready to deliver its message of truth. The price is
50 cents postpaid.
          TRACT-CARRYING POCKET
  The carrying of tracts for distribution on street cars or trains,
and in other public places, has been popularized by the "King's
Pocket League," and is b”inging good results. Because the tracts
are likely to become soiled if carried loose, there has been pro-
vided a small cloth pocket, which holds ten or twelve tracts.
Price 10c postpaid.

                  TRACT PACKAGES
  One of the best forms in which to purchase tracts for general
individual distribution is the assorted tract package, in either the
