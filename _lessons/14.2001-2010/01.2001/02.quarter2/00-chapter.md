    Beatrice S. Neall, Ph.D., received
her education from La Sierra Col-
lege and Andrews University. Af-
ter marrying Ralph Neall in 1949,
she served as a pastor's wife in the
New York Conference. Called to
mission service in 1957, the couple
spent 17 years in Cambodia, Viet-
nam, and Singapore. During these
years, Dr. Neall wrote, for non-
Christians, books and Bible courses
that have been widely used in Asia
and Africa. She taught theology
at Southeast Asia Union College
and recently retired from 17 years as professor of religion at Union
College in Lincoln, Nebraska.
    Through the years, Dr. Neall has contributed articles to such Adventist
publications as The Adventist Review and Ministry. She also has
served on numerous General Conference Committees including the
Sanctuary Review Committee ("Glacier View"), the Daniel and Rev-
elation Committee, and the Christian View of Human Life Committee.
    Since retirement, the Nealls have returned three times to Cambodia
to teach the pastors and lay-workers there. To help that country learn
the ways of peace, Dr. Neall has written a book, Building a Better
Cambodia, which is impacting the thought leaders of the nation.

    Great Prayers and
   Pray-ers of the Bible
   The lessons this quarter lead us into sacred places where Jesus and
great saints wrestled with God in prayer. Over half of these prayers
sprang out of the dark emotions of discouragement, fear, and re-
morse; for it is in distress that humans most often seek God. Other
prayers are bright with triumph, joy, and praise. All grew out of
spiritual conflict with the forces of evil.
   The pray-ers in these lessons represent a variety of people—the
God-man Jesus, ordinary men and women, statesmen and kings,
prophets and apostles, angels and redeemed. From them we learn of
the circumstances that generate prayer—rejection, abuse, guilt, bur-
den for souls, or joy and thanksgiving. From them we learn of the
kinds of prayer that move the heart of God—complaints, pleadings,
or praise—and how He responds to them. From them we learn of the
need for patience and perseverance as we wait for God to work out
His purposes.
    Jesus is our finest example of how a human being in a world of
evil can grasp the mighty power of God through prayer and prevail.
Three lessons are devoted to Him. After an introductory lesson
based on Jesus' prayers and prayer habits, the lessons continue in
chronological order from the oldest book of the Bible (Job) to the
triumphant conclusion portrayed in the latest (Revelation).
    Prayer can lift you from the depths of darkness to the radiance of
the heavenly land, from your dismal circumstances to the throne-
room of God. You will benefit most from these lessons if you try to
put yourself in the place of the Bible characters. Then try to reach
out to God and experience His blessings as they did.




                                                                     5

    The Model Pray-er and the
      Model Prayer: Christ


Sabbath Afternoon
HAVE YOU EVER EAVESDROPPED ON A PRIVATE CONVER-
SATION? In our lessons this quarter we will listen to urgent messages
from the battle lines to God in His heavenly headquarters as great saints
of the Bible struggle with the forces of evil. Jesus, the greatest prayer
warrior of all, shows us when to pray, how to pray, and for what to pray.
In a hostile world, separated from the glory of heaven and the adoration of
angels, He endured loneliness and torture of soul. His source of strength,
however, was His communication with Headquarters.
   What is prayer? It is "the breath of the soul" (Gospel Workers,
p. 254), "the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse,
where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence," and "the
opening of the heart to God as to a Friend."—Steps to Christ, pp. 93-95.
"Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God as we would
talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us personally. Often
there will come to us a sweet joyful sense of the presence of Jesus. Often
our hearts will burn within us as He draws nigh to commune with us as
He did with Enoch."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 129. As you study this
week, ask yourself what prayer has done for you.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Jesus' Prayer Life (Luke 3:21, 22).
 11. "I Have Prayed For You, Peter" (Luke 22:31, 32, 40-46;
     23:34).
I11. "Teach Us to Pray" (Luke 11:1-4).
IV. "Give Us This Day" (Matt. 6:11-13).
 V. Jesus' Principles of Prayer (Luke 11:5-13; 18:1-14).

MEMORY TEXT: " 'So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to
you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to
you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to
him who knocks, the door will be opened' " (Luke 11:9, 10, NIV).

JESUS' PRAYER LIFE (Luke 3:21, 22).

  Luke 3:21, 22, says that Jesus prayed at the beginning of His
public ministry. What do you think He included in that prayer?
What response did He receive?


   The Gospels portray Jesus as praying through each stage of His
journey to the cross. Today and tomorrow, we will travel with Him
through each of these stages to see how prayer encouraged Him and
to learn how it can do the same for us.

  What do the following texts teach us about Jesus' prayer life
and prayer in general?

       Text             Jesus' Prayer Life      Prayer in General

  Luke 5:15, 16;
  Mark 1:35

  Luke 9:18

   Luke 9:28-31

  John 17:1-26


   The longest of Jesus' recorded prayers, His prayer in John 17, ends
the instruction He gave to His disciples in the upper room and
Gethsemane. Some have said it is the most profound chapter in the
Bible. (See The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1051:1, "These
words spake Jesus.")
   "In the opening of his prayer (vs. 1) and three times later (vss. 5,
21, 24) Christ calls God Father....
   "And that name gives the atmosphere to the whole prayer. Listen-
ing, we learn how natural prayer is, how simply we can turn to God,
sure of his interest in us and his loving kindness toward us; in the
happy assurance that he will certainly do for us all that even God can
do, and that gladly and willingly. Christ spoke to God with open face,
as a man to his friend, as a child to its father, reverently and hum-
bly."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 742. (We will study this
prayer in depth in lesson 11.)

   Listen to Jesus as He arises early to pray. Notice the close-
 ness of His relationship with the Father. How do His prayers
 encourage you to talk with the Father as to a close friend?

                                                                      7

"I HAVE PRAYED FOR YOU, PETER" (Luke 22:31, 32, 40-46;
23:34).

   It is now Thursday evening, only hours before Jesus' arrest and trial.
Jesus is eating the Passover meal with His disciples. He warns them that
one is about to betray Him and all would forsake Him (Luke 22:14-62;
see also The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 866:14, "The hour").

    What special message did Jesus have for Peter? Luke 22:31, 32.


   "How true was the Saviour's friendship for Peter! how compas-
sionate His warning! But the warning was resented. In self-
sufficiency Peter declared confidently that he would never do what
Christ had warned him against. . . . His self-confidence proved his
ruin. He tempted Satan to tempt him, and he fell under the arts of the
wily foe."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 5, p. 1123:31-34, "Peter Tempted the Devil."
   Considering the force of the original Greek, we could say that
Satan demands to have every one of us. He lost heaven and eternal
life to gain this world, and he struggles to charm each of us and
fasten us in his grip. Jesus, however, disputes his claim. He won the
right to save every soul (John 1:29; Rom. 5:18). Earnestly He prayed
for Peter (Luke 22:31, 32). These prayers gave Peter courage to face
the darkest moment of his life.
   We travel on to witness Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Read Luke 22:39-44. Once again, despite great anguish, we hear Him
calling God His Father, indicating that, even though on the rest of His
journey He must travel through great tumult, He still trusts in the
divine plan.
   Jesus' prayer in Luke 22 points out the risk we sometimes take
when we pray. If we really are sincere when we pray, " 'Yet not my
will, but yours be done"' (vs. 42, NIV), we must be ready to drink the
cup He places in our hands, even if it is bitter. Remember, however,
that just as God sent an angel "not to take the cup from Christ's hand,
but to strengthen Him to drink it," so He will empower us. (See The
Desire of Ages, p. 693; for further study, read p. 694.)
   Jesus' prayer life followed a pattern we all can follow. He met
every crisis in advance through prayer. Before stepping forth to meet
His enemies or to meet an unfair trial, humiliation, torture, and
death, He fought the battle in prayer. He then was able to stride forth
calmly as a Victor to meet His foes.

     Why can we say that Jesus' prayer in Luke 23:34 expresses
 the sum and substance of Christianity?

"TEACH US TO PRAY" (Luke 11:1-4).

   Jesus' disciples were deeply moved as they watched Him intercede
with God before ministering to the multitudes each day. They longed
to have the same kind of relationship with God as He did. So they
requested, "Lord, teach us to pray." Jesus responded with "the Lord's
Prayer." Read Luke 11:2-4.

  Listed below are phrases from this prayer. What relationship
between ourselves and God does each of these phrases illustrate?
The first one is done for you. (From John F. MacArthur, The
MacArthur New Testament Commentary: Matthew 1-7 [Winona
Lake: Indiana, BMH Books, 1985], p. 374).

  "Our Father": the father/child relationship

   "Hallowed be thy name":

   "Thy kingdom come":

   "Thy will be done":

   "Give us ... our daily bread":

   "Forgive us our sins":

   The Lord's Prayer has two sections, the first dealing with God's
glory, the second with human needs. Each section has three parts.
The first three parts are petitions in behalf of God's name, His king-
dom, and His will. The second three parts are petitions for food, for-
giveness, and protection. (See MacArthur, p. 373).
   "Hallowed be thy name." Though we can be as familiar with God
as a child to a parent, we must also bow in reverence before His
awesome majesty. Those closest to the throne in heaven fall down on
their faces before Him (Rev. 19:4).
   "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on
earth." We should long to see the reign of evil come to an end when
Jesus will be King of kings and Lord of lords and take up His great
power to reign (Rev. 11:15-17). "Thy will be done" means first that
God's will becomes ours, and second, that our tortured world will
become subject to His will.

   Why do you think the first part of the Lord's Prayer deals
 with God's glory? Is affirming His power as we begin to pray a
 way of strengthening faith in His ability to answer our needs?

                                                                     9
Wednesday                                              January 3
"GIVE US THIS DAY" (Matt. 6:11-13).

 The second half of Jesus' model prayer centers on our needs.
What does "our daily bread" mean? (Matt. 6:11).


   Such a request is fitting for much of the world where the task of
providing food for a hungry family is a constant struggle. Our Father
hears such cries for help. More prosperous Christians can help to
answer those prayers.
   "Daily bread" includes all our human needs, especially a daily
supply of spiritual bread for the soul (John 6:35).

  What is another request we are to make of the Lord while we
pray? Matt. 6:12; Luke 11:4.


   This request is based on the tradition of forgiving debts during the
sabbatical year (Deut. 15:1, 2). The sabbatical year of release is a type
of the "acceptable year of the Lord" (Luke 4:18, 19, NKJV), when
Jesus by His grace releases us from our debts by granting pardon for
our sins. Those who have been crushed by overwhelming debt know
the joy of release. We should experience the same relief and gratitude
when Jesus forgives our sins.
   In Matthew 18:23-35, Jesus declared that it is a criminal offense to
withhold forgiveness from a fellow human being. Unwillingness to
forgive—resentment, hatred, a vengeful attitude—poisons the one
who harbors it, embittering the springs of life and producing mental
and physical disease. For our own sake, as well as the wrongdoer's,
we should forgive.
   Puritan writer, Thomas Manton, said, "There is none so tender to
others as they which have received mercy themselves, for they know
how gently God hath dealt with them."—MacArthur, p. 395.
   "He who sincerely seeks and entreats forgiveness of sins, longs
to be able to sin no more. So he prays, conscious of his own
weakness, that God may guide his life away from circumstances in
which he is exposed to evil temptations."—Norval Geldenhuys,
Commentary on the Gospel of Luke (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans,
1951), p. 321.

    Most of us have heard or repeated the Lord's Prayer so many
 times we hardly consider what it means. To help solve this
 problem, write your own prayer, based on the parts of Jesus'
 model prayer that Tuesday's lesson mentions. After you have
 written and prayed your prayer, repeat the Lord's Prayer.

JESUS' PRINCIPLES OF PRAYER (Luke 11:5-13; 18:1-14).

   Through His parables, Jesus taught many of the principles of
effective prayer. What principles can you gather from the follow-
ing parables?



        The Parables                        The Principles


        Luke 11:5-13


        Luke 18:1-8


        Luke 18:9-14



   Luke 11:9. The Greek emphasizes persistence in prayer. "Keep on
asking," "keep on seeking," "keep on knocking," and your divine
Neighbor will open the door and give you what you need.
   •How is God pleased when we ask Him to help others?
   •Why is persistence necessary in prayer? How would it affect us
personally if God gave us everything we asked for, without struggle
on our part?
   •Do some prayers take time for God to answer because He has to
overcome human resistance? Does it ever take time for God to ar-
range circumstances in our favor?
   •Is God really like the reluctant neighbor? Or do we sometimes
perceive Him as a reluctant neighbor?
   "Men may sometimes think of God as One who would prefer not to
have people trouble Him, but His true character as a solicitous,
loving, and generous Father is clearly set forth in vs. 9-13. The
reluctance of the friend to arise and supply that which was needed in
no way represents God. . . . Here, the lesson of the parable is not one
of comparison but of contrast."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 789:7, "Trouble me not."

   What do you say to someone who argues this way: "Why does
 God need to hear us pray over and over? If He knows what we
 need and intends that we have it—why doesn't He just give it to
 us?"

                                                                    11
Friday                                                January 5
FURTHER STUDY: On a separate sheet of paper, list the principles
of prayer that you have learned from this week's lesson. Provide a text
for each principle. The following questions can help you organize
your list.
   •What prayer habits should we develop?
   •On what occasions should we pray?
   •For what should we pray?
   •What attitude should we have toward God when we pray?
   •What attitude should we have toward our fellow humans?
   •How does prayer help us to have closer fellowship with God?
   Read either "Come Rest Awhile" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 359-
363 or "The Privilege of Prayer" in Steps to Christ, pp. 93-104.

   "Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weaknesses, in
that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father
fresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth braced for duty
and trial. . . . He found comfort and joy in communion with His
Father. And if the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of
prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the neces-
sity of fervent, constant prayer."—Steps to Christ, pp. 93, 94.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. On many occasions, Jesus warned His disciples of His death
     and prayed that they would not fail in the hour of trial.
     Should we be as concerned about our readiness to face
     coming trials, hardships, and tragedies? Explain. What is
     the best way to prepare?

     2. Were Jesus' prayers for His disciples answered, or did they
        all fail the test? Explain your answer. What about His
        prayers for Judas? Will our prayers for the salvation of
        souls always be effective?

     3. It is hard to be persistent in prayer when the answers
        appear delayed. How can one remain persistent?

SUMMARY: Prayer is the power line between earth and heaven,
linking us to the mind and might of God and allowing us to converse
with Him as with a friend. Through a constant connection with Him,
we can face trials, overcome temptation, and share the blessings of
heaven with others.

                   The God Who Sends Rain
                         J. H. Zachary
       INDIA—The Meitei people, who live in the hills of northern
   India, are still largely unreached with the gospel.
       Ranjit Singh and his wife worked for several days to plant 2,500
   cabbage plants in their garden. But as they worked, they noticed
   that some of the cabbage plants were beginning to wither. The
   ground was dry, and there was no sign of rain. Without rain there
   would be no harvest, and the family would face a difficult year.
       The Singhs had lost faith in the gods they had called upon
   throughout their lives, but they did not know where to turn for
   help. Which of Hinduism's 300,000 gods would answer their
   prayers for rain to make their cabbages grow?
       Then Mr. Singh recalled hearing someone say that the God of
   the Christians was all-powerful. He talked it over with his wife,
   and they decided to pray to this unseen God for rain. "If the God
   of the Christians hears our prayer and answers, then we will know
   that He is the true God," Mr. Singh told his wife. For the first time
   in their lives the couple poured out their hearts to God for help.
       That night it rained. The next day, the couple stood in amaze-
   ment when they realized that the rain had fallen only on their
   cabbage patch and nowhere else in the village. Mr. Singh did not
   hesitate; he set out to learn how he could become a follower of
   this powerful God who had answered their prayer. But his wife
   hesitated.
       Mr. Singh found a Protestant pastor and asked him how he
   could become a Christian. The pastor baptized him that day, and
   Mr. Singh went home happy. But he did not know what it meant to
   be a Christian. What should a follower of God be doing? How
   should he worship? What did God expect of him?
       Some time later Mr. Singh met an Adventist pastor and asked
   him, "What does it mean to be a Christian?" Through a series of
    Bible studies, the pastor showed the couple what it meant to
    follow Christ. Both Mr. and Mrs. Singh were baptized.
       The miraculous rainfall did not go unnoticed by others in their
   village. Many were deeply impressed and have shown a willingness
    to learn more about the God who can control the wind and the rain.
        Pray for the Meitei people as they seek God.

     Prayers of Despair: Job




Sabbath Afternoon
DARK TIMES CAN SHADOW LIFE with the appearance that God
has forsaken us. "Where is God?" C. S. Lewis asked after his wife
died of cancer. "Go to Him when your need is desperate, when all
other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your
face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After
that, silence. You may as well turn away. The longer you wait, the
more emphatic the silence will become. There are no lights in the
windows. It might be an empty house. Was it ever inhabited? It
seemed so once."—A Grief Observed (New York: Bantam Books,
1980), pp. 4, 5.
    During Job's dark night of the soul he cried, "If only I knew
where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling! I would state my
case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. I would find out
what he would answer me, and consider what he would say" (Job
23:3-5, NIV). No answer came, however.
   How does a person pray when circumstances are so bleak that it
seems as though no way out exists and God no longer hears? This
week's lesson looks for answers in the story and prayers of Job.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Crisis! (Job 1; 2).
 11. Job's Bitter Complaints to God (Job 7:7-21; 10).
HI. Job's Cry for Justice (Job 9:32-35).
IV. Glimmers of Hope (Job 13:15, 16; 14:7-17; see also 19:25-27;
     23:10).
 V. Breakthrough! (Job 38:1; Heb. 11:6).

MEMORY TEXT: "But he knows the way that I take; when he
has tested me, I will come forth as gold" (Job 23:10, NIV).

*(Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, January 13.)

CRISIS! (Job 1; 2).
   Job was a desert chieftain, and several clues in the book of Job
suggest that he probably lived during the time of the patriarchs:
(1) his great age (Job 42:16) before average human life span was
shortened to "threescore years and ten" (Ps. 90:10), or seventy years;
(2) Job served as the head of the family, offering sacrifices instead of
defering this task to temple priests (Job 1:5); (3) there was no written
Scripture, only oral transmission; and (4) there was lack of reference
to the great events of Israelite history such as the Exodus and the
conquest of the Promised Land.

  What kind of test was Job subjected to without his knowl-
edge? What was the issue in the contest? Job 1:6-12. What hap-
pened to Job's life when God removed His protective hedge?
1:13-19; 2:7. What common belief did Job's friends hold about
suffering? 4:7, 8.

   People suffer for many reasons. Much misery comes from our own
poor choices, though the cause of some misery isn't our own fault.
Even God's forgiveness doesn't necessarily interrupt the chain of
consequences that follow as a result of the poor choices we make.
People also suffer indiscriminately from the violence of Satan, the
elements, and human nature. "Job and his friends were steeped in a
tradition that claimed that suffering was always punishment for spe-
cific sin [4:7, 8]. Job was not aware of such sin, and was faced with the
predicament of finding an explanation for his misfortune."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 494:4, "Theme."
    Read Job 1:20, 21. These verses record Job's reaction to his first
round of suffering. As Job realized, affliction and loss can deepen our
own gratitude to God. Appreciation for the simple blessings may be
enriched by the loss of what we often take for granted—ordinary
things, such as a cup of water, as British author Somerset Maugham
learned. Maugham displayed a cracked clay cup on his mantle, along
with far more elaborate objects. When asked about this one misfit,
Maugham told how during World War I, on a troop ship crossing the
ocean, the crew received one cup of water a day. He drank his ration
from that cup and kept it in sight throughout his life to remind himself
never to take blessings for granted. After Job's first test, he worshiped
and prayed to God in a similar spirit of gratitude.

     Even when we suffer, we all have our own personal "cups"
 filled with blessings. Whatever you might be suffering now, can
 you think of things for which you should be thankful? If you
 know someone who's hurting, tactfully try to point him or her
 to the blessings currently enjoyed.
                                                               15

JOB'S BITTER COMPLAINTS TO GOD (Job 7:7-21; 10).

  Prolonged suffering profoundly affects the sufferer. How did
Job's prayers change after he had been suffering for a long
period of time? Job 3:20, 21; 6:8, 9; 7:16.

   Preservation of life is one of the strongest human instincts. Job's
desire to die shows his desperation. Yet he never thought of taking his
own life; instead, he begged God to take it from him.

  Job 10 is another of Job's prayers uttered in pain. Use the
chart below to study this prayer.


             Question                            Answer

     What was Job's plea
     to God? Vs. 2.

     How did he feel about what
     was happening to him? Vs. 1.

     In your own words, what
     question did Job keep
     asking God? Vss. 8, 9, 18.

     What was Job's final request
     in this prayer? Vss. 20, 21.


   "The patriarch continues his argument against God—but why
does he? It's as if he cannot give up on the Lord. Do we usually keep
on arguing with someone who we expect will never respond to us?
Most of us will either retreat into silence or aggressively break the
relationship. But Job hangs on—he won't let go of his Creator. . . .
The loss of God overwhelms him far more than the destruction of his
wealth or even the death of his children and servants."—Gerald
Wheeler, God of the Whirlwind (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Her-
ald Publishing Association, 1992), p. 69.

    Have you ever felt that life was not worth living? At times
 like this, faith can be so crucial. How were you able to cope?
 Have you learned things from your experience that you could
 share with someone going through a crisis?

JOB'S CRY FOR JUSTICE (Job 9:32-35).

    As a tribal chief, Job is accustomed to court proceedings. Yet, he
who had defended the oppressed (Job 31:21, 22) now longs for a
hearing for himself (13:3, 22, 23; 23:3-5). He agrees with his friends
that righteousness should be rewarded and evil punished. His com-
plaint is that God has violated the rules (9:22-24). Therefore, he
prepares a legal brief with his signature on it, defending the upright-
ness of his life (chap. 31; see especially vs. 35). However, he fears that
he would be defeated in a confrontation with God and that God would
not answer his questions but simply overwhelm him with a show of
power (chap. 9:14-20; compare 40:1-9).

   What kind of legal help did Job long for? Job 9:32-35.

   The "daysman" or "umpire." "In his argument with God, Job
feels that there is no one to whom he can look to as an arbiter. On one
of two conditions only, he thinks, could the contest be more even
between himself and God: (1) If God, divesting Himself of all His
divine attributes, became man, and (2) if some umpire, or arbiter,
could be found to decide the contest. Neither condition, however, did
Job think possible. The gospel provides a fulfillment of both condi-
tions. 'The I AM is the Daysman between God and humanity, laying
His hand upon both' (DA 25). Not that we need to conceive of Jesus
as settling an argument between man and God, but He is the One who
represents God to man, the One through whom man can understand
and approach God. See Heb. 2:17, 18."—The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 525:33, "Daysman."

 Job asked, "How can a mortal be righteous before God?" (9:2, NIV).
What is our only claim to acceptance with God? Rom. 3:23, 24.


   Job was righteous (chap. 31), and God does reward deeds of mercy
like Job's—if not now, then in the hereafter. (See Matt. 25:34-40 and
Job 42:12-17.) Job's faith in his own good works, however, did not
bring him acceptance with God. We all must bow before God as a
sinner, claiming the Sacrifice for sin and pleading only the merits of
His blood.

     How can you help someone who feels too sinful for God to hear his
 or her prayers? How would an understanding of Christ's imputed
 righteousness help such a person grasp the truth that God's acceptance
 is because of Christ, not because of anything good in ourselves?

                                                                        17

GLIMMERS OF HOPE (Job 13:15, 16; 14:7-17; see also 19:25-
27; 23:10).

   Silence is one of the cruelest treatments a person can inflict on a
friend. It is easily interpreted as hostility. God's silence caused Job's
gloom. He kept talking to God, demanding a hearing. God, however,
did not answer (13:22, 24; 30:20). Yet, in the darkness of Job's forsaken
state, shafts of light, each one more intense, pierced through. These
gave rise to sublime expressions of faith.

   Through the ages, Job's declarations of hope have brightened
the pathway of Christians everywhere. Summarize these declara-
tions of hope below.

     Job 13:15,16



     Job 14:7-17



     Job 19:25-27



     Job 23:10



    Job 23:10 "is one of the key verses of the book. Although Job could
not seem to find God, he believed that God was aware of his ways and
purposeful in His dealings with him. Job was beginning to understand
that he was being tried. He still did not know of Satan's challenge
regarding him. One of the rungs of the ladder by which Job climbed
from despair to faith was the recognition on his part that he was not
being punished or unjustly treated, but rather was being tested that he
might emerge as pure gold from a furnace."—The SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 3, p. 561:10, "Come forth." His conversations with God began
to show this change.

  When we endure suffering and the prospect of death, what
an advantage we have knowing that Christ will resurrect us!
How can this advantage affect the tone of your prayers when
you communicate with God during trials?

Thursday                                            January 11
BREAKTHROUGH! (Job 38:1; Heb. 11:6).

  The greatest sorrow Job expressed was not the loss of his
property or family but the loss of a sense of God's presence.
Where did Job finally find Him? Job 38:1.

    In the midst of Elihu's final speech, a great whirlwind approached
(chap. 37) and God spoke to Job out of that storm. "Then the Lord
answered Job out of the whirlwind" (Job 38:1). Through the storms of
life we struggle, and in the storms we find God.
    In Job 38 God does not desire "to settle an argument, but to reveal
Himself. Neither does He explain the reason for Job's suffering. A
clear understanding of God is superior in importance to an unfolding
of all the reasons for divine providence. God does not explain why the
wicked prosper or why the righteous suffer. He says nothing about the
future world, or future compensation for present inequalities. God
simply reveals Himself—His goodness, His power, His wisdom—and
He intends that this revelation shall answer Job's problems."—The
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 598:1, "Answered Job."
    God never explains to Job the cause of his suffering. Why? Per-
haps because in this life we often have to trust God without knowing
why we suffer. Job, however, seems to be satisfied just to see God
(42:5, 6), to make contact with Him again.
    Today many "thieves" try to rob us of our intimacy with God.
Often we allow guilt, grief, and pain to come between us and Him,
but doubt is the cruelest weapon against faith. After studying contem-
porary science and theology, many Christians cry out, "They have
taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him"!
(John 20:13). Losing sight of God undermines the very basis of life.

  What attitude is necessary in order to make contact with God?
Heb. 11:6. How does one get this attitude? Rom. 10:17.


   Believers today never need to experience the silence of God,
because He speaks to us through His Word. We can store in our hearts
promises that bring God near, especially in times of crisis. We can
also sing our way out of darkness through the great hymns of faith.
These hymns become some of the greatest prayers ever uttered.

   What promises and hymns have you stockpiled in your
 arsenal of faith to equip you for the conflicts of life? What do
 you do when, in certain times, even these promises feel empty?
 How can we learn to move beyond feelings to trust in God?

                                                                    19
Friday                                                January 12
FURTHER STUDY: We read about the circumstances surrounding
Job's last recorded prayer in Job 42:7-10. What does this prayer teach
us about grace and forgiveness?
   Read Education, pp. 154-156, and Prophets and Kings, pp. 162-
165.

   "Let us strive to walk in the light as Christ is in the light. The Lord
turned the captivity of Job when he prayed, not only for himself, but
for those who were opposing him. When he felt earnestly desirous
that the souls that had trespassed against him might be helped, he
himself received help. Let us pray, not only for ourselves, but for
those who have hurt us, and are continuing to hurt us. Pray, pray,
especially in your mind. Give not the Lord rest; for His ears are open
to hear sincere, importunate prayers, when the soul is humbled before
Him."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 1141:10, "Pray for Those Who Hurt Us."

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why did God have Job pray for his three friends?

     2. Job's friends accused him of being guilty of sin when Job
        knew he wasn't guilty, at least, of anything worthy of his
        suffering. If you had been Job, how would you have felt
        about having to pray for friends such as these?

     3. Just because Job's situation remarkably improved after he
        prayed for his friends, can we always assume that interces-
        sory prayer will guarantee material success? Explain.

     4. Consider the principles about prayer that last week's les-
        son discussed. How do Job's prayers fit these principles?
        What other principles regarding prayer does this week's
        lesson teach us?

SUMMARY: Through the long dark night of the soul, God is with
us, though we may not be able to sense His presence. During such
times, we need to cling to Him in prayer and through faith in the
promises of His Word.

               Through Sickness and Fire
                       Charlotte Ishkanian
   GHANA—When Mavis Akomeah's [ah-koh-MEH-ah] father
lost his job, the family was forced to return to their village to
farm. But Mavis and her younger brother stayed with an uncle in
town, so they could continue their studies.
   Mavis became sick with a high fever and a serious cough. But
there was no money for a doctor or medicine. The cough often
kept her awake at night and left her too weak to attend school. As
her illness dragged on, Mavis worried that she would not be able
to prepare for her upcoming school exams.
   Her classmates and pastor came to visit and pray with her.
Mavis was surprised at this outpouring of love, for her own
family had grown somewhat cold spiritually. The visits showed
Mavis that God cared for her, a lonely, sick teenage girl.
   Mavis returned to school just before her exams. Though still
weak, she forced herself to study long hours to catch up. One night
the power went out, and she lighted a candle so she could continue
studying. But weak and weary, she fell asleep. Suddenly she awoke
and found the table in flames and the room filled with smoke.
   Mavis and her brother jumped through the flames to safety.
Their shouts brought help, and the fire was soon out, but the room
and its contents were destroyed, including Mavis's study notes.
   When her friends learned what had happened, they shared their
notes with Mavis so she could prepare for her exams. With much
prayer and support from her friends, Mavis passed her exams.
   The pastor continued to visit Mavis and her brother, and they
began Bible studies. Their mother came to visit and joined their
study group, then later their father joined them. Mavis asked to be
baptized, and her parents, who had not taken their faith seriously
                          before, decided to be rebaptized.
                              Mavis thanks God for making His love
                           real to her through her uncle, her caring
                           friends, and their concerned pastor, who
                           visited and prayed with her when she
                           needed it most. It made an eternal dif-

     A Prayer of Supplication:
              Moses

Sabbath Afternoon
HINDSIGHT IS SO ANNOYINGLY CLEAR! Reviewing one's
past can be discouraging, as in the case of a missionary couple who
regretted that their years of service had been so unfruitful. The build-
ings they had built were later destroyed. They wished instead that they
had invested more energy into building people. If only we had been
more loving and made more friends! they thought.
   Rearing children also can be a challenge. Wouldn't it be great if
children came with an instruction manual? "If only the first child
didn't count!" one father remarked.
   "If only" is a common lament. "If only I had known his character
before I married him!" "If only I had told her I loved her!" "If only I
hadn't gone into debt!" "If only I hadn't messed up my life!" "If only
I had answered God's call when it came!"
   Moses, to whom the authorship of Psalm 90 is widely attributed,
seems to be playing the "if only" where he writes, "The length of our
days is seventy years—or eighty, if we have the strength; yet their
span is but trouble and sorrow, for they quickly pass, and we fly
away" (vs. 10, NIV).
   Learn how he "wins" the game in this week's lesson.

OVERVIEW OF PSALM 90 (Ps. 90:1, 7-10, 12-17).

   Most Bible scholars believe that Moses wrote Psalm 90, and many
translations preface it with the superscription: A prayer of Moses, the
man of God (compare Deut. 34:10). This would make Psalm 90 the
oldest of all the psalms.

   Psalm 90 consists of three parts. Read it through and identify
the verses that go with each of these parts:

   The infinite God:


   Finite humans:


   A plea for redemption:


   "The 90th psalm . . . reflects [Moses'] thoughts, perhaps toward the
close of his sojourn in Midian [Exod. 2:11-3:3]. If so, the following
interpretation seems appropriate: The opening verses of this psalm seem
to mirror the mountain solitudes of Sinai and the majesty of God, in
contrast with human frailty in general and the great mistakes of his own
life (vss. 7, 8). Knowing the role Providence had marked out for him
(Acts 7:25), Moses doubtless reflected that his impetuous act in slaying
the Egyptian had frustrated God's purpose and thwarted the divine plan
for his life. He had already passed the mark of 'threescore years and ten'
and was approaching 'fourscore years' (Ps. 90:9, 10), but with his great
disappointment in mind he prayed that God would teach him to 'number'
his days that he might apply his heart unto wisdom (vs. 12). He still had
faith in the promises of God to the fathers and hoped for their fulfillment.
His thoughts then turned to his suffering brethren in the land of Egypt
(vss. 13, 14) and he prayed for their deliverance (vss. 15, 16). Finally,
he pleads with God that the work of his own hands may be established,
that his life may not have been altogether in vain (vs. 17)."
 —SDA Bible Dictionary (1979 edition), "Moses," p. 763.

    Considering the tone of this prayer, take some time to exam-
 ine your priorities (see vs. 12). Have you been expending energy
 on things that don't really matter? What are you doing now that
 in a few years, looking back, you might regret? What can you
 say to someone who, looking regretfully over his or her past, is
 in need of encouragement?

                                                                         23
Monday                                              January 15
HEADED HOME (Ps. 90:1-9).

   In his prayer, Moses says that the Lord has been his eternal
refuge (vs. 1). Provide specific incidents in Moses' life that illus-
trate this truth.


   As author of the book of Genesis, Moses had done a lot of reflect-
ing on the "generations" of patriarchs since the time of creation
(Gen. 5; 10; etc.); he saw that their dwelling place was in God. Like a
mansion in which generations of family have been born, lived, and
died, so God is home to His people (Ps. 90:1). In Psalm 90, Moses
turns his feet toward home. There is nowhere else to go.
   The parable of the loving father generously illustrates the welcome
we will receive (Luke 15:11-20). " Tut while he was still a long way
off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he
ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him' " (vs. 20,
NIV).

  How does Moses contrast the eternity of God with the short-
ness of human life in Psalm 90?

     God's life span (vss. 2, 4)

     Human life span (vss. 3, 10)

   How do such insights enhance our understanding of God's
plan for our lives?


   As Moses contemplated the "everlasting hills" (see Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 251) that surrounded him in Midian, he must have been
awestruck to realize that God is more ancient still—from eternity in
the past to eternity in the future. His awe at the immensity of God's
existence was matched likewise by his impression of human life. God,
for whom time is nothing, sternly orders humans to return to dust
(vss. 3, 4) in fulfillment of the dread sentence upon Adam—"Dust you
are and to dust you will return" (Gen. 3:19, NIV).

   Though our lives are incomparably short in contrast to the
eternity of God, the Lord had, through Christ, "stepped into"
human time, when He lived as man. In other words, the Lord,
the one who created time, for 33 years became subject to time,
just as we are. How does that concept help us understand God's
love for us?

LIVING UNDER GOD'S WRATH (Ps. 90:7-14).

   Moses experienced drastic changes in his life. Heir to the throne
of Egypt, he suddenly found himself a wandering shepherd in the
desert. His brilliant education in science and the military arts seemed
wasted. His life mission had been thwarted. Moses could think of
only one explanation. God was angry with him (vss. 7, 9, 11). Year
after year passed with no change in his status or Israel's condition.
Prolonged trial has profound effects on the believer. Sometimes we
think God does not care. Fortunately, that conclusion is incorrect.
God does care.

  Where did Moses think God had put his sins? What secret sin
oppressed his conscience? Ps. 90:8; Exod. 2:12.


   The memory of this sin most likely had haunted his lonely exile in
Midian. That one error in judgment, when he thought he was to deliver
Israel in his own power, "apparently" had aborted his whole career
and shunted him into obscurity.

  Next, Moses supplicates God for a number of remarkable things.
List two of these below.

   Ps. 90:13

   Ps. 90:14

   Why is it so remarkable that Moses asks God for such blessings?


   Moses "prays that after a night of sorrow and suffering, God will
give a morning of joy and peace (see Ps. 143:8)."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 3, p. 842:14, "Early." "Let the morning bring me
word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you. Show me
the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul" (Ps. 143:8, NIV).

    Instead of God's anger, Moses wanted the assurance of His
 love. In place of terror, he wanted joy. In place of disapproval,
 he longed for God's favor. Though we all long for these things—
 how crucial it is to remember to go by faith and not by feelings
 alone, which sometimes can be influenced by things as simple as
 diet. What do you say to someone who has repented of his or her
 sins and yet still feels separated, alienated from God? How can
 you help this person to look beyond emotions?

                                                                     25
Wednesday                                            January 17
MIDIAN REMEMBERED (Ps. 90:16).

   Had Moses' life been a failure? Were the 40 years in Midian a
waste? Had he been living under God's wrath? (See the SDA Bible
Dictionary, [1979 edition], p. 763, "Moses.")
   The long years of exile were, in fact, an important chapter in
Moses' life. "Shut in by the bulwarks of the mountains, Moses was
alone with God. . . . In the solemn grandeur of the everlasting hills he
beheld the majesty of the Most High, and in contrast realized how
powerless and insignificant were the gods of Egypt. . . .
   "As the years rolled on, and he wandered with his flocks in the
solitary places, pondering upon the oppressed condition of his people,
he recounted the dealings of God with his fathers and the promises that
were the heritage of the chosen nation, and his prayers for Israel
ascended by day and by night. Heavenly angels shed their light around
him. Here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he wrote the book of
Genesis. The long years spent amid the desert solitudes were rich in
blessing, not alone to Moses and his people, but to the world in all
succeeding ages."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 248, 251.
   The many years Moses spent in the wilderness gave him time to write.
His writings—the books of Genesis to Deuteronomy—are among the
greatest masterpieces in literature. It is possible that Moses also wrote
the book of Job during his stay in Midian. There he became acquainted
with worshipers of God in the Edomite and Midianite branches of
Abraham's family to which Job and his friends belonged. The ninetieth
psalm has strong ties with the books of Genesis and Job. All three
contain perceptions of God's wrath and supplications for His mercy, in
addition to echoes of the themes of Creation and the Fall.
   Another benefit from the years Moses spent in Midian was the
experience of being a shepherd. "The habits of caretaking, of self-
forgetfulness and tender solicitude for his flock, . . . would prepare
him to become the compassionate, longsuffering shepherd of Israel."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 248.

     What other request did Moses make of God? Ps. 90:16.


   Moses thought it was time for God to act for His people, but little
did he realize what God had in mind. Little did he know the role he
himself would play in God's plan!

   Can you think about experiences that, at the time, seemed so
terrible but, in retrospect, you now are able to see the Lord's
providence? How could having experiences like that help some-
one who is struggling now?

GOD'S ANSWER TO MOSES' PLEA (Ps. 90:15, 17; Exod. 3:1-
10; 33:12-34:7).

  What final requests did Moses make of God?

  Ps. 90:15




   Ps. 90:17




    In effect, Moses was saying, "Give me 40 years of gladness for
these 40 years of affliction in the wilderness." Surely God could make
up to him the years of exile and servitude the same as He had done for
Jacob and for Joseph. Couldn't God crown his afflictions with joy?
    "Finally, he pleads with God that the work of his own hands may
be established, that his life may not have been altogether in vain
(vs. 17). It was probably about the time of these reflections that God
met Moses at the burning bush and commissioned him to return to
Egypt to liberate the Hebrews (Ex. 3:1-10)."—SDA Bible Dictionary,
"Moses," p. 763. Read God's response to Moses in Exodus 3:9-12.
     The curtain was opening on the next act of Moses' life. God was
going into action, and Moses was the major actor in the drama. At
first, Moses was unprepared for his new role. His long years of
solitude, his sense of failure and God's anger, had left him with a low
self-image. God lifted him up, however, by reassuring him time and
again that He would be with him and help him (Exod. 3:12, 14; 4:2-
5, 12).
    During the next 40 years of his life, Moses experienced a closeness
 with God never before experienced by another person. Twice he spent
40 days and 40 nights shut in with God on Mount Sinai until his own
 face glowed with the glory of God (Exod. 24:18; 34:28; 34:30).

    Moses saw the glory of God—the beauty of His character. He
 saw beyond God's anger against sin to His incredible love and
 compassion for sinners. Though most of us are not privileged
 with such a revelation of God, the Lord has, in fact, provided us
 with an even better revelation of Himself. What was the revela-
 tion, and how should it change our lives?

                                                                    27
Friday                                              January 19
FURTHER STUDY: When the children of Israel worshiped the golden
calf, Moses again prayed for them. Read this prayer in Exodus 32:11-
14 (compare Deut. 9:25-29). Based on Psalm 90, what did he learn
about God and prayer that empowered him to be such a great interces-
sory pray-er?
   Read Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 471-480.

   " 'Let Me alone, . . . that I may consume them,' were the words of
God. If God had purposed to destroy Israel, who could plead for
them? How few but would have left the sinners to their fate! How few
but would have gladly exchanged a lot of toil and burden and sacri-
fice, repaid with ingratitude and murmuring, for a position of ease
and honor, when it was God Himself that offered the release.
   "But Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared only
discouragement and wrath. The words of God, 'Let Me alone,' he
understood not to forbid but to encourage intercession, implying that
nothing but the prayers of Moses could save Israel, but that if thus
entreated, God would spare His people."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 318.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  I. What principles of prayer can we learn from Psalm 90?

     2. In essence, Psalm 90 is a prayer of supplication on behalf of
        Israel. How can this psalm be a prayer for God's church
        today? Are we facing some of the same spiritual challenges?

     3. Sabbath's lesson talked about the "if only" game and how
        we all play it. According to Psalm 90, how do we win this
        game?

     4. Perhaps Moses actually wrote Psalm 90 while sitting on a
        rock in the Midian desert tending sheep. What merit is
        there in writing down some of our prayers?

SUMMARY: Reviewing our past and looking forward to the future
can be discouraging, especially when life is not going well. Moses'
experience, however, teaches us that we can take our lives to God in
prayer so that His favor will rest upon us and He can "establish the
work of our hands for us" (Ps. 90:17, NIV).

 Single Mother Plants Two Churches in Siberia
                           J. H. Zachary

   RUSSIA Galina Kazakova's life looked dreary. As a single par-
ent with a daughter to provide for, she found that her work as a nurse's
assistant barely paid the bills. Life was hard, but Galina developed a
close walk with Jesus. He sustained her through this difficult time.
   Galina lives near Irkutsk, on the southern tip of Lake Baikal, in
south central Siberia. This huge territory that covers five time zones
contains hundreds of towns and cites that have no Sabbath keepers.
And some Adventist congregations are 600 miles (1,000 kilometers)
from the next nearest Adventist congregation.
   A thought began to burn in Galina' s heart. The city of Cheremhovo
and the region surrounding it were almost empty of believers. Some-
one should share the gospel with the people in this region.
   Galina stepped out in faith and took a year's leave from her work.
She packed up her few belongings and went to Cheremhovo. She
found a place to live then visited the city manager's office to secure a
permit to be a missionary in the city. With her permission document
in hand, Galina began visiting schools, orphanages, and factories,
offering to give a spiritual message to the students and employees.
She sold Christian literature to earn a living as she searched for
honest souls who were interested in spiritual matters. She found very
few who would agree to study the Bible course she offered.
   The work was hard, and her earnings were meager. In a moment
of discouragement she felt as if she were a failure, and she considered
returning home. In desperation she poured out her heart to God.
"Lord, I want to see a church here in Cheremhovo. I have worked
hard, but the way seems impossible. Please, please help me."
    The next day Galina received a letter from the Bible correspon-
dence school containing a list of persons who had completed the
course. She began visiting the people and giving personal Bible stud-
ies. Soon a church was organized in Cheremhovo with 53 members.
    Galina turned her eyes to the city of Severobaikalsk, another area
with no Adventists. So far ten persons have been baptized here, and
Galina is giving Bible studies to more than fifty others.
    During The Quiet Hour's training program for volunteer mission-
aries, Galina committed herself to plant a third church in another city
in Siberia. She is joining 15 other teams in the East Russian Union
 Mission to plant 16 new churches in one year.

          Prayers of Triumph:
           Hannah and Mary


Sabbath Afternoon
WHEN GOD WANTS TO PRODUCE A GREAT LEADER, He
often starts with a mother whom He molds through deep trials.
Susanna Wesley (1669-1742) was such a mother. The wife of a
pastor, Susanna was brilliant, strong-minded, and deeply religious. In
21 years, she bore 19 children, 9 of whom died in infancy. Susanna
home-schooled her children, teaching them the alphabet as soon as
they turned five and using Genesis 1 for reading material. In addition
to daily worships, she arranged weekly interviews with each child for
personal counsel on their spiritual condition. Once, an angry church
member set fire to their home. Six-year-old John almost died. As a
result, Susanna felt a special burden for this child. She wrote in her
diary, "I do intend to be more particularly careful with the soul of this
child . . . that I may instil into his mind the principles of true religion
and virtue."—Ruth Gordon Short, Affectionately Yours, John Wesley
(Nashville: Southern Publishing Assoc., 1960), p. 37. It was from
such dynamic nurture that John and Charles Wesley arose to lead the
Methodist movement—John with his lifelong preaching ministry and
organizational skills and Charles with over 6,000 hymns that have
enriched the Christian world.
   Susanna was walking in the steps of her spiritual ancestors, Hannah
and Mary, whose prayers of triumph will inspire us this week.

BRIARS IN THE NEST (1 Sam. 1:1-18).

   When God wanted to bless His people with a great prophet, He
chose a most interesting family for the prophet-to-be. Elkanah,
the father, though descended from the evil Korah of Moses' day
(1 Chron. 6:33-38; Num. 16), was a godly Levite and a loving
husband (1 Sam. 1:3, 8). His wife Hannah also was a devout
person. Why, then, were their lives so miserable? 1 Sam. 1:1-8.
List the reasons below.

   1 Sam. 1:1, 2


  1 Sam. 4, 5


  1 Sam. 6, 7


   In those days, women achieved self-worth by bearing sons, just as
today some women obtain satisfaction from a career. During Hannah's
day, people believed that to be barren was a dreadful affliction from
God.
   It is natural for a wife to demand sole custody of her husband's
affections. No woman is content with second place. Second wives like
Hagar, Leah, and Peninnah felt threatened by the obvious attraction of
their husbands for the preferred wife. Jealous and bitter, Peninnah
tried to lift herself up by putting Hannah down. She continued this
abusive treatment year after year until Hannah was driven to despair.
Furthermore, Peninnah felt superior because of the children she had
borne.
   "Hannah had good reason to feel discouraged and bitter. She was
unable to bear children; she shared her husband with a woman who
ridiculed her (1:7); her loving husband could not solve her problem
(1:8); and even the high priest misunderstood her motives (1:14). But
instead of retaliating or giving up hope, Hannah prayed. She brought
her problem honestly before God.
    "Each of us may face times of barrenness when nothing 'comes to
birth' in our work, service, or relationships. It is difficult to pray in
faith when we feel so ineffective. But, as Hannah discovered, prayer
opens the way for God to work. . . ."—Life Application Study Bible
(NIV), p. 434.

 reason, seems "barren"? Explain to them how prayer can help.

TROUBLE IN THE SANCTUARY (1 Sam. 1:3-20; 2:12-17).

   Israelite men were required to attend religious feasts at the sanctu-
ary three times a year (Deut. 16:16). Elkanah and his family ex-
pressed their devotion to God by making these pilgrimages (1 Sam.
1:3). Two forces were at work in the sanctuary during this time.
Opposing the Lord was a corrupt priesthood, guilty of extortion,
gluttony, and molestation of female worshipers. By their scandalous
behavior, Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas disgraced the worship of
God (1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22). In contrast, there were those like Hannah
who prayed to God with every fiber of her being.

  What characteristics or qualities marked her conversation with
God?

     1 Sam. 1:11

     1 Sam. 12

     1 Sam. 13

     1 Sam. 15

   Eli, experienced in detecting drunkenness in his sons, was quick
to suspect Hannah. Elkanah had just reproved her for not eating and
drinking, and now Eli scolded her for eating and drinking too much!
Under the sting of such a rebuke Hannah responded calmly without
revealing her sorrows (vss. 15, 16). Eli was quick to give her his
blessing; and, in faith that God would hear her prayer, Hannah shed
her sorrows and took part in the feast (vss. 17-19). Read God's answer
in verses 19 and 20.
   Sometimes God chooses a barren woman to nurture a special
child—a woman like Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah, or Elizabeth.
The agony of craving for a child over a long period of time often
creates an intense commitment to that child's welfare when it finally
arrives. Yet, only a few women would consent to give such a child
back to the Lord as Hannah did. Her sacrifice of her son and Abraham's
near sacrifice of his son reflect, in a measure, the sacrifice of God in
giving us His Son.

   Fortunately, most of those who love the Lord aren't faced
with a situation in which they must give up one of their children.
Yet, what does Hannah's act say to us about half-hearted com-
mitment to the Lord?

GRATITUDE! (1 Sam. 1:21-2:11).

  What does Hannah's care for Samuel reveal about her faithful-
ness regarding the vow she made to God?

  1 Sam. 1:11

  1 Sam. 1-23

   Hannah decided not to attend the feasts when Samuel was small in
order that she might begin educating him from infancy. "As she
watched his expanding powers and listened to his childish prattle,
her affections entwined about him more closely. He was her only son,
the special gift of Heaven; but she had received him as a treasure
consecrated to God, and she would not withhold from the Giver His
own."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 570, 571.
   When Hannah finally did return to Shiloh, she brought Samuel
with her. After a sacrifice had been made, she brought her son to Eli
and said, " 'As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood
here beside you praying to the Lord. I prayed for this child, and the
Lord has granted me what I asked of him. So now I give him to the
Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord' " (1 Sam.
1:26-28). Hannah clearly believed that the God who had given her
this child in answer to prayer was able to keep him. Thanks to her
nurturing, the little boy already knew how to worship God (vs. 28).

   Read Hannah's prayer of praise. 1 Sam. 2:1-10. What is its
theme? What was she grateful for? Which verse indicates her
attitude toward Peninnah?

   "As a result of her full surrender to the Lord [Hannah] is happy for
the privilege of giving back to her Creator that which He has given
her. In doing so she experiences the highest form of joy, for has she
not learned to appreciate His loving-kindness in a new way? . . .
   "Hannah's experience may have proved to be the greatest blessing
that could come into Peninnah's life. God was as anxious to save
Peninnah as He was to save Hannah. How could He accomplish this
more effectively than by showing the exaltation of a soul that trusted
Him and did not retaliate evil for evil?"—The SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 2, p. 461.

    How do the prayers of others affect you? Also, stop to think
 about how your prayers might affect others. What does this tell
 us about the responsibility we have to pray wisely?

                                                                    33

VICTORY! (1 Sam. 2:1-10).

   Why was Hannah so exultant? What was her source of joy?
1 Sam. 1:1-3.


   Peninnah and her children (Hannah's "enemies") had no doubt
told her that she was under God's curse, but the birth of Samuel was
evidence that God had vindicated her. Hannah saw in this one child
the promise of many more (vss. 1, 5; compare vs. 21). She exults in
this future blessing of bearing more children when she says, "My
heart rejoices in the Lord; in the Lord my horn [strength] is lifted
high" (vs. 1). In an agricultural society, horns were symbols of
strength; a horn lifted up was powerful (Dan. 8:3). In our human
frailty, we often feel weak and insecure. Like Hannah, we need to
ground our self-worth on God, our Rock.
   In a series of figures (1 Sam. 2:1-10), Hannah notes the reversal of
the fortunes of God's people and His enemies.

   Hannah certainly had her prayers answered in a miraculous
 way. Not everyone has had such an experience. How do we
 console those, or even ourselves, when prayer isn't answered as
 hoped?

MARY'S TRIUMPH (Luke 1:26-56).

   When God designed that Samuel should be His prophet to bring
Israel back to God, He first chose a mother to nurture him. When God
sent His Son to be the Savior of the world, He again chose a special
woman to be His mother.
   Ever since God had promised that a "seed" of the woman would
crush the serpent's head (Gen. 3:15), many women in Israel hoped to be
the mother of the promised Messiah. At the birth of Cain, Eve ex-
claimed, " 'I have gotten a man, the Lord' " (Gen. 4:1, literal translation).
She, however, was mistaken. Thousands of years passed, and the hope
grew dim. Then an angel came to the town of Nazareth (which may be
translated from the root word under Nazareth to mean: "watchtower";
"sprout"; "root"; or "branch"), where Jesus, the Branch from Jesse's
roots, would grow up (Isa. 11:1; Matt. 2:23). In that town, the Lord found
a young woman to be the mother of the Messiah.
   Mary and Hannah both felt exalted by the gift of a son. God
performed a miracle for each of them—one conceiving despite bar-
renness, the other conceiving despite virginity. Both women over-
flowed with gratitude to God for doing great things for them.
   Mary possessed a fine mind and a deep knowledge of Scripture.
Her spontaneous prayer of rejoicing is full of references to the He-
brew Scriptures. Her knowledge of these scriptures helped to equip
her for her role as the foremost teacher in Jesus' life.

   Read Mary's prayer of praise in Luke 1:46-55. Which verses
of her prayer refer to the following Old Testament scripture?

   Ps. 34:2, 3                      Ps.138:6

   Ps. 71:19                        Ps. 103:17

   Ps. 98:1                         Ps. 98:3

   Luke 1:52. "The reference here is particularly to oppressors. Per-
haps Mary had in mind the cruel tyrant Herod, who murdered not only
thousands of the Jews but even his closest relatives. . . . Contemporary
Jewish literature also reveals the fact that the common people often
suffered intensely from economic oppression."—The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 5, p. 687:52, "Mighty."
    In her prayer, Mary said, "The Mighty One has done great
 things for me—holy is his name" (Luke 1:49, NIV). Though
 maybe none of us can say that anything so great has been done
 for us, what great things has God done in your life?

                                                                          35
Friday                                             January 26
FURTHER STUDY: Review both Hannah's prayer (1 Sam. 2:1-10)
and Mary's prayer (Luke 1:46-55). How do they compare with one
another?
   Read "The Child Samuel," in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 569-
574.

    Mary and Hannah learned the necessity of and experienced the
benefits of praising God. Their experiences teach us how to season our
prayers with praise. Ellen White wrote, "To praise God in fullness
and sincerity of heart is as much a duty as is prayer. We are to show
to the world and to all the heavenly intelligences that we appreciate
the wonderful love of God for fallen humanity and that we are
expecting larger and yet larger blessings from His infinite fullness.
Far more than we do, we need to speak of the precious chapters in our
experience. After a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit, our joy in
the Lord and our efficiency in His service would be greatly increased
by recounting His goodness and His wonderful works in behalf of His
children."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 299, 300.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

     1. Review the principles of prayer discussed in lesson 1. How
        do the prayers that we studied this week follow these prin-
        ciples? What other principles motivated these prayers?

     2. What characteristic of God particularly inspired Hannah
        to praise God in her prayer? What inspired Mary?

     3. What happened to Hannah's mood after she prayed in the
        temple? 1 Sam. 1:18. What does this tell us about the
        benefits of prayer?

     4. Why is it important not only to take our requests to God in
        prayer but to praise Him in our prayers, as well?

SUMMARY: The pain Hannah endured as a result of her infertility
and the taunts of her rival prepared her for a great role in Israel's
history. Mary's lowliness prepared her for the highest responsibility
ever entrusted to a human being—rearing the Son of God. The
experiences of both women produced mighty prayers that still teach
and inspire God's people. Our experiences also can draw us closer to
God and to one another through prayer.

                    The Truth in a Dream
                           Ismael Serrano

    COLOMBIA—Every time Ena Tordecilla came out of a disco,
her conscience bothered her. She knew that her mother was pray-
ing that the light of God would shine in her life again, as it had
during her childhood.
    Ena testifies, "Without Christ, I tried to fill the emptiness in my
life with activity—going to parties and discos. But one day I came
to myself and realized that nothing and no one could fill the God-
shaped hole in my heart. Like the prodigal son, I decided to go
home to God. I found a church and began attending. Then my
thoughts turned to my family. My husband had died without Christ,
but I was determined that my children would have the opportunity
to know God.
   "Thirst for the gospel filled the corners of my soul, and I spent
much of my time in prayer and Bible study. As I studied the Bible,
I found the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation and wanted to
know more about them. But the church that I attended did not seem
interested in unraveling these prophecies. I began to search for a
way to understand these on my own. Then I had a dream.
    "I dreamed that I was visiting a woman in a beautiful city when
two young people came to her home. They talked with us and told
me many things, then they asked to pray with me, and I agreed.
    "I awoke from my dream with a new understanding of the
Sabbath. I had never known that the Sabbath began at sundown on
Friday.
    "I continued to attend the Protestant church while I searched
for a church that kept the Sabbath. I did not tell anyone about my
dream until the Lord told me in another dream, 'Share what you
have been shown with others.'
    "I told the pastor, my mother, and several friends what I had
learned about the Bible prophecies and the Sabbath. On the day I
was baptized into the Adventist Church, several members of my
family and three friends from the Protestant church were baptized
with me.
    "It is my joy to share with others the truths that God has so
graciously shown to me. I challenge every Adventist believer to
share this great light with the multitudes who wait for God's
truth."

  Ismael Serrano is a pastor working in Apartado, Colombia, South
America. Ena Tordecilla continues to share her faith in the same city.

Prayers of Penitence: David



Sabbath Afternoon
HARRY ORCHARD WAS ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS
KILLERS OF HIS TIME. He became involved in the bloody wars
between miners and mine operators from 1896 to 1905. The early
labor organizations considered themselves to be engaged in social
revolution against the "unscrupulous capitalist forces." The labor
leaders thought of themselves as the saviors of the downtrodden
masses. Under their direction, Orchard blew up trains, mills, and
mines to intimidate mine operators, workers, and government agen-
cies and cause a reign of terror. He was especially bitter against
Frank Steunenberg, governor of Idaho, for breaking the union's
power in that state. On December 30, 1905, he planted a bomb in the
snow by the gate of Steunenberg's home so when the gate opened it
would explode. The huge blast killed Steunenberg and shook the
town of Caldwell. Orchard was arrested and jailed. As he lay in his
cell, the terrible scenes of his past life tormented him. He considered
suicide, but was appalled at the thought of hellfire. One question
haunted him: "Can God forgive a murderer?"
   This week's lesson answers that question and tells the rest of
Harry Orchard's story.

     32:1-5; 51:1-6).
IV. Clean! (Ps. 51:7-15).
 V. Reflections on Sinning (Rom. 6:1-4).

MEMORY TEXT: "Have mercy on me, 0 God, according to your
unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my
transgressions" (Psalm 51:1, NIV).

SIN, COVERUP, EXPOSURE (2 Sam. 11; 12).

   King David was Israel's greatest king—a brave shepherd boy who
conquered formidable enemies, extended the boundaries of Israel to
their farthest extent, and established Jerusalem as the capital. His
psalms have influenced the worship of God's people for three thou-
sand years. He became the ancestor and type of Christ, the Messiah.
A series of shameful sins, however, marred David's life.

  What temptation led to David's downfall? 2 Sam. 11:1-4.


   Decisions made in the heat of passion are always bad. Why was
David vulnerable to temptation just then? Flattery, the subtle allure-
ments of power and luxury, and association with surrounding nations
were not tolerated in subjects but went uncondemned in the king and
lessened his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. "As soon as
Satan can separate the soul from God, the only Source of strength, he
will seek to arouse the unholy desires of man's carnal nature. The
work of the enemy is not abrupt; it is not, at the outset, sudden and
startling; it is a secret undermining of the strongholds of prin-
ciple."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 717, 718. Satan lures us step
by step from God until we are separated from Him—then he springs
his trap.

   Describe at least two of the strategies David used to cover up
his sin. 2 Sam. 11:5-27.



   2.

    The coverup was worse than the initial wrong. Sin gripped him
like an octopus. As he tried to pull off one tentacle, another fastened
itself until he was hopelessly entangled. When he thought he had
freed himself, he found that his troubles were just beginning (2 Sam.
11:27; 12:10).

   How did the Lord bring David to his senses? 2 Sam. 12:1-14.


   After David's initial sin (lust in his heart), everything spun
 quickly out of control. Can you think of other examples in which
 one sin quickly led to another? What lesson can we learn re-
 garding even "small" sins?


                                                                    39
Monday                                               January 29
REMORSE AND REPENTANCE (Ps. 51:1-5).

   David wrote Psalm 51 in the anguish of remorse and self-
abhorrence. It explores not only the depths of David's guilt but the
farthest reaches of salvation (see Derek Kidner, Psalms 1-72: An
Introduction and Commentary on Books I and II of the Psalms [Downers
Grove: InterVarsity Press, 1973], p. 189). David gave this prayer to
the chief musician to be sung in public worship services; therefore,
others could learn from the sad history of his fall (Ps. 51, heading), as
well as about the power of God to save even the most wretched of
sinners. It's a beautiful commentary on salvation by faith in Christ.

  What was the basis of David's plea for mercy? Ps. 51:1; Exod.
34:6, 7.

   As a lover of the Torah—the books of Moses—David knew the
character of his God (Ps. 119:97). Perhaps the very words of Exodus
34:6 and 7, detailing the Lord's revelation of His glory (33:18),
brought him comfort in his hour of grief. The heart of God cannot
resist the plea—"God, be merciful to me, a sinner!" (Luke 18:13).
   "There is in this cry no excuse, no apology, no attempt to vindi-
cate, no complaint against the justice of the law that condemned him.
In true humility David blames no one but himself."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 3, p. 755:1, "Have mercy."

     How did David describe the misery of a guilty conscience?

     Ps. 51:33

     Ps. 2:3, 4

   In prison, Harry Orchard endured mental agony as he reviewed his
past life—the wife and baby girl he had abandoned, the drinking and
gambling that had led him deeper into sin, the string of horrible
crimes he had committed. He saw one small ray of hope. Maybe God
could forgive him. Dr. David Paulson of Hinsdale Sanitarium sent
him a little Bible, which Harry read diligently. There he found the
story of David's sin and repentance.

   However unique the specifics of David's sin, his experience of
repentance and forgiveness is universal, at least among those
who know the power of the gospel. How could you use David's
story to help someone who feels that he or she is too evil to be
forgiven?

TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH (Pss. 32:1-5; 51:1-6).

   According to David's prayers of penitence, how can one find
relief from guilt?

  Ps. 32:5

  Ps. 51:4

   After Nathan confronted David with the enormity of his sin, David
made a public confession. He did not attempt to neutralize his sin by
dwelling on the good he had done. Instead, he approached God as a
sinner from birth (vs. 5), pleading for mercy. He even defended the
Lord's severe judgment of his sin (2 Sam. 12:10; Ps. 51:4).

   What does God require of the sinner? Ps. 51:6, 7.


     True confession does not excuse sin or blame others. How rare
such a virtue is in our day! How many millions are spent on lawyers
to find loopholes in the law. How many innocent people are punished
while the guilty remain free. How much injustice exists in this world
because people do not tell the truth.
   Harry Orchard decided to make no attempt to save himself. He
would not plea-bargain for a lighter sentence. Neither would he let the
labor union with its huge funds hire lawyers to defend him, even when
he knew he could have gone free as many of his fellow criminals had
done. "I could find absolutely no way out," he wrote, "except through
an open, true confession, regardless of consequences, and with not the
slightest deviation from, or modification of, the facts."
—Harry Orchard: The Man God Made Again (Nashville: Southern
Publishing Association, 1952), p. 103. This resolution to tell the truth
enabled him to be consistent through intense cross-examination by
lawyers determined to discredit his story. When the famous lawyer,
Clarence Darrow, asked him what his real motive was in telling about
his life of crime, he replied, "I wished to make myself right with God
and man, as far as lay within my power."—Orchard, p. 105.
    "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite
heart, 0 God, you will not despise" (Ps. 51:17, NIV).

    What can you do, if anything, to help a person who refuses
 to confess his or her sins before God or man? Suppose you
 find yourself struggling with this problem? How could prayer
 help?

                                                                     41
Wednesday                                             January 31
CLEAN! (Ps. 51:7-15).

   What does David's prayer teach us about how to become clean
after we sin? What vivid details, or imagery, does David use to
describe what he wants God to do?

     Ps. 51:1, 2

     Ps. 51:7, 9

   David didn't say "Lord, preserve my reputation" as Saul had done
(1 Sam. 15:30). He wanted God to transform his corrupt nature.
   Blotting out means to erase the record of sin from the books God
keeps (see Exod. 32:32, 33). David prayed that God would not count
his sins against him in the judgment day (Ps. 32:1, 2).
   Purging (cleansing) with hyssop refers to the cleansing of a leper
by dipping hyssop in blood and sprinkling it upon the person (Lev.
14:6, 7). The writer of Hebrews identified the sprinkled blood with
the blood of Jesus (Heb. 12:24). Also, the Israelites used hyssop
branches to sprinkle the lamb's blood on the doorposts of their
homes. This kept them safe from death (Exod. 12:22), because it
symbolized the righteousness of Christ imputed to them through
faith.
    Washing white as snow suggests laundering clothes (Isa. 1:18).
The result of such intense cleansing is a sparkling white garment.
" 'Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as
snow' " (Isa. 1:18, NIV).

   What did David want beyond having his guilt removed? What
kind of power would it take? Ps. 51:10.


    God uses the same power with which He created the world to make
a sinner whole. Harry Orchard knew that God had worked a miracle
in his life. " 'Before God came into my life ... I could sit for hours and
listen to vulgar, immoral stories, play almost any kind of game, and
could scarcely talk without intermingling a string of curses. With the
new birth all those old things passed out of my life.. . . They . . . have
no attraction for me now.' "—Orchard, pp. 153, 154.

     David desired not just forgiveness—but cleansing. Those who
 know the power of forgiveness will earnestly seek, by faith, for a
 new heart. Explain why forgiveness will lead to this desire. Why
 must forgiveness always come first? What happens if the order
 is reversed?

REFLECTIONS ON SINNING (Rom. 6:1-4).

   God delights to uplift fallen human beings. He can save to the
uttermost those who come to God through Him (Heb. 7:25). No
matter how terrible our sin, God can forgive; no matter how badly our
lives are damaged, God can repair.
   Some of the greatest saints were once despicable sinners—in fact,
even after conversion they still struggled. Christ assured the thief on
the cross a place in Paradise. Paul the persecutor became the great
apostle. John Newton, a pastor and the composer of the hymn "Amazing
Grace," wrote his epitaph to read:
                              "John Newton
                     Once an Infidel and Libertine,
                    A Servant of Slaves in Africa, . . .
        By the Rich Mercy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
                     Preserved, Restored, Pardoned
                   And Appointed to Preach the Faith
                   He had Long Laboured to Destroy."
—Grace Irwin, Servant of Slaves: A Biographical Novel of John
Newton (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1961), p. 433.
   George Mueller, a dissolute youth, became a great man of faith
and a father to thousands of orphans. Out of his recovery from
alcoholism, Bill Wilson founded Alcoholics Anonymous. The salva-
tion that all these people experienced gave them a ministry to the
fallen.

   Some people might be tempted to think If God's grace is so
abundant, why not sin all the more? Why is this idea wrong? Rom.
6:1-4.

   All of the saints mentioned above regretted their past sin. Further-
more, though God forgives sin, He does not prevent its consequences
(Exod. 34:7). David's sin led to the death of four of his sons, caused a
civil war, and weakened the moral fiber of the nation. "Though David
repented of his sin and was forgiven and accepted by the Lord, he
reaped the baleful harvest of the seed he himself had sown."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 723. The pleasures of sin are only "for
a season" (Heb. 11:25), while the results are long-lasting and bitter.

    A young woman, pregnant out of wedlock, accepts Jesus
 Christ as her Savior. How do you help her understand that
 though her sins are forgiven, the consequences can remain? Is
 not part of our ministry as Christians to help people work
 through these consequences?

                                                                     43
Friday                                             February 2
FURTHER STUDY: Read Psalm 130. This psalm is another prayer
of penitence. It "is the confession of a sinner who in despair cries
unto the Lord for forgiveness. He recognizes that if the Lord should
deal with him according to his sin, his case would be hopeless. The
Lord reveals Himself to this sinner as a pardoning God."—The SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 915.
   Read "Repentance" and "Confession" in the book Steps to Christ,
pp. 23-41.

   "David often triumphed in God, and yet he dwelt much upon his
own unworthiness and sinfulness. His conscience was not asleep or
dead. 'My sin,' he cried, 'is ever before me.' He did not flatter
himself that sin was a matter with which he had nothing to do, and
that should not concern him. As he saw the depths of deceit in his
heart, he was deeply disgusted with himself, and prayed that God
would keep him back by His power from presumptuous sins, and
cleanse him from secret faults."—Ellen G. White Comments, The
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1147:3, "A Live Conscience Leads
to Confession."
   "God intended the history of David's fall to serve as a warning
that even those whom He has greatly blessed and favored are not to
feel secure and neglect watchfulness and prayer."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 724.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What ultimately was the foundation of David's acceptance
     with God? Was it his sorrow, his confession, his repentance?
     Or was it the righteousness of Christ credited to Him?

     2. Why must our hope of salvation be rooted not in ourselves
        but in Christ?

     3. Why is David's mention of Jerusalem in Psalm 51:18, 19 an
        appropriate conclusion to his prayer? Apply your answer
        to your personal prayers for forgiveness and how you per-
        haps should conclude them.

     4. What role does prayer have in confession and in repentance?

SUMMARY: David's prayers of penitence teach us that to become
right with God we must come to Him as we are, confess our sins, and
ask Him to cleanse and recreate us anew. "No one who conceals
transgressions will prosper, but one who confesses and forsakes them
will obtain mercy" (Prov. 28:13, NRSV).

                            J. H. Zachary

    SOLOMON ISLANDS—The happiness of the new parents turned
to sorrow when they discovered that their infant daughter was blind.
They named her Metol Maki, but people called her Blind Metol Maki.
    The little girl did not go to school, but she was a natural leader.
When she was a teenager she became the village devil priestess.
    Not everyone in the village was a devil worshiper; the village chief
had become a Christian. He asked for someone to come and teach his
people about God. Beven Stephen, an Adventist lay preacher, an-
swered the call and came to teach the people about Christ. Blind Metol
Maki and several others in the village turned from the devil and
embraced Christianity.
    The new members felt an urgent need for a church in which to
worship. They did what they could to make their dream come true.
They went into the forest and cut timber and prepared local materials
for the walls. But they needed money for the metal roof, for paint and
nails, and for the cement floor. How could they raise the funds when
they had nothing to sell in the neighboring towns to earn money?
Blind Metol Maki wanted to help too, but she wondered what a blind
teenager could do to help raise money to build God's house.
    Beven Stephen, serving as the lay minister, had listened to Blind
Metol Maki sing. He was convinced that God had given her a gift of
music, and he encouraged her to learn some Christian songs and make
a cassette recording to sell. Her cassette would bless others and raise
funds for the church.
    She agreed to try and began memorizing some songs. Soon her
cassette was ready. The believers each took some to sell, praying that
people would buy the recordings that would enable them to build their
church. Within a few days the cassettes had all sold. Blind Metol
 Maki's efforts encouraged other members to work harder for their
church. Thrilled by the sales of the cassette, Beven Stephen encour-
aged Blind Metol Maki to enlarge her repertoire and present a benefit
 concert in the largest city on the island.
     By the time you read this, Blind Metol Maid's mountain village will
 have a new Adventist church. But even more important, a young
 woman who was born blind and never attended school is using her
 talents to encourage others to follow Jesus as their personal Savior.

           Dwelling: Solomon

Sabbath Afternoon
LIGHT TRAVELS AT 186,000 miles per second. This means it
can circle the globe seven times in, literally, the blink of an eye.
Yet, even at that speed, light requires 4.3 years to reach Alpha
Centuri, a star near to earth. In contrast, some stars are so far away
that—even at the speed of light—it would take billions of years to
arrive.
   The universe is, indeed, big. Yet, the God who created it is even
bigger, not in a physical sense but in the sense that an artist is greater
than his or her creation. No matter how wondrous the music, the
statue, the painting—whatever is created first existed in the mind of
the artist, who had not only the notion of what to create but the ability
to create it. In this sense, the creator is always greater than the
creation.
   Yet the Creator of the creation that we exist in—the Creator of
the universe itself—had come to dwell with us. The thought is
overwhelming. Of course, the closest association came with Jesus,
Immanuel, "God with us." This week's lesson, however, deals
with another way in which the One greater than all that was made
chose to tabernacle with those who were made, and that is in the
earthly sanctuary.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. A Dwelling Place for God (1 Kings 8:1-21).
 11. "Hear From Heaven, Your Dwelling Place" (1 Kings 8:17-30).
I11. Prayer for a Rebellious Nation (1 Kings 8:31-61).
IV. "When You Hear, Forgive" (1 Kings 8:23-61).
 V. "If My People ..." (2 Chron. 7:11-22).

MEMORY TEXT: "If my people, which are called by my name,
shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn
from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will
forgive their sin, and will heal their land" (2 Chronicles 7:14).

A DWELLING PLACE FOR GOD (1 Kings 8:1-21).

   God always wanted to be near His people, but since Israel entered
Canaan, He had been dwelling in humble structures, homes, and tents
in Shiloh, Gibeon, and Jerusalem. Embarrassed at the contrast with his
own palace, King David dreamed of building a home for the Lord. He
drew up the plans and collected the materials. His son Solomon had
the honor of building it.
   Hundreds of years before, Moses had predicted that God would
choose a place for His Name to dwell (Deut. 12:5). The very spot
where Abraham had offered his son Isaac and where David had of-
fered a sacrifice to end a devastating plague became the site where
Israel presented their sacrifices to God in anticipation of the Great
Sacrifice God would provide (Gen. 22:2-14; 1 Chron. 21:15-18;
2 Chron. 3:1).
   Solomon spent seven years building the temple, a magnificent
structure of stone and cedar, lined with gold (1 Kings 6). With great
ceremony, the priests brought the ark and sanctuary furnishings into
the temple.

   How did God respond to this gift from His people? 1 Kings
8:10, 11. How long did Solomon intend that the gift should en-
dure? Verse 13.


   "Had Israel remained true to God, this glorious building would
have stood forever, a perpetual sign of God's especial favor to His
chosen people."—Prophets and Kings, p. 46. Human failure thwarted
that purpose. Ultimately, this purpose will be fulfilled when the New
Jerusalem descends to earth and God lives with His people forever
(Rev. 21:1-3).

  Solomon built the temple for the name of the Lord to dwell in
(1 Kings 8:17-20). Where else does God put His name? Rev. 14:1.
What does it mean to bear His name?


   A name is not a mere label of identification but an expression of its
bearer's nature. The full expression of God's character is given in
Jesus Christ, who has manifested God's name (John 17:6, 26, KJV).
Whatever is called by Yahweh's name is His possession and comes
under His authority and protection. God wanted His character to be
embedded in Jerusalem, in the temple, and in His people.

     What does it mean to bear God's name before people in your part
 of the world? What kind of solemn responsibility does that entail?

                                                                     47

"HEAR FROM HEAVEN, YOUR DWELLING PLACE"
(1 Kings 8:17-30).

   Though King David had conceived the plan of building a temple
for the Lord, God did not want him 10. He told David that his job was
to unify Israel and lead them in battle against their enemies. God told
David, " 'You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are
a warrior and have shed blood' " (1 Chron. 28:3, NIV). So He gave the
honor of building a permanent place of worship to his son Solomon
instead (1 Kings 8:16-20).
   Solomon and David did not resist God's plan (see 2 Sam. 7:27-29;
1 Kings 8:17-21). Sometimes people want to do a great work for God,
but because of a lack of experience or capability the Lord directs that
others do the work. Instead of resisting, David stepped aside and let the
honor fall on Solomon. As a result, both received great satisfaction.

  What principle can we learn from David surrendering His
ambitions and plans to the Lord?

   In his prayer of dedication, Solomon stated that even heaven is not
big enough to hold God (1 Kings 8:27). Though God is infinite,
eternal, and incomprehensible to us, He is also very near, a friend and
personal companion who will enter into a personal relationship with
His creatures and who dwells in earthly sanctuaries made for Him
(see The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 766:27, "Will God indeed
dwell?"). It is only as we recognize the awesome majesty of our God,
however, that we can fully appreciate the wonders of intimacy with
Him. "I dwell in the high and holy place, with Him also that is of a
contrite and humble spirit" (Isa. 57:15).

  What was Solomon's earnest longing for himself, for the people,
and for the temple?

     1 Kings 8:28-30




   Five times Solomon asked God to "hear," also to "give atten-
tion," and to keep His eyes open. It sometimes appears to human
beings that God is not there, that He does not hear, that heaven,
His dwelling place, is far away. What if a person feels that God
neither is near nor hears his or her prayers? What advice can
you give to that person?

PRAYER FOR A REBELLIOUS NATION (1 Kings 8:31-61).

   Solomon's prayer contains numerous requests. The first was a plea
that God would see that justice was done to those who swore under
oath before His altar. How much better our justice systems would be
today if their object was to determine the truth rather than to secure a
favorable verdict for the rich and powerful!

  What did Solomon request for foreigners? How far did he
expect Israel's influence to extend? 1 Kings 8:41-43.


   The temple of Jerusalem was to be a "house of prayer for all
people" (Isa. 56:7). What does this tell us about churches that tend
to exclude people based on class or ethnic identity?


  Other petitions dealt with the covenant curses (Lev. 26:14-39).
What types of calamity did Solomon foresee in 1 Kings 8 that
would happen as a result of Israel's sins?

   1 Kings 8:33


   1 Kings 8:35


   1 Kings 8:37

   Elijah called down a covenant curse when he declared that there
would be no dew or rain except according to his word (1 Kings 17:1).
Israel's frequent defeats in warfare were a consequence of sin. When
a city was besieged, the population inside the walls would experience
starvation, disease, and death (8:37). Leviticus 26:27, 28, and 33
state that one of the punishments for persistent rebellion against God
would be foreign captivity (see also 1 Kings 8:46). God was patient
with His people for hundreds of years. Then the dreaded blow fell. In
722 B.C., Assyria took captive the northern kingdom of Israel, and
Babylon overtook the southern kingdom of Judah in 586 B.C.

    How would you help a person who believes that a personal
 calamity in his or her life was a direct result of a judgment from
 God? Even if that were the case, could you help that person
 realize that even in such a circumstance God has not abandoned
 him or her?

                                                                      49
Wednesday                                            February 7
"WHEN YOU HEAR, FORGIVE" (1 Kings 8:23-61).


   Most of Israel's history was spent under the shadow of apostasy
and the resulting curses. Yet, mingled with the curses were the
promises of mercy to those who would repent (Lev. 26:40-45). It was
these promises that Solomon drew upon in his prayer of dedication.

   What hope was there for God's people when they were captive
in a foreign land? 1 Kings 8:46-51.


   Daniel was one of those captives. He used the very words of
Solomon's prayer as he confessed the sins of his people and begged
for mercy (Dan. 9:4-19).
   Several times in his prayer, Solomon asked God to forgive. He
"recognized that every man who sends a prayer heavenward stands in
need of forgiveness. . . . Solomon knew that forgiveness of sin would
be the earnest desire of those who prayed. He also knew that man's
hope of receiving an answer to his petitions would rest largely on the
sin-pardoning grace of God."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2,
p. 766.
   Will God's people ever get beyond the need for forgiveness? The
doctrine of perfection is unprofitable—it leads to pride or despair. The
doctrine of imperfection is satanic—it leads to presumptuous sin.
   God's people do not need to commit acts of sin, but the closer they
come to Jesus, the more they will recognize the sinfulness of their
own natures and their constant need for forgiveness. It's an interest-
ing process: The more we come to reflect the character of God and the
more we obey His commands, the more we realize our own sinfulness
and our need for a God who will forgive us, not based on our own
righteousness but on His righteousness. "But now the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the
prophets; even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
difference" (Rom. 3:21, 22).

    Though Christ's righteousness alone is the foundation of our
 acceptance with God, explain the importance of prayer in the
 process of being reinstated with the Lord after we sin. What
 other things beside prayer are involved?

     1 Kings 8:33, 34

"IF MY PEOPLE ..." (2 Chron. 7:11-22).

   How did God respond to Solomon's petition? 2 Chron. 7:1, 2,
12-16. What does His response teach us about His attitude toward
prayer?


   It's a great thrill to make contact with Almighty God—to pray and
receive a reply from heaven. The Lord accepted the steps of repent-
ance Solomon had outlined and had promised to respond graciously.
   At the conclusion of the dedication services for the temple, the
nation celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles, commemorating the years
when God and His people had wandered in the wilderness living in
tents. Now, God had a substantial place of rest with His people in
their own land. They experienced the great joy of being at peace with
Him. If only that "rest" had been permanent!
   The dedicatory celebrations inspired the people, and they returned
to their homes "joyful and glad in heart for the good things the Lord
had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel" (2 Chron.
7:10, NIV).

   What special counsel and warnings did God give to Solomon?
2 Chron. 7:17-22.


   Solomon's story presents an astonishing picture of the weakness of
human nature. The deceitfulness of riches, fame, and association with
the world lured him step by step away from God. Most people can stand
adversity. The real test of character comes when they experience pros-
perity. It is easier to carry an empty cup than a full one.
   Solomon committed the very sins he had prayed he would not
commit. He lived most of his years away from God. When he looked
back on his life, he found it was all "vanity" (the Hebrew word means
"vapor" or "breath"). Wealth, pleasure, hard work, and accomplish-
ments brought him no satisfaction (see Eccles. 1; 2). He reached the
top of the ladder of success only to discover he had leaned it against
the wrong wall! How could this happen to the wisest man on earth?

    How can we live our days so that when we are old we will look
 back with satisfaction? What are the achievements that bring
 lasting pleasure—wealth, service, friendships, prestige, close family
 relationships, sacrifice, a walk with God?
    Being connected to God's love and pouring it generously on
 those around us is a call Christ makes to each one of us. How can
 prayer help us do this?

                                                                    51
Friday                                                February 9
FURTHER STUDY: Solomon's temple was only one example of a
place where God loved to dwell. Ever since sin separated humanity
from God, God has sought ways to dwell or "tent" in human skin with
us. Look up the following texts to learn what God's other temples are:
Exodus 25:8; John 1:14; 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20; Revelation 21:1-3.
   One more special temple wherein God wants to dwell is your home.
You might wish to plan a special dedication service to invite God's
presence there.

   "From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth. Love
should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home inter-
course, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, unselfish
courtesy. There are homes where this principle is carried out—homes
where God is worshiped and truest love reigns. From these homes
morning and evening prayer ascends to God as sweet incense, and
His mercies and blessings descend upon the suppliants like the morn-
ing dew."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. We have been warned that, in the church, "Many a star that
     we have admired for its brilliance will then go out in dark-
     ness."—Prophets and Kings, p. 188. When this happens, it
     can be a very painful experience because of the influence of
     these people. What can we do to help protect ourselves as a
     church when something like this occurs?

     2. "He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But
        as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
        the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
        which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
        nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made
        flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the
        glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and
        truth" (John 1:11-14). The word for dwelt comes from a
        Greek word skenoo, meaning "to pitch a tent or a taber-
        nacle" and is related directly to the word translated taber-
        nacle numerous times in the Greek version of the Hebrew
        Bible. What does this mean that Jesus "tabernacled" among
        us?

SUMMARY: It is our privilege to dedicate ourselves, our churches,
and our homes to be God's dwelling place. We can pray with Solomon,
"Arise, Lord, and fill your temple!"

                     Berhantinsea Masrekasay

   ETHIOPIA—I am 19 years old and already have wasted years
of my life. I was searching for something, but I did not know what.
Some of my friends invited me to become a member of their cult,
but I hesitated. Eventually, they convinced me to quit school and
join them. They said the Bible did not prohibit smoking, drinking,
drugs, adultery, or other activities I had thought of as sinful.
   I started taking drugs, and soon I graduated to selling drugs. But
when I learned that the police knew about my activities, I became
worried. I did not want to spend my life in prison!
    I grew restless and could not sleep. I began reading the Bible,
although my mind was foggy from drugs and alcohol. I realized
that my life was out of control, but I could not help myself. My
soul cried out for hope and salvation. The religion that had prom-
ised a good life was choking me. Instead of happiness it brought
sorrow, and instead of life it brought death. I cried out to God, and
He reached down and pulled me out of the pit of sin.
    Two Adventist friends invited me to a nature program at their
church. I was inspired by the devotional message I heard. I yearned
to have what these Christians had—real happiness, true freedom,
and purity. As I prayed, I felt God's power pumping new life into
me.
    However, the devil was not willing to let me go. He tried to
convince me that God could not love me. But God assured me that
He loves me and I am His child.
    I spent much time on my knees begging God to save me from
the sins that I had let bind me. Soon I had the assurance that God
accepted me and would abide with me. I stopped associating with
my former friends and spent all my time with my new Adventist
brothers and sisters.
    I moved back into my parents' home. They were not sure they
wanted me back. But the changes they saw in my life convinced
them that I had met Jesus.
    Today I am truly happy. I have returned to school; my life has
found direction and purpose. But most important, I have the assur-
ance of God's love and salvation. God has cleared my mind of the
 foul pollution of drugs and the poisons of my bad behavior. I am at
peace. I am satisfied. I have real life in Jesus.

THE CULTURE OF OUR WORLD CAN TURN QUICKLY TO
EVIL. It usually does. Like tainted air, this evil seeps through the cracks
under the doors and the windows of our hearts and minds and homes.
Often, because we are part of the culture, we don't see these cultural evils
for what they are. They can even invade the church; in fact, they often do.
    In the early centuries, paganism invaded Christianity. "Almost
imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their way into the
Christian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was re-
strained for a time by the fierce persecutions which the church en-
dured under paganism. But as persecution ceased, . . . the world,
cloaked with a form of righteousness, walked into the church. "—The
Great Controversy, pp. 49, 50; emphasis supplied.
    The marriage of the Israelite King Ahab with the heathen Jezebel
illustrates the union of God's people with the world—a union that
always results in apostasy. God still needs Elijahs and prayers of
reformation to halt the downward course of compromise.

ELIJAH AGAINST EVIL (Exod. 34:15, 16; see also Deut.
18:9-12; 1 Kings 16:29-33).

  Describe the evils of Canaanite culture against which God had
warned Israel.

  Exod. 34:15, 16

  Dent. 18:9-12
   Because of the degrading practices of its people, Canaan was ripe for
conquest. The conquering Israelites themselves, however, were se-
duced into idolatry. They might have won the military battle, but they
lost the war against culture. When Israel split from Judah and formed
the northern kingdom, Jeroboam introduced calf worship to keep his
people from worshiping in the southern kingdom of Judah. In all of its
history, the northern kingdom never had a righteous king, and the
majority of its people were idolaters.
   How did King Ahab increase the nation's apostasy? 1 Kings
16:30-33.


   Jezebel, daughter of a Sidonian priest-king, was a ruthless, domi-
neering person who exercised a powerful influence over Ahab and the
nation. She had a temple built for Baal in Samaria and supported a huge
college of Baal and Asherah prophets to practice and foster this reli-
gion. She also killed large numbers of the Lord's prophets (see 1 Kings
16:32; 18:4, 19).
   Baal worship was extremely seductive to Israel. In order to stimulate
the gods to make the land fertile, priests, temple prostitutes of both
sexes, and worshipers engaged in sexual orgies after working them-
selves into an ecstatic frenzy by drinking wine and dancing. Israel, as
an agricultural society, thought it necessary to follow the practices of
the surrounding nations to guarantee abundant harvests.
   As bleak as chapter 16 ends, however, chapter 17 begins with a note
of hope. "Elijah appears on the scene as a man with an urgent errand for
God. The hour is one of crisis. Sin has invaded the land, and if not
stopped, will soon engulf all in tragic ruin."—The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 2, p. 811:1, "Elijah."

     The dangerous thing about culture is that those who are part of
 it can't often see it for what it is. Trying to step out of it is like trying
 to take off your shoes while jogging. As a church, we are part of our
 culture. What is the only guide we have to teach us which part of
 our culture is acceptable and which part we must reject?

                                                                            57
Monday                                                February 12
THE CURSE OF THE COVENANT (Lev. 26:14-20; see also
Deut. 28:15-24; 1 Kings 17:1).

     What would happen to God's people if they refused to obey Him?

     Lev. 26:18-20

     Deut. 28:23, 24


   God loves to bless His people, but when they forsake Him, He
speaks to them through blessings removed. We so often tend to forget
God in times of prosperity and seek Him in times of adversity.
   From his mountain home in Gilead, Elijah viewed with anguish
Israel's deepening apostasy. He prayed that God would invoke the
covenant curses to bring the nation to its senses. Read James 5:17,
18 and 1 Kings 17:1. According to Baalist theology, rain is simply
Baal impregnating the earth in order that it bring forth its crops. God
chose to destroy this claim by revealing that He alone is responsible
for the earth's treasures—sunshine, rain, and abundant harvests.
   In obedience to God's command, Elijah appeared before a startled
Ahab, locked up the heavens, and walked away with the key! It took
strong faith for Elijah to predict a long-term dry spell. The country-
side, lush and green, seemed beyond the bony fingers of drought.
   If Ahab, Jezebel, and her prophets were inclined to sneer at Elijah's
curse, they soon had cause for alarm. Weeks and months went by with
no rain. The prophets of Baal had plenty of opportunity to invoke their
god but reasoned that he must have been asleep or on a journey. The
brooks dried up, the grass withered, the crops failed, and gaunt herds
suffocated under choking clouds of dust.

  There was a key to unlock the heavens, but the people didn't
know about it because their leaders had neglected to teach them.
What was this key? 2 Chron. 7:13, 14.


   "The Christian's most powerful resource is communion with God
through prayer. The results are often greater than we thought were
possible. . . . Because God's power is infinitely greater than ours, it only
makes sense to rely on it—especially because God encourages us to do
so."—Life Application Study Bible (NIV), p. 2252.

    When has prayer been a key that unlocked the blessings of
 heaven for you? How do you respond when the lock seems to remain
 shut and the blessings stay in heaven?

SHOWDOWN ON MOUNT CARMEL (1 Kings 18:16-46).

    After three and a half years of devastating famine, the Lord told Elijah
it was time for the showdown. The God who brought drought could also
bring rain (2 Kings 18:1). Elijah summoned the nation to Mt. Carmel.
   How did he challenge the people? 1 Kings 18:21, 24.


   Many Israelites had been serving both Baal and Yahweh. The time
had come for them to take a stand one way or the other. As Elijah
proposed a test, the prophets of Baal cringed—their god had been
powerless for over three years. Before God could send rain, there
needed to be a sacrifice to atone for the sins of the people (1 Kings
18:23, 24). Elijah repaired the altar of Yahweh, which had been in disuse
for many years.

   Study Elijah's prayer (vss. 36, 37). Note the length and manner
of his prayer and its content. How does it contrast with that of the
Baal prophets? (vss. 26-29).


       Contrast                 Elijah's           The Baal Prophets'

   Content of

   When fire streaked from heaven and consumed the drenched sacri-
fice, wood, and the altar itself, the people fell on their faces, crying
"Yahweh"—not Baal "is God!"

   Why did Elijah follow up the demonstration by exterminat-
 ing the prophets of Baal? What lesson is taught by this act
 regarding any compromise with the sinful parts of the culture?
 How could you apply this principle to your own life? Are there
 any specific issues on which you, personally, need to make a
 decision one way or another?

                                                                          59
Wednesday                                             February 14
LETDOWN AT HOREB (1 Kings 19).

    The exciting day was not yet over. As Elijah prayed seven times
under a cloudless sky, his faith clung to God's past performances—the
drought, the fire, the promise to bring rain (18:1). Faith feeds upon the
memories of God's past leading. A tiny cloud was enough to convince
Elijah that a deluge was coming. In spite of an all-day fast, Elijah ran
with superhuman strength to guide Ahab's chariot through the rain.
Then he laid on the ground, wet and exhausted, and fell asleep.

   What events happened next that caused Elijah to flee? 1 Kings
19:1-5.


     How could his mood change so rapidly from triumph to despair?


    For years Elijah had invested all his emotional and spiritual energy in
the cause of reformation. Yahweh had given convincing proof that He
was God. Surely everyone in the whole nation would be converted, but
they were not.
    After an emotional high, one often experiences a letdown. Elijah felt
that the crusade on Mt. Carmel was a failure. He felt useless, and he
wanted to die.
    Twice Elijah complained to God, " 'I have been very zealous for the
Lord God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken
down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am
the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too' " (1 Kings
19:10, NIV; compare vs. 14).
    A great wind, a powerful earthquake, and a fire immediately followed
Elijah's first complaint, but God was not in any of them. Then came a
gentle whisper—the unmistakable voice of God (vss. 11, 12). Then
Elijah knew that God does not always show Himself in vigorous ways.
It is not always the person or event that creates the greatest excite-
ment. A humble heart who hears and obeys God's still, small voice
can be just as mighty.
    Miracles are often not enough to convince stubborn hearts. They
sometimes arouse more bitter opposition (John 11:45-50, 57). God must
not only startle the people with signs but persuade them with the still
small voice of the Spirit.

    Elijah, a man of God, a prophet in fact, became disheartened and
 discouraged. How should his experience help us through our own
 periods of discouragement?

Thursday                                               February 15
JESUS' EXAMPLE (Luke 1:32, 33; 19:41-44; see also John 17:6-19).

   What plans did God have for Israel through the coming of
Jesus? Luke 1:32, 33, 71, 74; 2:32.


    In Luke 19:41-44, we read that these plans were not to be fulfilled.
Israel's leaders would not recognize that God was visiting His people in the
person of Jesus! (Luke 1:68). If they had, the covenant blessings described
in Isaiah 62 and repeated in Luke 1 and 2 would have been poured out.
Because of their constant opposition, Christ "seemed to do little of the work
He longed to do in uplifting and saving."—The Desire of Ages, p. 678.
   Jesus, however, would not be discouraged. "In the heart of Christ,
where reigned perfect harmony with God, there was perfect peace. He
was never elated by applause, nor dejected by censure or disappoint-
ment. Amid the greatest opposition and the most cruel treatment, He
was still of good courage."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

   What instructions and encouraging fact about Israel did the Lord
give to Elijah? 1 Kings 19:15-18.


   "One cure for depression is to get busy. So the first word from God
to Elijah after the dramatic demonstration on Mount Horeb is 'Go.'
The anointing of Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha would ensure that the
campaign against Baal worship would continue, and a faithful rem-
nant of Yahweh worshipers would survive."—Lloyd J. Ogilvie, gen-
eral editor, Russell H. Dilday, The Communicator's Commentary: 1, 2
Kings (Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1987), vol. 9, p. 224.
    The campaign also would succeed because God had a remnant.
Reformers need to remember and be encouraged by the fact that God
has always worked through a remnant. "When we give ourselves
wholly to God and in our work follow His directions, He makes
Himself responsible for its accomplishment. He would not have us
conjecture as to the success of our honest endeavors. Not once should
we even think of failure. We are to co-operate with One who knows no
 failure."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 363.
    At the end of His ministry, Jesus looked with satisfaction upon His
eleven disciples whom God had given Him. He prayed that God would
keep them faithful (John 17:6-12). Through this small remnant, the
world would be evangelized (vs. 20).

    Raphael was a newly baptized member. Early on he saw things in
 the church that greatly upset him. What can you do to help someone
 like him? How does "remnant theology" help in a case such as this?

                                                                          61

FURTHER STUDY: In review, how does Psalm 51 reassure us that
God will honor our prayers for, and sincere efforts on behalf of,
spiritual reform?
   Read any or all of the following from Prophets and Kings: "Carmel,"
pp. 143-154; "From Jezreel to Horeb," pp. 155-166; " 'What Doest Thou
Here?' " pp. 167-176.

   "When upon Mt. Carmel he [Elijah] offered the prayer for rain,
his faith was tested, but he persevered in making known his request
unto God. . . . Had he given up in discouragement at the sixth time,
his prayer would not have been answered, but he persevered till the
answer came. . . . God does not always answer our prayers the first
time we call upon Him; for should He do this, we might take it for
granted that we had a right to all the blessings and favors He be-
stowed upon us. Instead of searching our hearts to see if any evil was
entertained by us, any sin indulged, we should become careless, and
fail to realize our dependence upon Him, and our need of His help.
   "Elijah humbled himself until he was in a condition where he would
not take the glory to himself. This is the condition upon which the Lord
hears prayer, for then we shall give the praise to Him."—Ellen G. White
Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, pp. 1034, 1035,
"Important Lessons From Elijah."

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Was Elijah's request for drought, fire, and rain his idea or
     God's? Explain your answer. What scriptural support did Elijah
     have for his request? How can we know when we are praying and
     acting according to God's will?

     2. Human cultures greatly vary. People also tend to think that
        their culture is the best or does things the "right" way. How
        can we as a church learn to respect cultural difference without
        being judgmental, simply because the practices are differ-
        ent? Why is it a good idea to leave as much of a culture
        intact, provided these practices don't violate biblical prin-
        ciples?

     3. Elijah thought he was the only person left in Israel who wor-
        shiped the true God. There were others, however (1 Kings
        18:13; 19:18, 19). How would working together with these
        people have helped him?

SUMMARY: In the work of reformation, whether personal or corporate,
we are at war with powerful enemies. We need to pray for wisdom, tact,

                  Natasha's Search for God
                            J. H. Zachary

   RUSSIA—Natasha Dashidordzieva comes from a Buddhist back-
ground. But growing up in Russia, she was taught to trust in atheistic
communism. She tried to start several businesses, but each time her
efforts resulted in failure.
   Discouraged, Natasha began searching for God. She read many
books, visited religious teachers, and endured many strange practices
in an attempt to find God. Finally, she gave up in frustration.
    A neighbor gave her some religious books, but Natasha decided to
return them unread. She knocked on the neighbor's door and found
several women holding a Bible fellowship. The neighbor invited her to
stay, and out of courtesy she did. But she was not interested in any new
religious ideas.
    However, Natasha noticed that the women seemed happy. As the
women shared ideas, Natasha suddenly blurted out, "I don't believe
there is a living God. If there is, why do I pray but receive no answers?"
    Natasha told them of her failed business attempts, and one woman
suggested that she should try giving God a tithe of her income and see
what happened. It sounded ridiculous to her, but finally Natasha
decided to try it. She was amazed when her business efforts began to
prosper. Natasha continued attending the fellowship group.
    The women planned an outing in the country, and Natasha wanted
to go. But she had no money. A friend owed her some money and had
not repaid it. Natasha prayed, "Lord, if You really exist, please send
my friend to repay the money she owes me—today." As the hours
passed and her friend did not come, Natasha wondered if God had
heard her prayer. Then at sunset her friend appeared with the money
she had borrowed.
    Natasha was convinced. She gave her life to God for His service.
Recently she attended a training program for missionary volunteers
who are preparing to plant churches in unentered cities of eastern
 Russia. Natasha has been assigned to work in the city of Kiahta, on the
border between Russia and Mongolia. This is a strategic area, for the
 people living in this region can work freely in Mongolia, a country that
has fewer than fifty Adventists.
    Natasha feels her new life is like a fairy tale, for because of Jesus
Christ, her life already has a "happily ever after" ending.

     Prayers of Desperation:
           Hezekiah




Sabbath Afternoon
THOUGH ONLY EARLY SPRING, the farmers were already in
fear of another horde of locusts, like the one that had devastated last
summer's crops. A similar disaster would ruin many families, which
was why April 26 was to be a day of fasting and prayer for every
woman, man, and child in the community. That day, a hush fell
across the land while prayers ascended to God. The next morning,
the sun rose in a cloudless sky. The thermometer soared to mid-
summer heat—and everyone watched in horror as the warm earth
stirred with the dreaded insects.
    During the next three days, the heat hatched a grand army of
locusts. What kind of an answer to their prayers was this? But on the
fourth day, the temperature dropped and frost enveloped the earth,
destroying most of the locusts. That summer, the wheat waved tall
and green.
    As you study this week's lesson, think about the role of prayer in
your life, especially when your prayers were uttered in frantic and
fearful desperation.

ASSYRIA, THE ROD OF GOD'S ANGER (2 Chron. 29; 30;
32:1).

   The Assyrians had been the scourge of Israel and Judah for over
150 years. They attempted to eradicate the national identity of their
captives by removing them from their homelands and settling them
in foreign lands. In 722 B.C., they conquered the northern kingdom of
Israel and took these people captive.
   King Hezekiah of Judah inherited the problem of Assyria from his
father, Ahaz. Ahaz disobeyed the Lord by asking the Assyrians for
aid against his enemies. The Assyrians only made things worse by
overpowering Judah. Ahaz also closed the temple and set up idola-
trous shrines all over Jerusalem and the nation (2 Chron. 28:19-21, 24,
25).

   What reforms did Hezekiah introduce when he became king?
2 Chron. 29:3-5, 10; 30:1. What explanation did Hezekiah give for
the troubles Judah had suffered? 2 Chron. 30:6-9.


   "A right regard for Him was no abstraction for God's people, but
was grounded in pure and regular worship at the temple. Hezekiah at
the beginning of his reign found the temple in a shocking state of
neglect and misuse. It was a mirror of the people's condition before
God. So two related tasks were necessary, to put the temple aright
and to use it for a service [through] which the people . . . could get
right with God again."—Lloyd J. Ogilvie, general editor, Leslie C.
Allen, The Communicator's Commentary: 1, 2 Chronicles, vol. 10,
p. 370.
   Read the invitation Hezekiah sent to the nation in 2 Chronicles
30:6-9. Underline the parts that appeal to you. Why do you find
these sections particularly meaningful?


   The huge crowd that came to Jerusalem enjoyed the "camp meet-
ing" so much that they extended the celebration for another week
(vs. 23). Serving God brings joy. Under Hezekiah's rule the nation
enjoyed years of peace and prosperity. Eventually, however, the king
of Assyria made war on Jerusalem, and the peaceful times quickly
stopped (2 Kings 18:17).

    Like Hezekiah, have you ever experienced a time when, even
 though you were working diligently for the Lord, things were
 going badly? Explain why wholehearted service to God does not
 always guarantee peace and prosperity.

                                                                    65

CRISIS WITHOUT AND WITHIN (Isa. 36; 38).

   In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (701 B.c.), Assyrian
King Sennacherib began a western campaign against his rebellious
provinces, including Judah. Hezekiah took measures to fortify Jerusalem.
In an engineering feat for that time, he had a tunnel built from the
Gihon Spring to the Pool of Siloam, channeling water into the city to
assure an abundant supply during the siege. He then fortified the
city's walls. (For further study, see the SDA Bible Dictionary, pp. 484-
487, "Hezekiah.")
   Meanwhile, the Assyrian forces conquered 46 villages, including the
fortress city of Lachish. Hezekiah tried to appease Sennacherib with a
massive payment of silver and gold, but to no avail (2 Kings 18:14-16;
see also the SDA Bible Dictionary, pp. 1003, 1004, "Sennacherib.").
Sennacherib gloated in his Annals, "I laid waste the large district of
Judah and made the overbearing and proud Hezekiah bow in submis-
sion."—The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Ency-
clopedia, George Arthur Buttrick, dictionary editor (Nashville, Tenn.:
Abingdon Press, 1962), vol 2: E-J, p. 600, "Hezekiah."
   While Hezekiah faced the Assyrian invasion from without, his
body was struggling with a life-threatening disease from within.
Troubles often come in droves.

   What message came to him from the prophet Isaiah, and how
did he respond? Isa. 38:1-3.


    At 39 years of age, Hezekiah was not ready to die. In response to his
weeping, Isaiah returned with this message from God: " 'I will add
fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the
hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city' " (Isa. 38:4-6, NIV).
    "Hezekiah did not conclude that it was useless to pray, as though the
prophetic message had made death inevitable. If we pray, God may be
able to do for us that which He could not do if we did not pray. Requests
for healing, however, must be made in the spirit of submission. God
alone knows whether the answering of a petition will work for the good
of those concerned and redound to [contribute to; advance] His glory."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 966:2, "Prayed."

   Why does God sometimes wait to act on our behalf until we
pray? Are you presently facing a seemingly hopeless situation?
Do you feel that praying about it is useless? Have you ever faced
situations where what you specifically asked for in prayer hadn't
come, but the mere act of praying itself gave you strength to
deal with the situation?

Tuesday                                            February 20
THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM (Isa. 36; 39).

   Hezekiah won his battle with death, but the Assyrians still con-
trolled all of Judah except Jerusalem. Why had the Lord permitted
such calamity to strike His people, even after the national revival?
Apparently, the years of prosperity that followed had undermined the
character of the nation. As stated before, often it is easier to find God
during adversity than during prosperity.

  What character weaknesses did Hezekiah and his people re-
veal? Isa. 39:1-4; 22:9-11.


   Hezekiah's pride was in his possessions rather than in God. The
king who had disposed of idol worship in Judah had a few idols of his
own! Also, he depended on the arm of flesh by making an alliance
with Egypt despite Isaiah's warning recorded in 31:1-3: "Woe to
those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in
the multitude of their chariots . . . but do not . . . seek help from the
Lord" (NIV).
   The people trusted in the city's defenses rather than in God. And
when the siege was temporarily lifted, they indulged in feasting and
drunkenness, saying " 'Let us eat and drink . . . for tomorrow we die!' "
(Isa. 22:12, 13, NIV).

  One dreaded day, the Assyrian commander appeared outside
Jerusalem and called for a conference with Hezekiah's officers
outside the city walls. How did he try to confuse and deceive
Hezekiah's men? Isa. 36:4-7; 13-20.


   Compare his words to what Satan told Eve at the tree of knowl-
edge of good and evil (Gen. 3:1-5). How does Satan use similar
strategies to confuse and deceive us?


   The commander's defiance of God was commonplace. Because of
Israel's repeated apostasies, the surrounding nations no longer feared
God, and the commander thought he could safely mock Him.

    German writer Gunther Grass once said that all he knows is
 what he sees, hears, and feels. Why do we tend to trust most in the
 things that we ourselves can see, feel, or hear? Is this one reason
 why, in wealthier nations, it's harder to spread the gospel? Think
 about these questions in the context of Hebrews 11:1.

                                                                      67

"SPREAD IT OUT BEFORE THE LORD" (Isa. 37:1-20).

  How did Hezekiah react when his officers relayed to him the
message of the Assyrian commander? Isa. 37:1-4.


   When we reach out to God, we are saying that we believe He exists
and that He will help us as He helped Hezekiah. The message the
Lord sent to him through Isaiah was, " 'Do not be afraid of what you
have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of
Assyria have blasphemed me. Listen! I am going to put a spirit in
him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own
country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword' " (Isa.
37:6, 7, NIV).
   Previously, God promised to protect Jerusalem like mother birds
hovering over their nests (Isa. 31:5), and He predicted that Assyria
would fall by "a sword, not of mortals" (vs. 8, NIV). When Hezekiah
was ill, He promised to deliver Jerusalem from the king of Assyria
(Isa. 38:6). Are God's promises not more powerful than a mighty
army?
     In answer to Hezekiah's plea for help, Sennacherib raced from
Jerusalem when he heard the news that the Egyptian army was
advancing on him. Before he left, however, he sent a letter to Hezekiah
proclaiming he would return and that no god would be able to save
Judah (Isa. 37:9-13).

     What did Hezekiah do with the letter? Isa. 37:14-17.


   Jesus encourages us to do what Hezekiah did. " 'Come unto me,' is
His invitation. Whatever your anxieties or trials, spread out your case
before the Lord. Your spirit will be braced for endurance. The way will
be opened for you to disentangle yourself from embarrassment and
difficulty. The weaker and more helpless you know yourself to be, the
stronger will you become in His strength. The heavier your burdens, the
more blessed the rest in casting them upon the Burden Bearer.
   "Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future; but Jesus sees the
end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way prepared
to bring relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide
for us of which we know nothing."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

   Take time now to spread your case out before the Lord.
Thank Him for His past care and guidance. Why is it so impor-
tant to remember the Lord's past leading in your life as you
attempt to trust Him with your future?

DELIVERANCE! (Isa. 37:14-38).

   Hezekiah's prayer was a model of what a prayer for help should
be like. What attributes of God did Hezekiah recall as he prayed?
Why were these particular characteristics of God so important at
this time? Isa. 37:16.


   What other features of this prayer do you notice? Isa. 37:17-20.


    Hezekiah's prayer emphasizes the following:
    1. A deep sense of God's presence: " 'Enthroned between the cheru-
bim' " (vs. 16, NIV). "It is a point of the first importance that we should
feel, in prayer, that God is with us in very deed and truth; that we stand in
his near presence; that the angels who inhabit the heavenly kingdom are
not more truly, though they may be more consciously, before him than
are we as we take his Name on our lips and breathe our petitions into his
ear."—The Pulpit Commentary, vol. X, part II: "The Book of the Prophet
Isaiah," chap. XXXVII, p. 29.
    2. An attitude of reverence: " 'You alone are God' " (vs. 16, NIV).
It is true that we can pray to God as to a friend, but we must never
forget that we are speaking with the Majesty of heaven, the one true
God, infinite and eternal.
    3. Complete confidence in God's power: " 'You have made heaven
and earth' " (vs. 16, NIV). "To doubt God's power to interpose on our
behalf . . . must be painful to him, and must invalidate our prayer."
—The Pulpit Commentary, vol. X, part II, XXXVII, p. 29.
    4. Confidence in His interest in us: " 'God of Israel' "(vs. 16,
NIV). "We place ourselves in accord with God's will concerning us
. . . when we assume the fact that we are the objects of his deep
solicitude, that we are near to his heart, and that he is disposed to
do all that is needful for our present well-being and future blessed-
ness." —Ibid.
    5. An unselfish spirit: " 'Deliver us . . . that all kingdoms on earth
may know that you alone . . . are God' " (vs. 20, NIV). Hezekiah was
concerned about the fate of Judah, but even more so, He was con-
cerned that God be glorified.

    In times of difficulty, what is your first reaction? Why do
 some of us seek God only when we are in trouble? If you are
 facing a difficult problem, of course you will want to pray, but
 take time now to thank God and praise Him for the many
 blessings He has given you.


                                                                          69
Friday                                             February 23
FURTHER STUDY: Review yesterday's lesson. Then read the an-
swer to Hezekiah's prayer in Isaiah 37:21-35. To learn how the Lord's
answer was fulfilled, read verses 36-38.
   Is God concerned with the fears and worries of His people today? A
comforting answer to that question is found in the chapter, "The
Invitation," The Desire of Ages, pp. 328-332. You also might want to
read the following chapters from Prophets and Kings concerning
Hezekiah: "Hezekiah," pp. 331-339; "The Ambassadors From Babylon,"
pp. 340-348; "Deliverance From Assyria," pp. 349-366.

   "Hezekiah's pleadings in behalf of Judah and of the honor of their
Supreme Ruler were in harmony with the mind of God. Solomon, in
his benediction at the dedication of the temple, had prayed the Lord
to maintain 'the cause of His people Israel at all times, as the matter
shall require: that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord
is God, and that there is none else.' 1 Kings 8:59, 60. Especially was
the Lord to show favor when, in times of war or of oppression by an
army, the chief men of Israel should enter the house of prayer and
plead for deliverance. Verses 33, 34."—Prophets and Kings, p. 359.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What spiritual warfare is the church presently engaged in?
     How can individual church members and the church as the
     body of Christ engage in prayer for deliverance from what-
     ever foes it faces?

     2. Explain how a crisis such as an accident or a serious illness
        can change our prayer habits. Look at how much suffering
        Ellen White went through. How do you think her suffering
        impacted her ministry? What can we learn from Sister
        White's experiences?

     3. What things cause us to forget to thank God and praise
        Him? Think of ways we can remember to thank and praise
        Him each day.

     4. What can people do to help their regular prayer life be
        more like their emergency prayer life?

SUMMARY: Our God is still mighty enough to save and to deliver us
from crises and from sin. Let us pray always that in the process of such
deliverance His name will be glorified, whatever the outcome of our
particular trying situation.

                            Paul Livingston

     AUSTRALIA—Pat Turton had everything—a husband she was
 proud of and a beautiful home on the coast of eastern Australia.
 But her life was empty. When John Kingston, a literature evange-
 list, visited her, Pat sensed his relationship with God and began
 asking him questions. She expressed her desire to know God, and
 Kingston arranged for Pat to take Bible studies.
     Then Pat's husband died suddenly. Pat was devastated, but she
 continued her Bible studies. However, Pat had an addiction to
 tobacco, and following her husband's death, her smoking increased.
     Pat moved to a small farm some distance away, but the peace
 she sought eluded her.
     One day an Adventist couple living near Pat received a phone
 call alerting them to Pat's interest in spiritual matters. They visited
 Pat, and she resumed Bible studies. Eventually Pat was baptized.
     But Pat had not gained complete victory over tobacco. She tried
 to hide her habit from her friends, but the habit drove a wedge
 between her and God. Soon she stopped attending church and
 pretended to be away when church members came to visit.
     Months passed; Pat tried everything she knew to win the battle
 over cigarettes. But the habit was stronger than her will. Her health
 began failing as her smoking increased to 150 cigarettes a day.
 Then she heard about the church's stop-smoking program and
 called to see if any sessions were being held in her area. None
 were. Pat asked for a "stop-smoking-at-home" kit.
     As Pat waited for the kit to arrive, she thought seriously about
 her relationship with God and her inability to stop smoking. She
 knew she needed to surrender her life fully to God before she could
 truly gain victory over cigarettes. When the stop-smoking kit ar-
 rived, Pat committed her problem to God and asked Him for the
  victory over tobacco and her will. With strength she received from
  reading the Bible and the encouragement of a trusted Adventist
  friend, Pat started the stop-smoking plan.
      With God's help she won her freedom from tobacco. She testi-
  fies that once she committed her will to God, He took away her
  desire to smoke, a desire that had enslaved her for years.
      Pat rejoices in her new life. She sings as she works and wants to
  tell everyone what God has done for her.

 The Prayer of Intercession:
          Daniel



Sabbath Afternoon
HIGH WALLS SURROUNDED ANCIENT CITIES. Sometimes
sections of a wall tumbled down, making the inhabitants vulnerable
to attack. Then strong men would stand in the gaps to protect the
sleeping citizens. At a time of national apostasy, God told Ezekiel:
" 'I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and
stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have
to destroy it, but I found none' " (Ezek. 22:30, NIV). So He permitted
the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem, devastate Judah, and take its
people captive.
      There have been great intercessors in Bible history. Abraham
bargained at length with God in behalf of Sodom's wicked populace
(Gen. 18:16-19:29). Moses pleaded for rebellious Israel, willing that
his own name be blotted out of the book of life in order that they may
live (Exod. 32:31, 32). Paul suffered such agony over his nation's
rejection of Jesus that he was willing to be cursed for its sake (Rom.
9:1-4). In this week's lesson, we will observe Daniel pleading for his
sinful people. In this role, Daniel is similar to Jesus, who always lives
to make intercession for us (Heb. 7:25).

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:

DANIEL, CHILD OF GOD (Dan. 2:14-23).

   A member of the royal family, Daniel grew up in the court of good
King Josiah. As a child, he no doubt read the book of Deuteronomy,
newly discovered after being lost during the reign of wicked king
Manasseh (2 Chron. 34:14; Deut. 31:24-26). As he heard King
Josiah pledge to follow the Lord and obey the words of the covenant
written in the book (2 Chron. 34:31), his young heart must have
thrilled with the resolve to do the same. From then on, the book of
Deuteronomy probably exerted a profound influence on his life.
   The boy Daniel must have heard Jeremiah plead with the people
of Judah to return to their divine Husband (Jer. 3); and he must
have been dismayed by their stubborn resistance. When Daniel was
a teenager, a tragic event occurred—King Josiah died in battle.
Daniel must have mourned deeply, along with Jeremiah and all the
people (2 Chron. 35:23-25). Josiah's successors were weak men
who rebelled against the rising power of Babylon, provoking
Nebuchadnezzar and his armies to enter Jerusalem, plunder the
temple, capture some hostages from the royal family, and take
them on approximately a 480-mile trek to Babylon (Dan. 1:3, 4).
Daniel was one of these hostages.

  Read Daniel 1:17-20 and 2:1-18. What do these events tell us
about Daniel's character and his regard for prayer?


  Now read Daniel's prayer of thanksgiving in 2:19-23. What
concept about God does each of the following verses teach us?

   Dan. 2:20


   Dan. 2:21


   Dan. 2:22


   Dan. 2:23


    Before going to King Nebuchadnezzar with the interpretation
 to his strange dream, Daniel thanked God for answering his
 prayer for the wisdom to understand the dream. How do you
 respond, however, when what you pray for doesn't come as you
 ask? Why is it important to praise the Lord, anyway?

                                                                  73
Monday                                             February 26
DANIEL'S DEVOTIONAL LIFE (Dan. 6).

   The year 539 B.C. was a tumultuous time in Daniel's life. Now in
his eighties, he witnessed the fall of Babylon, under the midnight
attack of the Persians, and the ascent of Darius the Mede to the
throne (Dan. 5:30, 31; 9:1). Darius showed extraordinary confidence
in Daniel by inducting him into his government with the intention of
making him prime minister. The political feuding caused by this plan
nearly cost Daniel his life (chap. 6).
   In the midst of this turmoil, Daniel's heart grew heavy with a
deeper concern: What was to become of his people? From Jeremiah's
prophecy, he believed the time had come for the Jews to return to
their homeland after 70 years in exile (Jer. 25:11, 12). He may even
have hoped that the return would usher in the new-earth state, for
Isaiah's prophecies blended the two events (see Isa. 35; 66). However,
his own visions over past decades pointed to a succession of oppres-
sive empires, climaxing with an evil power that would trample the
saints and the sanctuary before God would set up His kingdom and
restore the sanctuary. To the aging Daniel, hoping for the speedy
restoration of his people, city, and sanctuary, this was a bitter disap-
pointment. He seems to have thought that the 70-year captivity would
be prolonged because of the people's sins.
   Imagine we have a camera lens that can look into the past. Notice
Daniel's study on the second floor of his home on the palace grounds.
It contains an extensive library, for Daniel is a man of letters,
familiar with many languages and cultures (1:17). We especially
notice the well-worn Hebrew Scriptures—the books of Moses, the
chronicles of Israel, and the writings of Jeremiah.
   In the afternoon Daniel enters, his figure stooped with age and
clothed in sackcloth, as he opens a scroll to the prophecy of Jeremiah
and kneels before the west window facing Jerusalem, where He prays
daily at the time of the morning and evening sacrifice and also at
noon (Dan. 6:10; 9:21; Ps. 55:17).

   Why was it necessary for Daniel to pray for something God
had already promised? Why should he agonize over the future of
his people if it were already determined?


   Why did Daniel, in chapter six pray in his usual manner,
even with the death threats against him? Was there any specific
command he would have been violating if he closed the window
or prayed in secret? Why put himself in such danger? Is there
some specific lesson the Lord wants to teach us through this
incident? If so, what?

DANIEL INTERCEDES (Dan. 9:1-19).

   What promise gave Daniel the confidence to pray for his people?
Jer. 29:10-14.


   "God did not forget his people, even though they were captive in
Babylon. He planned to give them a new beginning with a new
purpose—to turn them into new people. In times of deep trouble it
may appear as though God has forgotten you. But God may be
preparing you, as he did the people of Judah, for a new beginning
with him at the center. . . .
   "According to God's wise plan, his people were to have hope and a
future; consequently they could call upon him in confidence. Al-
though the exiles were in a difficult place and time, they should not
despair because they had God's presence, the privilege of prayer, and
God's grace. God can be sought and found when we seek him
wholeheartedly. Neither strange lands, sorrows, frustration, nor physical
problems can break that communion."—Life Application Study Bible
(NIV), p. 1339.

  As you read Daniel's prayer, summarize the sins that led to
captivity. Dan. 9:5-14.


   What special sin was Israel guilty of committing? Dan. 9:6.


   Israel's history shows that it is dangerous to despise God's prophets.
Are we guilty of this sin today? God has entrusted us with expressions
of His love by revealing to us wonderful truths through the prophetic
ministry of Ellen G. White. Have we undermined these messages by
disputing how they were given rather than what they say? Or have we
simply not bothered to read them? Or do we reject them because they
condemn sin in our lives?

  What verses in Daniel's prayer show that he trusted in the
mercy of a gracious God?


    Part of Daniel 9:13 often translated "and understand thy truth"
 could also be translated "and prosper in thy truth." Why has God
 revealed truth to us? How can we prosper in that truth? Have we,
 either as a church, or even as individuals, prospered in God's truth as
 much as we could? Explain your answer.

                                                                      75

GOD'S ANSWER TO DANIEL'S PLEA (Dan. 9:20-27).

   In his prayer, Daniel requested that the God who brought Israel
out of Egypt with a mighty hand would bring His people out of
Babylon (Dan. 9: 15, 16) and that He would restore His city and His
sanctuary without further delay.

   In what ways was God's answer encouraging to Daniel person-
ally? Dan. 9:20-23.


   After greeting Daniel with words of personal encouragement, the
angel Gabriel told him that after 70 years of captivity, his people
could look forward to 70 weeks (490 years) of blessings, mingled
with conflict (vs. 24).
   The 70-week period would begin with a decree to restore and build
Jerusalem, but the rebuilding would be difficult (vs. 25). Though
various decrees regarding the city had been issued, the decree speci-
fied by Gabriel was issued in 457 B.C. by Artaxerxes (Ezra 7; see also
the SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 80, "Artaxerxes."). For details on this
date, see the The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 852-855.

   Daniel also had prayed about the desolate sanctuary (Dan.
9:17). What future was there for it? Dan. 9:24, 26, 27.


   "Gabriel is sent by God, and Daniel receives new light. We may
find, especially in spiritual matters, that there is a real exertion of
energy on God's side in response to prayer. He is not a passive hearer
of prayer. His answers are not the mere echoes of sympathy. They
carry active aid. . . .
   "Daniel prays for the restoration of his people. God answers the
prayer by revealing the already settled purpose of this restoration.
God often answers prayer in a different way from our expectation.
Sometimes he opens our eyes to blessings already given, but not
recognized. . . . Sometimes he changes our desires, and inclines our
hearts to rest in his will by showing us that it is better than our will.
The best prayer is that in which we seek to be reconciled to the will of
God [see Matt. 26:39]."—H. D. M. Spense and Joseph S. Exell,
editors, The Pulpit Commentary (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson Pub-
lishers), vol. XIII, part I, p. 278.

   Why do you think Daniel received such a quick answer to his
prayer? Notice, too, that Daniel was not praying for himself but
for others. Are your prayers selfish and self-centered?

THE ULTIMATE ANSWER TO THE SIN PROBLEM (Dan.
9:24-27).

    The biggest burden that weighed Daniel down was the sinfulness
of his people. Gabriel's message contained a more magnificent an-
swer to the sin problem than Daniel imagined, because it contained
the solution for not only his own people's sin but for the sins of the
whole world.

  Daniel confessed that his people had no righteousness of their
own (vs. 18). How would God supply their lack? Dan. 9:24, 25.


   God would bring in a supply of everlasting righteousness that
would be enough to counteract all the wickedness of the human
race (Rom. 5:18). He would do this through the coming of the
Messiah, Jesus Christ. He alone could atone for sin. He alone could
bring in everlasting righteousness, because He alone possessed the
"righteousness of God" (Rom. 3:21, 22), the righteousness that He
credits to all who truly believe.
   Daniel 9 tell us what must happen to the Messiah in order to make
the atonement for sin. Jesus emptied Himself of His glory and rank.
His unity with the Father was broken up; His human support dried
up. His life was "cut off." He gave until nothing more remained to be
given.
   "Before Gabriel had satisfied Daniel with respect to Israel's earthly
fortune, he poured into Daniel's ear what was uppermost in his own
mind—the advent of the Son of God. The grandeur, the value, the
triumphant issues of Messiah's work,—these were the tidings which
he delighted to convey. The revelation which, in any age, man most
needs is revelation respecting the removal of sin—knowledge how
the great redemption can be accomplished. No tidings from heaven
can ever be so joyous as these . . . that sin shall meet with final
destruction, and that reconciliation between God and man is made
secure."—The Pulpit Commentary, vol. XIII, part I, p. 287.

  It was in response to Daniel's prayer that this wonderful prophecy
was given, a prophecy that 500 years before the event gave the
dates and basic work of Jesus. What can this tell us about the
importance of prayer and how God often acts in response to our
prayers?

    Suppose Daniel had not prayed as he did. Would we not have
 been given this prophecy?

                                                                     77
Friday                                                    March 2
FURTHER STUDY: As our study this week shows, intercessory
prayers can bring powerful results. Even though God is all-powerful
and all-knowing, such prayers can change the world and individual
lives. Read what else the Bible has to say on intercessory prayer in
1 Timothy 2:1-6. Praying for others reminds us that we are not alone
in our joys and sorrows and that others have special needs as well.
Praying for others helps us to focus outward, not inward.
   Read "Daniel's Prayers" in The Sanctified Life, pp. 46-52.

   "Prayers of intercession give God permission to work in another
person's life. Our prayers for healing, salvation, or protection are
unhindered by distance, political borders, or locked doors. We can
surround loved ones thousands of miles away with the protection of
holy angels through prayer. Our prayers can reach wherever God can
reach.
   "A spirit of intercession will come among God's people before
He comes. About this experience, Ellen White wrote: 'Many were
praising God. The sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought.
A spirit of intercession was seen, even as was manifested before
the great Day of Pentecost' (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9,
p. 126)."—Dorothy Eaton Watts, Prayer Country: A Tour Guide to
the Wonders of Prayer (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press® Publishing
Association, 1993), pp. 116, 117.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Daniel's prayer in chapter 9 is not only an intercessory
     prayer, it is a model prayer for forgiveness. What charac-
     teristics mark it as such?

     2. The inspiration for all true prayer comes from God's at-
        tributes and character. Which of God's attributes moti-
        vated Daniel's prayer in chapter 9? Why did he concen-
        trate on these particular characteristics?

     3. Daniel prayed for some of Judah's specific needs. What
        needs in your church and community could you pray for?

SUMMARY: The only solution to the problem of sin is the sacrifice
of the Messiah. It is the privilege of each of us to ask forgiveness for
our own sins and to intercede for others by claiming the atoning blood
of Jesus.

                   Merlinton Pastor de Oliveira

    BRAZIL—Jose was not interested in religion. He was young and
had no time for God. When his mother and sister became Adventists,
he often made fun of their new religion.
   One day the teenager awoke with pain in his joints. Within a few
days, his entire body ached. The doctor told him that he had rheuma-
tism, a condition that causes the body's joints to become painfully
inflamed. The doctor ordered hospital treatment and bed rest.
   Jose was angry and frustrated. He wanted to work, to spend time
with his friends, and to ride his motorcycle. Time hung heavy on his
hands. With nothing to do all day, he reluctantly began reading some
books that his sister offered him. Later she persuaded him to take Bible
studies. But he was still not willing to accept Jesus as his Savior.
    After a month in bed, Jose could not stand it any longer. He began
going out with his friends for a drink or some fun.
   One Saturday Jose and his friends were invited to a wedding party.
There would be plenty of alcohol, music, and girls. Jose did not want to
miss it! Jose and a buddy eagerly mounted his motorcycle and sped
toward the party. Jose slowed down for a speed bump in the road, but
the car behind him did not see the bump or slow down. Jose saw the
car's headlights approaching and realized that it was going to hit them!
    Suddenly Jose flew through the air and hit the pavement. He lay
stunned for several seconds. Then he sat up and looked around. His
motorcycle lay in a heap of twisted metal some 250 feet (80 meters)
away. He looked for his friend but could not see him.
    "Eugenio!" he called out, but he heard no answer. Then he saw his
friend, lying under the car that had hit them. Jose stumbled over to his
friend. Neither one of them had been wearing a helmet, and Jose could
see that his friend had suffered serious head injuries. He was bleeding
heavily, but he was alive.
    A bus driver who had seen the accident offered to take the boys to
the hospital, and Jose accepted, for an ambulance might take too long,
and his friend needed help right away.
    The doctors examined Jose and released him, but his friend had
suffered massive head injuries. He was in intensive care, and the
outlook was not good.

     Prayer: Listening to Jesus




Sabbath Afternoon
HUDSON TAYLOR, GREAT MISSIONARY TO CHINA, carried
staggering burdens—the mission of bringing Christ to all of China,
despite personal sickness, persecution, and heavy administrative re-
sponsibilities. When in communion with Christ, these burdens seemed
light. When separated from Christ, he felt like a diver under water
without air, or he felt like a fireman on a burning building with an
empty hose. "I continually mourn that I follow at such a distance my
precious Master," he wrote to a trusted friend. "I cannot tell you how I
am buffeted sometimes by temptation. I never knew how bad a heart I
had." Nearness to Christ had been so precious that any distance—any
clouding of the Master's face—was unbearable.
   The reply he received from his friend changed his life. He
gathered his fellow workers around him to tell them what the Lord had
done for his soul. "I looked to Jesus," he said, and "Oh, how joy
flowed!" Thus, other hearts were moved and blessed and "rivers of
living water" flowed forth that still flow today.
   As you study this week's lesson, learn more about the reply Taylor
received and how it can transform your life.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Sitting Down With Jesus (John 14:1).
 11. The Future Is Now! (John 14:1-3).
I11. No Real Separation (John 14:4-6; 15-23).
IV. "I Am the Vine; You Are the Branches" (John 15:1-11, NIV).
 V. How to Bear Fruit (John 15:1-16).

MEMORY TEXT: "Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch
cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can
you, unless you abide in Me" (John 15:4, NKJV).

SITTING DOWN WITH JESUS (John 14:1).

   If you wanted to sit down for an intimate conversation with Jesus,
you probably would not choose the evening of His arrest and trial.
Jesus, though, reserved those last hours for a special season of fellow-
ship with His disciples. This week, let us join Him in our own "upper
room" of communion with Him as we learn that prayer is not just
talking with Jesus. It also is listening to what He has to say to each of
us individually.

  On that last evening alone with His disciples, what was Jesus'
concern for them? John 14:1.


   Instead of being overwhelmed with His own approaching ordeal,
He sought to dispel the gloom that had fallen on them all. His actual
words were "Believe into God—believe also into me." The peculiar
expression believe into is found only in John's gospel. Believing into
Jesus means more than intellectual belief. It means entering into
intimate fellowship with Jesus, becoming one with Him (John 17:20,
21). When we have such a relationship, it will be second nature for us
to spend time listening to Him.
   When our hearts are troubled by our daily cares, it is impossible to
trust in Jesus. Without this trust, it is impossible for us to listen to
Him.

  What comforting promises did Jesus give His disciples to pre-
pare them for the long separation from Him? John 14:2-4.


   In Jesus' day, when a young man was betrothed to a woman, he
would go back to his father's house to prepare a home for her on his
father's property. After the home was ready, he would bring her to
the house he had prepared. Jesus applied the language of betrothal,
the language of love, to His disciples. He was going to His Father's
house in heaven to prepare a place for His bride, the church. Some
day, He will come to claim her, "that where I am there you may be
also."
   While the bride-to-be is separated from her fiancé, surely every
thought centers upon him in some way. This is how it should be with
us while we wait for Jesus to return. If we are so focused on Him, His
voice will be the first and only sound we hear in our "upper rooms."

   How do you respond to someone who says "I try to commune
 with God, but I never hear Him talk to me"?

                                                                      81

THE FUTURE IS NOW! (John 14:1-3).

   Most of us are well acquainted with John 14:1-3. Deeper meanings,
however, lie in these verses than we usually see. John, more than the
other Gospel writers, caught a magnificent element of Jesus' teaching
that scholars sometimes call "present eschatology." Eschatology is the
study of last-day events, such as the judgment, the resurrection, Jesus'
ascension to heaven, the gift of eternal life, and dwelling with Jesus.
In Jesus' teaching, all these events occur in the present, as well. He
often speaks with double meanings so the spiritual invades the literal,
heaven invades earth, and the future invades the present. Following
are two examples:
   1. We read in John 13:30 that "Judas . . . went out and it was
night" (NIV). Literally, it was night. However, Judas also entered a
spiritual night from which he would not return.
   2. In John 12:32, Jesus says " 'I, when I am lifted up from the earth,
will draw all people to myself' " (NRSV). Jesus was lifted up physi-
cally on the cross. He also is highly exalted through the Cross.
   When we are alone with Jesus in our "upper room," listening to
what He has to say, these deeper meanings become especially clear
and appropriate to us personally.

     Explain the spiritual meanings in the following verses.

     John 13:10

     John 1:51

     John 5:25; Eph. 2:1-5

   Jesus loved to bring the blessings of eternity into the present. We
pass from death to life at the resurrection, but the spiritually dead can
come to life and receive eternal life now (John 5:24, 25; 3:36; 6:54).
This does not mean unending life on the horizontal level but a vertical
connection with God that transforms our earthly existence. We recog-
nize these blessings, receive them, and nurture our connection with God
in our "upper rooms," where "we allow inner distractions and frustra-
tions to melt away before him as snow before the sun"; where we "allow
him to calm the storms that rage within by saying, 'Peace, be still.' "
—Richard J. Foster, Prayer: Finding the Heart's True Home (San
Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992), p. 162.

   Which of these blessings, mentioned above by Foster, have
 you experienced in a very personal way?

NO REAL SEPARATION (John 14:4-6; 15-23).

    The promise of reunion with Jesus at His second advent comforted the
disciples. Jesus knew, however, that this was not enough to cheer their sad
hearts. Therefore, He also promised to give them, in this life, the blessings
of the future He had just listed. After Jesus told the disciples He was going
away, He added, "And you know the way where I am going" (John 14:4,
RSV). Which way was that? Thomas confessed total ignorance (vs. 5).

  Read Jesus' explanation in verse 6. Explain in your own words
how to go to the Father.


   Notice how Jesus shifted from a literal journey toward the Father's
house to a spiritual journey. Going to the Father's house is not just a
future experience when Jesus comes the second time. By believing
"into" God and Jesus (vs. 1)—by becoming one with Them—we go to
the Father.

   Jesus said, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself"
(vs. 3). How does He come to us now?

   John 14:16-18




   Here is an amazing fact about the members of the Godhead—when
you have One, you have the Others too. Just as the fullness of the
Godhead dwells in Jesus (Col. 1:19), so the whole Godhead comes
when the Spirit enters in (compare with John 14:23). Jesus comes to
each of us when His Spirit comes to our hearts.

   Where is God's special "dwelling place" now? John 14:23.


    Jesus' going away "is not really a departure but the opening of a
door into a new age where the presence of the Father, Son, and Spirit
is eternally guaranteed to the believer."—Walter R. L. Scragg, Adventist
Review (Nov. 27, 1980), p. 5.

    In your "upper room," the Holy Spirit attunes your ears to
 the special words God desires to say to you only. What can you
 do to open yourself to this intimate relationship with God? What
 things can interfere?

                                                                          83

"I AM THE VINE; YOU ARE THE BRANCHES" (John 15:1-11,
NIV).

  Jesus continues His private instruction with the disciples in the
upper room by teaching them that He is the vine and they are the
branches (John 15:5). Explain what He means.


    Jesus did not say He was the stem and we are the branches. He is
the total vine, and we, as branches, are part of Him! Christ is one
with His people like a husband and wife are one, like a temple with
its foundation are one, and closer yet, like a person with a body united
to its head is one (Eph. 5:31, 32; 2:19, 20; 1:22, 23).
    It was this concept of the vine and its branches that transformed
Hudson Taylor's life. Shortly after his transformation, he met his
friend Mr. Judd, who had replied to his letter. Mr. Judd later recalled
Hudson Taylor exclaiming, " ' "Oh, Mr. Judd, God has made me a
new man! God has made me a new man! . . ." ' " Later, Hudson
himself rejoiced, " 'I have not got to make myself a branch. . . . The
Lord Jesus tells me I am a branch. I am part of Him, and have just to
believe it and act upon it. If I go to the bank in Shanghai . . . and ask
for fifty dollars, the clerk cannot refuse it to my . . . hand and say that
it belongs to Mr. Taylor. What belongs to Mr. Taylor my hand may
take. It is a member of my body. And I am a member of Christ, and
may take all I need of His fulness.' " Mr. Judd commented, " 'He was
a joyous man now, . . . a bright, happy Christian. He had been a
toiling, burdened one before, . . . with . . . not much rest of soul. It was
resting in Jesus now, and letting Him do the work—which makes all
the difference!' "—Dr. and Mrs. Howard Taylor, Hudson Taylor and
the China Inland Mission (London: China Inland Mission, 1955),
pp. 172, 173.

   Is the vine a symbol of Jesus and the individual or of Jesus and
the body of believers? John 15:5-8. Explain your answer.


   All the "you" pronouns in the Greek are plural. The closest bonding
that human beings can possibly experience occurs when hearts are
united through mutual love for Jesus.

   The goal of being alone with Jesus in your "upper room" is to
be so united with Him that you will be one of the living, vibrant
branches growing from the Vine. To be so, a necessary part of
prayer is being still and knowing that He is God (Ps. 46:10).
Then we are nourished as the vine nourishes the branches.

HOW TO BEAR FRUIT (John 15:1-16).

   Explain our function as branches of the Vine. What effort does
a branch make to bear fruit? John 15:4, 5.


   Jesus made us the loveliest part of the vine—the part that bears
flowers and fruit. A branch does not bear fruit by struggling but by its
connection with the vine.

   In John's Gospel, what is meant by fruit? Look at the following
verses in their setting: John 4:35; 12:24; 17:20.


   How does one abide in Jesus? What role does the Word have in
this process? John 15:7. What role does love have? Verse 9.


   "The scion is engrafted into the living vine, and fiber by fiber, vein
by vein, it grows into the vine stock. The life of the vine becomes the
life of the branch. . . . The sinner unites his weakness to Christ's
strength, his emptiness to Christ's fullness, his frailty to Christ's
enduring might. Then he has the mind of Christ. The humanity of
Christ has touched our humanity, and our humanity has touched
divinity."—The Desire of Ages, p. 675.

  What privileges come with abiding in Christ? John 15:7, 16.
See also John 14:12-14; 16:23, 24.


   When our mind is one with the mind of God and our will is in
harmony with His, we can approach the Lord with faith and assur-
ance. "He is well pleased when [His people] make the very highest
demands upon Him, that they may glorify His name. They may expect
large things if they have faith in His promises."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 668.
   Our highest wish and the Father's greatest pleasure will be that we
bear fruit that will remain through all eternity (John 15:16). To stand
by the throne of God and see souls that we have won and whom they,
in turn, have won will be pure joy!

    What is it about prayer that makes us more open to the
 Lord? What does prayer do to us that enables the Lord to work
 in our lives? What happens to a Christian who neglects prayer?


                                                                      85

FURTHER STUDY: This week's lesson has only sunk a few test
holes into the riches we can mine from John 14 and 15. For deeper
insights, read both chapters in their entirety. As you do, constantly ask
yourself how you can apply Jesus' promises in these chapters to your
life.
    Also read "Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled" in The Desire of
Ages, pp. 662-680.

   "In all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life
that is not in harmony with the world, its customs, or its practices;
and everyone needs to have a personal experience in obtaining a
knowledge of the will of God. We must individually hear Him speak-
ing to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness
we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the
voice of God. He bids us, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' Ps.
46:10. Here alone can true rest be found."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 363.
   "Be still. Literally, 'let be,' desist,"give up.' God Himself speaks
these sublime words. The first clause of this verse [Ps. 46:10] has
been paraphrased: 'Hush! Cease your tumult and realize that I am
God.' We talk too much and listen too little."—The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 3, p. 745:10, "Be still."

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What causes us to "talk too much" in many of our prayer
     sessions?

     2. List and discuss ways we can prevent our prayer sessions
        from being one-sided—where we do all the talking and God
        does all the listening.

     3. In many ways, prayer is a means of dying to self. What does
        this mean, and why is that so important for our spiritual
        life?

SUMMARY: Though Jesus has departed from this world, He has not
left us alone. He has promised that the entire Godhead will come and
make Their home with us in the Person of the Holy Spirit. Our
greatest responsibility and privilege is to abide continually in Jesus.
One way of doing so is to meet with Him in our "upper room," where
we can shut the door against the clamor of life and listen to what He
has to say.

             Another Chance for Jose, Part 2
                   Merlinton Pastor de Oliveira

   BRAZIL—Jose and his friend were riding their motorcycle to a
party when they were struck by a car. Jose was not seriously
injured, but his friend suffered massive head injuries and lay
unconscious in the intensive care unit of the nearest hospital.
   After being released from the hospital, Jose went to the police
station to file an accident report. It was after midnight when he
finally started for home. He had not called his mother to tell her of
the accident, because he knew she would worry.
   As he made his way home along the quiet city streets, Jose
thought about the accident, thought about his friend's life, which
hung on a thread because of another driver's inattention. Jose
realized that his own life could have ended that same instant. He
knew that if he had died his life would have been without purpose
and without God.
   He remembered the times he had made fun of God and of his
mother's faith. But now he was ready to turn his life over to God.
   Arriving home, he opened the door and found his mother wait-
ing up for him. She stared at him, dirty and torn and bruised, while
he told her what had happened. When he finished he looked at her
and said, "Mother, I want to give my life to Jesus." Mother and son
knelt together, while Jose asked Jesus to take over his life.
    Jose's friend died a few hours later. And in a sense, Jose also
died that day. His former life of pleasure and carelessness in
regard to sin died, and in its place was born a new life in Christ, a
life that had purpose and meaning.
    Jose had quit school, but after the accident he resumed his
education with a new zeal and purpose. Today, three years after
the accident that took the life of his friend and forever changed his
own life, Jose is studying at the Adventist college in northeastern
Brazil, where he is preparing for the ministry. He wants others to
know what can happen to them if they choose to live a life of self-
seeking and carelessness. But Jose also wants them to know that
with Christ living in their hearts their lives can become a wonder-
ful adventure with God.

     The High Priestly Prayer:
              Jesus


Sabbath Afternoon
HEAVEN AND EARTH ONCE WERE AT ONE WITH EACH
OTHER. Then sin came and drove them apart. It is Satan's mission
to break up all godly unions—whether it be marriage, the family, the
church, or tribes and nations. John's Gospel paints the contrast be-
tween heaven and earth as follows:

     The World Above       God         Light        Life      Truth

     The World Below       Satan     Darkness      Death      Lies

   Jesus came to bring life to a world of death, light to a world in
darkness, truth to a place of lies. He descended from the world above
to be the ladder uniting the two realms. In Jesus, divinity and human-
ity are united so that He becomes our High Priest, representing God
to us and us to God. He brought heaven down to earth, and at His
ascension, lifted humanity up to God.
   As you study this week's prayer, examine your heart to see what
Jesus' conversation with God means to you personally.

"THE HOUR HAS COME" (John 17:1-5, RSV).

   Concluding their time in the upper room, Jesus gathered His eleven
disciples around Him and lifted them up in prayer. First, He prayed for
Himself (vss. 1-5), then for His disciples (vss. 6-19), and finally for all
believers. Thus, Jesus has prayed for you (vss. 20-26).
   Christ's "hour" had come. "The hour" had been planned since the
foundation of the world. He had anticipated His "hour" throughout
His life on earth. To Him, the hour of His death was His hour of
glory: He would glorify His Father, and His Father would glorify Him
(John 17:1).

  What glory was there in being lifted up on the cross? What
would He accomplish through it?

   John 12:23, 24

   John 12:31

   John 12:32


   The crucifixion appeared to be anything but glorious. At the cross-
roads of the world, Jesus would be stripped of all human dignity and
degraded by the very people He came to save. Incredibly, though, to
Him it was an hour of supreme glory. He was about to illumine the
world and the onlooking universe with a glory never before witnessed,
though He and the Father had shared this glory before They created the
world (17:5)—the glory of self-sacrificing love. Jesus was anticipating
the grand results of His suffering on the cross (Isa. 53:10, 11).

  What was Jesus' secret of being jubilant in the face of a cruel
death? John 17:13; Heb. 12:2.


   Through faith, Jesus transcended time and space. He could see the
glory of the future and bring it into the present darkness. He could
rise above earthly gloom to the presence of His Father (John 17). He
invites us also to "come to the Father" through Him (14:6). We may
"come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
find grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16).

   Look again at Hebrews 4:16. What do the promises in there
 mean? What does it mean to approach God "boldly"? How
 could you, right now, or in any "time of need," apply the
 promises in this text to your life?

                                                                        89

MUTUAL OWNERSHIP (John 17:6-10).

  Jesus rejoiced because He had completed the work God gave
Him to do (John 17:4). What work was that? Verses 6, 8, 12.


    Jesus considered that His mission on earth was to reveal the Father to
His disciples so they could share this revelation with the world. He had
sown the seed. They were to sow more seeds and reap the harvest (4:35-
38), making their work greater in extent than His (14:12). All subse-
quent generations would believe in Jesus through their efforts (17:20).
    In verse 8, Jesus tells His Father two things about the eleven men
listening to His prayer:
    1. They had accepted Jesus' teachings, unlike the Pharisees and
others who had heard Him.
    2. They knew beyond a doubt where Jesus had come from, and
acceptance of this led them into further truth.

     List the possessions the Father and the Son hold jointly. John 17:5-10.


  Jesus and His Father do not own separate bank accounts. They
share everything jointly, and we are one of Their most precious
possessions.

     How do we become God's "possession"?

     John 3:16-18

     John 12:32

     John 14:6

     John 15:16


   Both the Father and the Son work for our salvation. The Father
draws us to Jesus (6:44), and Jesus draws us to Him by His Cross
(12:32). In this sense, we are Their property, obtained at great cost to
Them, and They derive great joy from us. We have a role to play, too,
however. We must respond to God's drawing power.

    How does knowing that we have been "bought" at such a
 great price change our views about ourselves? What does it tell
 us about our worth?

"FATHER, KEEP THEM" (John 17:11-19, RSV).

   What was Jesus' great concern as He faced separation from His
disciples? John 17:11.


   "Jesus is about to leave; hence He commits the disciples to His
Father's care. . . . They would be left in an evil world and would need
special grace in their battle against sin. This keeping power every
Christian may claim. God will not suffer him to be tempted above
what he is able to bear (1 Cor. 10:13). He is impregnable to the
assaults of Satan so long as he battles in the strength and light of
Heaven. However, God keeps only those who choose to be kept. When
against divine counsel men willfully place themselves upon the enemy's
ground they cannot expect to be preserved by the power of God."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1052:11, "Keep."
   Though it's so easy to forget, we do live in a world where super-
natural forces are always at work. In our humanity, with our own
carnal and worldly weapons, we are incapable of fighting against
those powers that are hostile to us. We can no more fight Satan on
our own than we could shoot down a military jet with a slingshot.
That's why we have to rely on Divine power, the power of God. More
than anything else, prayer is the method by which we grasp hold of
that power—as did Christ.
   "As a man He supplicated the throne of God till His humanity was
charged with a heavenly current that should connect humanity with
divinity. Through continual communion He received life from God,
that He might impart life to the world."—The Desire of Ages, p. 363.
Through our prayer life, we may be so charged with the power of self-
sacrificing love that our faces radiate the glory of God—His name on
our foreheads.
   Jesus saw in His disciples the seed of His church that would spread
over continents and ages to become a great multitude that could not be
numbered, standing before the throne, praising Him for His salvation
(Rev. 7:9, 10). This was Jesus' joy, and in John 17:13 He prays that
we will experience this same joy in full measure. In order for us to do
so, we must learn to abide in Him as branches abide in the vine (lesson
10). Then we will experience the power of God's name and the joy of
serving Him.

    There's a phrase that supposedly someone once used in the
 heat of a military battle: "Praise the Lord, but pass the ammu-
 nition!" What do you think this means? How could you apply
 that principle to your own life? Or should you even apply it?


                                                                    91

IN THE WORLD BUT NOT OF THE WORLD (John 17:13-19).

  Why does the world hate Jesus and His people? John 17:14;
15:18, 19.


   "Because Christ's followers don't cooperate with the world by
joining in their sin, they are living accusations against the world's
immorality. The world follows Satan's agenda, and Satan is the
avowed enemy of Jesus and his people."—Life Application Study
Bible (NIV), p. 1916. Jesus told Peter that Satan wanted to "have"
him. The adversary of souls claims every sinner as his own (Zech.
3:1; Jude 9; Rev. 12:10). For this reason, Jesus guards us. He does not
want to lose a single soul.
   " 'I [Jesus] give them eternal life, and they shall never perish and
no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out
of the Father's hand. I and the Father are one' " (John 10:28-30,
RSV).
   Grasp a coin in your left hand. You are just as secure in the hand
of Jesus, even more so. Then wrap your right hand around your left
hand. You are secure in the Father's hand as well. When tempted to
doubt your own salvation, claim the promise that both Jesus and the
Father will hold you firmly in Their hands.

     List and explain the things Jesus and His people have in common.

     John 17:13,16


     John 17:18,19


   In Jesus' high priestly prayer, He "put his whole soul into an
adoration of thanksgiving to the Father for allowing him to suffer for
the world. . . . [A]11 through the prayer he keeps speaking of his
disciples as a gift of God to him. . . . Lovingly and trustfully he
commits them to the Father's watchfulness and care. . . . that they
may hold together, and be one in heart and mind and purpose."
—George Arthur Buttrick, editor, The Interpreter's Bible (Nashville,
Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1952), vol. VIII, p. 742.

   Why would Jesus, the Son of God, need to consecrate Him-
self? What does this say about the importance of consecrating
ourselves to God?

"THAT THEY MAY ALL BE ONE" (John 17:20-26, RSV).

   After Jesus prayed specifically for His eleven disciples, He broad-
ened His prayer to include "those who will believe . . . through their
[the disciples'] message" (John 17:20, NIV).

   What was Jesus' supreme wish for those of us who followed His
disciples? John 17:21-23.


   Why is it so important that this wish be fulfilled?


   The Father and the Son are closely bonded together. They never
act independently but always are united in everything They do (John
5:20-23). They share a common love for fallen humanity to the extent
that the Father sacrificed His Son, and the Son sacrificed His life
(3:16; 10:15). Neither one seeks His own glory, but each brings glory
to the Other (17:1). To know One is to know the Other (14:7, 9). This
type of relationship is what Christ desires for us, the members of His
church.
    The unity Jesus is speaking of is "an expression of the creative
diversity within the Godhead. As there is only one 'true God' who
manifests Himself through differing functions of Father, Son, and
Spirit, so the loving unity of the body of believers is expressed
through a rich variety of gifts and ministry. The whole family of
God is a beautiful montage [picture] of differing cultures and
temperaments, colors and gifts, offered to God in worship and
ministry that He may be glorified."—Lloyd J. Ogilvie, general
editor, and Royce L. Fredrickson, The Communicator's Commen-
tary: John, vol. 4, p. 258.
     Love is the "glue" that will hold us together in Christian unity
(17:26). Love, oneness, and glory are closely related. Love holds the
universe together. Selfishness tears it apart. We find the Christian
definition of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. Sometime during the
 remainder of this week, read and meditate upon this definition.

    How do you deal with a church member who is upset by
 things happening in the church and is thus causing disunity? At
 the same time, is unity at any cost a biblical principle? For
 example, if a group of church members, or even a pastor, were
 teaching that the Sabbath was no longer binding and that vio-
 lating it was not a sin, would dealing with them be appropriate,
 even at the cost of unity? Who decides over which factors, if any,
 are worth splitting a church?

                                                                    93
Friday                                               March 16
FURTHER STUDY: To reflect further on the theme of love and
oneness as expressed in Jesus' prayer in John 17, read the following:
Psalm 133; Ephesians 4:1-16; 1 John 3:I, 11-24; 4:7-21.
  Also read The Desire of Ages, pp. 680.

   Jesus' prayer in John 17 "is a lesson regarding the intercession
that the Saviour would carry on within the veil, when His great
sacrifice in behalf of men, the offering of Himself, should have been
completed. Our Mediator gave His disciples this illustration of His
ministration in the heavenly sanctuary in behalf of all who will come
to Him in meekness and humility, emptied of all selfishness, and
believing in His power to save (MS 29, 1906)."—Ellen G. White
Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1145, "Illustration
of Jesus' Intercession in Heavenly Santuary."

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What does Jesus' high priestly prayer teach you personally
     about His present work in your behalf? With such a prayer
     as this, how should we view the work He is presently doing
     for us?

     2. When we read Jesus' prayer in John 17, we are struck by
        how easily He talked with His Father. What can we learn
        from this example about conversational prayer?

     3. When Jesus prayed this prayer, it was a very special mo-
        ment in His life. List and discuss special moments in the
        lives of people and the church when prayer is essential.

     4. In what specific ways does Jesus' prayer apply to His fol-
        lowers and the church today? How might the church be
        changed if we made Jesus' prayer our prayer?

SUMMARY: Just before Jesus went forth to die, He consecrated His
disciples and all succeeding believers to His Father through prayer.
The bonds of God's love are the power we need to draw the unbeliev-
ing world to Christ. Pray daily for an outpouring of that love upon
yourself and the church.

                     The One-Day River
                           Joe Dugucagi

    FIJI—When Joe Dugucagi (doon-goo-KAHN-gee) joined the
Seventh-day Adventist Church, he was the only Adventist in his
village. He met strong opposition from others when he tried to share
his faith, but eventually a few others were baptized.
   The believers held evangelistic meetings, and seven people pre-
pared for baptism. But an eight-month drought had left the nearby
river dry. Some skeptical villagers jeered at the Adventists, who
insisted on baptizing by immersion, even when there was no water.
The only alternative was to baptize the new believers in an oil drum.
The day before the baptism, the believers carried water to fill the
barrel. That evening they gathered for vespers and once more asked
God for rain, though the skies were clear.
   The next morning Joe saw puddles of water outside his door. He
realized that it must have rained during the night, although he had not
heard rain, even on his house's metal roof. Excited, he hurried to the
river and found the water level was up to his chest! He ran to tell the
pastor the good news.
    The believers gathered under the clear sky to worship and praise
God and then moved to the river for the baptism. It was a glorious day
for the little Adventist congregation!
    The following morning when Joe went down to the river to bathe,
he found only a few puddles where yesterday there had been a full
river. He walked some distance to another channel of the same river
and found water there. Apparently, Friday night's rain had caused the
river to change course and fill the river channel nearest the village.
When the water receded, the river returned to its normal channel.
    The villagers were amazed that the rain had filled the river channel
in answer to the prayers of the believers and then left it dry the
                                next day. Many who had jeered the
                                Adventists responded with interest.
                                   The church in Joe's village now has
                                about forty members, thanks to God's
                                blessings and to answered prayers.

                                  Joe Dugucagi (left) works in Suva,
                               Fiji, but he spends his weekends in
                               his rural village, where he continues
                               to share his faith.

     Prayers for the Church:
               Paul




Sabbath Afternoon
ROME, A.D. 62. THE TYRANT NERO IS ON THE THRONE.
The palace seethes with vice, intrigue, and murder. Not far away is
a house where a prisoner sits chained to a palace guard. Friends
and visitors come and go, encouraging him, listening to his instruc-
tions, and bearing letters from him to believers in other parts of the
empire.
   If we were to visit, we might expect to see a man sitting in the
gloom, pondering his fate, agonizing over whether he will be ex-
ecuted or released. Instead, he is writing to other Christians about
being alive and joyful in Christ. He also is praying for them that they
will apply Christ's salvation—His immeasurable grace—to their lives.
What kind of experience is this? How can we learn more about it?
Paul's prayers for the church in Ephesians 1:15-23 and 3:14-20 will
explain.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. The Church—Real and Ideal (Eph. 1:1-14).
 11. A Vision of the Church (Eph. 1:15-23).
I11. God's Power in Christ (Eph. 1:19-23).
IV. God's Power in Us (Eph. 2:1-10).
 V. Filled With All the Fullness of God (Eph. 3:14-21).

MEMORY TEXT: "God raised us up with Christ and seated us
with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in
the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his
grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians
2:6, 7, NIV).

THE CHURCH—REAL AND IDEAL (Eph. 1:1-14).

   Some people think the Christian church in the days of the apostles
was ideal. Actually, it was not all that different from our churches
today. The church at Ephesus, for example, had its problems. Paul's
letters to Timothy indicate that the church contained false teachers,
apostates, idlers, and busybodies (1 Tim. 1:6, 7, 20; 5:13). He warned
the elders of Ephesus that "grievous wolves" would infiltrate the
church, drawing away disciples after themselves (Acts 20:29, 30).
The church of Ephesus then rooted out heresy so vigorously that it
became a loveless congregation (Rev. 2:1, 2, 4, 6). Such experiences
are typiCal of the real church. In his letter to the Ephesians, however,
Paul shows a view of the ideal church that astonishes us.

  What were Paul's circumstances when he wrote the book of
Ephesians? See the SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 333, "Ephesians,
Epistle to the."

   Acts 28:16, 30, 31

   Eph. 3:1; 6:19, 20

   After being arrested and kept in custody for two years, Paul ap-
pealed to Caesar for justice and was sent to Rome as a prisoner. For
two more years, he was under house arrest, chained to a soldier—a
trying time for the aged apostle (Philem. 9, 10). He was tried before
Nero and acquitted but later re-arrested, confined to a dungeon, and
then beheaded. (See the article "Paul" in the SDA Bible Dictionary.)

  What is Paul's mood as he writes this letter? List the blessings
he specifies. Eph. 1:3-10.


    In the midst of persecution with the prospect of execution, Paul
still looks beyond his earthly circumstances to the heavenly realms in
Christ. Instead of worrying over his fate, he is reveling in blessings he
describes in exceptional terms—riches that God lavishes on those
who accept Him.
    God predestines that all should accept Him. He "desires everyone to
be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4, NRSV;
see also 2 Pet. 3:9; Ezek. 33:11; Matt. 11:28; Rev. 22:17; John 3:16).

    Paul's circumstances teach us that no matter where we are,
 God blesses us immeasurably. The lesson is obvious. The ques-
 tion is, How do we apply that lesson to our own lives?

                                                                      97

A VISION OF THE CHURCH (Eph. 1:15-23).

   Paul has caught a vision not only of the rich blessings God has
lavished on His people (vss. 3-10) but also of how richly blessed
God's people themselves are. He tries to explain this in verses 15-23.
   Upon hearing of their faith in Christ and their love for one
another, Paul expresses exuberant thanks for the saints in Ephesus
(vss. 15, 16). He remembers them daily in prayer, no doubt asking
God to help them continue their spiritual growth. For only as any
person in any age draws closer and closer to the Savior can that
person become more and more like Him.

   Paul's concept of the church is so magnificent we need special
help to comprehend it. What does he pray God will do for us to
help us understand?

     Eph. 1:17, 18




    Look at the three things that Paul prays we will especially under-
stand. Eph. 1:18, 19.
    1. "The hope to which he has called you" (v. 18, NIV). Colossians
1:27, written about the same time, sheds light on his thought. "The
hope of glory" is "Christ in you." Having Christ in our lives now is a
foretaste of the glory of the future.
    2. "The riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints" is the
literal translation. Paul mentions two inheritances in Ephesians, ours
and God's (1:14). Our inheritance is all the blessings Paul lists in
1:3-14. Conversely, we are God's possession (1:14) and Jesus' inher-
itance (vs. 18). Jesus looks at us and recognizes that we are "the riches
of His glorious inheritance." Are we, though, all that glorious? Paul's
next point explains.
    3. "His incomparably great power for us who believe" (NIV).
"God's mighty power is displayed in the transformation of a sinner
into a saint. This remarkable change is not accomplished by psychol-
ogy, education, or good works; it is an act of divine grace and power."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1004:19, "Power."

    How does one explain the gap between the great promises
 given the church and the reality of the church as it exists? How
 does one explain the gap between the great promises given
 individuals and the reality that often exists? We know where the
 fault lies. The question is, How do we remedy it?

GOD'S POWER IN CHRIST (Eph. 1:19-23).

   God's power to work in our lives is tremendous and immeasurable
(vs. 19). To demonstrate how great that power is, Paul shows what it
accomplished in the life of Christ. (Eph. 1:19, 20).
   1. God raised Him from the dead.
   2. God seated Him at His right hand in heavenly places.

   Christ's resurrection proves that no matter what humans may do,
they cannot prevent God's purpose from being fulfilled. In our frantic
and frenzied world, we can remain calm knowing that God is in
control.

   How high did God raise Jesus? Eph. 1:20, 22.


   Psalm 110:1 foretold this event: " 'Sit at my right hand until I make
your enemies a footstool for your feet' " (NIV). Compare 1 Corinthians
15:24, 25; Hebrews 1:3. The principalities, powers, dominions, and
names that Paul mentions include His enemies, the forces of evil, both
earthly and satanic (Eph. 6:12). Paul was suffering from the tyranny of
Rome, but Jesus was above Rome. The name of Nero that made
armies tremble was a "paper tiger" compared to the name of Jesus.

  What significance does Jesus' exaltation have for the church?
Eph. 1:21-23.


   God gave Jesus, as head over all things, to the church, which is
His body (literal translation). When Christ is exalted, His body, the
church, is exalted, too. When Christ is seated in heavenly places, His
body, the church, is seated in heavenly places with Him. Paul adds the
staggering statement that the church is the fullness of Christ! (Eph.
1:23). No wonder we need a special revelation to comprehend the
glory of the church! (vss. 17-19).

   How can you use these wonderful promises to help those strug-
gling with sin or with addictions?


   How can you help a person make these promises real and
 personal? What is the key to latching hold of these promises and
 making them work changes in your life?



                                                                     99

GOD'S POWER IN US (Eph. 2:1-10).

   Compare God's power in Christ with God's power in you,
using the following chart:


      Text       God's Power in Christ          God's Power in You


   Eph. 2:1-3     Christ was dead.

   Eph. 2:4, 5    God raised Christ.

   Eph. 2:6       God seated Christ in
                  heavenly places.


    The life lived apart from Christ is ugly indeed. It took the same
resurrection power to raise us from death in sin as it did to raise
Christ from death on account of our sins. Raised from death, we
become "a new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17).
    What does it mean to be seated in heavenly places with Christ
Jesus? Is this not a future privilege reserved for eternity when we will
sit with Him on His throne? (Rev. 3:21). Here is another example of
"present eschatology," when the blessings of the future invade the
present in spiritual form. (Review lesson 10.) Bodily, Paul was in
prison awaiting trial by a cruel tyrant. Mentally, he was praising God
for every spiritual blessing in heavenly places (Eph. 1:3).

   Paul is amazed that God would raise fallen sinners and exalt
them so high. How does he describe God's grace in verses 4-9?


   When a friend gives you a gift, you do not ask that person how
much you owe him or her. Yet many Christians, when they receive
the gift of Christ's salvation, feel or believe that there is still some-
thing they must do to earn that gift. Paul talks about "the incompa-
rable riches" (2:7, NIV) of God's grace. Nothing we could ever do
would equal such a gift. We are to do with it what we would do with
any gift—accept it gracefully, enjoy it to the fullest, and share it with
others through traditional witnessing activities and acts of service.

   How do you explain to someone just what "grace" is? What
 analogies can you use to show how futile salvation by works is
 and that salvation must be a gift, unmerited and unearned?

FILLED WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD (Eph. 3:14-21).

   Paul concludes his vision of the ideal church with one of the most
sublime prayers in the Bible. After describing God's family (Eph.
2:11-22), he pours out his soul, asking Him to do stupendous things
for them—His church.
   "For this reason I kneel before the Father" (3:14, NIV). Normally,
the Jewish attitude of prayer was standing with hands outstretched and
palms upward (Mark 11:25). However, Paul's prayer is not the ordi-
nary, incidental prayer inspired by a passing feeling or thought. His
desire for the church is so deliberate and passionate that He kneels
before God in solemn humility and pleads with Him to grant his
request.

   Paul proceeds to pray for the Ephesians to receive power through
Christ's Holy Spirit. For what reasons does Paul desire the Ephesians
to have this power?

   Eph. 3:17

   Eph. 3:17,18

   Eph. 3:19

   Paul speaks of the Spirit and of Jesus coming to make their
home with us as Jesus promised in John 14:16-18 and 23. Though
the power of God is constantly at work in every breath and heart-
beat of our lives, Paul wants the Spirit to penetrate further into the
"inner being" of our minds. Then we will be "strengthened with
power."
   To receive this power, we must first have deep roots (like a tree)
and a firm foundation (like a building) based on love (Eph. 3:17).
Second, we must experience this power "with all the saints." We
cannot fully grasp it on our own. It comes to the church as a body.
   Once we have the Holy Spirit's power, we can begin to know
something that surpasses knowledge—the width, length, height, and
depth of Christ's love.
   "God so loved the world" is the breadth of His love. "That He gave
His only begotten Son" is the length of it. "That whosoever [the
lowest sinner] believeth in Him" is the depth of it. "Should . . . have
everlasting life" is the height of it (John 3:16).

   What does prayer do to us that allows these promises to

FURTHER STUDY: Read the closing to Paul's prayer in Ephesians
3:20, 21.

    Paul's prayer staggers the imagination. It is a field for deep and
prolonged meditation. Notice all that God wants us to take into our
inner beings: His power, His Spirit, Jesus, the four dimensions of
Jesus' love, and the fullness of God.
    The conclusion is no less astounding. After making such bound-
less requests, he says that God is able to do "immeasurably more than
all we ask or imagine"! (NIV). There is no limit to what His power can
do for us. This is Paul's vision of "glory in the church and in Christ
Jesus" forever and ever! (vs. 21).
    After Paul's trip into the heights of the glory of the ideal church
(Eph. 1-3), Paul descends to the real church in the world below. Read
chapters 4 through 6 to see how living in heavenly places translates
into life in this world. Jot down the counsels that are relevant to your
life.




 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How is the closing of Paul's prayer an appropriate conclu-
     sion to chapters 1, 2, and 3?

   2. If Paul were your prayer partner, how might his prayer for
      the Ephesians influence your prayer life?

   3. Paul included prayers in his letters to the churches. Can
      you include prayers in your correspondence and contact
      with others? In what other ways can you approach your
      prayer life more creatively?

SUMMARY: Paul's great prayers, as recorded in the letter to the
Ephesians, teach us that the church is the body of Christ, a part of His
being, infused with His blood and breath and life. To be a part of it is
the greatest privilege and honor given to human beings.

      The Stranger Who Came to Town, Part 1
                            J. H. Zachary

    INDIA—Pastor Jesurathnam Baka was assigned to work in a re-
mote area of India north of Madras (Chennai). As he walked from
village to village, young people crowded around him, curious about a
stranger who had come to visit them.
    But when Pastor Baka told them that he had come to bring them
Jesus Christ, the villagers answered, "We already have three village
gods. There is no place for your God in our village." Still the people
were curious about this stranger. "Please tell us a story," they begged.
    The stories Pastor Baka told them about Jesus touched their hearts,
and they asked him to stay. Pastor Baka stayed in the village for 20
days and taught the people about Jesus. The stories led to Bible studies
and seasons of prayer.
    Pastor Baka walked to the next village, where he found a group of
children playing marbles under a tamarind tree. He bent over and
joined them in their game until a village man saw him. "What are you
doing here?" the man asked.
    "I have come to bring Jesus Christ to your village," he answered.
    The village man told Pastor Baka, "If Jesus is a God, we have no
place for Him here. You should leave at once." As Pastor Baka silently
prayed for wisdom, one boy said, "Wait! Samuel worships your God. I
will go call him!" The boy ran off to fmd Samuel.
    Soon Samuel arrived. "Sir, this is a wonderful day!" Samuel said. "I
have prayed for five years that God would send someone to teach us
about Jesus. The people here worship a man-god. How can we tell
them about the living God?"
    Pastor Baka asked Samuel to invite the villagers to a worship
service that evening. At sunset a crowd of curious villagers gathered to
see the stranger and learn how Christians worship their God. Children
scooted close for a better view. Pastor Baka talked about God and His
 love for them. Then he announced that he would hold public meetings.
    Nearly two hundred people came night after night to study and learn
about God. When the pastor invited those who wanted to follow Jesus
to prepare for baptism, several came forward.
     However, Satan was determined that these people who had lived in
darkness for so long would not escape to Christ without a struggle.

             Prayers of Praise:
                Revelation



Sabbath Afternoon
ON THE VIVID SCREEN OF JOHN'S REVELATION we gaze
into heaven to observe worship there. At the heart of heavenly
worship is a glorious King on the throne with the Lamb standing
before Him. Many choral groups surround Him. From the throne a
lone voice frequently cries out. In the inner circle is a quartet of living
creatures. Surrounding them is a chorus of twenty-four elders. Beyond
is a vast choir of angels. Before our delighted gaze, another group
presses its way to the throne—a great multitude that no one can
number, from every nation, tribe, people, and language (Rev. 7:9).
Then the focus expands to encompass "every creature in heaven and
on earth and under the earth and in the sea," all uniting in praise to
God and the Lamb. Even the satanic forces from the abyss "under the
earth" will eventually bow down to worship God (Phil. 2:10, 11).
   What do these various orders of creation have to say about their
God? Their exultant songs express many reasons for exalting the
Creator. Learn about these reasons this week and how your prayers
can become hymns of praise.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. He Exists (Rev. 4:1-8).
 11. He Created All Things (Rev. 4:9-11).
I11. He Was Slain (Rev. 5:1-12).
 IV. He Judges and Makes War (Rev. 11:15-19).
  V. His Wedding Day Has Come (Rev. 19:1-8).

MEMORY TEXT: "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to re-
ceive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and
glory and praise!" (Revelation 5:12, NIV).

HE EXISTS (Rev. 4:1-8).

  How do the four living creatures around the throne continually
praise God?

  Rev. 4:8




   These creatures are the cherubim who guard the throne (Ezek. 1:5;
10:1). Their threefold repetition of the word holy suggests the Trinity,
whom John introduces in Revelation 1:4, 5. The One "who is and who
was, and who is to come" is God. The second Member is the Holy
Spirit, and the third Member is Jesus Christ.
   Holiness has the meanings of majesty, brightness, purity, and good-
ness. God's holiness separates Him from sin but brings Him close to
the repentant sinner. This truth was manifested in Jesus, who though
He is the Holy God, nevertheless tabernacled among sinners.
   God is also the Source of "ultimate reality." Go back before, after,
above, below, and in everything—and the evidence of God is seen.
Everything came from Him and depends on Him (Col. 1:17; Rev. 22:13).
The welfare of the universe depends on God's character. How fortunate
we are that God is good. How miserable our existence would be if God
were a selfish tyrant or if His law were unjust and unfair, as Satan has
accused.
   Almost all the early Christian writers indicate that John wrote the
book of Revelation during the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian.
Under his rule, emperor worship became a pressing concern for
Christians. Many met with persecution for refusing to worship this
false god. This was especially the case in the province of Asia, where
John first sent the letters to the seven churches (Rev. 2; 3). These
second-generation Christians must have rejoiced at his reassurance
that the God they worshiped was, indeed, the Lord God Almighty.
(See The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 720-723.)

    The four creatures sing their praises day and night without
 stopping. What does this teach us about developing an attitude of
 reverence and worship toward God?


    What is the immediate spiritual benefit to ourselves when we have
 an attitude of praise?

                                                                    105
Monday                                                  March 26
HE CREATED ALL THINGS (Rev. 4:9-11).

   How do the twenty-four elders worship God? What is the meaning of
casting their crowns before the throne? Rev. 4:10.


   In John's day, a king would signal his surrender by casting his
crown at the feet of the conqueror. Occasionally, the Roman army
carried with them an image of the emperor so that, when they con-
quered another ruler, that ruler would throw his crown before the
image in a gesture of defeat. As our Redeemer and Lord, God con-
quers our souls with His grace. We cast our crowns before Him in total
submission. We cannot be His disciples without doing so.

   How do the twenty-four elders enlarge upon the praise of the
four living creatures? Rev. 4:11.


    God's creation is awesome—from the vastness of the heavens with
billions of systems of stars to the microscopic molecular world with
its intricate systems of subatomic particles. He is the God of breath-
taking sunsets and delicate flowers. His children recognize in nature
the tokens of their Father's love.
    However, many human beings want to exalt self in place of God.
They want to make humanity the center of worship. Ironically, when
they remove God, their lives lose all significance. Life then becomes a
product of chance, an accidental collection of atoms thrown into the
world with no purpose for existence, no future but extinction. As social
scientist Peter Berger once wrote: "There is really nothing very funny
about finding oneself stranded, alone, in a remote corner of the uni-
verse bereft of meaning. . . ."—Peter Berger, A Rumor of Angels:
Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural (New York:
Bantam Doubleday Publishing Group, Inc.; Anchor Book Division,
1969), p. 33.
     By contrast, how satisfying it is to know we are not orphans but
God's special creation, made in His image for never-ending fellowship
with Him.

   If you know people who do not believe in God, ask them to
explain (if they can) what they believe the purpose of their life is.
Press them to take their premises to their logical conclusion.
How can you, as a Christian, show them the utter futility of their
beliefs, in contrast to the wonderful hope that our faith has
given us?

HE WAS SLAIN (Rev. 5:1-12).

   In a tense drama over who can open the scroll of human destiny
(see Rev. 5:1-10), a new Figure enters the throne room. How does
one of the elders describe Him?


   When John looks, what does he see instead? Verses 5, 6.


   What a contradiction—a powerful conquering Lion and a gentle
dying Lamb. Yet, they are the same Person. The Lion conquers by His
overwhelming power. What, then, is the greatest power in the universe?
Not missiles or atomic bombs. It is the self-sacrificing love of the Lamb
giving up His life for fallen, created beings. God's love has such power
that it conquers kingdoms, empires, and stubborn hearts. The Lion is
strong, the Lion conquers, because He is a dying Lamb. The most
powerful force in the universe is God's love.

   Read the new song of the living creatures and the elders. How does
the Lamb's sacrifice exalt the redeemed? Rev. 5:9, 10.


   Jesus' goal was to gather representatives from all peoples, tribes,
and nations (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) and unite them into a kingdom
whose citizens will be "priests to serve our God" (Rev. 5:10, NIV).
   In addition, their new song praises Christ's work in two other areas:
   1.He purchased them with His blood.
   2. He appointed them to reign on the new earth.
   Next, a multitude of angels bursts into song with these words,
" 'Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and
wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!' " (vs. 12, NIV).
   Jesus renounced all power, wealth, strength, honor, and praise in
His long journey from the throne of heaven to the stable in Bethlehem
and the cross on Calvary. In their place, He accepted weakness, pov-
erty, mockery, scorn, and abuse. He never, though, gave up His glory—
the glory of self-sacrificing love.

   Why should Christ's death in our stead be the foundation of our
 worship, praise, and prayer?


   Discuss this: What would have happened to the human race had
 Christ not died? Would you even be here to discuss this topic if He
 had not redeemed us?

                                                                     107
Wednesday                                              March 28
HE JUDGES AND MAKES WAR (Rev. 11:15-19).

  What great announcement is made in heaven at the climax of
earth's history? Rev. 11:15.


   Why do the twenty-four elders rejoice? Verses 16, 17.


   God's kingdom has been an "underground" power in the midst of
enemy territory ever since Satan seized dominion from Adam and be-
came "the prince of this world." Now God takes full control and begins
to reign.

   How does the last part of verse 17 and the first part of verse 18
describe the transfer of power from Satan's kingdom to God's king-
dom? Compare Psalm 2:1.


   It is a time of wrath—the wrath of the nations suddenly cut short by
the wrath of God. God's wrath is a necessary part of His love. Sin
causes suffering; therefore, a loving God must hate sin. Those who
choose sin will feel the wrath of God. Salvation is such a tremendous
gift that rejecting it is a terrible offense.

  What need is there for the judgment as depicted in Revelation
11:18?


   To bring an end to the great controversy, there must be a final
judgment that reveals God's justice (Rev. 15:2-4; 16:5-7). Though we
reap what we sow, neither sinners nor saints receives the full conse-
quences of his or her deeds in this life. There is a moral necessity for
judgment, and a future life, in order that justice may be done.
   It is God's purpose that every sin should be justly punished. Indeed,
every sin has been punished in the Person of Jesus Christ at the cross!
No human being ever needs to endure the wrath of God against sin. The
greatest sin against God is to reject His gift of forgiveness.

    German philosopher Immanuel Kant developed an argument for
 an afterlife, based on the assumption that if God is just, there
 must be some sort of final reckoning, because justice certainly
 doesn't appear in this life. Does the notion of a final reckoning
 strengthen your faith? What would it say about God if, in the
 end, there were no final reckoning?

HIS WEDDING DAY HAS COME (Rev. 19:1-8).

   What new group takes its place before the throne? What is the
significance of their cry, "Salvation belongs to our God" (Rev. 7:10,
NIV)? Rev. 7:9,10.


  What further reasons do they have for rejoicing?


    Text                       Reasons for Rejoicing


   Rev. 19:2


   Rev. 19:6


   Rev. 19:7


   There is joy when the great harlot Babylon (a persecuting religious
system—(see Rev. 17:1-6) is destroyed, because she is the rival to the
Lamb's bride. As long as God's people are part of the harlot, the
marriage of the Lamb cannot take place. So they are called to come out
of her (Rev. 18:4).
   The saints are jubilant because the time has at last come for the
wedding of the Lamb. At last His bride is ready.

 What makes the wedding dress "bright and clean"? Rev. 7:14.
Where does the wedding dress come from? Isa. 61:10.


   In some cultures—including the heavenly one—the groom gives the
wedding dress to his bride. Jesus gives the saints the perfect robe of
His righteousness—a perfect standing with God. The wedding dress in
this passage also includes her character, her "righteous deeds," given
her by God. The bride must wash her robe in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation 7:14 is a picture of how we are saved through faith (see also
Isa. 1:18; Rom. 3:21-26).

    Though the great wedding day has not yet come, why can we
 rejoice in it now? Where is our assurance that we can be part of the
 wedding? Is that assurance found in ourselves or in someone else?

                                                                    109
Friday                                                   March 30
 FURTHER STUDY: What do the following texts teach us about
 praise, and how can they help us develop a more invigorating prayer
  life? Psalms 34:1; 113:3; Ephesians 5:19, 20.
     Read about the praises of the redeemed when Jesus brings them into
His heavenly kingdom, in The Great Controversy, pp. 645-652. No-
tice how many times the praises of Revelation are repeated.
     Read also about the time and circumstances when Satan will bow
down and confess the justice of his sentence, in The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 669-672.

   "To praise God in fullness and sincerity of heart is as much a duty as
is prayer."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 299.
   "Human help is feeble. But we may unite in seeking help and favor
from Him who has said, 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.' Divine power is
infallible. Then let us come to God, pleading for the guidance of His
Holy Spirit. Let our united prayers ascend to the throne of grace. Let our
requests be mingled with praise and thanksgiving."—Testimonies to
Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 485.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Though it is sometimes difficult to understand how prayer
     works, why is it so important for Christians to pray anyway?
     How many other things do we do in our life that we don't
     fully understand yet know that they work?

   2. Why would God, the Creator of the universe, be so interested in
      our worship? Is there something beneficial to ourselves in
      worship? If so, what?

   3. List and discuss ways we can develop an attitude of praise and
      thanksgiving as we go throughout our day.

   4. The prayers we studied this week were hymns of praise. What
      are some creative ways we can use the words and music of
      hymns to enhance our prayer life?

SUMMARY: The book of Revelation shows why all creation will praise
God and the Lamb—He always lives, He is our Creator, He redeemed us
by His blood, He will claim us as His bride. Before we join the heavenly
choirs in singing praises to God, let us practice here on earth. Then the
heavenly praises, whose words already are written for us in Revelation,
will become our everlasting prayers that will be answered continually
and spontaneously by the very presence of Christ Himself.

      The Stranger Who Came to Town, Part 2
                            J. H. Zachary

   INDIA—As Pastor Baka visited the villages in his new district in a
remote area of southeastern India, he was met with curiosity, but little
interest in religion. "We have no place for your God here," one man
told him. But one villager, Samuel, was a Christian who had prayed
for five years that God would send a pastor. Together the men held
meetings, and 200 people attended. When the pastor asked for those
who wanted to follow Christ in baptism, 35 villagers stepped forward.
   On the day of the baptism, the entire village gathered at a lake to
watch the baptism. Samuel and his family were baptized first, then a
woman stepped into the water. When the pastor raised her out of the
water, she suddenly cried out in alarm. "My wedding ring is gone! If I
go home without it, my husband will beat me!" she wailed.
   "Our God can do anything," Pastor Baka assured her. "If it is His
will, He will show us where your ring is." When he finished baptizing
the new believers, he joined them on the shore and asked them to form
a circle for prayer. He prayed that God would reveal His power and
glory and show them where the woman's wedding ring was.
   The pastor told two young boys to go into the water and stand on
the spot where he had baptized the new believers. "Reach into the
water and bring up a fistful of sand," he said. The youth did as they
were told, but they found no ring. "Reach in again and bring up more
sand," he said.
    The villagers watched as the boys searched the lake bottom hand-
ful by handful. Could the God of the Christians find a small ring in the
sandy bottom of the lake? The crowd pressed closer. Suddenly one of
the boys shouted, "I found it!" He held up the woman's ring.
    The happy woman cried, "My God Jesus Christ! You are great!"
The new believers praised and thanked God for showing the villagers
that God is truly the one all-powerful God.
    The amazed villagers returned to their homes talking about the
                          miracle of the missing ring. Following this
                          dramatic answer to prayer, the entire village
                          wanted to know more about this new God
                          who had come to live in their village.
