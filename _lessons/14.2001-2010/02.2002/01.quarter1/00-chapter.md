DITOR'S OVERVIEW
                              Blood on the Tracks


        A
                  t 2:30 A.M. on Monday, May 24, 1999, a passenger train,
                  called the Twilight Shoreliner, en route from Boston, Massa-
                  chusetts, to Newport News, Virginia, struck and killed five
        people. The dead were Julia Toledo, an Ecuadoran immigrant, and
        her four sons: Carlos (eleven), Jose (ten), Angel (six), and Pedro
        (three). An investigation revealed that no one had been at fault. Sure,
        the mother shouldn't have been on the tracks with her children (they
        might have all been there by accident, lost), but otherwise, there was
        no one to blame, no one to charge with a crime, no one to explain
        why a mother and her four children should get run over so unceremo-
        niously by the Twilight Shoreliner on May 24, 1999. For atheists,
        this blood on the tracks poses no philosophical problem: We live in a
        meaningless, senseless world in which mothers and children some-
        times get run over by trains. Don't look for meaning because, frankly,
        there is none.
            As Seventh-day Adventist Christians, we know that answer is
        wrong. Because we are beings made in the image of God, our lives,
        each one, have meaning; thus, by default, our deaths (each one)
        must, as well. The hard question is not Do they have meaning? but
         What is it?
            Ellen White, writing in the context of Lucifer's fall, said that to
        explain sin would be to excuse it; sin is inexplicable because it is
        inexcusable (see The Great Controversy, p. 492). Perhaps, then,
        death, the result of sin, falls into the same category: To explain it
        would be, in a sense, to excuse, even justify, it, and how can death be
        justified in a universe created by our loving Lord?
            It can't. Instead, all we can know, at least for now, is that we are
        swept up in a battle between good and evil, between Christ and
        Satan—and that two thousand years ago, at the cross, the decisive
        victory was won for us. Because of that victory we have the promise
        that evil and death will be eradicated, that all God's ways will be
        vindicated before human beings and angels, and that so much of
        reality that now comes entombed in darkness will one day radiate in
        the light of God Himself (1 Cor. 4:5), who promises to make all
        things right. Until then, and beyond that promise, it can be so fruit-
        less to ask Why because there is no Why other than that evil is, that it
        is part of this world for now, and that, again, to explain it would be
        excusing it, and the last thing evil needs in this great controversy is to
        be excused.
           And it's this theme, that of the great controversy between good
        and evil, that Dr. John Fowler of the General Conference Education
        department expounds with great depth and clarity in this quarter's'
        lesson study. And though many questions will remain, this Bible
        Study Guide—with Christ as the focus—helps us see that the only
        hope we have in a world with things like the Toledo family's blood
        on the tracks is, indeed, Christ's blood on the cross.

 The Cosmic Conflict Between Christ and Satan: The
                 Hard Questions

       o often life seems to be only a tangle of questions, hard ques-

S      tions at that. Why does the earth quake, killing hundreds with
       each spasm of dirt and rock? Why do the rains fall, destroying
a season's worth of food with each wet shower? Why do planes
plummet from the sky, taking hundreds to terrifying and fiery deaths?
If God is a God of love, why do I have cancer? If God is all-powerful,
why doesn't He keep my spouse from alcohol? Couldn't He have
prevented the car accident that took my child's limb?
    These questions, and endless others like them, lead us to what we
have called the great-controversy theme, the great motif of the
battle between Christ and Satan that weaves its way through the
Bible, from the opening pages to the climax and close. Through
captivating stories and inspiring truths, this theme—that of the battle
between Christ and Satan, between good and evil—gives us a basic
understanding, a basic framework or template, in which we can seek
some understanding of these hard questions.
    The theme provides a worldview of our origin and destiny and
the ebb and flow of human history. It also offers an outline, though
broad (even coarse at times) of the following: (1) how sin began; (2)
why we suffer; (3) how God can be both just and loving; (4) what
really happened through Jesus' life and death; (5) the meaning of
Jesus' heavenly ministry; (6) how we should relate to God's law,
love, grace, and judgment; and (7) how sin will end.
    "All humanity is now involved in a great controversy between
Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His
sovereignty over the universe. This conflict originated in heaven
when a created being, endowed with freedom of choice, in self-
exaltation became Satan, God's adversary, and led into rebellion a
portion of the angels. He introduced the spirit of rebellion into this
world when he led Adam and Eve into sin. This human sin resulted
in the distortion of the image of God in humanity, the disordering of
the created world, and its eventual devastation at the time of the
worldwide flood. Observed by the whole creation, this world be-
came the arena of the universal conflict, out of which the God of
love will ultimately be vindicated."—SDA Church Manual
(Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Pub. Assn., 1995, revised
edition), p. 9.
    This quarter we will study the great controversy theme in detail.
The lessons do not cover all that we might wish on this topic (What
 human books could?); instead, they provide an outline that, while
 not giving answers to the hard questions, will provide a framework
 from which we can, at least, glimpse the hope that lies behind them.

                                examines the great-controversy
                                theme with depth and clarity to

                War in Heaven




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:12-
17; Revelation 12.

    MEMORY TEXT: "God is love, and those who abide in love
    abide in God, and God abides in them" (1 John 4:16, NRSV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: Where did the great controversy begin? Whom
and what did it involve? What were the initial consequences?

          OD IS LOVE" (1 John 4:16). God's dwelling place is

G         characterized by His love, and all who abide with Him live in
          such a way that glorifies His character.
    But here is a great mystery. Lucifer, an angelic being abiding in
God's presence, chose to question God's loving character. Little by
little this being spread his dissatisfaction among other angels, caus-
ing a "war in heaven. Michael [Jesus] and his angels fought against
the dragon [Lucifer], and the dragon and his angels fought back. But
he [the dragon] was not strong enough, and they lost their place in
heaven" (Rev. 12:7, 8, NIV).
    This week's lesson provides "a history of the origin, initial posi-
tion, and downfall of the angel who later became known as the devil
and Satan."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 675. How God
chose to handle this conflict exemplifies further His loving character.
As you study and begin to understand how the great controversy is
won in your own life, remember that Lucifer was "not strong enough"
then (when he first rebelled against Christ), and he is not strong
enough now—because God's "love endures forever" (Ps. 107:1, NIV),
a love that is perfected in those who abide in Him (1 John 4:17).

*(Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, January 5.)

GOD AND HIS PERFECT CREATION (Gen. 1:31; Ps. 104:24,
25).

   In each of the following verses, what one word does the author
repeatedly use to describe God's creation? Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18,
21, 25, 31. What does this word imply about His character?


    n Psalm 34:8, David invites us to "taste" (experience) for our-

/   selves this aspect of God's character. In Psalm 145:7, he describes
    a time when people will celebrate this goodness with joyful sing-
ing: "They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
and shall sing of thy righteousness."
   What applies to God's earthly creation applies to the entire cos-
mos. If He made the earth so "good" and created human beings
without any tendency toward evil, surely heaven and its inhabitants
reflect these same attributes.

   Even though the origin of sin is a mystery, what characteristics
in particular helped bring it to fruition? The following verses
provide clues.


    Isa. 14:12-15




    Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1-6




    God can force all creatures in the universe to worship Him,
 He can force all creatures in the universe to obey Him, He can
 force all creatures to fear Him—but He cannot force even a
 single one to love Him. Love, to be love, must be free. In what
 ways do we experience every day this freedom that God's love
 has given to us? How do you day by day use, or abuse, this
 freedom? What principles motivate your actions? Ask yourself
 this hard question, too—What are you doing with the freedom
 that God has given you?


                                                                      7
Monday                                             December 31
FROM THE ANOINTED TO THE EVIL ONE (Ezek. 28:12-17).

   Using the king of Tyre, an evil and morally bankrupt monarch, as
a metaphor, Ezekiel portrays the king of all evil.

   Ezekiel 28:12-16 points to the fall of Lucifer from "anointed
cherub" to God's adversary. Answer the questions below regard-
ing this event.

    1. How did the anointed cherub come into being? (vs. 15).


    2. What was his responsibility? (vs. 14).


    3. Where was his dwelling place? (vs. 14).


    4. Describe his original character (vs. 15).


  5. Explain the meaning of "filled with violence within" (vs. 16,
NKJV).


    6. What was the iniquity found in him? (vss. 16, 17).




B
       efore his fall, this angelic being is described as "the covering
       cherub," a figure related to the mercy seat in the sanctuary
       (Exod. 25:8-22; 37:6-9; Heb. 8:5). How could iniquity occur in a
being who occupied such a lofty position, a being who was, in fact,
created "perfect"? How does the role of freedom fit into this situation?
   The fall of Lucifer shows that neither ecclesiastical position nor
power is a safeguard against sin. Such safety is found only in a
nurturing relationship with the One who creates and sustains. (See
Rev. 12:11.) Thus, even a perfect being like Lucifer needed to main-
tain a humble, submissive relationship to His Creator. How much
more so, then, should we?

   Ezekiel 28:15 states that this highest of angels was a created
being. What is wrong with a created being claiming or striving
to be equal with the Creator? Can we fall into a similar trap,
even in more subtle ways than openly claiming equality with
God? If so, how?

LUCIFER'S SIN (Isa. 14:12-15).

   Compare Isaiah's description of Lucifer's sin with the descrip-
tion in Ezekiel by listing five comparable elements.

F
      irst and foremost, Isaiah and Ezekiel were addressing the rulers
      of Babylon and Tyre. But some details in each prophecy are
      true only of someone more powerful than these two fleshly
kings. We can understand the details of the prophecies when we
understand the nature of biblical writings. Just as God was behind
Israel's Davidic throne (Isa. 41:21; Zeph. 3:15), Satan was behind
the throne of these pagan monarchs. Just as Israel's kings were to
reflect the characteristics of their true King, so the kings of Tyre and
Babylon exhibited characteristics of the one who ruled them. Also,
just as the Davidic psalms give details pointing to the Messiah that
are not true of David, so, too, these prophecies detail things that are
not true of the kings of Babylon and Tyre but refer instead only to
Lucifer. (See Peter's argument in Acts 2:14, 22, 25-36 that Psalm
16:8-11 refers to Christ, even though David wrote the passage as
though he were speaking about himself.)
   The title applied to Lucifer in Isaiah 14:12 reflects the position he
once held in heaven as leader of the angels. But because he was a
created being, his position always would be lower than that of his
Creator, Christ (John 1:1-3; Eph. 3:9; Heb. 1:2). Lucifer refused to
acknowledge this fact.

     No matter how much God gave Lucifer, it obviously wasn't
 enough. He wanted more. And all this in a being who from the
 start had been created perfect! What warning should Lucifer's
 fall have for us—sinful, selfish, and defective beings from the
 start—about the danger of self-exaltation, pride, and covetous-
 ness, especially when they arise in a very subtle manner?

                                                                       9

LUCIFER'S SINISTER PRESUMPTIONS (Isa. 14:13, 14).



L
        ucifer's claims began in the heart—that is, in the mind. God
        created the mind as the seat of all emotions, decisions, and
        actions. As is the mind, so is the life. "Your word I have
hidden in my heart," says the psalmist, "that I might not sin against
You" (Ps. 119:11, NKJV). A mind filled with God's thoughts and His
will serves as a shield against sin. But Lucifer filled his mind with
rebellious, prideful thoughts:
   " ' "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the
stars of God" ' " (Isa. 14:13, NKJV). Lucifer's ultimate presumption
was that he could seize the sovereignty that Christ had above all other
created thrones. His presumption was not only false but in direct
revolt against the basic law of the created order: Only the Creator can
be sovereign.
   " ' "I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the
farthest sides of the north" ' " (vs. 13, NKJV). Psalm 48:2 describes
Mount Zion as being "on the sides of the north." Lucifer's ambition
was to sit on the mount of the congregation—an ambition that once
fulfilled would no doubt win the angels' allegiance and their worship.
But worship is the prerogative of God and Him alone (see 1 Chron.
16:29; Ps. 96:9; Rev. 14:7).

     Upon what other presumption did Lucifer dare to act? Vs. 14.


    What is wrong with this particular presumption of Lucifer's?
After all, doesn't the Bible itself tell us we should seek to be like God,
to love like Him, to serve like Him, to forgive like Him, to hate sin
like Him, to be a source of hope like Him? (Gal. 5:22-26; Col. 3:12-
14). The problem, instead, is what it was about God that Lucifer
wanted for himself. Lucifer desired God's power, position, authority,
and glory; not His love, His benevolence, His mercy.
    Lucifer's rebellion did not begin as a full-blown revolt; it rarely
does, even in us. It starts small, unperceived, a little doubt here, a
little hatred there, a little greed or jealousy somewhere else. Soon it
all adds up into something that we never imagined at first. Unless we
guard our minds with God's Word and commit ourselves daily to
Him, revolt will not be far away.

    All of us have harbored, at one time or another, the germs of
 mutiny and revolt. How can we quickly recognize these prob-
 lems within ourselves, so that we can, through surrender to God
 and death to self, exterminate them before they lead us to our
 eternal ruin?

SATAN CAST OUT OF HEAVEN (Revelation 12).

  When Michael and His angels crushed the rebellion in heaven,
what happened to Lucifer and his angels? Rev. 12:7-9.




R
        evelation 12 provides a dramatic overview of the great contro-
        versy between Christ and Satan. Given in three major scenes,
         hat are not in chronological order, the chapter provides the
basic background of a conflict that involves every one of us (no one is
neutral in this war).
   Verses 1-6 focus upon Satan's attack on earth, first against the
Christ-child and then against Christ's church, which has to flee into
the wilderness for "one thousand two hundred and sixty days" (vs. 6,
NKJV).
   Verses 7-12 focus upon the original war in heaven, when Satan
first rebelled and with his fallen angels fought against Christ, a battle
they lost.
    Verses 13-17 focus back on the earth, where Satan, cast out of
heaven, continues his war against Christ (whom he was unable to
defeat) by attacking Christ's church, the next best thing to attacking
Christ Himself.

   As best you can, go back through Revelation 12 and write down
the sequence of events chronologically, starting, for example, with
verse 7, which describes the war in heaven. What follows, and in
what order do they come? (Remember that some events are re-
peated.)




   Centuries ago, a German theologian and philosopher named
 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz coined the word theodicy, meaning
 "the justification of God," the idea being that, in the end, all
 His ways will be justified before the universe. How do you
 understand this notion of God being "justified" in His actions
 before creatures of His own creation? What does that tell us
 about His character? How does the idea of theodicy help us
 understand the continued existence of Satan, even after his
 defeat at the Cross?

F
       URTHER STUDY: The great controversy is a study in con-
       trasts: Satan's character of pride and self-glorification as op-
       posed to Christ's character of unselfish love and service. Prov-
erbs 6:16-19 gives us a picture of one. Philippians 2:5-8 portrays the
other.
   "Satan's rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through all
coming ages—a perpetual testimony to the nature of sin and its ter-
rible results. The working out of Satan's rule, its effects upon both
men and angels, would show what must be the fruit of setting aside
the divine authority. It would testify that with the existence of God's
government is bound up the well-being of all the creatures He has
made. Thus the history of this terrible experiment of rebellion was
to be a perpetual safeguard to all holy beings, to prevent them from
being deceived as to the nature of transgression, to save them
from committing sin, and suffering its penalty."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pp. 42, 43.

   To learn more about the topics discussed in this week's lesson,
read any or all of the following: Early Writings, "The Fall of Satan,"
pp. 145-147; Patriarchs and Prophets, "Why Was Sin Permitted?"
pp. 33-43; The Great Controversy, "The Origin of Evil," pp. 492-504.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In what ways does Satan fit the description in Proverbs
     6:16-19?

     2. Why does the Bible refer to sin as the "mystery of iniq-
        uity"? (2 Thess. 2:7; see also Rev. 17:5, 7). Contrast this
        mystery with the one Paul wrote about in 1 Timothy 3:16.

     3. Augustine once wrote that it seemed as if humans were put
        in an arena to do battle for the truth. How do you under-
        stand this concept, that of us doing battle for the truth, in
        the context of the great controversy?

       UMMARY: The great controversy began in heaven when

S      Lucifer attempted to exalt himself above his Creator. Calling
       into question God's loving character, he was able to deceive a
third of the angels. Because pride and self-glorification cannot by its
very nature live in harmony with God's selfless love, Lucifer, along
with those he seduced, was cast from heaven. Even though the great
controversy still rages on global and personal levels, we should not
despair. "God is love," His "love endures forever" (1 John 4:16; Ps.
107:1, NIV), and His love has defeated the foe in our behalf.

                 Faithful Hitchhikers, Part 1
                         Gladstone Simmons

    When Clara Smith, a single parent living on the Navajo reserva-
 tion in New Mexico, learned about a prophecy seminar that the All
 Nations Adventist church in Gallup, New Mexico, was conduct-
 ing, she decided to attend. She took her three teenage children with
 her. Night after night Clara and her children, Alexis, 18, Dana, 17,
 and LaCora, 14, made the 80-mile round trip to attend the meet-
 ings. They were thrilled by the clear explanation of Bible truth that
 the pastor presented, and in November 1999, Clara and her chil-
 dren committed their lives to God in baptism.
    Every Sabbath Clara and her teenagers faithfully made the trip
 in her aging auto to worship God with her new church family.
 Then late one night as the family returned home after prayer
 meeting, a black cow wandered across the dark highway in front of
 her car. There was no time to stop, and Clara hit the cow.
    No one was seriously injured, but the car was totaled. Clara had
 no insurance, and the cow's owner refused to repay her loss. Clara
 could not work because of rheumatoid arthritis, and had no money
 to replace the car. And no other church members live anywhere
 near her to give them a ride to church.
    But Clara and her family refused to let this setback keep them
 from their weekly appointments with God. Clara and her children
 prayed that God would help them get to church some other way.
     Early on Sabbath morning Clara and her children set out on foot
 toward the highway. A few minutes later a car stopped, and the
 driver offered them a ride into town.
     Week after week the family prayed for a ride, then set out for
 church. God is faithful, and the family did not miss a single
 Sabbath. And they are never late, in spite of their irregular mode of
 transportation. They even attend prayer meeting, and once a month
 Clara and her children hitchhiked to the church to take their turn
 cleaning it for Sabbath.
     One Sabbath a driver stopped to offer the family a ride. He
  asked where they were going, and when Clara replied that they
  were going to church, the driver said, "I am on my way to work.
  When I reach my job, you may drive on to church. Just bring the
  car back to me when church is over."

             Issues in the Great
                Controversy



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 8:42-46; 14:9-11; Rev.
12:17.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'Do you not believe that I am in the Fa-
     ther, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do
     not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in
     Me does the works' " (John 14:10, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: The great controversy is a cosmic battle
involving God and Satan. What are the root issues of this conflict,
and how have they been manifested?



L
        ET GOD BE GOD. Though the Bible doesn't give a system-
        atic explication of the specific issues in the great controversy,
        we may gather from the overall biblical portrayal that these
issues center on God's character and around God's law, which reveals
that character.
    As we study this week's lesson, we need to be aware of God's
infinity and our finiteness, of God's omnipotence and our frailty. We
are mortals approaching a divine mystery. God is holy; we are sin-
ners. Let us take off our shoes (Exod. 3:5, 6) as we seek to understand
the ways in which His grace and love are His chief weapons in the
great controversy.
   "He that ruleth in the heavens is the one who sees the end from the
beginning—the one before whom the mysteries of the past and the future
are alike outspread, and who, beyond the woe and darkness and ruin
that sin has wrought, beholds the accomplishment of His own purposes
of love and blessing."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 43.

GOD'S LAW.

   "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 12:17).

    f Satan wars against God's people because they are faithful to His

/   law (Rev. 12:17), we can conclude that one of the issues in the
    great controversy is that law. Scripture says that "everyone who
sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness" (1 John 3:4, NIV). But
sin is more than lawlessness. Read Psalm 40:8. This Messianic text
identifies the principles of God's law with His personal will. Sin,
therefore, is also rebellion against God Himself.
   When 1 John 3:8 says that "the devil has been sinning from the
beginning" (NIV), it seems that right from the start of the great
controversy, Lucifer rebelled against God by questioning the neces-
sity of obeying His law.

    What position did Jesus take regarding the law?




    Matt. 5:17, 18 (what Jesus taught)




    John 15:10 (Jesus' testimony)




    2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 2:22 (the sinlessness of Jesus)




    The nature of a government is discerned by its laws: Evil
 governments have evil laws; good governments have good laws.
 In this context, what does it mean to say that God's law is a
 "transcript of His character"? (see The Great Controversy, p. 434).

                                                                      15
Monday                                                  January 7
GOD'S CHARACTER AND AUTHORITY (2 Chron. 20:6; Jer.
31:3; Dan. 7:14; John 3:16; Rom. 5:8; Rev. 19:6).

   What do the passages listed above teach us about God's char-
acter, power, and authority?


       he New Testament word used to describe God's love is agape.

T      It refers to love in its highest, fullest, and most selfless sense.
       The entire Bible portrays God's love, but nowhere more viv-
idly than it does at the Cross (1 John 4:9, 10). God's law, mercy,
providence, and judgment are all in harmony with His love. Even the
commandment He gave to Adam and Eve regarding the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:17) stemmed from that love. God
not only loves; He is love. This love includes "mercy," "loving-
kindness," "long-suffering," and "goodness."
   One of the most famous verses in the Bible is 1 John 4:8, "God is
love." What does that mean? If it said "God exudes love" or "Love is
a manifestation of God's character," then it would be easier to under-
stand. But "God is love"? Love is an emotion, a principle, or (to get
really technical) a specific chemical reaction in the brain. How, then,
do we understand this idea that God is love?

   How did Lucifer dispute God's character, power, and author-
ity in heaven? The following texts give us some clues: Matt. 5:21,
22; John 8:44; 1 John 3:11-15.


   In John 8:44, Jesus states that "from the beginning" Lucifer was a
liar and a murderer. Thus he was in violation of God's law (Exod.
20:13, 16), which, in essence, is His character. But whom did he kill
or lie about "from the beginning" (that is, before he was thrown out
of heaven)? Both Jesus and John state that anger and hatred are the
motivating forces behind murder (Matt. 5:21, 22; 1 John 3:11-15).
Therefore, in John 8:44, Jesus is apparently alluding to the emotions
Lucifer was harboring in his heart that led to spreading lies in heaven
about God's character. In effect, he was "murdering" God.

   Discrediting God's law, His character, and His authority doesn't
always have to be openly and blatantly manifested to be real. In
fact, more subtle forms could be even more dangerous, because
those doing so might not even be aware of what they are doing. In
what subtle ways could we, even as professed followers of Christ,
be guilty of this same sin? Even more important, how can we
break free from this most deadly of deceptions?

GOD THE SON (Matt. 4:8-11; John 14:10).



I
    n heaven, Satan sought for himself the worship only God deserves
    (Isa. 14:12-14). And, if that wasn't enough—on earth he at-
    tempted to get even God the Son to worship him! In exchange for
that worship, Satan offered Christ "all the kingdoms of the world and
their splendor" (Matt. 4:8, NIV).
   But were they really his to offer? On the contrary, they were
"stolen property, but so long as they were in his hands Satan pro-
posed to trade with them to his own advantage. Christ was the true
owner, and His ownership was based on the fact that He had made
`all things' (John 1:3). He had never abdicated His rights. Satan
knew that Jesus had come to contest his claim, and now offered to
surrender it without a conflict—but on conditions."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 314.

   What makes Christ (as opposed to Satan) the true "owner" of
this world? See Col. 1:16.


   Linked to the idea of Christ as owner of the world is the last of
Jesus' three temptations in which His status as God the Son, the
Creator, is another issue in the great controversy:
   1. Satan disputed Christ's unparalleled position. (For Christ's
status, see Matt. 16:16; John 1:1-3; 10:30; 14:10; 17:5; Rom. 9:5;
Phil. 2:5-8; Titus 2:13.)
   2. Satan was jealous of Christ's position in the Godhead, and on
earth he thought he could make Christ bow to him.
   3. Satan knew that God alone is worthy of worship and that as God the
Son, Christ deserves worship from all created beings. Getting Christ to
worship him meant getting Him to doubt His own position in the Godhead.
   4. Jesus' mission was to return Satan's "stolen property" to the
Father by shedding His blood for sin.
   "Satan had questioned whether Jesus was the Son of God. In his
summary dismissal [Matt. 4:10] he had proof that he could not
gainsay. Divinity flashed through suffering humanity. Satan had no
power to resist the command. Writhing with humiliation and rage, he
was forced to withdraw from the presence of the world's Redeemer."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 130.

    Harry was raised in the church, but as a young man, he left,
 disgruntled and angry. Whenever anyone in his family tried to
 talk to him about the claims that Christ had on his life, he would
 retort: "No one owns me. I am my own man." Are we really our
 own? How would you answer him?

                                                                     17

GOD'S JUSTICE AND MERCY (Rev. 12:10; Zech. 3:1-5).

   Based on Revelation 12:10 and Zechariah 3:1-5, what is an-
other issue in the great controversy?


  Satan, Jesus said, is a liar; he is also the "accuser of our breth-
ren." What are some of the accusations Satan makes against us?
Does he even have to lie about us? Can the truth, alone, of our
deeds be enough to condemn us? If so, what's our only defense
against his accusations?


        an God be both just and merciful—or are these two attributes

C       mutually exclusive? If obeying God's will is so crucial to the
        welfare of His created beings, then how can it be fair to grant
mercy to those who violate His will? Lucifer disputes God's right to
offer sinners grace and forgiveness, and he bases that dispute on
questions such as these.
    Even the casual observer can see what a dilemma sin must be for
God. He loves His creatures no less because they have sinned (Hos.
11:8). But how can a holy God remain true to His nature if He
forgives them? The following illustration helps us to understand:
    Martin Luther dreamed he was standing before the judgment seat
of God, where Satan spread out a long scroll on which he had kept a
careful record of Luther's innumerable sins. With great fervor, the
accuser argued before God, "This man cannot enter the kingdom. He
has violated the law times without number. He deserves death. He
cannot enter heaven where only the loyal and the obedient live."
Martin Luther then told Satan to take his hand off the scroll. Satan
said, "I will not." Luther again demanded that he do it, and the devil
again refused. Finally, Luther said, "In the name of Jesus Christ,
move your hand!" Satan then moved it from the scroll, which said:
"The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses Martin Luther from all his sins."
    Here is the mystery of the Cross, the mystery of how God could be
both just and merciful. At the Cross, He poured out His righteous and
just indignation against sin. That's God's justice. But He poured it out
in the person of Jesus, not us, the ones who deserved that punishment.
That's God's mercy. Thus, it was through the Cross, and only through
the Cross, that God was able to be both just and merciful.

     Picture yourself among some of those soldiers nailing Jesus to the
 cross. Imagine taking the nails and hammering them into His hands
 and feet. Though we weren't there, in the flesh, doing that to Jesus, we
 still, in a real sense, share in the guilt of His death. How so?

GOD'S PREROGATIVES (Deut. 10:12, 13; Matt. 7:21; Rev.
14:7).



B
        ecause God is who He is, He has certain rights or privileges
        (prerogatives) that His creatures cannot claim for themselves.
        What are some of these prerogatives? Based on previous lessons
in this Bible Study Guide, how did Lucifer take issue with each of them?

      Texts           God's Prerogatives         Lucifer's Issues


   Deut. 10:12, 13


   Matt. 7:21


   Rev. 14:7


   When we understand (to whatever degree possible) what God has
done for us, when we accept His activities on our behalf and apply
them to our lives with the help of the Holy Spirit, then we can fear
God. Fearing God means approaching Him with awe and reverence,
being completely loyal to Him, and surrendering ourselves totally to
His will (see Deut. 4:10).
   Giving God glory means to praise Him and honor Him (see Ps.
115:1; Isa. 42:12; 2 Pet. 3:18; Jude 25).
   "The Creator of the universe is the true and only object of worship.
No man, no angel, is worthy of worship. This is the prerogative of
God only. Creatorship is one of the distinguishing features of the true
God in contrast with false deities (Jer. 10:11, 12). The appeal to
worship God as Creator has become especially timely in the years
following the initial preaching of the first angel's message, because
of the rapid spread of the theory of evolution. Furthermore, the call to
worship the God of heaven as Creator of all things implies that due
heed be given to the sign of God's creative works—the Sabbath of the
Lord. . . . If the Sabbath had been kept as God intended, it would have
served as a great safeguard against infidelity and evolution."—The
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 828.

    Why does God ask us to worship Him? Does the Creator
 really need our worship? Or is worship for our own good? If so,
 how would worshiping God be to our advantage? In other words,
 what good does it do for us, personally, to worship God?

                                                                      19

FURTHER STUDY: According to Revelation 12:17 and 19:10, what
is another issue in the great controversy?

       he word 'prophecy' describes any inspired message communi-

T      cated by God through a prophet (see on Matt. 11:9). Prophecy
       may be a prediction of future events, though more commonly it
is not. The expression 'spirit of prophecy' refers specifically to the
`manifestation of the Spirit' in the form of a special gift of the Holy
Spirit that inspires the recipient and enables him to speak authorita-
tively as a representative of God (1 Cor. 12:7-10) when 'moved by the
Holy Ghost' to do so (2 Peter 1:21). The context of the expression in
Rev. 19:10 defines 'the testimony of Jesus' and 'the spirit of proph-
ecy' in this sense. In view of the fact that the 'remnant' of ch. 12:17
specifically refers to the church after the close of the 1260 prophetic
days of vs. 6 and 14, that is, after 1798 . . . , ch. 12:17 stands as a
clear prediction of the special manifestation of the 'spirit,' or 'gift,'
of prophecy in the church in our day. Seventh-day Adventists believe
the ministry of Ellen G. White meets the specifications of Rev. 12:17
in a unique way."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 876.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What role does God's law have in the great controversy? Why
     did God not change His law in order to meet humanity in its
     fallen condition? Would having changed the law been an admis-
     sion that something was wrong with it from the start?

     2. Didn't God know, even when He created Lucifer, that eventu-
        ally Lucifer would rebel? God knew, too, that Adam and Eve
        would sin, did He not? Why, then, did God create these beings,
        knowing what would happen? Perhaps a key to understanding
        this is to understand that God has given His creatures free will;
        that if He wanted beings who could love Him, He had to create
        them free, for only free beings can love. Yet this freedom has
        caused so much pain and suffering. Was it worth it? How does
        what happened at the Cross, in that God Himself suffered in
        the person of Jesus, help answer some of the issues involved in
        the great controversy?

       UMMARY: At the root of the great controversy lie several

S      issues. Some of these include God's law, His character and
       authority, His justice and mercy, His prerogatives, and the posi-
tion of His Son, Jesus. Satan raised these issues while he was an angel
of light in heaven, and he is still raising them globally and in our
personal lives. But praise be to God for His love and mercy—two
indestructible weapons in the fight against sin.

                Faithful Hitchhikers, Part 2
                        Gladstone Simmons

   Although Clara Smith and her teenagers live 40 miles from the
Adventist church, they never missed a Sabbath service or prayer
meeting. When their car was demolished in an accident, they
prayed for a ride and began hitchhiking to church.
   Sometimes the family would get a ride quickly, but occasion-
ally they had to walk several miles before someone would offer
them a ride. When this happened Clara sometimes asked the pastor's
wife for a bandage to cover the blisters on her aching feet, but she
never complained, though her arthritis caused her a great deal of
pain. Always the pastor or someone in the church would take them
home.
   Being without a car caused other problems for the family.
Alexis and Dana have completed secondary school and want to
attend college, but the nearest college is in Gallup, 40 miles away,
and there is no public transportation to town. The family cannot
afford to send them to a boarding college. Alexis hopes to study
history and law, and Dana would like to become an elementary
school teacher.
    While waiting for an opportunity to continue their studies,
Alexis and Dana have tried to find jobs. Repeatedly they hitch-
hiked into Gallup to look for work. But lack of a consistent means
of transportation and their refusal to work on Sabbaths have sty-
mied their efforts to find jobs. But the young people would not
grumble. Instead they threw their energies into helping the family
and serving their church. Alexis enjoys leading the song service,
and Dana runs the sound system.
    The family continues to rely on God's providence and the
kindness of strangers to get to church. Clara testified, "I receive
                                         such a blessing as I wor-
                                         ship with God's people. I
                                         cannot understand why some
                                         people do not attend church
                                         regularly."

                 The Contenders




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 2:5-11; 1 John 1:5-10; 3:4-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "'I am the light of the world. He who
     follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of
     life" (John 8:12, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: Who are the chief contenders in the great
controversy? What weapons does each contender employ, and how
effective are they?

        HE LORD OF LIGHT VERSUS THE PRINCE OF DARK-

T       NESS. Many New Testament word pictures portray the contend-
        ers in the great controversy. Studying these pictures will help us
better understand the nature of the war. Anyone who wants to know the truth
can see the stark contrast between the opponents. They are Immanuel—God
with us—versus the devouring lion in our midst; the Lord of light versus the
prince of darkness; the God of truth against the father of lies; Christ versus
antichrist. One is the Shepherd, the other a wolf.
    We should be able to see, too, that there's no compromise between these
two contenders. The issues between them are too deep, too divisive, too
contrary to allow for any kind of truce, any kind of conditional surrender,
any kind of synthesis of sides into some sort of settlement, as often happens
between warring nations. Instead, it's a matter of one side that is wholly
good fighting against another side that is wholly evil in a battle that only one
or the other can win. There's no middle ground between them, no possibility
of cooperation. Whenever the battle is over, the victory will be complete and
unconditional, with one side, our side—under the command of Lord Jesus—
enjoying the fruits of a hard-fought battle that we're all engaged in, even if
Jesus was the decisive victor for us 2,000 years ago.

Sunday                                               January 13
GOD WITH US VERSUS A LION IN OUR MIDST (Matt. 1:23;
1 Pet. 5:8).

           hen God cast Satan out of heaven, Satan took upon himself

W          the task of deceiving the whole world (Rev. 12:9). With the
           fall of Adam and Eve, Satan turned this world into a
battlefield on which the opponents fight over the issues we studied in
lesson 2.
   As he did with Eve, Satan often pretends to be our ally. "He fre-
quently appears as an angel of light, assuming friendly airs, presenting
peculiar temptations which it is difficult for the inexperienced to with-
stand."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 207. But however subtle
Satan may be, he remains our "adversary," lurking "about like a roaring
lion, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Pet. 5:8, NKJV).

   Based on such a description, what deceptions might Satan use
to get us on his side? Might we be on Satan's side without even
knowing it?

   Peter's own experience with Satan certainly qualified him to por-
tray our enemy as a stalking lion seeking its prey. During their last
Passover together, Jesus told Peter that Satan would haunt his foot-
steps (Luke 22:31). Indeed, before the night was over, Peter would
deny his Lord and Savior not once but three times (vss. 34, 54-62).
Jesus, however, did not leave him without hope. Immediately after
telling him that Satan desired to have him, Jesus said, " 'But I have
prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have
turned back, strengthen your brothers' " (vs. 32, NIV).

   Jesus could offer Peter hope because of a plan that God, in His
infinite wisdom, formulated to redeem us. When did He develop this
plan, and what did it include? Rom. 5:19; 1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8.

   Satan claimed this world as his (Matt. 4:8, 9; John 14:30), but God
sent us His Son. Born as a babe, He became " 'Immanuel . .. God with
us' " (Matt. 1:23, NKJV). He took upon Himself our human nature,
and in that nature He crushed Satan.

    Who of us hasn't, at some point, fallen as Peter did, in the
 sense that—though boldly proclaiming (maybe just in our hearts)
 that we'd stay faithful to Christ no matter what—we allowed
 Satan to come in and cause to us betray Christ anyway? Yet
 why didn't Jesus reject Peter, and why can we have hope that
 He, Immanuel, won't reject us either, if we do the same?

                                                                       23

THE LORD OF LIGHT VERSUS THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS.

  "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
shall have the light of life" (John 8:12).

    n the beginning of Creation, Christ, the Creator, said: "Let there

/   be light" (Gen. 1:3; John 1:1-5). Thus He dispelled the darkness
    that was over the earth. The same Christ now proclaims that He is
the Light of the world—a light that has come to dispel the moral and
spiritual darkness that has overtaken the world as a result of sin.

     As light, what does Jesus provide for us?

     2 Cor. 4:6



     1 John 1:7



     Ps. 119:105



     Ps. 27:1



   It has been said that all the darkness in the world can't cover or
hide the light from even a single candle. In the same way, no matter
how "dark" our situation might be, Jesus, the Light, is there to guide
us through the darkness, if we are willing to turn toward Him.
   There is something absolute about the Father and Christ being
light. Because light is what the Father and Christ are, there can be no
darkness in them at all (1 John 1:5). Because light is opposed to
darkness, Christ is by nature opposed to Satan, the prince of dark-
ness. As the presence of light dispels darkness, so the presence of
Christ assures Satan's defeat.

    Scientists speculate on the existence of black holes, objects in
 space so dense, so full of mass, that their gravitational pull allows
 nothing to escape, not even light. Considering, in the spiritual
 realm, who our Light is, can any spiritual black holes exist?

Tuesday                                             January 15
THE GOD OF TRUTH VERSUS THE FATHER OF LIES.

  "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no
man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

     ohn 14:6 is a profound statement, not carelessly made or selfishly

J    asserted. He not only came to show the truth about God the
     Father, Satan, sin, and redemption; He is the truth. Because He is
the incarnation of truth, He is the only way to the Father and the only
source of eternal life.
    The truth is divine reality—who God is, what He does, and how He
relates to His created beings. Many people have speculated on what
constitutes truth. Even with Truth standing before him, Pilate asked,
"What is truth?" (John 18:38). There are many and varied answers,
and Satan delights in all of them, because they are all weapons in his
arsenal. But the Creator has the ultimate weapon. Jesus says that He
is the truth (John 14:6). Truth has put on human garb, and to know
Him is to know the Father and to have eternal life (John 14:9; 17:3).

   So often, we tend to think of truth as propositions, statements,
such as A=B and B=C, therefore A=C. Jesus, however, by the state-
ment that He is truth, puts even the concept of truth in a whole
different perspective. How do we understand this idea of truth
being a Person? Consider the fact that Jesus is the Creator of
everything created (Col. 1:16). Could that concept help us under-
stand how Jesus is the truth?


   While Jesus is the truth, Satan is "the father of lies" (John 8:44,
NIV). Satan told lies in heaven, in Eden, and in the wilderness. In the
following verses, we see not only blatant lies but even more subtle
ones. What were they?

   Eden (Gen. 3:1)

   Heaven (Job 1:10,11)

   Wilderness (Matt. 4:5, 6)

    Jesus is the truth; Satan is the father of lies. The contrast is
 blatant. However, in our own lives, the line can seem blurred,
 especially when we find ourselves in positions in which the tempta-
 tion to lie, even for a "greater good," is very alluring. What does
 today's lesson teach about whom we're reflecting when we lie?
 What should it tell us about lying? Is anyone ever justified in lying?

                                                                     25

CHRIST VERSUS ANTICHRIST (Matt. 16:13-17; 1 John 2:18-23).

           e saw last week that one of the issues in the great contro-

W         versy centers on Christ's status in heaven. Satan refused to
          acknowledge that Christ is equal to the Father. Since his
expulsion to our world, he battles this issue with even greater vigor.
Satan has tried to usurp the role that belongs only to Christ. This
action has been manifested in various ways, through Satan himself or
his proxies (see Isa. 14:13, 14; Ezek. 28:2, 6; 2 Thess. 2:3, 4).
   First John 2:18-23 speaks of the antichrist in both singular and
plural terms. The singular reference is to Satan, the original antichrist,
who, from the beginning of the battle, has opposed Christ.
   Satan also works against Christ and His role in redemptive history
through certain human agencies and systems. Though antichrist has
been around since John's time, it has been manifested particularly in
a church that assumes for itself the role and prerogatives that belong
only to God or Christ Himself.

   Antichrist doesn't mean just "against Christ" but, in fact, "in
place of Christ." How does that definition better help us identify
the antichrist?


  Christ Himself asked His disciples who they thought He was.
How did Peter respond? Matt. 16:13-17.


    Jesus Christ is the eternal Word, the second Person of the Godhead—
coexistent, coeternal, and coequal with God the Father. Jesus was not a
created being but rather existed from eternity with the Father. As such,
He's in a whole separate category from any created being. As part of the
Godhead, He's the Creator; everything and everyone else, Lucifer in-
cluded, are created. The difference, then, between Christ and Satan is,
in a sense, the difference between the finite and the infinite. Like Peter,
Satan is fully aware of Christ's position; but unlike Peter, he constantly
attempts to usurp that position, one way or another.

   In Matthew 6:24 Jesus said, "No man can serve two masters:
for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will
hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
mammon." How do these words fit in today's lesson? How do
you understand His meaning here? More importantly, if you
were to take an honest, serious look at your own life, at your
own priorities, at how you spend your time, which of these two
masters could you honestly say you are serving?

THE SHEPHERD VERSUS THE WOLF (John 10:11-15).

  Answer the following questions based on the scripture above:

  Who is the Good Shepherd?


  Who is the hireling?


   Who is the wolf?


   What is the relationship between the wolf and the
   hireling?


   Explain the relationship between the shepherd and the sheep.




         ftentimes, a hired hand is interested only in the money he will

0        make, but a good shepherd does not work for compensation
         alone. The shepherd owns the sheep and loves them. Likewise,
Jesus is not just going through the motions for His benefit. He loves us to
the point of actually having died for our sins. It was His love for us that
led Christ to take up the cross. He died because He willed to die and thus
turned an earthly government's instrument of capital punishment into the
heavenly government's instrument of victory over sin, death, and Satan.

    Between the flock and the peril stands the Good Shepherd.
 The wolf's only objective is to devour the sheep. List some of the
 contrasts that exist between the work and attitudes of the Shep-
 herd and the wolf. (For example, Christ died that we might live.
 Satan lives to lead us away from life.) And though we are sheep,
 helpless against the wolf without the protection of our Shep-
 herd, what things can we do to make the Shepherd's job of
 protecting us easier? In other words, what do we do that makes
 it very difficult for the Shepherd to be able to render to us the
 protection He wants to give us? At the same time, what can we
 do to best place ourselves under the protection the Shepherd
 willingly offers us? In the end, if the wolf devours us, where
 must the fault ultimately lie, and why?

                                                                        27

F
       URTHER STUDY: This week, we studied five sets of con-
       trasting word pictures that portray the role and function of the
       chief contenders in the great controversy. Following are three
other such portraits: Acts 3:15/John 8:44; 1 Tim. 2:5/Rev. 12:10; Isa.
9:6/John 14:30. As you read each one, consider what it tells us about
Christ and Satan and the part they play in the war over good and evil.
   "Christ is 'the Prince of Peace' (Isaiah 9:6), and it is His mission
to restore to earth and heaven the peace that sin has broken. 'Being
justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ.' Romans 5:1. Whoever consents to renounce sin and open his
heart to the love of Christ becomes a partaker of this heavenly peace.
   "There is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of Christ
received into the heart subdues enmity; it allays strife and fills the
soul with love. He who is at peace with God and his fellow men
cannot be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil surmisings
will find no room there; hatred cannot exist. The heart that is in
harmony with God is a partaker of the peace of heaven and will
diffuse its blessed influence on all around."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, pp. 27, 28.

   To learn more about this week's topic, read Prophets and Kings,
"Joshua and the Angel," pp. 582-592.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Christ is the friend of sinners. So is Satan. What are the
     differences between these two friendships?

     2. We may not be pastors, elders, or deacons. We may not be
        holding any official position in the church. Yet we have a
        responsibility to nurture other church members. If we fail
        in that responsibility, how are we like the hireling in the
        parable of the Good Shepherd? (see Thursday's lesson).
        List ways we can fulfill our nurturing role.

      UMMARY: Christ and Satan, the chief contenders in the great

S     controversy, both employ certain strategies and weapons. But
      Satan's attempts to coerce, spread fear, and tell lies about
God's character are no match for us as we learn to trust the guidance
of the Holy Spirit, the Word of God, and His love for us. Dressed in
the armor of Christ's righteousness as we rally around the Cross, we
glory in His victory, for it is ours, as well.

                        The Joy of Christ
                             J. H. Zachary

   Dennis Patinde pastors a small group of Adventist Christians in
Mali, a predominantly Muslim country.
   Lamine is the son of the imam, the Muslim teacher. From childhood
Lamine had memorized large portions of the Qu'ran. But as he ma-
tured, he became discouraged over the uncertainties of life. He wished
for a deeper spiritual experience, but he did not know how to achieve it.
Then he met Pastor Patinde, the first Christian pastor Lamine had ever
known.
   "Religion should be a joy," Lamine told Patinde. "So why is it such
a burden? Why is there so much fear and hatred, so much killing?"
   The youthful pastor and the imam's son talked for some time. As
the two discussed spiritual issues and prayed together, Lamine caught a
new glimpse of God. Patinde gave Lamine a Bible, and Lamine began
to read it. He was amazed that it contained some stories found in the
Qu'ran.
    When Lamine read in the Qu'ran that a true believer should read the
prophets, the Gospels, and other writings of the Bible, he felt that he
was following the counsel of Mohammed, Islam's prophet. As he
continued studying the Bible, his burden was replaced with joy. He felt
a peace he had never known.
    Lamine had to be careful that no one saw him enter or leave the
pastor's home. Each night he went home by a different route so that no
one would know where he had been.
    But in spite of his care, word spread that Lamine, the son of the imam,
had become a Christian. Lamine's parents were angry and disowned
him. Pastor Patinde visited them and talked about their son. "Something
has happened to our son," Lamine's father said. "He is a different boy,
                                  happy and confident." Patinde explained
                                  that Lamine had discovered the joy of
                                  salvation in Jesus Christ.
                                      Lamine's parents eventually
                                  accepted his decision and are now
                                  studying the Bible. Lamine is praying
                                  that they, too, will follow Jesus one day
                                  soon.

     The War Comes to Earth




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1-6; 4:1-
12; 6:1-9:17; 11:1-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'And I will put enmity between you and the
     woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise
     your head, and you shall bruise His heel' " (Genesis 3:15, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: When Satan was cast out of heaven, he
eventually found his way to the earth; thus, the great controversy
shifted its theater of operation. What strategies did he use to capture
the human race? How does he use these strategies today? What did
God do to counterattack?



D
         ECEPTION AND DELIVERANCE. Genesis 1 and 2 pro-
         vide a picture of what God meant for us to be and to have, but
         like a knife to a master's canvas, the events in Genesis 3 slash the
idyllic scene to shreds. Now instead of peace, harmony, and selflessness, we
witness anger, jealousy, pride, disobedience, shame, and guilt—words, thoughts,
and actions that earlier had no existence. "God's creation of man as a person
stands as the source of good in us; now we face the source of evil."
—Lawrence 0. Richards, The Teacher's Commentary (Colorado Springs,
Colo.: Chariot Victor Publishing, 1987), p. 32.
   From this point in time, the agencies of deception and deliverance
have struggled over the heart of each person on earth. Adam and Eve,
Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood, and the Tower of Babel illustrate
well the beginning of this struggle, its underlying issues, and moti-
vating forces. As you study this week's lesson, consider how the
agencies of deception and deliverance are at work in your own life
and how you can choose deliverance.

ADAM AND EVE (Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1-6).

       od's laws govern His entire creation. When He placed Adam

G      and Eve in Eden, they were subject to His laws. Obedience is
       the Creator's first command and the creature's first privilege.
Both are born of love.

 What did God require of our first parents? Gen. 2:16, 17.
What was the essence of this requirement?


   "Given the intention of God that man should be in His own image,
that tree was a necessity! There is no moral dimension to the exist-
ence of a robot; it can only respond to the program imposed by its
maker. Robots have no capacity to value, no ability to choose between
good and bad, or good and better. To be truly like God, man must
have the freedom to make moral choices and the opportunity to
choose, however great the risk such freedom may involve."—Richards,
The Teacher's Commentary, p. 32.

   Scottish atheist J. L. Mackie has argued that an omnipotent
God should have created free beings who could have chosen to
make only good decisions and that freedom didn't require the
potential to do wrong. "If God has made men such," he wrote,
"that in their free choices they sometimes prefer what is good and
sometimes what is evil, why could he have not made men such that
they always freely choose the good?" What's wrong with that
argument? Would Adam and Eve have truly been free moral
agents if they could have made only right decisions? Discuss this
further with your class.


   Adam and Eve had given the wrong answer to a spiritual and
moral test. God had proven His unselfish love for them by creating
them in His own image and then entrusting them with dominion over
the rest of His creation. But they yielded to everyone's first and
greatest temptation—the desire to be one's own god. They destroyed
their relationship with Him by placing their will against His and in so
doing joined forces with the chief of all rebels.

    The test God presented to Adam and Eve was about loyalty to
 God and making the right choices. Obey the Sovereign Lord or
 the usurper. Abandon self or establish oneself as God. In what
 ways do we face these same choices every day, even in the "little
 things"?

                                                                    31

THE FIRST LIE (Gen. 3:1-6).

     What methods did Satan use to tempt Eve?

     Gen. 3:4, 5


     Gen. 3:6


       atan tempts us all in many ways, but his objective in doing so

S     is always the same: to get us to distrust and then disobey God.
       His speech to Eve is basically a three-part lie: 1. You shall not
die. 2. Your eyes shall be opened. 3. You shall be like God.

     How did God respond to the fall of Adam and Eve? Gen. 3:15.


   "Reference is made to the agelong struggle between Satan's 'seed'
or followers (John 8:44; Acts 13:10; 1 John 3:10) and the woman's
seed. The Lord Jesus Christ is styled by pre-eminence 'the seed'
(Rev. 12:1-5; cf. Gal 3:16, 19); it was He who came 'to destroy the
works of the devil' (Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8). . . .
   "[I]n this pronouncement is compressed the record of the great
controversy between Christ and Satan, a battle that began in heaven
(Rev. 12:7-9), was continued on earth, where Christ again defeated
him (Heb. 2:14), and will terminate finally with Satan's destruction
at the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:10)."—The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 1, p. 233.
    The enmity that God puts between the seed of the woman and the
seed of the serpent also can be viewed as the way by which sinful
humans can return to Christ. This way is none other than divine
grace, the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. We can read Jesus'
discussion with Nicodemus regarding this work in John 3:5-8. Labor-
ing with our conscience (Rom. 9:1), the Holy Spirit aspires to convict
us of sin and lead us to the Cross. Thus, He enables us to hate sin and
love righteousness (Amos 5:14, 15; Heb. 1:9).

  Read how the Old Testament describes the work of divine
grace on our hearts in Jeremiah 31:31, 33; Ezekiel 11:19, 20;
18:31; 36:26, 27. Through divine grace, we can (1) have our sins
washed away, (2) receive a new heart, and (3) have His Holy
Spirit live in us. Think of it as God's three-part remedy to
Satan's three-part lie.

CAIN AND ABEL (Gen. 4:1-12; 1 John 3:10-12).

     atan used Cain in the great controversy to (1) introduce a false

S    system of worship and (2) to cause resentment between human
     beings. Both involve the commandment of love—the first to-
ward God (Exod. 20:3-11), the second toward our fellow humans
(Exod. 20:12-17; see also Matt. 22:37-40).

   A false system of worship. "Cain brought an offering of the
fruit of the ground to the Lord. Abel also brought of the firstborn
of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his
offering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering" (Gen. 4:3-
5, NKJV).

   What did Cain's offering symbolize? Why was Abel's offering
pleasing to God? Heb. 11:4.


   "Cain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in the
world till the close of time. One class avail themselves of the
appointed sacrifice for sin; the other venture to depend upon their
own merits. . . .
   "The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain in-
cludes by far the greater portion of the world; for nearly every false
religion has been based on the same principle—that man can depend
upon his own efforts for salvation. . . . Humanity has no power to
regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward the divine, but
downward, toward the satanic. Christ is our only hope."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 72, 73.

   Resentment between human beings. "Cain rose against Abel his
brother and killed him" (Gen. 4:8, NKJV).
   Cain loved neither God nor his brother. Where there is no love, sin
thrives and Satan rejoices. Cain is an example of how a lack of love
destroys life, but Christ is the supreme example of how love redeems
life. "God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:8, RSV).

    Put yourself in the role of Cain, working hard to present your
 offering to God, who rejects it while He accepts your brother's
 offering, which is nothing but a slain animal. What was Cain's
 problem? What didn't he understand? What lessons does that
 hold for us today who might be tempted to harbor sentiments
 similar to Cain's?


                                                                   33
Wednesday                                             January 23
NOAH AND THE FLOOD (Gen. 6:1-9:17).

      omehow, between Genesis 3 and 6, Satan was able to gain so

S     much ground in the great controversy that "the Lord was grieved
      that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled
with pain. . . . But Noah found favor [grace, KJV] in the eyes of the
Lord" (Gen. 6:6-8, NIV).

   What does that mean, the idea that God's heart was filled with
pain? Does God have emotions? (See Exod. 32:11; 34:7; Deut.
4:31; 1 John 4:7.) How do we understand God's "emotions," if
that's even the right word? What limits do we have, as fallen
beings, in trying to understand this concept?


   God's "emotions" brought the Flood. The Flood tells us that God
cares very much about right and wrong, that His universe is moral,
and that He will punish unrepentant sinners. However, because of His
love for sinners, He gave the people 120 years to reconsider whose
side they wanted to be on in the great controversy. And while they
waited, they watched. The ark grew before their very eyes as a symbol
of the gospel God wanted them to accept.

  The Flood is God's judgment on sin. Love, no less than justice,
demanded that the earth be cleansed of evil. How does God's
judgment reflect His grace?


    While God's judgment destroys sin (2 Pet. 3:5-7), His grace and love
pursue the sinner as far and as long as possible. God's love is limitless,
His justice certain. To symbolize that love, God made a covenant with
Noah at the conclusion of His judgment (Gen. 9:8-17). In His mercy,
God looked down upon the small handful of people who came out of the
ark, and He pledged never again to destroy the entire earth by flood. As
a sign of this covenant, He set a rainbow in the sky. Noah did not, could
not, originate the covenant or the rainbow. Because of God's promise,
we have the assurance that His goodness never fails.

   Imagine being one of those who lived during the time of
Noah. Here's this man, claiming that water would fall out of the
sky—something that's never happened before. (He might as
well have said that fish could climb trees.) No wonder so many
didn't get on board. In what ways does Satan use this same ploy
today, getting us to doubt that which we have yet to see, in order
to try to keep people from "getting on the boat"?

Thursday                                            January 24
THE TOWER OF BABEL (Gen. 11:1-9).

   Why did Noah's descendants desire to build a tower that would
reach to the heavens? Gen. 11:4.


  What was the underlying motive of their desire? Compare this
motive to the motive that misdirected Lucifer while he was still in
heaven. Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:17.




T
       he Tower of Babel stood as a symbol of distrust in God's Word.
       His covenant with Noah assured his descendants that a flood
       would never again destroy the entire earth (Gen. 9:11). But still
they distrusted God and sought to save themselves by their own works.
    The people "disbelieved God's covenant that He would not again
bring a flood upon the earth. Many of them denied the existence of
God and attributed the Flood to the operation of natural causes. . . .
One object before them in the erection of the tower was to secure their
own safety in case of another deluge. By carrying the structure to a
much greater height than was reached by the waters of the Flood,
they thought to place themselves beyond all possibility of danger. . . .
The whole undertaking was designed to exalt still further the pride of
its projectors and to turn the minds of future generations away from
God and lead them into idolatry."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 119.
    The tower also was a symbol of disobedience to God. His command
at Creation and after the Flood was for people to spread throughout the
earth. But the builders of Babel became their own god and sought
strength in their faulty human reasoning. So, once again, God intervened
to fulfill His purpose. And once again Satan stood defeated, if not
speechless, while God confused the language of the builders.


    "The tower of Babel was a great human achievement, a
    wonder of the world. But it was a monument to the people
    themselves rather than to God. We may build monuments tol
    ourselves (expensive clothes, big house, fancy car, important
    job) to call attention to our achievements. These may not be
    wrong in themselves, but when we use them to give us identity
    and self-worth, they take God's place in our lives. We are free
    to develop in many areas, but we are not free to think we have
    replaced God. What 'towers' have you built in your life?"
    —Life Application Study Bible, p. 25.



                                                                     35

F
       URTHER STUDY: Read in 2 Peter 3 how Peter summarized
       and applied the message of the Flood. Give each verse a title or
       summary statement to help you develop a thorough idea of
what he is saying. Then determine how Peter's application is true for
us.
   " 'For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might
destroy the works of the devil.' Christ was engaged in this warfare in
Noah's day. It was His voice that spoke to the inhabitants of the old
world in messages of warning, reproof, and invitation. He gave the
people a probation of one hundred and twenty years, in which they
might have repented. But they chose the deceptions of Satan, and
perished in the waters of the Flood."—The SDA Bible Commentary,
Ellen G. White Comments, vol. 1, pp. 1088, 1089.

   If you are interested in learning more about how the great contro-
versy came to this earth and spread, read any or all of the following
chapters from Patriarchs and Prophets: "The Temptation and Fall,"
pp. 52-62; "The Plan of Redemption," pp. 63-70; "Cain and Abel
Tested," pp. 71-79; "The Flood," pp. 90-104; "After the Flood,"
pp. 105-110; "The Tower of Babel," pp. 117-124.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Some scholars have viewed the narratives of the Fall and
     the Flood as myth. Why do we affirm that they are histori-
     cal incidents? Consider the implication of New Testament
     evidence as part of your answer.

     2. Based on 1 Peter 3:4-7, how should the story of the Flood
        affect our lives?

     3. Discuss the deceptive doctrines and beliefs that are an
        outgrowth of Satan's threefold lie (Monday's lesson). An-
        other method Satan uses to tempt us is to mix truth with his
        lies. In what ways was this first lie "true"?

      UMMARY: With the fall of Adam and Eve, this world has

S     become the center of the great controversy between Christ and
      Satan. They, along with Cain and Abel, Noah and the Flood,
and the Tower of Babel illustrate how good and evil struggle to win
the hearts and minds of human beings. Satan's weapons include lies
about God, our desire for self-exaltation, false systems of worship,
and resentment between humans. But Genesis 3:15 tells us that
God's weapon—divine grace shaping and molding the human heart
through the work of the Holy Spirit—will prevail.

                   The Illiterate Evangelist
                          Ch. Victor Sam

   "The mission needs 50 volunteer evangelists to help enter new
villages in our area," the pastor announced one Sabbath. "There
will be training for those who volunteer. Those who are interested
see me after the service."
   Sangayya (sung-GEE-yah), felt that God was calling him, and
after the service he told the pastor, "I would like to be one of those
volunteers."
   "But Sangayya," the pastor said kindly. "You cannot read or
write. How will you take notes on the lectures during the training
program? How can you give Bible studies?"
   "I will take my little daughter to help me," Sangayya answered.
"She is in the fifth grade and can read and write well. She will take
notes for me. I will memorize the Bible studies, and she can help
me find the Bible texts."
    Reluctantly the pastor added Sangayya's name to the list of
volunteers. He was accepted, and he and his 10-year-old daughter
went to the training program together. For six days the child sat
next to her father during every session. Carefully she took notes
on everything the teachers said. At the end of the training, Sangayya
stood in commitment to study the Bible with everyone in his
village.
    Sangayya and his daughter went from house to house praying
for the people and sharing words of hope and truth about Jesus
Christ. At the end of one month he invited a pastor to conduct a
series of evangelistic meetings. Sangayya invited the people with
whom he had studied to attend the meetings. At the close of the
                                   meetings 100 precious new believ-
                                   ers were baptized.
                                      "I can't read nor write,"
                                   Sangayya admits. "But that will
                                   not stop me from sharing the won-
                                   derful truths I have come to love.
                                   I am glad that God is willing to
                                   use even poor and illiterate me to
                                   build up His kingdom."

          Winning and Losing




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 39; Judges 13-16;
2 Samuel 11-12; 1 Kings 18:20-40; Heb. 11:23-29.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'How long will you falter between two
     opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow
     him' " (1 Kings 18:21, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTION: The great controversy is fought, in part, through
human agents. In what ways is the battle manifested in our lives?

       HE BATTLE CRY OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY.

T       Satan will attempt to influence every person, especially those
       who claim to be God's servants, to deny their Creator and view
His commandments as harsh and arbitrary. During such struggles, the
cry of the battle is: Whom will you serve? This week we will study
about Joseph, Moses, Samson, David, and Elijah to see how they
prepared themselves to answer this battle cry.
   "The whole universe is watching with inexpressible interest the
closing scenes of the great controversy between good and evil. The
people of God are nearing the borders of the eternal world; what can
be of more importance to them than that they be loyal to the God of
heaven? All through the ages, God has had moral heroes, and He has
them now—those who, like Joseph and Elijah and Daniel, are not
ashamed to acknowledge themselves His peculiar people. His special
blessing accompanies the labors of men of action, men who will not
be swerved from the straight line of duty, but who with divine energy
will inquire, 'Who is on the Lord's side?' (Exodus 32:26)."—Proph-
ets and Kings, p. 148. As you read this week's lesson, ask yourself
how the lives of the people we are studying can help you remain true
to duty in the battles that you, personally, are facing.

JOSEPH (Genesis 39).

  "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
God?" (Gen. 39:9).

  How did Joseph know that having an affair with his master's
wife would have been a "sin against God" when the giving of the
Ten Commandments at Sinai was still many centuries away?


  Make a list of excuses Joseph could have used to rationalize
away his sin, had he chosen to do so:




A
        salesman confessed to his pastor one day that he had become
        entangled in an illicit love affair. "I couldn't help it," he
         rationalized. "You can't possibly understand the outside pres-
sures that were affecting me."
   The pastor responded: "You couldn't help it? Outside pressures?
Whatever happened to your inside braces?"
   Joseph had his outside pressures too! The daily persistence of an
attractive woman. The promise of romance. Sexual passion. The
likelihood of not getting caught. Society's tolerance of sexual immor-
ality. The possible advantages of climbing high on the professional
ladder. And above all, Satan's ceaseless whispers that such an act
was nothing. But Joseph's inside braces kept him from betraying
God. The story of Joseph, however, up to that point, revealed some-
thing that showed why he acted as he did. What was it? See Genesis
39:1, 2.

    Suppose Joseph had succumbed to Satan's wiles and sinned
 against his master and his God. Would this have been the unpar-
 donable sin? No. Couldn't he have been forgiven and the slate
 wiped clean? Yes. But there's a deeper issue with sin than just
 forgiveness. Would God have been able to use Joseph to the
 extent that He did if Joseph had fallen at that time? In other
 words, how does sin, even if forgiven, sometimes limit what we
 could otherwise accomplish for the Lord?

                                                                    39
Monday                                              January 28
MOSES (Heb. 11:23-29).



M
          oses' role in the great controversy was to forge a nation out
          of battered tribes who had nearly lost their identity to sla-
          very—a nation through whom God would spread the mes-
sage of salvation to the world and from whom would come the Mes-
siah.
   Satan, however, hoped to win a decisive victory in the war between
good and evil, and his tool in this case was Pharaoh's determination to
keep Israel under his domination (Exodus 1; 5). When that didn't
work, he thought he could gain victory through Israel's complaining
spirit and subsequent 40 years of wandering in the wilderness (Num.
10:11-14:45).

  How did Moses prepare for his role and succeed in fulfilling it?
Heb. 11:23-29.


   Moses made choices that prepared him for the battles ahead.
Putting things into perspective early in his life, he refused Egypt's
throne. He chose affliction with God's people rather than the pleas-
ures of sin. He esteemed "disgrace for the sake of Christ" (vs. 26,
NIV) greater than the riches of Egypt. He confronted Pharaoh, kept
the Passover, then led Israel to freedom (Exodus 5-12). He mediated
the law and established the sanctuary service (Exodus 19-30). He
snuffed out rebellion, pleaded to God on Israel's behalf, and finally
brought them to the borders of the Promised Land (Exodus 32; Num.
22:1-36:13). But he could not enter Canaan because of one specific
sin (Num. 20:7-11, 24). However, he was resurrected and taken to the
presence of God (Matt. 17:1-13; Jude 9).
   "Never, till exemplified in the sacrifice of Christ, were the justice
and the love of God more strikingly displayed than in His dealings
with Moses. God shut Moses out of Canaan, to teach a lesson which
should never be forgotten—that He requires exact obedience. . . . He
could not grant the prayer of Moses that he might share the inherit-
ance of Israel, but He did not forget or forsake. His servant. The God
of heaven understood the suffering that Moses had endured; He had
noted every act of faithful service through those long years of conflict
and trial. On the top of Pisgah, God called Moses to an inheritance
infinitely more glorious than the earthly Canaan."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 479.

    Through Moses' faith and obedience, God's justice and love
 stood vindicated. How can you, as a single individual, make a
 difference in the conflict between good and evil? Or can't you?

SAMSON (Judges 13-16).

       amson was a miracle child. His birth was the direct result of a

S      divine promise for a divine purpose. The angel of the Lord,
       who delivered the promise to his parents, gave detailed instruc-
tions regarding what his mother should not eat and drink and how she
should raise him.

   Study these instructions in Judges 13:4, 5, 13, 14. Also take
note of Manoah's prayer in verse 8. What do these instructions
and the prayer suggest about the role of the home in the great
controversy?


   Samson's role in the great controversy was to deliver Israel
from the Philistines and to be a judge over God's people. Because
he started out in life with every advantage possible, he should
have been incredibly successful in fulfilling this role. But what
character traits prevented him from realizing his goal in a timely
manner? Judges 14:1-3; 13:5; 15:7, 8; 16:1, 4, 17.


   No question, Satan wanted to destroy Samson, or at least his effec-
tiveness for what God wanted to use him for. The devil knows our
weak points and will press hard upon them. How crucial that we
surrender ourselves every day to the Lord, especially when tempta-
tion comes. God promises that we can have victory: "There hath no
temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is
faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able;
but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may
be able to bear it" (1 Cor. 10:13).

  List other texts in the Bible that promise us divine aid to
overcome the temptations that will, inevitably, come our way.


   How ironic that the strongest man on earth became the weakest
because of his selfish passion. With his eyes, he had gazed upon lovely
women and had fallen to the temptation of these pleasurable sights.
Ultimately his "eyes" became the reason for his capture and a source of
great pain and grief. He whose goal it was to defeat the Philistines was
defeated by them, even as he succeeded in fulfilling that goal.

   Was Samson a winner or a loser in the great controversy?

DAVID IN CRISIS (2 Samuel 11; 12).

        avid had his ups and downs, his triumphs and tragedies. But

D       his greatest crisis was the sin he committed against Bathsheba,
        Uriah, and the Lord. Adultery combined with murder offered
the perfect opportunity for Satan to hail that even a man after God's
own heart (1 Sam. 13:14) cannot keep the law. Satan's jubilation was
a challenge to God's stand in the great controversy. But God de-
clares: "Where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that,
just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through
righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"
(Rom. 5:20, 21, NIV).

  God and Satan seemed locked in a battle over who would win
David's heart. What brought about Satan's defeat? Ps. 51:1, 4, 10.


    In this Psalm, David penetrated to the heart of the issue. His
relationship with God was more than some legal contract. It was
grounded in an understanding that God cared for him personally, that
God cared for what sin did, not just to those he hurt but to David
himself.
    "With David's heart attitude corrected, forgiveness could flow and
the Spirit of God could work again to cleanse David. When he was
cleansed, God would work through David to do good for Zion and for
all his people."—Richards, The Teacher's Commentary, p. 236.
    In Psalm 32:1, 2 (RSV), David used four words to define sin: (1)
transgression—a deliberate, premeditated, willful violation of a divine
norm; (2) sin—an act that misses the mark and deviates from what God
has marked out; (3) iniquity—an act of crookedness and perverse behav-
ior; and (4) deceit—an attempt to cover up and evade obligation.
David's actions described in 2 Samuel 11 and 12 cover all four of these
definitions. Furthermore, he is aware of what his actions have done to
him (Ps. 51:2-4). The effects of sin are so diabolical that there is
nothing the sinner can do to escape from its clutches (Rom. 7:24).
    When we desire a pure heart and steadfast spirit (Ps. 51:10) we
will be enabled to receive God's grace and sing the song of victory:
"Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 15:57).

    Psalm 51:10 reads literally in the Hebrew: "A clean heart
 create for me, God." How does allowing God to create "for" us a
 clean heart enable us to be better able to withstand the foe's
 assaults against us?

ELIJAH (1 Kings 18:20-40).



A
        s this week's memory text implies, the great controversy is a
        battle for allegiance, a battle for our minds. Elijah's confron-
        tation with the prophets of Baal and King Ahab was, perhaps,
one of the most graphic portrayals of this spiritual conflict.
   Elijah's challenge was especially to those people who wavered
between God and Baal; to those who seek in the church a comfortable
pew and a compromising message; to those who find in Christianity
not the power of the gospel to convict and save but a tool that brings
social status and approval. To such comes the prophet's challenge:
" 'How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the
Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him' " (1 Kings
18:21, RSV).

    According to 1 Kings 18:28, the prophets of Baal "cried aloud,
and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets,
till the blood gushed out upon them." What does this example
teach about the notion that "it doesn't matter what you believe, as
long as you are sincere in believing it"? Why is that sentiment
something that Satan, in the great controversy, would be glad to
have people believe?




   The lone prophet was pitted against 450 priests of Baal. But one
person committed to God's truth can defy any evil army. Elijah knew
that. He also knew that he was doing God's bidding. There lies the
strength of the lonely soldier of the Cross in the conflict between
good and evil. The powerful representation of God's power was done
in a way that only God Himself, not any man, could have done.

    Look again at this verse: " 'How long will you go limping with
 two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if
 Baal, then follow him' " (1 Kings 18:21, RSV). Notice the inter-
 esting use of the verb "limping." Why is that such an appropri-
 ate word to use in this situation? Why do people "limp" between
 these two positions? What does that tell us about the nature of
 the great controversy?

                                                                      43

F
       URTHER STUDY: All of the people we studied this week
       knew what it was like to both win and lose in the great contro-
       versy. Based on Wednesday's lesson, it is easy to see how
Moses and David both lost and won. In what ways did Joseph, Samson,
and Elijah both lose and win? Base your answers on the following
texts: Genesis 37:1-19 (Joseph); Hebrews 11:32, 34 (Samson); 1 Kings
19:1-18 (Elijah). How do their mistakes and successes help us to
answer Sabbath's key question?
   "Of everyone He [God] expects loyalty, and to everyone He grants
power according to the need. In his own strength man is strengthless;
but in the might of God he may be strong to overcome evil and to help
others to overcome. Satan can never gain advantage of him who
makes God his defense. 'Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I
righteousness and strength.' Isaiah 45:24."—Prophets and Kings,
p. 175.

    If you would like to read more about the people we studied this
week, see any of the following: Patriarchs and Prophets, "The
Return to Canaan," pp. 204-212; "Joseph in Egypt," pp. 213-223;
"Joseph and His Brothers," pp. 224-240; "Moses," pp. 241-256;
"The Death of Moses," pp. 469-480; "Samson," pp. 560-568; Proph-
ets and Kings, "Elijah the Tishbite," pp. 119-128; "The Voice of
Stern Rebuke," pp. 129-142; "Carmel," pp. 143-154; "From Jezreel
to Horeb," pp. 155-166; " 'What Doest Thou Here?' " pp. 167-176;
" 'In the Spirit and Power of Elias,' " pp. 177-189.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How is Elijah's conflict with Ahab and Jezebel similar to
     the conflict God's people will have in the last days, particu-
     larly regarding Sabbath keeping? Why is Satan so inter-
     ested in attacking the Sabbath?

     2. English poet John Donne once wrote that no man is an
        island. How did the actions of each of the people looked at
        this week impact others, both for good or bad? Is sin
        something that we do in isolation or are others, often inno-
        cent, hurt by what we do or don't do?

      UMMARY: The great controversy is partly fought through

S     human agencies. "Whom will you serve?" is the battle cry we
      must answer, and how we answer determines if we win or lose.
The people we studied this week teach us that we will occasionally
both win and lose. We will lose when we focus on ourselves, but when
we focus on Christ and His salvation, we will win.

     Cambodian Refugee Finds Hope in Jesus
                              J. H. Zachary

      During Pol Pot's regime, Cambodians were taken from cities
  and forced to labor under impossible conditions. Starvation and
  death were common. Hardly a family escaped without losing at
  least one member. Iam Wet lost his parents, sister, brother, and
  more than 30 members of his extended family. Soon he realized
  that his only hope for survival lay in escaping his homeland. He
  joined thousands who risked being shot as they made their way
  toward the safety of the Thai border.
      Iam made it across the border and spent the next 17 years living
  in a refugee camp in Thailand. He married and fathered four
  children while in the camp.
      The camps were full of people desperate to find lost relatives.
  As families fled Cambodia they often became separated in an
  attempt to avoid soldiers. For eight years Wet worked with the Red
  Cross trying to locate lost family members. Every day he met death
  and sorrow face to face, and eventually he lost hope in the future.
      Raised a Buddhist, Iam accepted a friend's invitation to visit a
  Christian church. There for the first time in his life he heard the
  story of Jesus, who volunteered to die for the sins of the world.
   From that one visit Iam began to believe that there is a God, a God
  who cares for humanity.
      As soon as it was safe to return to Phnom Penh, Iam enrolled his
  children in a public school. But he was concerned about the level
  of moral education they were receiving. A neighbor told him that
  the Adventist church had just opened a new school. She described
   the spiritual influence that the school offered. Iam transferred his
  children to this new "God-school."
      lam discovered that the Adventist pastor had been his friend in
   the refugee camp. Iam and his wife went to visit their old friend,
   Hang Dara. Soon the couple began studying the Bible with their
   pastor friend, and in 1999 they were baptized.
      Today Iam rejoices in a new life that his family has found in
   Jesus. "Every day we thank God for the happiness and hope that
   we now have. And we look forward to the day that He will come
   again.

          Faith Amid Turmoil




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 17:1-11; 22:1-18; Ruth
1:16, 17; 4:13-22; Esther 4:13-17; Job 19:25-27; Dan. 6:22.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'I know that my Redeemer lives, and that
     He shall stand at last on the earth' " (Job 19:25, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: One of the issues in the great controversy is
whether God's people can be faithful to Him. What strategies does
Satan use to make us think that faithfulness is an impossibility? What
defenses do we have against his subterfuge?



H
         OW ORDINARY PEOPLE WIN EXTRAORDINARY
         BATTLES. The Bible is filled with stories of men and
         women afflicted by Satan. Job, Abraham, Ruth, Daniel, and
Esther stand among those who won decisive victories in the great
controversy. Facing pain, grief, confusion, temptation, and even the
possibility of death, they stepped out in faith, willing to risk all. They
were able to do so not because of any power of their own but because
of what they permitted God in His grace to do in their lives, both
before and during the crises they faced.
   As you study the lives of these ordinary people who contributed to
the history of salvation in extraordinary ways, remember that "The
Lord can work most effectually through those who are most sensible
of their own insufficiency, and who will rely upon Him as their leader
and source of strength. He will make them strong by uniting their
weakness to His might, and wise by connecting their ignorance with
His wisdom."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 553.

JOB: VICTORY IN TRIAL (Job 19:25-27).

  Job's life is a clear illustration of how Satan targets God's
people in the great controversy. Why did Satan want to test Job,
and why did God allow him to do so? Job 1:6-2:10.


        fter his second test, "Job's grief placed him at the crossroads
        of his faith, shattering many misconceptions about God (such
         as: he makes you rich, always keeps you from trouble and
pain, or protects your loved ones). Job was driven back to the basics of
his faith in God. He had only two choices: (1) he could curse God and
give up, or (2) he could trust God and draw strength from him to
continue."—Life Application Bible, p. 845.
   Affliction can destroy our faith if that faith is not grounded in an
experiential relationship with Christ. At the same time, affliction can
strengthen true faith, which—based on our past experiences with
God—knows that the only way to survive is to put our hand in His.

  State in your own words how the following verses describe
Job's faith.

   Job 13:15

   Job 19:25-27

   Job 23:10


   In the middle of Job's story, the confidence he has in God (Job
19:25-27) is revealed. His acclamation in these verses is even more
astounding when we realize that he was not aware of why he was
being tested and that he thought God had caused all that had hap-
pened to him. Even though he believed this way, he had enough faith
in God to trust that after it was all over He would be on his side. Thus
Job is one of the first people in the Bible to express belief in the
resurrection of the body.

    Satan made accusations against God regarding the faithful-
 ness of Job. Why was it so important, not just for Job but for
 God, that Job remain faithful even amid adversity? What is it
 about the great controversy theme that makes our faithfulness
 to God amid adversity an important part of the conflict? In
 other words, why does it matter to God that we stay faithful to
 Him?

                                                                     47

ABRAHAM: COVENANT FAITH (Gen. 17:1-11; Gen. 22:1-18).



T
       he covenant theme runs throughout Scripture. We see it with
       Noah, Abraham, Moses, the prophets, and in the book of
       Hebrews. Through the covenant, God becomes our heavenly
Parent, and we become His children. It begins with Him and estab-
lishes a community of people who exercise love, faith, and obedience
in Him.

  Read the covenant God made with Abraham in Genesis 17:1-11.
Then answer the following questions.
  What promises did God make?

 How many times does the covenant refer to God's activities?
Whom did the covenant include?

     What did God require of Abraham and the covenant people?

     What changes occurred because of the covenant?

   It takes two sides to make a covenant. What was Abraham's
part of the bargain?
   Were there other things he should do that weren't explicitly
mentioned in the above texts (such as a willingness to sacrifice his
son)?


   The Israelites were to give God not only their bodies but their
hearts, as well. Circumcision was evidence of their faith in His cov-
enant and, as such, it symbolized separation from sin and a heart
purified by one who had surrendered the will to God. Only after
doing so could they have a covenant faith amid turmoil and be
winners in the great controversy. (See also Rom. 2:29; 4:11, 12.)
   Abraham's faith came under the most severe test when God com-
manded him to sacrifice Isaac. Most likely, Satan sowed seeds of
doubt in his mind. How could he do this to his own son? And, if he
sacrificed Isaac, how could the covenant be fulfilled through him?
Furthermore, the heathen nations around him practiced human sacri-
fices. Hadn't God called him away from such an environment and its
practices? (See Lev. 20:1-5.)

  After her father read the story of Abraham and Isaac on
Mount Moriah and explained that Abraham was doing what God
asked, an eight-year-old girl responded, "Daddy, if God asked
you to do that to me, would you?" How would you answer?

RUTH—A GENTILE IN THE MESSIANIC LINE (Ruth 1:16,
17; 4:13-22).

    Ruth is King David's great-grandmother. A Moabite by birth, she
is listed in David's genealogy and through him has a place in the
genealogy of Jesus (Matt. 1:5, 6).

   Matthew wrote his Gospel mainly for Jewish Christians. What rea-
son did he have for listing the name of a Gentile in Christ's genealogy?




G
        od does not limit the plan of salvation to any particular race
        (Rev. 14:6). He is Lord of all, the Sovereign of the universe.
        Only He can destroy the barriers that exist between so many
of us; barriers of race, nationality, ethnic origin, even gender, barri-
ers erected by Satan to prevent the gospel from going forward (Eph.
2:11-18; Gal. 3:27-29).
   Being a Moabite did not stop Ruth from accepting the true God.
Most likely, she learned about Him from Naomi and her family. The
more people see God's transforming power in our lives, the less of an
advantage Satan will have in the great controversy.

   Below is a list of character traits we find in Ruth that are
essential for fighting the good fight of faith. Match each of the
following texts to its corresponding trait (you will want to use some
texts more than once): (a) Ruth 1:15, 16; (b) 1:17, 18; (c) 2:8, 9; (d)
2:1-17; (e) 2:4; (f) 3:1-5; (g) 3:14; (h) 3:15; (i) 3:11-13; (j) 4:1-10.

          worship of the true God                   love

          respect for a wiser,                      faith
          older family member

          respect for womanhood                     generosity

          respect for community                     compassion

          responsibility                            courtesy

    Read Psalm 126:5. Ruth's life illustrates the truthfulness of
 this song. We may shed tears over Satan's unjust dealings, but if
 our faith in God remains strong, our tears, too, shall turn to joy.
 What are some other Bible promises that you can cling to in
 order to draw comfort that whatever our lot in the great contro-
 versy now, we will rejoice as victors in the end?

                                                                      49

DANIEL—GOD MORE THAN LIFE (Daniel 6).

   Considering some of the issues so far discussed in the les-
son, why would Satan want Daniel to pray to another god? Or
did Satan, working through the "governors and satraps," know
that Daniel would not pray to another god and this was all
simply a plan to kill him? Why would it be to Satan's advan-
tage to kill him?


         ne of the most fascinating verses in this chapter, particularly

0        in the context of the great controversy, is verse 5, in which is
        said, basically, If we want to do harm to this man, we have to
do something that pits our laws against the law of his God, because it
is clear from watching him that he will not violate the law of his God.
In other words, they knew that here was something that was not going
to change, and that was Daniel's obedience to God. Therefore, they
needed to weave a plot around their knowledge that this is one thing
that will not change.

   Though King Darius obviously considered himself a "friend"
of Daniel, he unwittingly found himself the key player in
Satan's plot against the aged Hebrew. What was Darius's sin
that allowed Satan to use him like that, and what lesson can
we learn from this about how our sins can be exploited by the
enemy?


   How easy it would have been for Daniel to rationalize actions that
could have spared him this test. After all, he could have closed the
window (Dan. 6:10) or done something to have (at least for 30 days)
protected himself against what was clearly a law aimed at him. Yet,
for whatever reasons, Daniel decided to do just as "was his custom
since early days" (vs. 10, NKJV).

   Look at both sides of the issue here. Could Daniel have
been justified in taking measures—without compromising
his faithfulness to God—that would have protected himself?
Did he have to do things exactly the way he had always
done? Or would any change, in any way, have been a com-
promise, if he did it out of fear? Should prudence have
dictated that he take simple precautions to spare himself
legal problems? Does Daniel's example mean that believers,
in all cases, should not take steps that could alleviate poten-
tial problems with the authorities?

ESTHER: "IF I PERISH, I PERISH" (Esther 4:13-17).



T      he word God does not appear in the book of Esther, yet from
       start to finish, it shows how the Lord can arrange events to
      help those who are faithful to Him. Haman, no doubt inspired
by Satan, planned to kill the Jews. But Mordecai and Esther use to
their advantage the situations in which they find themselves to bring
about the deliverance of their people.
   Two expressions in the book are of special interest as we cooperate
with God in the fight against Satan: (1) " 'Who knows but that you
[Esther] have come to royal position for such a time as this?' " (4:14,
NIV), and (2) " 'If I [Esther] perish, I perish' " (4:14-16). The first
indicates that on some occasions God might give some of us a special
role to play in the great controversy within a specific time frame. The
second stresses that faith in God is no faith at all unless it is willing
to risk all for Him.

   Below are the names of the principal characters in the book of
Esther. Compare and contrast each one's personality. What char-
acter traits motivated each of them, and how do these traits aid or
hinder us in the great controversy?

   Principal Character                       Character Traits
   Ahasuerus (Xerxes; 1:4-8, 10-12)

   Mordecai (2:5-7, 21-23; 3:1, 2; 4)

   Haman (3:1-9; 5; 7:6-8)

   Esther (4:15, 16; 5:1-8; 7:1-6)

   Character, it has been said, is destiny. We see this, clearly, in the
story of Esther. And though, as Christians, we believe that our
ultimate destiny rests only upon the perfect character of Jesus—the
perfect righteousness that He wrought out for us in His life and
credits to all who accept Him by faith—the Bible time and again
shows that personal character traits play a big role in our more
immediate destinies in a way that can't be separated from our ulti-
mate one. No wonder the Bible stresses the need for personal holiness
and character development in the life of believers, even now.

    Write down all the ways Esther could have rationalized a
 decision not to go to the king. Some of them sound pretty
 convincing, do they not? What's been your rationale for some of
 the wrong decisions you have made lately?

                                                                      51

F
       URTHER STUDY: In this week's lesson, we saw how the
       faith of Job, Abraham, Ruth, Daniel, and Esther survived the
       turmoil the great controversy can generate in a person's life.
Prayer plays a significant role in faith maturity. Read Daniel's great
intercessory prayer in Daniel 9:4-19. What does this prayer say about
the great controversy and how we should face the issues that some-
times confront us with all the grace and subtlety of a steam roller?
   Also read the answer to Daniel's prayer in verses 20-27.
   "Through His chosen agencies God will graciously make known
His purposes. Then the grand work of redemption will go forward.
Men will learn of the reconciliation for iniquity and of the everlasting
righteousness which the Messiah has brought in through His sacri-
fice. The cross of Calvary is the great center. This truth acted upon
will make Christ's sacrifice effectual. This is that which Gabriel
revealed to Daniel in answer to fervent prayer. . . . By the humiliation
of the cross He was to bring everlasting deliverance to all who would
walk after Him, giving positive evidence that they are separated from
the world."—The SDA Bible Commentary, Ellen G. White Comments,
vol. 4, pp. 1172, 1173.

   Read also Prophets and Kings, "In the Court of Babylon," pp. 479-
490; "In the Lions' Den," pp. 539-548; "In the Days of Queen
Esther," pp. 598-606; from Patriarchs and Prophets, "The Test of
Faith," pp. 145-155.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Haman exhibited a spirit of hatred against a minority whose
     lifestyle and faith were different. How does such hatred work
     toward Satan's advantage in the great controversy? How do
     we exhibit hatred like this today, and how is it overcome?

     2. Go back and look at the specific situations of each of the
        people studied this week. In what ways could each have
        rationalized acting differently (in other words, less faith-
        fully) than he or she did? What lessons can we learn about
        the potential danger of rationalization when we face situa-
        tions in which our faith demands that we take a firm stand?

      UMMARY: Satan could use neither temptation, pain, grief,

S      confusion, nor the threat of death to convince the people we
       studied about this week that it was impossible to follow God.
Through prayer, by cooperating with Him, and by accepting His strength
and grace they learned that "those who wait on the Lord shall renew
their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall
run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint" (Isa. 40:31, NKJV).

               Alice's Stubborn Heart, Part 1
                               Jeff Bishop

    Alice Sukua of Papua New Guinea awoke thinking about the dream
she had. She had seen a wide road filled with people. Nearby was a
narrow road on which only a few people traveled. What could it mean,
she wondered.
    A few months later Alice had another dream. In it she approached a
village, and a man invited her to enter. As they walked through the
village, she smelled burning meat. As she left the village, the man told
her, "Think about what you have seen here."
    The next morning Alice told her family about the dream, hoping
they could help her understand its meaning. She knew that the meats
she had smelled were unclean, and that Adventists do not eat them.
But she was not an Adventist. In fact, she often fought against the
Adventists in her village.
    A few months later Alice and her family moved to the district capital,
where she would teach school. She met Adventist missionaries Jeff and
Bobbi Bishop. The two families became friends. One day Jeff Bishop
saw Alice sitting alone in her classroom, and he stopped to talk.
    "I was listening to the radio the other day," Alice said. "The
announcer offered a book that sounded interesting. I would like to read
it, but I can't remember the name of it." Jeff was stymied as well, but
he offered to try to help her get the book. He began guessing book
titles.
    "Could it have been The Great Controversy?" he asked, stabbing at
any title that came to mind.
    "That's it!" Alice said excitedly. Jeff agreed to try to get her a copy.
He managed to find a working telephone and relay the request for the
book to the bush pilot who flies across Papua New Guinea and was
planning to come to the nearby airstrip the following week. "And
bring me The Desire of Ages, too," he requested.
    The pilot arrived on Sunday as planned, and Jeff picked up his
supplies, including the books for Alice. She began reading them. Jeff
could see that God was moving on her heart, but Alice continued to
 resist the Adventist message. Then the Bishops were assigned to their
 permanent village two hours upriver by canoe. The families were not
 able to keep in touch with each other except when Jeff returned to the
 district capital for supplies. What will become of Alice and her fledg-
 ling faith? the missionaries wondered.
                                                   (continued next week)

   Jeff Bishop and his family serve with Adventist Frontier Missions in
 Kotale, Papua New Guinea.

          Jesus Models Victory




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 4:1-11; Luke 4:16-
28; John 6:1-15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "When the fullness of time had come, God
     sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, in order to
     redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive
     adoption as children" (Galatians 4:4, 5, NRSV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: In what ways did Satan tempt Christ? How
did Christ resist? How can we apply Christ's responses to our lives?



T
       HE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. In Lesson 1, we discussed
       how, in heaven, Lucifer desired to be first (Isa. 14:13, 14). To
       gain this position, he systematically attempted to discredit
God's law and character.
   After Lucifer was cast out of heaven, he successfully spread his
lies about God throughout the earth. So how was God to prove that
Lucifer was wrong? Because He is a God of love, He could not use
force. One solution was to somehow contrast His character with
Lucifer's. "This work only one Being in all the universe could do.
Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could
make it known. Upon the world's dark night the Sun of Righteous-
ness [Christ] must rise, 'with healing in His wings.' Mal. 2:2."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 22.
   Satan unleashed his most relentless attacks against our Savior. If he
was to win the great controversy, he knew he needed to occupy the
ground upon which the Cross would stand. But Christ's victory
against Satan is ours, and how He won remains a model for us.

"IN THE FULNESS OF THE TIME."

  "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
made of a woman, made under the law" (Gal. 4:4).

  What does the phrase "the fulness of the time" mean in the
context of Christ's first coming? Did Jesus have to come when He
did? Of course, we say that the prophecies (such as Daniel 9:24-
27) pointed to that time, which is true. But the prophecies did so
only because God planned for Him to come then. Why at that
specific time, as opposed to some other one?




N
        of only did the Messiah come at the time indicated in Daniel's
        prophecy, He came at the most favorable time in all history.
        The world was at peace, under one government. Travel by
land and sea was relatively safe and expeditious. There was a
universal language, Greek. The Scriptures had been available in
Greek—the LXX—for about two hundred years. Men were dissat-
isfied with their religious beliefs and were longing for the truth
about life and human destiny. The Jews were dispersed every-
where, and in spite of themselves, bore witness to the true God.
From all parts of the world they came to attend the feasts at
Jerusalem, and could carry with them, as they returned, news of the
Messiah's coming. . . . Providence could have appointed no place
and time more auspicious for launching the gospel message to the
world than Palestine at this period of history."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 965.
   Satan, too, was aware of the significance of time. Under his leader-
ship, "sin had become a science, and vice was consecrated as a part of
religion. . . . It was demonstrated before the universe that, apart from
God, humanity could not be uplifted. A new element of life and power
must be imparted by Him who made the world."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 37.

    In what ways do the conditions of the world today match
 those at the time of Christ's first advent? Suppose Christ's
 first advent had been in our day and age. Try to picture the
 scenario, perhaps, of Baby Jesus being born outside Berlin
 or Manhattan, Seoul, or even Bethlehem. Would His recep-
 tion have been any better? Would a modern-day Herod have
 found it easier to dispose of Him? Hypothetical questions,
 for sure, but they lead to one important point worth remem-
 bering: Whatever the human foibles involved, God's ulti-
 mate plan will be consummated.

                                                                     57
Monday                                             February 11
" 'IF YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD' " (Matt. 4:1-7, NIV).

           e often talk about the great controversy between Christ and

W         Satan as the background motif for what happens in our
          world. Of course, we never see the actual battle between
them itself; we see it, instead, in various secondary manifestations,
such as what happens even in our own hearts.
   In the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, however, we see the
great controversy between Christ and Satan literally, in the purest
form—Christ against Satan, Satan against Christ, no proxies in-
volved. Here, some of the fundamental issues in the great controversy
are played out in about as clear a manner as possible. No symbols, no
hidden codes to interpret, no guess as to who is on which side. What
we are privileged to see is the essence of the great controversy, Christ
against Satan, period.

  Notice what Satan says to Christ in Matthew 4:3: " 'If you are the
son of God' " (NIV). What is Satan trying to do here that reflects
what he tried to do in heaven? What issue is at stake in these words,
and how does it fit in with the whole great controversy theme?


    Another important point regarding the great controversy as it is
manifested here is the subtlety of Satan. Ellen White says that he
appeared as an angel of light; his purpose was, of course, to try and
trick Jesus, just as he tried, and succeeded, to trick Eve in Eden. In
other words, Satan did not attempt to use violence or force against
Christ. He didn't threaten Him with violence, jail, or anything that
could have given him or his purposes away. Instead, he worked
subtly, smoothly, even quoting Scripture in response to Christ's
quoting Scripture, though Satan purposely twisted the Word. He
quoted a divine promise from Psalm 91:11, 12 and challenged Christ
to rely on that promise (Matt. 4:5-7). Notice, however, that he omit-
ted the words "to guard you in all your ways" (NIV). "In order to set
forth the true meaning of the words quoted from Ps. 91 and to prove
that the devil had misapplied them, Jesus quoted another passage
(Deut. 6:16), whose context sets forth the circumstances under which
one may claim the blessing of God (see vs. 17-25)."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 313.

   In what similar ways, in your own life, are you facing the same
type of struggle with Satan that Christ did in the wilderness?
Even if the exact manifestations are different, can you discern
similar principles behind what you are experiencing? What are
they, and what is your only hope not to be snared by them?

WORSHIP ME (Matt. 4:8-10).

   List the characteristics of the third temptation. Matt. 4:8-10.


       s stated in lesson 2, worship is the sole prerogative of God. It
        is the one factor that forever separates the creature from the
        Creator, and as the great controversy draws to a close, the issue
of worship will be brought to the surface in a very dramatic, universal
manner.
   Here Satan takes the Creator of the universe to a mountaintop and
shows Him all the kingdoms of the earth. He no longer baits Jesus
with the phrase " 'If You are the Son of God' " but offers Him
instead a crown without a cross. In essence he is urging, "Why go
through the struggle? Why die a criminal's death on an instrument of
capital punishment? What assurance do You really have that doing
so will benefit anyone? Doesn't the fact that God the Father sent
You here to do this prove what I've been saying all along—that He is
unfair and selfish?" So Satan presses in on the tired, starving, and
lonesome Jesus for the final thrust with the promise of something for
nothing.

  Of course, Jesus didn't worship Satan; to have done so would
have, in effect, done what Satan, even in heaven, wanted all along.
What was Satan looking for in this temptation, and why didn't
Christ give it to him?


   Notice, too, Christ's manner here as opposed to the other tempta-
tions. Christ's final dismissal of Satan is one of contempt. Basically,
He is saying, "I have come to do My Father's bidding. And I will do
so." Absolute resolve to obey God is the ultimate answer to Satan's
lies and tricks. He must know that our obedience to God is not for
sale, not even for all the kingdoms of the world.

    Most of us aren't offered all the kingdoms of the world.
 We're offered, instead, only a slice (30 pieces of silver, per-
 haps), often a paltry one at that. Yet so many people grab that
 slice, even with gusto, though it means (at least symbolically)
 bowing down and worshiping Satan to get it. What can we—
 those who have publicly proclaimed our refusal to accept Satan's
 offer—do to show those who have made the wrong choice just
 how wrong that choice has been? What hope can we offer them
 that it is not too late to turn around and make a decision to
 serve Christ?

                                                                      59

NAZARETH: REJECTION AT HOVE (Luke 4:16-28).

  At the time of Christ, what reputation did Nazareth have?
John 1:45, 46.




A
       despised and wicked city, Nazareth was the unseen battle-
       ground of Satan against the Son of God before He began His
        public ministry at the age of 30. But what Satan could not
accomplish when Jesus lived in Nazareth, he would attempt to do
when He visited His hometown for the first time nearly two years after
leaving. Notice how different Satan's approach was here, as opposed
to what he tried to do to Christ in the wilderness.

   Think how painful it must have been for Jesus, the Son of man, to
have been rejected by those in His own hometown (Luke 4:16-30).
For those who have faced something similar, perhaps rejection by
family or friends because of their faith, in what ways can comfort be
drawn from Christ's experience here? After all, if Jesus Himself
faced it, why should any of His followers expect less?


   As long as Jesus was honoring God's law (vs. 16), declaring His
allegiance to God's Word by reading from it (vss. 16, 17) and
affirming the work and anointing of the Messiah (vss. 18, 19) and
proclaiming the fulfillment of the prophecy He had just read (vs. 21),
the religious leaders were delighted (vs. 22). As soon, however, as He
asserted that God's kingdom would not be limited to just this people
(vs. 27), the religious leaders became enraged, especially when He
implied that not all of those who professed to have the truth would be
saved by it.
   "Satan was determined that blind eyes should not that day be
opened, nor souls bound in slavery be set at liberty. With intense
energy he worked to fasten them in unbelief." —The Desire of Ages,
p. 238.

   Considering the purpose of the Jewish nation, which was to
proclaim the gospel to the world, why should the leaders have
gotten so upset at what Jesus said about the gospel going to
others, as well? What does their reaction tell us about how even
those who have the "truth" can so twist it until their own
concept of the truth makes them, in fact, enemies of the truth?
What other examples of this principle have we seen in either
biblical or secular history? What lessons do these incidents hold
for us as Seventh-day Adventists?

BY FORCE A KING.

  "This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the
world. When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and
take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a
mountain himself alone" (John 6:14, 15).

   t 's not surprising that the Jewish people wanted to make Jesus a

/  king in the hope that He would overthrow the Romans. The
   general climate of the times supported an arrogant, violent national-
ism. The historian Josephus tells of two self-proclaimed prophets
who sought to overthrow Roman tyranny (Antiquities, 20. 5. 1; 8. 6).
Theudas swayed thousands of Jews to follow him to the Jordan River,
where he vowed to divide the waters. The Romans crushed him. The
other was an Egyptian who led a crowd to the Mount of Olives. There
he claimed that at his word the walls of Jerusalem would collapse, and
he would establish a kingdom. Romans quelled this uprising too.

   Against this background, and within the context of the miracle
of feeding the five thousand (John 6:5-13), it is no wonder the
crowd exclaimed, " 'Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into
the world' " (vs. 14, NIV). What did they plan to do next? John
6:15.


   The idea of Christ as an earthly king remained all through His
ministry. Even Pilate asked Jesus, " 'Are You the King of the Jews?' "
(John 18:33, NKJV). Jesus never denied that He was, even if His
kingdom was "not of this world" (John 18:36). He drew a line
between the political and the spiritual kingdoms, the economic and
the moral, the temporal and the eternal, the visible and the not-yet-
visible. The great controversy is a conflict between these two. While
Satan offered Jesus the first, He persistently focused on the Cross—
the basis of the true kingdom.
   "Not by the decisions of courts or councils or legislative assemblies,
not by the patronage of worldly great men, is the kingdom of Christ
established, but by the implanting of Christ's nature in humanity through
the work of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 509.

    What dangers do modern Christians pose, both to themselves
 and others, when they attempt to use the forces of humanity to
 establish the kingdom of God on earth? In what ways can we,
 even as individuals, on a smaller scale be tempted to do the same
 thing?


                                                                      61

F
      URTHER STUDY: In Monday's and Tuesday's lessons we
       studied how Christ met Satan's temptations in the wilderness.
       We can rely on the following promises when Satan tempts us.
Choose one or two to memorize: Ps. 121:2; Luke 1:37; Rom. 8:37;
1 Cor. 10:13; 15:57; 2 Cor. 12:9; Phil. 4:13; Heb. 2:18; 4:16; James
4:7, 8; 2 Pet. 2:9.
   "In our own strength it is impossible for us to deny the clamors of
our fallen nature. Through this channel Satan will bring temptation
upon us. Christ knew that the enemy would come to every human
being, to take advantage of hereditary weakness, and by his false
insinuations to ensnare all whose trust is not in God. And by passing
over the ground which man must travel, our Lord has prepared the
way for us to overcome. It is not His will that we should be placed at a
disadvantage in the conflict with Satan. He would not have us intimi-
dated and discouraged by the assaults of the serpent. 'Be of good
cheer,' He says; 'I have overcome the world.' John 16:33."
—The Desire of Ages, pp. 122, 123.

   To learn more about the topics in this week's lesson, read any or all
of the following: The Desire of Ages, " 'The Fullness of the Time,' "
pp. 31-38; " 'We Have Seen His Star,' " pp. 59-67; "The Temptation,"
pp. 114-123; "The Victory," pp. 124-131.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In Sabbath's lesson, we learned that in order to prove that
     Lucifer was lying about God's character, someone needed
     to show the contrast between God's character and his.
     Based on this week's lesson, how did Christ do so?

     2. God's divine strategy works with precision and order. In
        Sunday's lesson we noted that the first advent of our Lord
        came "in the fullness of the time." Can we say the same
        about the Second Coming? Explain your answer.

     3. Review this week's memory text. In light of the great con-
        troversy, what does it mean that Christ was "born under
        the law"? Why was it necessary for Him to be "born under
        the law" to redeem us?

     UMMARY: Jesus is our model in every aspect of Christian

S     life, not the least in how we may obtain victory over Satan.
      Satan always was ready and willing to attack Him when He was
most vulnerable, but Jesus met his assaults in ways that are available to
each of us. He met Satan head on with God's Word and power, prayer,
personal resolve, angels, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

               Alice's Stubborn Heart, Part 2
                              Jeff Bishop

     Alice Sukua had resisted Adventists who tried to convert her. Then
 shortly after the Adventist missionaries left for their new post, Alice
 became sick and was hospitalized. She lay helpless in bed as nurses
 tried desperately to find a vein and insert an IV. Alice, who had fought
 God's convicting voice, finally gave in. "OK, God," she said. "I will
 keep the Sabbath!" Just then the nurses located a vein and started the
 IV. Alice slipped into unconsciousness.
     When she regained consciousness, she turned to her husband who
 was standing by her bed and said, "I am going to keep the Sabbath."
 As soon as she was able, she sought out two Adventist families in the
 area. The tiny group had ceased meeting regularly when the mission-
 aries moved away, but when they learned that Alice wanted to worship
 with them, they began meeting again.
     Alice took her twin daughters to the services and tried to convince
 her husband to attend too. But he had not set foot in a church for 30
 years, and Saturday was his drinking day. The more Alice tried to get
 him to stop drinking and straighten out his life, the more he resisted.
 Seeing that her plan was not working, Alice stopped nagging and
 began praying for him. She treated her husband with kindness and told
 only God her desires for her husband.
     Several months passed, and one Sabbath Alice and her daughters
 were waiting impatiently for their father to come out of the bathroom
 so they could prepare for church. When he walked out of the bath-
 room, the twin girls stared in amazement. "Daddy, why are you
 dressed in your best clothes to go drinking?" one of them asked.
     "I'm not going drinking; I'm going to church," he answered. The
 girls hugged their father, and the entire family, including two teenage
 boys, went to church together.
     Today some 50 to 70 people gather in Joseph and Alice's home to
 worship God on Sabbath. God used many Adventist organizations and
 individuals to reach the hearts of Alice and Joseph and their family:
 Adventist World Radio broadcast the programs that Alice heard;
  Adventist Frontier Missions sent the Bishops to minister in Papua
 New Guinea; an Adventist colporteur provided the literature for Alice;
 and an Adventist Aviation plane and pilot delivered the books to her.
  But the Holy Spirit sent the dreams that had awakened in Alice
 questions that led to the family's conversion and eventual baptism.

   Jeff Bishop and his family serve with Adventist Frontier Missions in
 Kotale, Papua New Guinea.

     The Great Controversy in
       the Parables of Jesus




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 13:1-9, 18-30; 21:33-
41; 22:1-14; Luke 15.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'Then the righteous will shine forth as the
     sun in the kingdom of their Father' " (Matthew 13:43, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What do Jesus' parables teach us about the
great controversy? What themes run through His stories that en-
lighten us regarding the nature of the war between good and evil and,
most importantly, its outcome?

         E SPOKE MANY THINGS TO THEM IN PARABLES"

H        (Matt. 13:3, NKJV). As stated in an earlier lesson, Christ
         came to this earth so people could see the striking difference
between the two contenders in the great controversy. Another way
people could see this difference was through Christ's parables. With
this method, Christ illustrated the unknown with the known and "sought
to remove that which obscured the truth. The veil that sin has cast over
the face of nature, He came to draw aside, bringing to view the spiritual
glory that all things were created to reflect. His words placed the
teachings of nature as well as of the Bible in a new aspect, and made
them a new revelation."—Christ 's Object Lessons, pp. 18, 19.
   This week we will study the parables of the soils, the tares, the
vineyard, the wedding feast, and the lost coins in order to see what
they reveal about the war between good and evil and how it is fought
in our lives.

THE FOUR SOILS (Matt. 13:1-9, 18-23).

  List at least four things the above texts teach about the great
controversy:

  1.

  4.




M
          atthew 11 and 12 record how the religious leaders rejected
          Christ and plotted to kill Him. In every age, some people
          accept Jesus, while others reject Him. Why? The answer,
simply, is that there's something in the human heart that leads people
to choose either life or death. What, exactly, is it, and why, specifi-
cally, do some accept and some reject Christ? It remains a mystery, at
least to us, at least here and now. (See 1 Cor. 4:5.)
   In every case, however, Satan stands ready to snatch away what is
sown or to prevent the seed of Christ's righteousness from taking root.
Then there is always worry and anxiety to strangle our joy in the
gospel. In every instance, it is his plan to cloud our understanding
and confuse the issues so God's Word will not yield fruit.

   What hope does the parable give us regarding the outcome of
the great controversy? Matt. 13:8, 23.


   This hope is manifested in two ways: (1) Those who hear God's
Word and live accordingly are good not because of anything in
themselves (Rom. 7:18) but because the Holy Spirit lives in their
hearts (Phil. 2:13). Thus their lives are transformed by faith in Christ.
They are assured of victory in the great controversy. (2) Symbolizing
Jesus, the sower casts the seed, regardless of where it might fall. No
matter how much of the seed goes to waste, the sower knows a harvest
is sure. So we should never become discouraged when Satan seems to
be winning all the battles. In the end, Christ has won, and through
faith in Him, we can win, as well.

   In what ways do our own choices determine the quality of our
 own soil? In the end, can we blame Satan if our soil is poor? If
 not, why not?

                                                                      65

WHEAT AND TARES (Matt. 13:24-30).

  Read the text above. Then tell what each of the symbols in the
parable represents. Check your responses against verses 37-41.


     the field                      the good seed



     the tares                      the two sowers



     the harvest                    the harvesters


        he parable teaches us the following about the great contro-

T       versy: (1) Evil owes its origin to the "enemy." Though God is
        not responsible for evil, He is aware of the enemy's presence.
(2) It is the enemy who hinders the spread of the gospel. (3) Good and
bad will exist within the world and the church until the end of time.
(4) While we must be ruthless with the weeds in our own lives, we
should never rush to judge others. (5) Once again, God's people are
assured of victory (vss. 40-43).
   The tare looked so much like wheat that, until it formed a head, not
even the best farmers could identify it. Likewise, "Satan is a deceiver.
When he sinned in heaven, even the loyal angels did not fully discern
his character. This was why God did not at once destroy Satan. Had
He done so, the holy angels would not have perceived the justice and
love of God. A doubt of God's goodness would have been as evil seed
that would yield the bitter fruit of sin and woe. Therefore the author
of evil was spared, fully to develop his character. Through long ages
God has borne the anguish of beholding the work of evil, He has
given the infinite Gift of Calvary, rather than leave any to be de-
ceived by the misrepresentations of the wicked one; for the tares
could not be plucked up without danger of uprooting the precious
grain. And shall we not be as forbearing toward our fellow men as the
Lord of heaven and earth is toward Satan?"—Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 72.

   How do you respond to a church member who—facing church
discipline—claims that our actions against him or her are in
violation of the parable of the wheat and the tares?

THE VINEYARD (Matt. 21:33-41).

   In the chart below, state what each of the main elements in the
parable of the vineyard symbolizes, based on the following list: the
prophets and priests who remained faithful to God and preached
to Israel; God; God's law; Jesus; Israel; Israel's religious lead-
ers; the Gentiles.

          Main Element                    What It Symbolizes

  The landowner

  The vineyard

  The wall

   The tenants

   The landowner's servants

   The son

   The other tenants

        od is full of love and grace. Just as the landowner protects the

G       vineyard with a fence, so God protects us with His law, if and
        when we obey it through the indwelling of His Spirit (Gal.
5:16-26). And just as the landowner provided all that was necessary
for the vineyard to bear a profitable harvest, and just as he expected
his tenants to be faithful, so God provides what we need to bear
spiritual fruit and desires us to be loyal. In this case, however, not
only were those who were given the responsibilities untrue to those
responsibilities, but they even turned vehemently against their master.
What a warning!

   Jesus ends the parable with these powerful, poignant words:
 "And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
 whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder" (Matt.
21:44). What a contrast! In each case a person is confronted by
 that rock, which with great force does something dramatic to
 him or her. In one case, however, the person is broken by the
 rock; in the other, the individual is ground down into powder by
 that same rock. Who or what is the rock, what's the difference
 between being broken on it or crushed under it, and why did
 Jesus end the parable on this note?

                                                                     67

THE WEDDING FEAST AND THE WEDDING GARMENT
(Matt. 22:1-14).

  This parable points out four significant elements in the great
controversy. Find a verse in the Bible to match each element.

     God's invitation to accept His salvation
     God's gracious provisions for salvation
     People's rejection of God's invitation and provisions
     God's final judgment

        od's invitation. As does the parable of the vineyard, this story

G       also illustrates Israel's rejection of the gospel and the exten-
        sion of God's invitation to the Gentiles. However, God ex-
tends this invitation to all people through all time. Christ says to each
one of us, "'Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear
my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you,
and you with me — (Rev. 3:20, NRSV).
   God's provisions. The host of the feast provided everything his
guests could possibly want. He butchered oxen and fattened cattle and
even provided special clothes for them to wear, as was the custom.
Likewise, God provided the sacrifice for sin so we would not have to
die eternally; and Christ's robe of righteousness is ours through faith
in Him (Isa. 61:10; Zech 3:3-5).
   Rejection of God's invitation and provisions. Of course, Satan does
everything he can to keep us from accepting God's salvation. He can
even use everyday items that in themselves are not always bad. In the
parable, one person was too preoccupied with his field while another
was too distracted by his business (Matt. 22:5). In contrast to them,
there was the one who came to the feast but who, because of pride and
self-sufficiency, had decided he did not need to wear the clothes the
host provided.
   God's final judgment. Because of his own wrong choice, the guest
was unfit to remain at the feast. And so it is with each of us. We lose
or win in the great controversy based on the choices we make, both
before and even after making a profession of faith in Christ. In other
words, just because someone makes a choice to come to the wedding
doesn't mean he's going to enjoy the final fruits of it. This should be
a sobering thought to all who claim to have accepted the invitation.
    If someone asked you right now (and you are being asked
 right now), Are you covered with the robe of Christ's righteous-
 ness? what answer would you give, and what grounds do you
 have for answering it as you do?

THE LOST AND FOUND (Luke 15).



A
       s soon as the great controversy entered this world, humanity
       was lost. Such a condition arises when we separate ourselves
       from God, either through innocent wandering, rebellion, care-
lessness, self-righteousness, yielding to Satan's temptation, or reject-
ing God's invitation.

   Three parables in Luke 15 portray this human condition through
three objects that were lost. Identify these objects, the elements
that symbolize God, and what each of those elements teaches us
about His response to lost humanity.

3 Parables of Luke 15      Verses 3-7     Verses 8-10     Verses 11-32

 Lost object(s)                sheep           coin        prodigal son

 Symbol of God
 What God's response
 teaches us about Him

   God's response to sinners stands in direct contrast to what Satan
has said about Him. These parables show us that God's love is so vast
and so amazing that He would empty heaven to save one lost person.
   The parable of the two sons not only portrays God's love through the
sons' father; it also focuses on humanity's response to its lost condition.
The younger son began his journey into the wasteland of sin by exclaim-
ing "Give me!" Self was his goal, self-sufficiency his god. Such a focus
could bring him to only one place—Swineland. But then came the return
journey, prompted by the memory of his father's love. "In his restless
youth the prodigal looked upon his father as stern and severe. How
different his conception of him now! So those who are deceived by Satan
look upon God as hard and exacting. They regard Him as watching to
denounce and condemn, as unwilling to receive the sinner so long as
there is a legal excuse for not helping him. . . . But he whose eyes have
been opened by the love of Christ will behold God as full of compas-
sion."—Christ 's Object Lessons, p. 204.

    Self was also the goal of the older son, self-sufficiency also his
 god. He exclaimed, " ' "You never gave me" ' " (Luke 15:29,
 NIV), and for years he worked for and obeyed his father, think-
 ing that such efforts would win his heart (vss. 28-30). It's called
 legalism. The Bible does not tell us if this son found the true way
 home or not. As the parable stands, which son was the victor?

                                                                        69

      URTHER STUDY: What do the following parables teach us

F     about how we can be victorious in the great controversy? Matt.
      25:1-13; Luke 12:16-21; 18:9-14.
   "The prayer of the publican was heard because it showed dependence
reaching forth to lay hold upon Omnipotence. Self to the publican
appeared nothing but shame. Thus it must be seen by all who seek God.
By faith—faith that renounces all self-trust—the needy suppliant is to
lay hold upon infinite power."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 159.

   Read any or all of the following to learn more about the parables
we studied this week and their relationship to the great controversy:
Christ's Object Lessons," 'The Sower Went Forth to Sow,' " pp. 33-
61; "Tares," pp. 70-75; " 'Lost, and Is Found,' " pp. 198-211; "Two
Worshipers," pp. 150-163; "Gain That Is Loss," pp. 252-259; "The
Lord's Vineyard," pp. 284-306; "Without a Wedding Garment,"
pp. 307-319; " 'To Meet the Bridegroom,' " pp. 405-421.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Based on what we've read and studied, not just this week but
     so far this quarter regarding the great controversy, how do
     you understand Jesus' words, "He that is not with me is
     against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
     abroad"? (Matt. 12:30). Why can no one be neutral in this?

     2. The parable of the weeds shows us how Satan works to
        overthrow God's kingdom. When you think you have iden-
        tified tares among the wheat, what should you do? Or is it
        even your job to attempt to identify tares?

     3. The parable of the prodigal son portrays two different re-
        sponses to God's love. Does our response to God change His
        love for us? If not, what does our response change? (For it
        does change something, even if it's not God's love for us.)

     4. The younger son symbolizes salvation by faith in Christ's
        righteousness. The older one symbolizes salvation by works
        (legalism). Discuss the difference between the two.

      UMMARY: Jesus came to this earth to uncover Satan's lies

S      about God. He did this not only through the way He lived but
       through the parables He taught. From many of these, we learn
how subtle Satan can be and how he uses everyday things to cloud our
vision, affect our attitude, and appeal to our sense of pride and self-
sufficiency. But each parable rings a note of victory. There is a harvest.
People do accept God's invitation. Some of us do find the way home.

AK 'Mk
            Timid Christian Becomes Soul Winner
                              J. H. Zachary

      Sri's Muslim father permitted Sri to enroll at the Adventist
   school, but warned him to never become a Christian. Sri enjoyed
   studying at the Adventist elementary school, and he especially
   enjoyed the Bible classes. He continued his studies in a Christian
   secondary school. After graduation he found work with a bank and
   married a Christian woman. But he had not committed his own life
   to Christ.
      Sri's wife prayed earnestly that her husband would give his life
   to Christ. Then one day Sri told her, "I will be baptized, but you
   must promise not to tell my parents." He knew they would be very
   angry.
      But as Sri's faith grew, so did his desire to share his love for
   Christ with others. He left his bank job and started his own busi-
   ness when Sabbath problems arose.
      Sri agreed to study the Bible with an elderly Buddhist woman in
   a suburb of Jakarta, Indonesia. Every time he went to the woman's
   humble home, he found more of her neighbors ready to listen.
   When the group reached 30 people, Sri asked a pastor for help. He
   did not feel qualified to teach a large group. But the pastor urged
   Sri to continue teaching the group. Sri prayed for the Holy Spirit to
   bring conviction to the members of his class. Today this group has
   grown to a full-fledged church of 100 members.
      Sri found a suburb of Jakarta where no church existed. He
   began studying with interested people, and today a church of 400
   members thrives there. The founding members of this congrega-
   tion were from Sri's Bible-study group.
                                     So far the Holy Spirit has blessed
                                 Sri in raising up five churches. But
                                 he is not stopping to count. He is too
                                 busy sharing his love for Jesus with
                                 others. This former banker and once-
                                 timid Muslim is now a leading soul
                                 winner in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The Great Controversy and
   the Miracles of Jesus



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 8:5-13; 12:22-32; Mark
5:25-34; John 5:1-18; John 11:1-45.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'I am the resurrection and the life. Those
     who believe in me, even though they die, will live, and everyone
     who lives and believes in me will never die' " (John 11:25, NRSV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: What do Jesus' miracles portray about Him?
How did they advance the cause of salvation, and how did they
confront Satan's position in the great controversy?



M
           RACLES WITH MEANING. A miracle is an occurrence
           we cannot understand because of the limitations inherent in
           human knowledge. They are things that happen outside the
known bounds of science and natural law; they can't be explained by
common physical phenomena. That's why, in fact, they're called miracles.
   The Bible records about thirty-five miracles that Jesus performed
while in the flesh. Each one served a specific purpose, and all of them
together advanced His mission of defeating Satan, death, and sin.
These miracles also show how closely the conflict between good and
evil is fought in the lives of individuals.
   This week we will study five miracles that focus on how Jesus
brought healing, life, and truth to those who so desperately needed
them. In addition to illustrating Jesus' power and authority, the
miracles also testify to His mission as the One sent by the Father to
save humankind from the consequences of sin, something far beyond
our capacity—even in the age of the Internet, space shuttles, and limb
transplants—to do for ourselves. Good news, indeed!

BY THE POOL OF BETHESDA (John 5:1-18).

   Explain the significance of the question Jesus asked the invalid
lying by the pool (John 5:6).




T
       his man's biography is brief. Because of a 38-year illness, he
       had lost everything, including hope, family, and friends. He
       was a victim of greed—when the waters of the pool stirred,
others who believed that healing could be found in the waters pushed
him out of their way. He, like all of us, was suffering the conse-
quences of sin, both his own sin and the sins of others, though at that
point in his life and experience, it hardly mattered whose.

   What four results did this miracle produce, and how do they
shed light on the great controversy?

   John 5:14


   John 5:15


   John 5:16, 18


   John 5:17

   In this account, Satan's ongoing war against God's law is seen,
but from a different perspective. Satan would have us believe that it is
harsh, unfair, and impossible to keep; thus he does everything he can
to place it in a bad light, even using the supposed defenders of the law
to do his work. That's what happened here. It was over the law—the
Sabbath (of all things!)—that Jesus faced attacks by those who claimed
that He was violating the law. How ironic that Jesus, the Lawgiver
Himself, would be accused of breaking the law, especially by those
who saw themselves in the role of defending the law. The irony
should not be lost.

    What's so sad about this story is how Satan was able to
 manipulate the leaders, using their own supposed adherence to
 the law to blind them to the deeper issue, which was Jesus. In
 other words, ignoring the miracle that had just happened, they
 attacked the Lord because He, supposedly, violated the law.
 What lessons are here for those of us who see ourselves as
 defenders of the law (and the Sabbath!)?

                                                                     73

THE CENTURION'S SERVANT (Matt. 8:5-13).



D
        iscord among humans was one of the first effects of the great
        controversy on this earth. When Cain killed Abel, Satan
        rejoiced that he had succeeded in this work of disunity. Jesus'
mission, therefore, included not only physical healing but spiritual
healing that would bring people together and facilitate the spreading
of the gospel.
   In this context, the centurion's request was most unusual for two
reasons. First of all, as a career military officer, the centurion was
responsible for 100 Roman soldiers; and the Hebrews despised the
Romans for their oppression over them. Second, the centurion sought
help for his slave. Both Greeks and Romans considered slaves to be
less than human (the Roman author Cato counseled people to throw
out old, sick slaves along with useless agricultural implements).
   Satan revels in such attitudes, for not only do they represent his
character (as opposed to Christ's); they prevent the spread of the
gospel. But the centurion stands in direct contrast to Satan and in
harmony with the gospel's initiative to break down the barriers that
divide humanity.

   What caused Jesus to commend the centurion, and why? Matt.
8:8-10.


    How interesting that a Roman, a Gentile, showed such faith in
Christ. No wonder Jesus replied: "And I say unto you, That many
shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But the children of
the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matt. 8:11).
    This centurion, born in heathenism, educated in the idolatry of
imperial Rome, trained as a soldier, seemingly cut off from spiritual
life by his education and surroundings—and still further shut out by
the bigotry of those who viewed themselves as the exclusive heirs of
salvation—he nevertheless responded in faith to Christ in ways that
those who should have didn't. What a rebuke to those who claimed to
be God's faithful servants.

   A young man, having read some Adventist literature, was so
excited about what he read that he rushed to an Adventist church
at his first opportunity. Sadly, the church he entered was cold and
dead, and in the lobby afterward he even heard some people
talking in a way that cast doubt upon our message. In what ways
does this story here parallel the story of the centurion?

THE DEMONIAC (Matt. 12:22-32).



T
      he New Testament recognizes the reality of demon posses-
      sion, but many people today attribute its symptoms solely to
      physical or psychological deficiencies.

   Describe the reaction of the general public and the Pharisees
to the healing of the demoniac. Matt. 12:22-24. Why did each
group react the way it did? How did Jesus answer the charge
that He cast out the devil under the direction of Beelzebub?
Vss. 24-32.

   Part of Jesus' answer includes a parable in verse 29, which
shows the foolishness of the religious leaders' reaction and sheds a
great deal of light on the great controversy. This parable "rein-
forces the truth stated in v. 28 that the 'kingdom of God' is come
and that the kingdom of Satan is being invaded."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 395.

  Read Matthew 12:29. What was Jesus saying with these words?
How can we apply His warning here in our own lives as we need to
protect our own "homes" from the enemy?


   In this chapter, Jesus places before us a non-negotiable choice.
Choosing Christ results in being gathered into the kingdom; choos-
ing Beelzebub results in being scattered under judgment. We all take
sides in the great controversy; by not taking sides, by claiming to be
neutral, we, automatically, by default, wind up on Satan's side.
That's just the nature of reality.
   Jesus also adds one more element here: the unpardonable sin
(vs. 32). This sin occurs when we persistently reject Christ and delib-
erately choose options contrary to the principles of His kingdom,
when we no longer view sin for what it is, when we mistake darkness
for light, when Satan's lies become to us the truth, and when our
hearts are so hardened they no longer recognize the need for forgive-
ness. Thus, when someone fears that he or she has committed the
unpardonable sin, in what ways does that fear show that this person, in
fact, hasn't committed it?

    Read Matthew 12:30. Those are very strong words. They
 leave no middle ground. Look at your own life. You can't be in
 the middle (it doesn't exist). Ask yourself: Which direction am I
 gathering in?


                                                                    75

THE TOUCH OF FAITH (Mark 5:25-34).



F
       or twelve years, Satan held this woman captive to an incurable
       hemorrhage that weakened her, not only physically but emo-
       tionally and spiritually. Because this condition rendered her
unclean (Lev. 15:25-27), she could not meet with family and friends
for worship and fellowship. Having tried everything, having spent
all, having lost all hope, she heard that Jesus was coming to town.
Might He be able to help her?

  What types of things do you think she heard about Jesus?
(Matt. 8:5-9, 13; Mark 1:29-34, 40-45; 2:1-12.)


  Was Jesus her last resort or her first bright hope? Explain
your answer.


   Before Jesus healed this woman, He had performed at least sixteen
miracles on all sorts of people. Is it possible that some of them told
her about what He had done for them? Spreading the good news
about Jesus is one of the first steps we must take in defeating Satan.
   But hearing about Jesus is not enough. Hearing must lead to faith,
and faith must lead to action. None of the people whom Jesus healed
hoped to live a normal, joyful life until he or she came to Him, and in
this woman's case, not only until she came but until she touched.
   We cannot be victorious in the great controversy until we "touch"
Jesus. The type of faith that saves is not an intellectual approval or
acceptance of truth but a faith that makes Him our personal Savior.
As it was with the woman, so it must be with us. "Genuine faith is
life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by
which the soul becomes a conquering power."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 347.
   Faith must have power to "arrest" God, to "stop" Him on Main
Street. "Who touched Me?" asked Jesus. The question is not one of
rebuke but of recognition that in this battle-scarred world where
Satan claims victory, faith can reach out and touch God.

   However much comfort we can draw from Jesus' miracles of
healing, no doubt one question often remains. As far as the
Gospel records go, Jesus healed everyone who came to Him.
Today, however, we all know that though we pray to Jesus for
healing, it doesn't always come. Does that mean He cares any
less? If not, how do we understand the difference between what
happened in the Gospels and what happens today?

" 'LAZARUS, COME FORTH' " (John 11:1-45).



A
        s their brother grew seriously ill, Mary and Martha turned to
        Jesus for help. No doubt they, too, had heard of Jesus' many
        miracles; perhaps they had even seen some. In addition, verse
3 suggests that Jesus and Lazarus had a special friendship. The word
here translated love means "admiration," "respect," and "esteem."

   If Jesus' relationship with Lazarus was so special, why did He
delay going to his house? Vss. 14, 25.


   "He tarried, that by raising Lazarus from the dead He might give
to His stubborn, unbelieving people another evidence that He was
indeed 'the resurrection, and the life.' He was loath to give up all
hope of the people, the poor, wandering sheep of the house of Is-
rael."—The Desire of Ages, p. 529. Also, had "Christ been in the
sickroom, Lazarus would not have died; for Satan would have had no
power over him. Death could not have aimed his dart at Lazarus in
the presence of the Life-giver. Therefore Christ remained away. He
suffered the enemy to exercise his power, that He might drive him
back, a conquered foe."—Page 528.
   Raising Lazarus was the one miracle above all the others that estab-
lished Christ as the Truth over and against Satan's opposing claims.

   Satan's extremes. Satan attempts to work both ends against the
middle, at least regarding the question of death, a question that, to
some degree, everyone thinks about.
   For many modern, secular minds, death is the end of everything
human: We just stop functioning, our body decays, and we go back to
the emptiness out of which we first arose. There's nothing else for us,
so we might as well enjoy our time here the best we can.
   In contrast, many others believe that there's something inherently
eternal that naturally exists within us and that even if we "die," that is,
our bodies decay, this eternal element goes on living, so that in the end
we really don't die. Thus, whatever we do here, eternal life awaits us.
   If people believe one way or the other, they really don't need Jesus,
do they? On one hand, they die and everything's forever over, whether
they believe in Him or not; on the other, they go on living anyway,
Jesus or no Jesus in their lives. Lies can be multifaceted (coming in all
different forms, shapes, and colors), in contrast to truth, which doesn't
come in so many options.

    How does what Jesus said and did in the story of Lazarus
 help debunk both of these demonic lies about death?

                                                                        77

      URTHER STUDY: This week we studied five of Jesus' miracles
      to see what we could learn about the great controversy. What
       else do the following miracles teach us about the great contro-
versy: (1) Matt. 14:22-33; (2) Mark 1:21-28?
   "The demoniac, in place of prayer, could utter only the words of
Satan; yet the heart's unspoken appeal was heard. No cry from a soul
in need, though it fail of utterance in words, will be unheeded. Those
who will consent to enter into covenant relation with the God of
heaven are not left to the power of Satan or to the infirmity of their
own nature. [Isa. 27:5 quoted.] The spirits of darkness will battle for
the soul once under their dominion, but angels of God will contend
for that soul with prevailing power. The Lord says, . . . 'The prey of
the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that
contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.' Isa. 49:24, 25."
—The Desire of Ages, pp. 258, 259.

  The following provide more material on the miracles we studied this
week: The Desire of Ages, "Bethesda and the Sanhedrin," pp. 201-213;
"At Capernaum," pp. 252-261; "The Centurion," pp. 315-320.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Jesus performed seven of His recorded miracles on the
     Sabbath (Mark 1:21-28; 29-31; 3:1-6; Luke 13:10-17; 14:1-
     4; John 5:1-5; 9). Why would He do so when He knew that
     the religious leaders would accuse Him of being a law-
     breaker? Discuss the role of the Sabbath in the plan of
     redemption (see Hebrews 3; 4).

     2. Discuss the following quote: "The . . . transformation of
        human characters, is a miracle that reveals an ever-living
        Saviour, working to rescue souls. A consistent life in Christ
        is a great miracle."—The Desire of Ages, p. 407. Why is
        transformation of character the greatest miracle of all?

     3. As we near the end of the great controversy, how will Satan
        use miracles to deceive God's people? Matt. 24:24; 1 Thess.
        2:9-12; Rev. 16:14; 19:20.

       UMMARY: Jesus' miracles brought healing to the sick, free-

S      dom to the captives of sin, rebuke to the demons, sight to the
       blind, acceptance to the rejected, life to the dead, and above all,
forgiveness to those who needed it. The miracles also carried the
hope that the God who walked amid humanity would win the great
controversy, that the One who said "I am the resurrection and the
life" would have the last word against sin and death.

                           Maria Salnikova

    Hatuna and Gogi, refugees from the country of Georgia, moved to
the village of Zaoksky, Russia, near the Adventist Theological Semi-
nary. The young father was not well, and the family learned that he had
cancer.
    While buying bread in the market, Hatuna met two Georgian girls
who were studying at the seminary. As they talked the students learned
about the family's desperate needs. Gogi could not work, and the
family had no money.
    The students shared the family's situation with their Sabbath School
class, who began visiting Gogi in the hospital.
    Masha and her husband, Sasha, members of the class, love people
and quickly took this family under their wings. One day Masha
planned to visit the family, but the important errand slipped her mind
during her busy day. All day she knew she must do something impor-
tant, but she could not remember what it was. Then late at night as she
was preparing for bed, she remembered that she had not visited this
family. When she told her husband, he asked, "Do you want to go
now?" Masha quickly gathered some food and wrote a note. If the
family was already asleep, she would put the note and food on the
windowsill, where they could find it the next morning.
    When Masha and Sasha arrived at the house, all the lights were on.
Masha knew something was wrong. When they knocked, Hatuna
opened the door. Her face was wet with tears, and Masha could hear
loud cries. Gogi was in terrible pain.
    Masha and Sasha offered to pray for Gogi. As they ended their
prayer, Gogi's pain subsided. The couple stayed to read the Bible with
them and encourage them. When they left, Gogi's pain was gone.
    Gogi and Hatuna began attending Sabbath School, and in time they
were baptized. Gogi wanted to return to Georgia to die, but the family
had no money to travel. The Sabbath School members, none of whom
had more than bare essentials themselves, pooled their money and
bought them tickets to Georgia. Before they left, Gogi and Hatuna
promised to keep in touch.
    When the couple arrived in Georgia, Gogi was weak, but felt no
 pain. A doctor examined him and could find no cancer. It has been five
 years since Gogi and Hatuna left Zaoksky, and Gogi remains alive and
 well. The family remains faithful to their Lord and shares the miracle
 of his healing with those they meet.

    Maria Salnikova is the dean of women at Zaoksky Theological Seminary
 in Russia.

                     Jesus Wins

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 10:29-34; 14:17-25,
32-42; 1 Cor. 15:1-28; Col. 1:19, 20.

     MEMORY TEXT: "'I [Jesus] have glorified You [God] on the
     earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to
     do" (John 17:4, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What is the main part of God's plan to crush
the revolt Satan began in heaven? How does it shed light on the issues
of the great controversy, and what does it mean for each one of us
personally?

       HE FATHER'S WILL provided the motivating force behind

T       all that Jesus did while He lived on this earth. He was fully
        aware that the Father's will involved not only His death as an
atonement for sin but triumph over all death through His resurrection
(Mark 8:31, 32). With the vision of this atonement and triumph ever
before Him, Jesus anticipated fulfilling the promise in Genesis 3:15
that He would crush the head of Satan.
   The outcome of the cosmic conflict between the forces of good and
evil, between Christ and Satan, would be decided on the cross.
Toward that objective, Jesus walked alone but steadfastly through the
perils of His journey, for at the end there would be a victory for Him
to share with all who claimed Him as their Redeemer.

THE SON OF MAN "MUST".. .

  "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
again" (Mark 8:31).

  "The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again" (Luke 24:7).

  "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up" (John 3:14).

        otice that one word these three verses have in common is the

N       word must. The Son of man "must" be delivered and cruci-
        fied, the Son of man "must" suffer many things.
   Why "must" the Son of man go through all this? Because only
through Christ's perfect life and atoning death could fallen humanity
have any hope of being spared the doom that sin inevitably brings
(Rom. 6:23)—that's why.
   God has a law, that law has been violated, and a just God, to be
just, has to punish those violators. But this same just God is also a
merciful God, and out of that mercy He gave Jesus, equal with
Himself, to die that death for the human race, to suffer vicariously, in
our place, the righteous wrath of a Holy God against sin. That's why
Jesus "must" die. At the Cross, God's justice was met, fully and
completely. Without the Cross, our fate would be no different than
the animals; in fact, it would have been worse, because unlike the
beasts, we can envision something like eternity or heaven, something
greater than what we experience now, and that realization of some-
thing that is greater but out of our reach makes the little we have that
much more unsatisfying. No wonder the Son of man "must" suffer and
die. If He didn't, we'd have nothing but the capacity to envision
eternity but no hope of ever inhabiting it.

    Imagine if you had only two minutes to give someone the
 essence of the Cross. Write down something you could say in
 that period of time that explains the Cross, why Jesus died there,
 what He did for the human race there, what the Cross promises
 us, and what our fate would be without it.




                                                                     81

BROKEN BODY, SHED BLOOD (Mark 14:17-29; 1 Cor. 11:23-
26).

  What instructions did Jesus give for the future at the Last
Supper? 1 Cor. 11:24, 25.


         hese instructions have an important purpose: "As often as you

T        eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's
         death till He comes" (1 Cor. 11:26, NKJV). In other words,
when we celebrate the Lord's Supper, we proclaim our faith in God's
power against Satan—a power based on His redemptive activity through
Jesus' death.
    Jesus established the Lord's Supper within the historic framework
of the Passover (Exodus 12), which recalls Satan's bondage of the
Jews, human helplessness, and God's grace as the only hope for
anyone to be free from that bondage. Just as Israel's freedom was
rooted in history by God's redeeming act, so our freedom from sin is
grounded in the historic event of the Cross. Jesus is our "Passover"
Lamb, "sacrificed for us" (1 Cor. 5:7, NKJV). Because of that sacri-
fice, we share Christ's victory in the great controversy.
    Jesus' claim that His broken body and shed blood establish a new
covenant (Matt. 26:28; 1 Cor. 11:25) confronts the core issue of the
great controversy. Satan charges that God's law is arbitrary, unjust,
and impossible to keep. Through His death, however, Jesus estab-
lished a new covenant by which the law could be written in the hearts
of God's people (Jer. 31:31-34). This new covenant enables us,
through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to love the Lord and obey
the commandments of Him "who gave Himself for our sins, that He
might deliver us from this present evil age" (Gal. 1:4, NKJV).
    It is to this new-covenant experience that Jesus calls us when He
says, " 'He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and
I in him' " (John 6:56, NKJV).
   "As faith contemplates our Lord's great sacrifice, the soul assimi-
lates the spiritual life of Christ. That soul will receive spiritual
strength from every Communion. The service forms a living connec-
tion by which the believer is bound up with Christ, and thus bound up
with the Father. In a special sense it forms a connection between
dependent human beings and God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 661.

  However important the corporate practice of Communion,
why is it so important for us personally to—day by day—
partake of "the blood and body" of Christ? How does that
practice fortify us in the battle against Satan's wiles?

GETHSEMANE.

  "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
what thou wilt" (Mark 14:36, emphasis supplied).

  "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was
able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared"
(Heb. 5:7).

       nce again a lush garden becomes a battleground upon which

0      rages the war between truth and falsehood, righteousness
      and sin. What a contrast, however, between the Garden of
Eden and the Garden of Gethsemane.

   What are some of the parallels and some of the differences
between what happened in Eden and what happened in Gethsemane?
   Read through the story of Jesus in Gethsemane. In what ways
do we see just how human the Son of God was? How do you
understand His prayer for the cup to be taken away from Him, if
possible? Why was it not possible? Or was it?


   In Mark 14:37-50, Jesus, facing the greatest test of His earthly
ministry, found His disciples sleeping, unable to stay awake long
enough to pray for Him. And then, when awake, they didn't provide
much comfort either, for, as Mark wrote, "They all forsook him, and
fled" (vs. 50).
   What do we see here, in this whole scene, other than the utter
depravity and corruption of humanity in contrast to the perfection
and love of God? Judas betrays Him, the disciples fall asleep on Him
only to awake and flee, the mob takes Him by night (including the
religious leaders); in short, this is a dramatic example of what is
basic to Christian theology: the decrepit moral state of sinful, weak,
sleepy, greedy, fleeing humankind.
   All this, of course, in contrast to the holiness and self-sacrificing
love of Jesus.

    In the story of Gethsemane, Satan seems to have triumphed
 (at least temporarily for some) over all the characters repre-
 sented—except, of course, Jesus. In what ways did Satan exploit
 the weakness of all these people, and why did he fail when it
 came to Jesus? What can we learn from this contrast that could
 help us better withstand personal trials?

                                                                     83
Wednesday                                               March 6
"IT IS FINISHED" (Matt. 27:27-53; Mark 15:20-28; Luke 23:26-
46; John 19:16-30; Col. 1:19, 20).

    What did Jesus mean by the following statements, one made in
His high-priestly prayer, the other from the cross? The first is " 'I
have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which
You have given Me to do' " (John 17:4, NKJV). The second, " 'It
is finished!' " (John 19:30, NKJV). What exactly did Jesus finish?




T
       he Cross is central to God's plan for defeating Satan in the
       great controversy because, without it, the universe would not
       have learned the true nature of Satan's rebellion. Three words
help us summarize Christ's work on the cross. These words are rev-
elation, redemption, and resolution.
    Revelation. The Cross reveals God's character. Lucifer argues that
God is an arbitrary ruler. The Cross, however, shows the universe
just how great His love really is (Rom. 5:8). The Cross is His love in
action (see John 3:16).
    The Cross also reveals the unchangeable nature of God's law. If
the law could have been changed, there would have been no sin, and,
consequently, Christ need not have died (Rom. 3:25, 26).
    Redemption. Sin has brought us under Satan's dominion, and he
claims this world as his own. But God "has delivered us from the
power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of
His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood" (Col.
1:13, 14, NKJV). That blood was shed when Jesus bore our "sins in
His own body on the tree" (1 Pet. 2:24, NKJV). Through the Cross,
then, God has reconciled "the world to Himself." "He made Him who
knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness
of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5:19, 21, NKJV). When Jesus said that He
came to " 'give His life a ransom for many' " (Mark 10:45, NKJV),
He was affirming that the Cross would accomplish the redemption of
the human race.
   Resolution. The sin problem must be resolved once and for all in
order for God to be victorious in the great controversy. Calvary
dethroned Satan as prince of this world and will "bring to nought"
(1 Cor. 1:28) "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil"
(Heb. 2:14). At the end of time, he will be "cast into the lake of
fire" (Rev. 20:10).

   Revelation. Redemption. Resolution. Review what they mean
 and then apply them to your own life. How has the knowledge of
 what these words mean, in the context of the Cross, changed
 you? In what ways should they change you?

HE IS RISEN (John 20:1-18; 1 Cor. 15:3-14).

  As you read 1 Corinthians 15:12-28, list in sequence Paul's
explanation of his belief in Christ's resurrection. Then explain
how he connects his belief with God's plan for the defeat of death
and Satan.


      atan and his allies hoped that the Roman seal affixed to Jesus'

S     tomb would put an end to His mission. But the devil's hope was
      only an outrageous wish. What right does the tomb, a place for
sinners, have over One " 'who committed no sin' "? (1 Pet. 2:22,
NKJV). "It was not possible that He should be held" by the grave
(Acts 2:24, NKJV). Satan could no more hold Jesus in the grave than
a cork could hold back an erupting volcano.

   Satan, however, is a determined fighter. He knew that the
Cross made his work null and void. He also knew that the Resur-
rection sealed his fate. Yet, he continued his deception. List below
how Satan began to sow doubts regarding the Resurrection.

   Matt. 28:12,13

   Matt. 28:17

   Luke 24:9-11

   Since Calvary, Satan relentlessly tempts people to question the
reality of the Cross and the Resurrection. Intellect defies these divine
events; reason is too crude, too coarse to grasp these events; and
science cannot prove (or disprove) them. However, as Jesus said to
Thomas: " 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have be-
lieved' " (John 20:29, NKJV).
   Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. Genuine faith reaches
beyond what we can touch and see to comprehend the fact that the
One who said "It is finished" is also the One who is risen.
   "The same power that raised Christ from the dead will raise His
church, and glorify it with Him, above all principalities, above all
powers, above every name that is named, not only in this world, but
also in the world to come."—The Desire of Ages, p. 787.

    Write down what you think Paul means when he says, "So we
 also should walk in newness of life" (Rom. 6:4). Can you hon-
 estly say that since accepting Christ, you have had this "newness
 of life"?

                                                                     85

      URTHER STUDY: Spend time this Friday evening review-

F      ing the closing scenes of Christ's ministry on earth as they
    relate to the great controversy. You might want to use the
following texts and references as a basis for your study: Matthew
26:14-28:15; Mark 14-16:15; Luke 22-24:12; John 13-20:29; The
Desire of Ages, beginning with the chapter "A Servant of Servants"
and ending with the chapter " 'Peace Be Unto You,' " pp. 642-808.

   "Christ did not yield up His life till He had accomplished the work
which He came to do, and with His parting breath He exclaimed, 'It is
finished.' John 19:30. The battle had been won. His right hand and
His holy arm had gotten Him the victory. As a Conqueror He planted
His banner on the eternal heights. Was there not joy among the
angels? All heaven triumphed in the Saviour's victory. Satan was
defeated, and knew that his kingdom was lost."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 758.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Read John 13:1-17. In these verses, the disciples' Master
     became their Humble Servant. Explain how this act sheds
     light on the issues of the great controversy. What signifi-
     cance does our participation in this practice have for us in
     light of the great controversy?

     2. The Cross proved false Satan's claim that God's law is
        dispensable. What part does claiming to honor the day of
        the Resurrection (Sunday observance) play in Satan's at-
        tempts to abolish God's law? (Exod. 20:8-11). What part
        will Satan's attacks against this portion of God's law play
        in the great controversy as the end of time approaches?

     3. Some Christians believe that Christ's death merely served
        as a revelation of God's love and that there was no need for
        Him to shed His blood in order to save us. How would you
        respond to that rather lame understanding of the Cross?
        Why is it so inadequate an explanation of Calvary?

      UMMARY: As the mainstay of Heaven's strategy in the great

S     controversy, the final events of Christ's life on earth ensured
      that Satan's attempts to discredit God's character would them-
selves be discredited. No other event could prove Divine love as
surely as Divine love dying on the Cross. No other event could prove
God's power over sin as the resurrection of Him who knew no sin.
With this same love and power living in our hearts, the victory gained
over sin and death can becomes ours.

                        The Long Search
                            Zhao Mu

     Determination showed on Zhang's face as this humble man
 told of his long search for God, how God led him to Adventists,
 and how eventually he established a church in his home.
     As a university student Zhang studied English with a teacher
 who taught him about Christ. Zhang watched this man and his
 wife as they lived out their faith. Their testimonies made a deep
 impression on Zhang, and he began longing for a deeper knowl-
 edge of God.
     Then the teacher retired and moved away, leaving Zhang feel-
 ing like a sheep without a shepherd. He would not be satisfied
 until knew the deeper truths of God. However, he had no idea
 where to look for spiritual help.
     Unable to find spiritual truth in his own city, he began travel-
 ing to other cities in search of God. His financial situation was not
 good, and he had no money to travel by bus or train, so he rode his
 bicycle long distances, even pedaling over high mountains. Be-
 cause he had no money to stay in local inns, he was forced to sleep
 in the hay along the roadside. Often he was turned away from
 hostels because of his appearance. Still he kept going. Through
 the years he wore out several bicycles traveling in search of
 Christ.
     But God was not hiding from Zhang. Eventually Zhang found
 the Adventist believers in a large city in western China. There he
 learned about the Sabbath and the Lord's soon return. At last
 Zhang's hungry heart was filled. Rejoicing, he returned home
 with the good news. Zhang traveled on business, and wherever he
 went he sought out Adventist believers. Zhang felt a burden to
 share the truths he treasured with others in his home town.
     He began visiting his family members and sharing the truths he
  loved. He met resistance, but he did not give up. Eventually his
 wife and her parents agreed to let him convert a storage room in
 their home to a church. People began coming to worship, some
  from as far away as 25 miles (40 km) or more.
     Today some 30 people worship with Zhang in his home. The
 storeroom-turned-church is too small to accommodate further growth,
  so Zhang plans to expand it so others can attend. He remembers
  how long he had to search to find God's truth, and he is deter-
  mined that others shall find it as well.

                The War Within




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 8:31-39; 16:13-17;
26:14-16, 20-25, 47-50; Rom. 13:12; Eph. 6:10-18.

     MEMORY TEXT: "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood,
     but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of
     the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness
     in the heavenly places" (Ephesians 6:12, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: Ever since the Fall, Satan has sought to
control people's hearts and minds. How does he do so, and what
weapons do we have that enable us to fight back against this most
subtle of foes in what, at times, can be the most subtle of battles?



T
         HE WAR WITHIN. Whatever the grand and cosmic issues
         of the great controversy (after all, it began in heaven), for us
         on earth it's manifested primarily as a battle for the human
mind and heart. Thus, unlike battles fought noisily with guns, tanks,
jets, this one is often slugged out in silence, in the quiet recesses of
the human conscience.
   It's true: The objective victory in the conflict was won, for us, at
the Cross, where Satan stood defeated; and, as a result of that victory,
God at the end of the millennium will eliminate Satan, sin, and death
from the universe once and for all. These are givens, guaranteed by the
Cross. The only question that remains, for each of us individually, is
this: Will we be among those eliminated when sin, death, and Satan
are, as well? Or, will we—taking advantage of the victory won for us
by Jesus at the Cross—be among those who live forever in a kingdom
that will never pass away? As you study this week's lesson, ask
yourself the hard question: In what ways do your daily choices reveal
which side of the battle you're really on?

ONE WHO LEFT.

   "Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of
the number of the twelve" (Luke 22:3).

   All the disciples of Christ had defective characters, rough
edges, selfishness, and other problems that manifested themselves
in various ways. What, however, was the difference with Judas,
that Satan entered him as opposed to the others?


  What do these following texts say that help answer this crucial
question?

  John 12:1-7



  Matt. 26:14, 15




     udas saw the sick, the lame, the blind, flock to Jesus from the

J    towns and cities. He saw the dying laid at His feet. He witnessed
     the Saviour's mighty works in healing the sick, casting out
devils, and raising the dead. He felt in his own person the evidence of
Christ's power. He recognized the teaching of Christ as superior to
all that he had ever heard. He loved the Great Teacher, and desired to
be with Him. He felt a desire to be changed in character and life, and
he hoped to experience this through connecting himself with Jesus.
The Saviour did not repulse Judas. He gave him a place among the
twelve. He trusted him to do the work of an evangelist. He endowed
him with power to heal the sick and to cast out devils. But Judas did
not come to the point of surrendering himself fully to Christ. He did
not give up his worldly ambition or his love of money. While he
accepted the position of a minister of Christ, he did not bring himself
under the divine molding. He felt that he could retain his own
judgment and opinions, and he cultivated a disposition to criticize
and accuse."—The Desire of Ages, p. 716.

    Review the list of Judas's characteristics. In what ways is
 there a little Judas in all of us? What steps can you take to free
 yourself from making the same eternal mistake that Judas did?
 (See Gal. 5:16-25.)

                                                                    89

ONE WHO LEI I BUT THEN RETURNED.

  "Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples" (Matt. 26:35).


  "Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
man. And immediately the cock crew" (vs. 74).


   The Gospels record two of Peter's confessions regarding Jesus.
What are these confessions, and why are they important? What do
they say about Peter's character? Matt. 16:16-20; John 6:68, 69.


        eter is a study in contradiction. He was among the first to

p       receive the truth that Christ was God in human flesh. However,
        immediately after Jesus outlined that the mission of the Mes-
siah involved His death, Peter chided Him that it should not be so.
His concept of the Messiah had room for a crown but not a cross.
Jesus denounced Peter's Messianic vision as satanic in origin (Matt.
16:22, 23).
    Peter's sense of discipleship wavered again after the Last Supper,
when Jesus revealed that He would soon die and the disciples would
be scattered. Peter's impulsive response once again displayed his
self-confidence. Whatever others might do, he would never deny his
Lord. But his Lord knew better (Matt. 26:33-35).
    The impetuous Peter could not even stay awake to pray with Jesus
in Gethsemane (vs. 40). Soon afterward, however, he could draw the
sword against His enemies (vs. 51). Yet going from rash daring to
cowardly denial did not take long. The crowing of the rooster brought
Peter to his senses, and the sight of his Savior reminded him of His
warning and promise: " 'Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for
you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that
your faith should not fail' " (Luke 22:31, 32, NKJV). Remorse and
repentance brought Peter back from Satan's clutches into the circle of
discipleship. Thus, he was awarded the privilege of being among the
first to see the risen Lord (Acts 2:32) and to receive His commission
(John 21:15-17).

    Most of us, at some point, have had a "Peter experience," in
 that we profess to do something for the Lord and then fail to do
 what we said. What lessons can we learn from Peter that should
 help us not to give up in despair when Satan causes us to fail our
 Lord as he did Peter?

AGAINST THE RULERS OF DARKNESS (Eph. 6:10-12).

  How does Paul explain the war between good and evil to the
Ephesians? Eph. 6:10-12.


    n Ephesians 1:18-21 Paul prays that the Ephesians would experi-

/   ence God's power as He displayed it in Christ's resurrection. In
    chapter 2:1-7, he explains how he hopes they will experience this
power. Just as God was able to raise Christ from the dead, so He is
able to raise them from death in sin to newness of life in Christ. Now
in chapter 6:10-12, Paul closes his letter by reminding them that for
the rest of their Christian lives they must rely on this resurrection
power to help them fight "the powers of this dark world" and "the
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (vs. 12, NIV).
   Some of "the powers of this dark world" maintain that God is
dead, that there is no such thing as sin, only failure. Others believe
that socially accepted principles are superior to God's standards,
while still others claim that death is a door to another life and that
grace is not a godly characteristic that redeems us but a human
potential enabling us to save ourselves.

   What role does each of these false assertions play in the great
controversy? How can Satan use them to deceive us to the nature
of our needs and our only remedy for those needs?


   Paul leaves no room for doubt regarding the devil's capabilities.
He will do anything he can to influence political, judicial, economic,
psychological, scientific, and supernatural principalities and powers
to entice people away from God. Satan's ploys worked well in Paul's
day, and they work well in the modern world, where the whole notion
of a literal devil is often mocked and scorned as nothing but supersti-
tions left over from an earlier age of intellectual and scientific dark-
ness. It is hard enough fighting against a power stronger than you of
whom you are aware. Who is going to fight against an enemy that one
doesn't even think exists?

    All around us exist forces that we can't see, hear, feel, or
 sense in any way: electromagnetism, gravity, radio waves, sub-
 atomic particles from space. All these are real yet outside our
 immediate sensory perceptions. How could knowledge of these
 imperceptible realities help us convince others of the reality of
 Satan and the forces of darkness?


                                                                     91
Wednesday                                                March 13
THE WEAPONS OF WARFARE (Eph. 6:13-18; Rom. 13:12;
1 Thess. 5:8; Heb. 4:12; Rev. 12:11).

   Yesterday's lesson dealt with "the powers of this dark world" and
"the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" that are engaged
in the great controversy. God, however, does not leave us unprotected
against these forces.

   In addition to the resurrection power mentioned in yesterday's
lesson, list other weapons available to Christians as they become
engaged in the great controversy.


     Which of these weapons is the most important, and why?

     Rom. 13:12

     Eph. 6:13-18

     1 Thess. 5:8

     Heb. 4:12

     Rev. 12:11

   Considering some of Satan's accusations concerning God's char-
acter, why is love an important weapon in the great controversy?




A
          nother weapon we are to use is the armor of light. In John
          8:12, Jesus declares, " 'I am the light of the world. Whoever
          follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light
of life' " (NIV). Just as darkness cannot exist where there is light, so
sin cannot exist where there is Christ. When we follow Him, He lights
the path before us, and before this light, evil flees, as creatures of the
night dart for cover when the sun rises.

    Write down all the "weapons" we have at our disposal in the
 great controversy. Review what each one means and ask your-
 self how, in whatever personal struggles you are facing, you can
 employ them to aid you as you face the personal assaults of the
 enemy.

IF GOD BE FOR US (Rom. 8:31-39).



R
       ead over the following verses again and again until you can see
       clearly the hope and the promises that shout out from them—
       all because of what God has done for us in Jesus. Wherever
Paul uses the word we or us, put your own name in there and then
reread the verses, applying them to yourself and whatever your cir-
cumstances are right now. Reach out in faith and grasp the promises:
Make them your own for, in the end, what else do you (or any of us)
have in this sinful, dying world?

  Answer these questions by reading Romans 8:31-39:

   What guarantee do we have that God will give us victory?


   If we are following Christ, why is it impossible for anyone,
including Satan, to condemn us?


   What does it mean that "in all these things [vs. 37] we are more
than conquerors"?


   What does it mean that Christ is making intercession for us?
(vs. 34). How should that reality impact how we live? Why do we
need an intercessor?


   "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord" (vss. 38, 39). What do these words mean, par-
ticularly in the context of the great controversy? What assur-
ance can we draw from them? At the same time, what don't they
mean? What false conclusions can someone draw from them
regarding salvation?


    In the midst of these wonderful promises, Paul inserts these
 words: "For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are
 accounted as sheep for the slaughter" (vs. 36). What is he talking
 about here? How does this fit in with the rest of the verses?
 Hint: See verse 37.

                                                                    93

F
       URTHER STUDY: Review Ephesians 6:14-17 by listing on a
       separate sheet of paper (1) each part of armor, (2) what that
       part symbolizes, and (3) its application. For example: (1) The first part
of armor is the belt; (2) it symbolizes truth; (3) Satan has told lies about God's
character, but we can combat these lies with the truth.
   "We must put on every piece of the armor, and then stand firm. The Lord
has honored us by choosing us as His soldiers. Let us fight bravely for Him,
maintaining the right in every transaction. Rectitude [goodness, virtue] in all
things is essential to the welfare of the soul. As you strive for the victory over
your own inclinations, He will help you by His Holy Spirit to be circumspect
in every action, that you may give no occasion for the enemy to speak evil of
the truth. Put on as your breastplate that divinely protected righteousness
which it is the privilege of all to wear. This will protect your spiritual life."
—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1119.

    To learn more about the topics in this week's lesson, read any or
all of the following: The Desire of Ages, "The Foreshadowing of the
Cross," pp. 410-418; " 'The Light of Life,' " pp. 463-475; " 'Let Not
Your Heart Be Troubled,' " pp. 662-684; "Before Annas and the Court
of Caiaphas," pp. 698-715; "Judas," pp. 716-722; "By the Sea Once
More," pp. 809-817.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Luke writes, "Then Satan entered into Judas" (Luke 22:3,
     RSV). How does Satan enter into an individual? Can He
     enter without the individual's consent? Explain. How is
     Satan's entry into a person different from Jesus' entry into
     the human heart?

     2. Again and again we see that self-centeredness makes it
        impossible for God's grace to do its work. Why is this so?
        In its call for self-abandonment, does Christianity reject
        the concept of self-esteem? Explain your answer.

     3. Why do false philosophies as human institutions, based on
        worldly errors, make ideal weapons for Satan? How does he
        use these philosophies to his advantage?

      UMMARY: Satan seeks to gain control of our hearts and

S     minds by appealing to our sense of self-sufficiency. To be
      victorious, we must accept the salvation Jesus offers through
His shed blood. Then, through the indwelling power of the Holy
Spirit, we will have at our disposal a complete set of armor with
which to combat the enemy.

                        Danger at Sundown
                               David Gates

    With my car loaded with expensive computer equipment, I was
heading back to the church headquarters in Lima, Peru. It was sunset,
and except for traffic in the road, the streets were nearly empty.
Ruffians controlled the streets from dusk to dawn.
    As I rounded a corner beside an abandoned bus, the engine began to
run rough, and the temperature light came on. Then the engine died. I
pulled the loaded station wagon onto the gravel shoulder.
    Forcing back the fear that was building in my stomach, I took off
my suit coat and tie and got out to examine the problem. The radiator
was empty. I managed to borrow a bucket of water, but it ran out as
quickly as I poured it in. Fear rose another notch. I was a well-dressed
foreigner with a disabled car filled with expensive computer equip-
ment in a dangerous area of the city.
    Two men stepped out of the abandoned bus. They picked up a large
rock, then started toward me. No one else was nearby. Staying meant
risking a beating and possibly death. Leaving would place God's
equipment at risk. I prayed that God would protect both the equipment
and me. The men raised their rocks as if to throw them. I stepped back.
    "Excuse me," a nicely dressed man spoke quietly to me. "Your life
is in danger. Get in the car and leave—now."
    I tried to explain that the car wasn't going anywhere, but the man
insisted, "Get in. I will push." Again I tried to explain the situation, but
the man ordered, "Get in, now!" I obeyed, though I was certain that the
effort was futile. I turned on the ignition and shifted into gear. There is
no way he can push this heavy car uphill on gravel, I thought.
    I could see the two men, still holding the rocks above their heads, as
they had been when the stranger had approached.
    The car started to move. As it gathered speed, I let out the clutch and
was surprised to hear the engine come to life. The stranger ran to my
window and insisted that I not stop until I was out of this dangerous
area. I tried to force a few dollars into his reluctant hand, but he said, "I
have no need for money."
    I drove a few blocks before the temperature light again came on, and
the engine sputtered and died. As I coasted into a gas station, I realized
that God had answered my prayer by sending an angel to protect both
me and the Lord's equipment.
    We live in a world filled with spiritual and physical dangers. God is
able and willing to care for us if we place ourselves in His hands.

The Great Controversy and
       the Church



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 18:19, 20; Acts 4:1-3;
12:5; 15; 20:29-31; Rom. 1:16, 17; 2 Tim. 2:15.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'Go therefore and make disciples of all the
     nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the
     Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things
     that I have commanded you' " (Matthew 28:19, 20, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: What role does the church play in the great
controversy? How does Satan attempt to thwart that role, and what
weapons must the church use in her own defense?



T
        HE CHURCH IN AN ALIEN WORLD. Though the Cross
        sealed Satan's doom, the great controversy will not be over
        until the church takes the good news of salvation to the entire
world and Christ returns. " 'And this gospel of the kingdom will be
preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the
end will come' " (Matt. 24:14, NIV). From the inception of the church,
however, the forces of evil, under numerous guises, both within and
without the church, have plagued the church's attempts to spread the joy
of salvation. Persecution, false doctrines, and internal divisions are some
of what the enemy uses to thwart the church in its mission. But Christ
does not leave His church without help. Through the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit and the preservation of the Word, its faithful members
continue to carry the banner of truth to a perishing world.
   This week's lesson provides an outline of the church's role in this
battle through the ages. As you study, ask yourself what role you now
play and what role you desire to play, as a member of the church
destined to fulfill God's divine commission.

*(Study this week's lesson to prepare for Sabbath, March 23.)

COMMISSION AND POWER.

   "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
Amen" (Matt. 28:19, 20; see also Acts 1:8; 2:1-4).

        hrist's commission to His church is perpetual. Its charge

C       includes every generation. Its duty motivates everyone who
        has taken the name of Jesus. The purpose of delivering the
good news to all nations is the salvation of souls and the creation of a
community in which individuals can strengthen one another and
continue to canvas the world with the gospel.
   That purpose, however, is contrary to Satan's goal. He despises
God's people and the unity that exists among them. His intention has
always been to scatter the sheep and keep them far away from their
Shepherd. He seeks to accomplish this through various means, such
as using divisive cultural differences to divide the church; by intro-
ducing doctrines that have no biblical basis in order to confuse the
church; by promoting views that are soothing but not demanding in
order to anesthetize the church; and by giving it emotional cushions
that eliminate personal crosses in order to weaken the church. We
cannot fight this enemy alone. Thus, we have only two choices:
Christ or failure.

  How does Christ empower His disciples to complete the gospel
commission? Matt. 28:20; Acts 1:8; 2:1-4.


   In Acts 1:8, the Greek word translated "power" is dunamis. The
word dynamite originates from this Greek word.
   Other religions have had great leaders and lofty agendas. But none
has had so daring an objective as Christianity, and no disciples have
been given such powerful promises as Christ's disciples were given.
Jesus is our eternal contemporary, the Holy Spirit our eternal empower-
ment. Together, they enable us to spread the gospel despite Satan's best
efforts.

    No one is neutral in the great controversy; even if you're a
 member of the church, you are either aiding in the church's
 work or diminishing it. Take a good hard look at yourself, your
 attitudes, your words, your actions, and ask, Am I helping or

EARLY STRUGGLES.

   Read the passages listed below and after each one write down
one word that describes the struggles Satan inflicted on Christ's
infant church as its members began to fulfill the divine commis-
sion.

     Acts 4:1-3


     Acts 5:1-11


     Acts 7:54-60


     Acts 8:3, 4


       atan's anger against God's people as predicted in Revelation 12

S      was already taking shape in several forms. Dismayed by the
       phenomenal growth of the church in Jerusalem and surround-
ing areas, he used everything in his power to halt its progress. If he
could stop it early, how easy the rest of his work would be!
   One of his first attempts backfired. Stephen's martyrdom, far from
destroying the church, proved to be a watershed in its early history.
Stephen's sermon (Acts 7) clearly showed the transition from the old
to the new, from Jesus whom they crucified to the Christ who fulfilled
the Messianic prophecies, from the temple on earth to the temple in
heaven where the risen Jesus is seated next to the Father. Both
Stephen's sermon and his death opened wide the doors of opportunity
for the early church. "The martyrdom of Stephen made a deep im-
pression upon all who witnessed it. The memory of the signet [mark]
of God upon his face; his words, which touched the very souls of
those who heard them, remained in the minds of the beholders, and
testified to the truth of that which he had proclaimed. His death was a
sore trial to the church, but it resulted in the conviction of Saul, who
could not efface [erase] from his memory the faith and constancy of
the martyr, and the glory that had rested on his countenance."—The
Acts of the Apostles, p. 101.

   Satan is just as determined today to keep us from spreading
the gospel now as then. What tactics is he attempting to use
against us that he used against the infant church? What other
tactics is he using, as well?

EARLY VICTORIES (Acts 2:36-38).



Y
        esterday we studied some of the struggles the infant church
        faced because of Satan's attempts to discourage its members
        from fulfilling their divine commission. But because of Jesus'
promise to be with them always through the Holy Spirit, the story of
Acts is really a story about victories.

   Some of these victories include the fact that the early church
was faithful to Christian truths and principles despite Satan's
attacks. The verses below show how this is so. Read each text and
then decide to which truth or principle the church was being loyal.
The first two are done for you.



        Text                         Principle/Truth

   Acts 1:14; 2:46        Unity is vital to Christian life and fulfill-
                          ing our commission.

   Acts 2:36              Christ is both divine and human.

   Acts 2:4; 4:8

   Acts 4:32-37

   Acts 5:29

   Acts 6:1-4; 15

   Acts 10

   Acts 12:5


    Today it is popular among some Christians to claim that
 doctrines are not so important. The important things, they say,
 are to love Jesus and believe in Him. And though certainly those
 factors are important, why is doctrine indeed important for the
 church? How could we fulfill the commission to spread the
 gospel if we aren't even preaching the same gospel? And though
 some differences will, of course, exist among members, on what
 teaching must there be harmony?


                                                                     99

CORRUPTING THE TRUTH (Acts 20:29-31).

        esterday's lesson dealt with the victory the early church had

y      in adhering to basic Christian truths and principles, despite
       Satan's attacks. But as time passed, this would not always be
the case.

  Based on each of the passages below, how has, and how will,
Satan try to corrupt the church with false teachings?

   Acts 20:29-31

   2 Pet. 2:1

   1 John 2:18, 19

   Between the close of the Apostolic Age and the beginning of the
Reformation (1517), some of the most basic Christian truths and
principles yielded to falsehoods, grounded in Roman and Greek phi-
losophy, and the desire for power and self-exaltation on the part of
various church centers in the Roman Empire. Some of these false-
hoods included: (1) the immortality of the soul (Job 14:2; 1 Tim.
1:17; James 4:14); (2) infant baptism (Acts 8:12, 13, 29-38; 9:17, 18;
1 Cor. 1:14); (3) mediation through saints (Heb. 8:1-6; 9:11-15); (4)
Sunday observance (Exod. 20:8-11); (5) righteousness by works (Hab.
2:4; Rom. 2:17); (6) church traditions viewed to be more important
than biblical truths (Matt. 15:1-3, 6; Mark 7:8).
   The nominal conversion of Constantine in the early part of the
fourth century caused Christianity to lose even more of its purity.
This event caused great rejoicing, but the world, cloaked with a form
of righteousness, walked into the church. Now the work of corrup-
tion rapidly progressed. Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished,
became the conqueror; its doctrines, ceremonies, and superstitions
become incorporated into the faith and worship of the professed
followers of Christ.

   Heresies and error don't arise overnight. Satan is patient.
He introduces error slowly, through one "small" compromise,
which leads to another "small" compromise to another and
another and so forth. All these errors begin inside the human
heart. People have to accept them in order for them to eventu-
ally make their way into the church as a whole. How can we, as
individuals, protect ourselves (and thus the church) from this
deadly trap?

BACK TO THE BIBLE (Rom. 1:16, 17; 2 Tim. 2:15).



D
        uring the Middle (or Dark) Ages, Bible study was confined to
        monks in monasteries. In fact, it was unlawful for ordinary
        church members even to have Bibles. However, with the help
of Englishman John Wycliffe, who translated the Bible into the
language of his people, the stage was set for a powerful reformation.
"In giving the Bible to his countrymen, he had done more to break
the fetters of ignorance and vice, more to liberate and elevate his
country, than was ever achieved by the most brilliant victories on
fields of battle."—The Great Controversy, p. 88.
   In Germany, Martin Luther struck a deadly blow to apostasy by
proclaiming two great biblical truths, long neglected by the Roman
church: (1) the Bible and the Bible only, and (2) the just shall live by
faith.

   Why are these two truths so important? What role do they play
in the great controversy?


   Until Luther made known his thoughts regarding righteousness by
faith based on his studies primarily in Romans and Galatians, the
church in Rome taught that a person could earn salvation through
various works. Risking his life, as did the apostles before him, Luther
condemned the purchase of indulgences and false teachings; he urged
people to taste the joy of salvation by exercising faith in Jesus'
righteousness and that alone. Reformers such as Calvin, Zwingli,
Melanchthon, and Wesley joined in the restoration of other biblical
truths so that the emerging Protestant church repudiated such false-
hoods as purgatory, indulgences, transubstantiation (the belief that
when taken by the believer, the Communion bread and wine actually
become Christ's body and blood), and prayers for the dead.
   The Reformation, however, did not restore such truths as the
Sabbath (Exod. 20:8-11), the state of the dead (Ps. 115:7; Eccles. 9:5,
6, 10) and Jesus' high-priestly ministry (Heb. 8:1-6; 9:11-15). The
reestablishment of these truths would be the work of another group
who would grow out of the Millerite movement (1839-1844) to be-
come the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

    How do you understand the role of the Seventh-day Adventist
 Church in the great controversy? Why did the Lord raise up
 this church? What specific truths are we teaching that no one
 else is, and how do these truths fit in with God's plan to end the
 great controversy, with His own character vindicated before the
 entire universe?

                                                                    101

      URTHER STUDY: Revelation 12:17 gives us a description of

F      God's people in the last days. Revelation 14:6-12 is the mes-
       sage they are to proclaim. How is this message part of the
commission Jesus gave His disciples in Matthew 28:19, 20?
   "To prepare a people to stand in the day of God, a great work of
reform was to be accomplished. God saw that many of His professed
people were not building for eternity, and in His mercy He was about
to send a message of warning to arouse them from their stupor and
lead them to make ready for the coming of the Lord.
   "This warning is brought to view in Revelation 14. Here is a
threefold message represented as proclaimed by heavenly beings and
immediately followed by the coming of the Son of man to reap 'the
harvest of the earth.' The first of these warnings announces the
approaching judgment. . . . This message is declared to be a part of
`the everlasting gospel.' The work of preaching the gospel has not
been committed to angels, but has been entrusted to men. Holy angels
have been employed in directing this work . . . but the actual procla-
mation of the gospel is performed by the servants of Christ upon the
earth."—The Great Controversy, pp. 311, 312. (We will study more
about these messages as they relate to the last great battle of the great
controversy in next week's lesson.)

   For more information on this week's topics, read any or all of the
following: The Acts of the Apostles, chapters 3, 4, 9, 10, 16-18.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. One of the victories of the apostolic church was breaking
     down the walls of prejudice (Acts 10; 11; 15). Yet Paul
     suggests that commitment to one family under God is always
     under attack from Satan (Gal. 2:11-13). How does Satan use
     prejudice today to prevent the church from doing its work?
     What prejudices might you be harboring that exclude you
     from full participation in spreading the gospel?

   2. "I have met Jesus, and I cannot keep quiet," said Sadhu
      Sunder Singh, an Indian convert from Sikhism. He took the
      gospel to Tibet, where he was martyred. Why is a personal
      relationship with Christ (as opposed to simply knowledge
      about Him) so important for witnessing to others?

     UMMARY: The church is to spread the gospel to the entire

S     world. Satan, however, prevents it from doing so through per-
      secution, infighting, prejudices, false doctrines, and lack of Bible
study. As we seek to fulfill the gospel commission, we must always
focus on Christ and invite His Holy Spirit to transform our lives.

                   The Little Missionaries
                       Daryl Famisaran

    Around the mission schools established by students from Moun-
tain View College, the children are the most active members. The
children are always on time for evening and morning worships
with their teachers. Their voices ring through the forests as they
heartily sing songs of heaven. Whenever they hear new truths
from their teachers, they can't wait to tell their parents or any-
body in the village whom they think may not have heard it yet.
    Arnold Lucero, who teaches at theTaucucon Mission School,
shared the story of Jerlie, the daughter of the village chief. Jerlie
was the first in her village to receive Jesus as her Savior, and
during a mission jamboree at Mountain View College in 1999,
she asked to be baptized. The student missionaries were surprised
by her decision. "The chief might be unhappy with us if you are
baptized," they told Jerlie.
    "Don't you worry about my father, sir," she told the student
missionaries. "I'm sure he will be happy." At her inistance, she
was baptized.
    When the teachers and students returned to the village, the
student missionaries went directly to the chief's home to tell him
about Jerlie's baptism. Just as she had predicted, her father re-
sponded, "I am happy for my daughter to follow the religion of
our teachers. I know that you are sent by the most powerful God
to teach our children."
    Somewhat surprised by the chief's response, the student mis-
sionaries asked, "What made you say that, chief?"
    "When you first came, my people and I had some reservations,"
the chief answered. "We thought that you would try to force
religion into the minds of our children. So we watched everything
 you did. Then one night I could not sleep. I got up and walked to
 your cottage. It was bright with light. I peeked into your room
 through a crack in the wall. You two were sound asleep, but I saw
 two figures floating in the air above your heads. The light seemed
 to come from the two beings in white robes. The two beings
 appeared to me to be angels, which my daughter had told me about
 when she repeated her Bible stories. I concluded that God had sent
 you to be our teachers. So you understand that I am happy to have
 my daughter follow your teachings."

    Daryl Famisaran is director of the the student missionary program
 at Mountain View College in southern Philippines.

         The End of the Great
             Controversy



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 12:17-14:20; 19:11-
21; 21:1-4; 22-26; 22:1-5.

   MEMORY TEXT: " 'Great and marvelous are Your works,
   Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, 0 King of
   the saints! Who shall not fear You, 0 Lord, and glorify Your
   name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and
   worship before You, for Your judgments have been manifested' "
   (Revelation 15:3, 4, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: How will the great controversy end? What
issues will climax at the end? How will God's people be involved,
and what will be the most important aspect in this—the conclusion of
the greatest battle the universe has ever known?



F
       ULL CIRCLE. The first book of the Bible tells us how the
        great controversy began on earth; the last book of the Bible
        describes how it will end. The pages in between have taught us
how the great controversy started in heaven, what the issues were
(and are), what Satan's ploys are, how God remedied the catastrophe
caused by Satan and the Fall, how we can maintain faith under
Satan's attacks, and how we as individuals and the church are in-
volved in this great controversy.
    As we've said all along, because of Christ and the Cross, victory is
assured. At the Cross, Jesus defeated the devil, exposed him to the universe as
the liar he is, and guaranteed all who come to Him, Jesus, in penitence and
faith, a place in the new earth. This week we will see final results of that
victory, which leads to the demise of sin, Satan, and death.

SATAN'S LAST ATTACK (Rev. 13:1-17).



T
      his verse tells us that Satan is planning one last battle before
      the end of the great controversy. Chapters 13 and 14 outline
     how this conflict will occur.

  What two earthly powers will Satan use in the last days to
wage war against God's people? Rev. 13:1-17.


   The first beast characterizes the church-state union that domi-
nated the Christian world for many centuries and was described by
Paul as the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:2-4) and by Daniel as the "little
horn" (Dan. 7:8, 20-25; 8:9-12). The image of the beast (Rev. 13:14)
represents that form of apostate religion that will be developed when
churches, having lost the true spirit of the Reformation, shall unite
with the state to enforce their teachings on others. In uniting church
and state they will have become a perfect image to the beast.

   How does Satan use the system established by these two powers
to help him fight the last battle of the great controversy? What
tactics will these powers employ?


                                     How the Two Powers
           Verse
                                     Will Be Used by Satan

   Rev. 13:12

   Rev. 13:13, 14

   Rev. 13:15

   Rev. 13:15-17

   In his final attempts to destroy God and His church, Satan will
inspire the system created by the two beasts to change God's laws, to
persecute those who remain loyal to God by obeying His laws any-
way, and to kill these steadfast disciples.

   The early church, through compromise and apostasy, lost the
 power of God. As a result, it used force to promote its beliefs.
 How does this same principle work in our personal lives?

                                                                   105

GOD'S INVITATION AND WARNING (Rev. 14:6-13).



R
         evelation 12:17-13:18 depicts Satan's final efforts in the great
         controversy to discredit God and destroy His church. Yet, even
         as he attempts to destroy the church, the church is involved in pro-
claiming a message to the world that will help, ultimately, lead to the
destruction of Satan. No wonder Satan wants to destroy these people.

  What part do God's people play in delivering these messages?
Vss. 6, 8, 9. In other words, are these literal angels, or are they
symbolic of something else? If so, what?


   The angels represent "God's saints engaged in the task of pro-
claiming the everlasting gospel, especially the features mentioned in
[verse 6], at a time when the 'judgment is come' (v. 7)."—The SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 827.

  The first angel's message announces the "everlasting gospel."
Why is this the first thing the verse talks about? What is this
"everlasting gospel," and why must all the world hear it?


   The second angel cries that Babylon has fallen because it "made
all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication [adul-
tery]." Babylon symbolizes rebellion against God (Gen. 11:1-9; Isa.
14:4, 12-14). In Revelation, Babylon stands for all false religious
institutions and their leaders, especially the system created by the
beast and his image, which will trigger the crisis in Revelation
13:15-17 (review yesterday's lesson).
   The third angel's message gives a fierce warning to everyone not to
worship the beast and its image. In fact, it presents one of the starkest
and most fearful warnings in all the Bible. Thus, it behooves anyone
who takes Scripture seriously to learn the content and meaning of
these three messages (which are linked), in order to know what the
issues are and how to be on the right side of this, the climax of the
great controversy, as it's being played out here on earth.

   The second angel's message regarding Babylon's fall finds
special fulfillment when Protestantism in general departs from
the everlasting gospel of righteousness by faith, proclaimed by
the first angel. Do you see such a departure occurring today? If
so, in what ways? Can we see it even in our own church, or even
in your own life? What's the only solution?

Tuesday                                               March 26
GOD'S JUDGMENT.

  "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Rev.
14:7).

         ne thing is clear: The message of the "everlasting gospel"

0       includes a message of judgment. Usually such references to
        the judgment refer to the close of human probation and the
end of the church's task in preaching the gospel. But verse 7 has the
saints fulfilling their great commission (Matt. 28:19, 20) at the same
time this judgment begins. Thus the judgment is something that is
happening while the great controversy is still being fought here on
earth.
   The angel's announcement of judgment in Revelation 14:7
points to the beginning of the final judgment just before Christ's
return. We know that Daniel's vision of judgment in chapter 7
depicts the final judgment because, when it is over, "one like
the Son of man" (Christ) receives the eternal kingdom (Dan.
7:13, 14), an act that we understand results from Christ's second
coming.
   Thus, Revelation 14:7 announces what Daniel 7 reveals, and that
is a judgment in heaven that precedes the second coming of Christ.
Both are talking about the same thing, though from different perspec-
tives. Either way, as a result of this judgment, the saints receive the
kingdom: "Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given
to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
possessed the kingdom" (Dan. 7:22). However one understands the
details of the judgment, it's something that turns out well for God's
people.

  Compare Revelation 11:16-19 with 14:7. What is it about 11:16-
19 that suggests it is depicting the pre-Advent phase of the final
judgment? What is significant about the ark of the covenant ap-
pearing in the judgment scene of 11:16-19? (See Exod. 25:16; 17;
Deut. 8:1-5.)


   How do you understand the role of this pre-Advent judg-
 ment in the context of the great controversy? The first angel's
 message announces that the judgment of God is come. Could
 this mean it also will be the hour of God's vindication, as
 well?


                                                                   107

ISSUES IN THE JUDGMENT (Rev. 12:17; 14:7, 9-12).

   (Because the issues in the judgment involve the same issues over
which the great controversy started, you might want to review lesson
2 before you study today's lesson.)

   How does Revelation 12:17 characterize God's people as they
face Satan's last attack in the great controversy? How does this
characteristic relate to the first angel's message in 14:7?




T
        he first angel invites all people to fear God, give Him glory,
        and worship Him as the Creator of the earth, heaven, the sea
       " 'and the springs of water' " (NIV). Because God designed the
Sabbath to help people remember that He is the Creator and because
His commandments urge people to keep the Sabbath (Gen. 2:2, 3;
Exod. 20:8-11), it seems clear that the obedience of God's people
during this last battle includes keeping the biblical Sabbath.
   But this obedience is more than a mere observance. Revelation 14:1
says that God's people have Christ's and the Father's "name written in
their foreheads." God's name symbolizes His character (Exod. 34:5-7;
1 Corinthians 13; Gal. 5:22, 23), and with His law written in their hearts
(Heb. 8:10), His people will reflect His character as they obey Him.

  What other issue dominates the last battle of the great contro-
versy? Rev. 14:9-12.


   The final issue involves true and false worship, the true and the false
gospel. When this issue is clearly brought before the world, those who
reject God's memorial of creatorship—the Bible Sabbath—choosing to
worship and honor Sunday in the full knowledge that it is not God's
appointed day of worship, will receive the "mark of the beast." This
mark is a mark of rebellion; the beast claims that its change of the day of
worship shows its authority over even God's law.
   Either one's choice of righteousness by faith will be revealed as
one participates in a form of worship that God has endorsed, or one's
effectual choice of righteousness by works will be revealed as one
participates in a form of worship God has forbidden but which the
beast and his image command, a humanmade worship.

    Consider: How ironic that Adventists are accused of being
 legalistic for keeping the Sabbath when the Sabbath is the sign of
 those who truly have embraced the everlasting gospel, in contrast
 to those who have embraced a theology of works.

THE GRAND FINALE (Rev. 19:11-21).

   How does Revelation 19:11-21 picture Christ at His return?




T
      his passage "portrays Christ as the victorious warrior descend-
       ing from heaven on a white battle horse (verse 11). He comes
      to claim our planet as His rightful domain: 'on his head are
many crowns' (verse 12). Neither the dragon with his seven crowns
(Rev. 12:3) nor the sea monster with its ten (Rev. 13:1) have received
from God the authority to rule over mankind. Christ returns as the
`King of kings, the Lord of lords' (Rev. 19:16). Him alone the Father
authorizes to govern the earth, and He alone will execute the holy
will of God, for He is 'the Word of God' (verse 13)."—Hans K.
LaRondelle, Chariots of Salvation (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and
Herald Pub. Assn., 1987), pp. 129, 130.
   "The title 'King of kings, and Lord of lords' (v. 16) applies in a
special sense to Christ at this time. . . . All power has been given into
His hands (1 Cor. 15:25). Satan selfishly aspired to the exalted
position that had been reserved for Christ as the Son of God (Isa.
14:12-14; Rev. 12:7-9. . . .) But the latter, not counting equality with
the Father a thing to be grasped, had voluntarily relinquished the full
exercise of the attributes and prerogatives of Deity for a time . . . , and
thereby demonstrated His worthiness to receive the honor and dignity
implicit in the title 'King of kings, and Lord of lords."—The SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 874.
   At Christ's return, the leopardlike beast and the two-horned beast
(Revelation 13; Sunday's lesson) are captured. In addition, Satan is
apprehended and imprisoned for a thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3).

   Based on the texts listed below, outline these following events:
   Rev. 20:4-6
   Rev. 7-10; 11-15
   Rev. 21:1-5

   During the final, or executive, phase of judgment, both the evil
angels and humans who remained unrepentant will be punished and
destroyed. The fire that destroys them will cleanse the earth of sin, and
God's desire "to unite all things in him [Christ], things in heaven and
things on earth," is finally a reality (Eph. 1:10, RSV).

    Review Revelation 19:11-21. List the four names Christ is
 called in this passage. How does each name give you comfort
 now and assure you of the outcome of the great controversy?

F
       URTHER STUDY: When the great controversy is over, God's
      people will live with Him for eternity. The Bible uses much
      more space to persuade people that eternal life is a divine gift
than it uses to describe that gift. Still, it is good to meditate on the
pictures of eternity we do find in Scripture. As you think about the
following passages that deal with eternity, remember that they use
ideas from human experiences that can only hint at the marvels of
our Creator and Redeemer: John 14:2, 3; 20:19, 26; 1 Cor. 2:9; 15;
1 John 3:2; Rev. 21:1-4, 22-27; 22:1-5. Which of these descriptions
means the most to you, and why?

   "Christ is the truth of all that we find in the Father. The definition
of heaven is the presence of Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, The
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 989.
   "Now the church is militant, now we are confronted with a world
in midnight darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry. But the
day is coming in which the battle will have been fought, the victory
won. The will of God is to be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.
Then the nations will own no other law than the law of heaven. All
will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise
and thanksgiving—the robe of Christ's righteousness."—Page 988.

   DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
   1. God's message to the church in Laodicea also is a message
      to the church that exists just before Christ returns. Based
      on what we have learned this quarter about the great con-
      troversy, why is this message so crucial? Rev. 3:14-22. (See
      also Matt. 25:1-13.)

   2. Matthew 25:31-46 is Jesus' description of the executive
      phase of the final judgment. Upon what are people's re-
      wards based? How does this basis fit with salvation by faith
      in Christ? Provide texts to support your answer.

       UMMARY: Satan's last effort to win the great controversy

S      involves the formation of a system that will attempt to force all
       people to cease worshiping God and obeying His commands.
God responds in two ways: (1) by issuing through His followers three
great messages that invite all people to accept His salvation and warn
them against Satan's last efforts; (2) through the final judgment that,
in all its phases, vindicates not only His character against Satan's
charges but the faith of His devoted followers, as well.

                        The False Prophet
                             J. H. Zachary

    Marco Martinez often preached in his Protestant church in Santa
Lucia, Honduras. The congregation appreciated his efforts until he
began quoting from a book that his wife had brought home. The
book, The Great Controversy, had a strong impact on Martinez's
sermons. But some of the church members began questioning his
theology, and some even called him a false prophet.
    One thing bothered Norma. Their church taught that women
should not hold leadership roles or take an active part in the local
congregation. When she accepted an invitation to visit the little
Adventist congregation in town, she was attracted by the members'
freedom to use their spiritual gifts. She began attending the Adventist
church regularly. Norma rejoiced in the love, fellowship, and op-
portunities to serve in her new church. And her husband enjoyed
reading the books she brought home. Martinez was touched by the
love of Jesus as he read Steps to Christ. He longed to learn more
about the Bible.
    When the leaders of the Protestant home church realized that
Norma was attending the Adventist church, they voted to punish
Martinez for allowing his wife to leave their church. He was
ostracized, and members avoided him. Martinez missed the close
fellowship he had once enjoyed in his church.
    About this time the Adventist church sponsored evangelistic
meetings. Marco attended with his wife and decided to join his
wife in this church. Not one to sit in the pew for long, during the
altar call one evening, Martinez circulated through the audience,
encouraging others to take their stand for Christ and join the
Adventist church with him.
    After his baptism Martinez organized a Bible study group in his
home. In his free time he hikes over the steep mountain trails
looking for interested persons with whom he can share his faith.
Martinez takes his turn preaching, for his home church shares its
pastor with several other congregations. His sermons are similar to
those he preached in his former church, but now when he quotes
 from Ellen White, he is no longer called a false prophet.
