7. What besides giving him refreshments did Melchizedek do for Abraham? Gen. 14:19.
8. Which was the greater man, Abraham or Melchizedek? Heb. 7:4, 7.

14. Since Abraham said that he would not take so much as a shoe latchet that belonged to the king of Sodom, whose property must he have regarded the tithe which he gave to the priest of the Lord? Lev. 27:30.
15. Who is our priest? Heb. 4:14.
16. Of what order is he the priest? Heb. 6:20.
17. Then ought we not to pay tithes as well as Abraham?
18. What words of the apostle Paul indicate that our great High Priest should receive tithes of us? Heb. 7:8.
19. What did Jesus himself say concerning men's duty to pay tithes? Matt. 23:23.

## NOTE.

The paying of tithes was not a Jewish arrangement, nor a ceremonial ordinance. "The tithe is the Lord's;" and when we pay a tithe of our income into the Lord's treasury, we simply give him that which is his own. When we withhold the tithe, we rob God of his due. See Mal. 3:8. In the seventh of Hebrews, in showing the superiority of the Melchizedek priesthood to the Levitical priesthood, the apostle shows that in the person of Abraham, Levi himself paid tithes to Melchizedek. Christ is a priest "after the order of Melchizedek," and so, although we are not under the Levitical priesthood, as Abraham was not, Christ is our priest, "of whom it is witnessed that he liveth," and he should receive tithe from us.
