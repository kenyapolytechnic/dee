## NOTE.

The same one who in six days created the heavens and the earth, also "rested the seventh day," and blessed and sanctified it "because that in it he had rested." We have already learned of Christ that "all things were created by him and for him; "therefore he must have made the Sabbath. Therefore he "is Lord even of the Sabbath day." This does not exclude the Father from the creation and the making of the Sabbath, for the two are one. God made the worlds by his Son. Both were united in the creation, as they are in everything; and so men "should honor the Son even as they honor the Father." When the Sabbath is not kept, both the Father and the Son are dishonored.
