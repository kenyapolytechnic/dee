## NOTES.

The day is made by the revolution of the earth on its axis. Each complete revolution makes one day, which for convenience is divided into twenty-four portions called "hours." If the sun were to become a body of darkness, the day would still be the same length that it now is. So there were days before the sun was made to rule the day. The earth began to revolve as soon as it was created, each revolution making one day; and during the fourth revolution the sun was made for a light-bearer. The sun does not make the day; it simply rules it. The Hebrew of Gen. 1:18, literally translated, says that the great lights were set in the firmament "to rule in the day and in the night."

WHEN the earth was created, "darkness was upon the face of the deep. "The phrase," in the beginning," marks the beginning of the first day of time. Consequently the first day of time began in darkness. Before the earth had completed its first revolution, God said, "Let there be light, and there was light." God saw that the light was good," and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night. And the evening [the darkness] and the morning [the light] were the first day." The first revolution of the earth was completed just at the dividing line between light and darkness; and as the first part of that day was in the darkness which up to that time had been unbroken, so the second day began with the darkness which had then been set off and placed within bounds. And because time began in darkness, the first portion of every day of time has been darkness. Men may adopt as many standards as they please, but every day of time has begun with evening, and so it will be as long as time lasts.
