## NOTE.

This lesson, it will be noticed, is entitled, "Suggestions for Quarterly Review." It is designed to assist the teacher in conducting a review of the lessons for the quarter, but need not be strictly followed unless he wishes to do so. If the previous lessons have been well learned, this one will not be found difficult. Nevertheless, anything like thorough treatment of it will in most cases require more time than can be allotted to class exercise, and the teacher will probably not be more than half or two-thirds through with it before the time for general review. In order to avoid repetition of one part of the lesson, and neglect of another, one of the following plans may be adopted at the discretion of teachers and officers: **1**. All the time of the class recitation, and also the usual time of the general review, may be given to the teachers, so that they can thoroughly consider the entire lesson in class. **2**. The whole of the time may be taken by the leader of the division, who can thus pass over the entire lesson. **3**. The classes may devote the usual time to the consideration of the lesson, and the division leader may begin about where they leave off, and finish the lesson. **4**. The division leader may begin the consideration of the lesson, asking questions and presenting some outline thoughts, and then the class recitation may occupy the remainder of the time of the school. Each school must decide for itself how it can use the lesson to the best advantage.
