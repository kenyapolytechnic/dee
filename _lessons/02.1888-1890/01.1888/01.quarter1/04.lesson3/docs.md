## NOTES.

The first words of the serpent to Eve were calculated to reflect upon God's justice, and to arouse in her the feeling that she had not been treated by the Lord with the consideration due to her. "And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" The Hebrew of the word translated "Yea," is itself a question, and the idea is, "Is it so, that God hath said," etc., indicating surprise that God should do such a thing. This was a most artful, insinuating way of arousing discontent.

IN verses 4 and 5 the serpent becomes more bold, and openly contradicts what God had said, and as openly charges him with injustice, in keeping Adam and Eve in an inferior position. Said he, "Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." This is a literal translation. The idea is that they might be equal to God as well as not, but that God had arbitrarily placed that prohibition upon them, so that he might lord it over them. Thus Satan fanned into open rebellion the pride and discontent which he first aroused. He caused our first parents to fall in the same manner that he fell. Compare Satan's words to Eve with the teachings of modern Spiritualism that what the Bible calls evil is a necessity, and the only means by which men can reach the highest development.

"BY one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12. God did not allow death to come upon all mankind to punish them for Adam's transgression, but because "all have sinned." By his transgression Adam lost the moral likeness to God with which he was created, and so he transmitted to his descendants a perverted, sinful nature. Where Adam sinned they sinned.
