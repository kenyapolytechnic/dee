## NOTE.

Angels of God unfolded to Adam and Eve the plan of salvation, consequently their knowledge of it must have been perfect. So Cain and Abel knew how they might obtain righteousness, and peace with God. Abel accepted the conditions in simple faith, "by which he obtained witness that he was righteous." What this witness was, may be learned from Rom. 8:16 and 1 John 5:9-12.
