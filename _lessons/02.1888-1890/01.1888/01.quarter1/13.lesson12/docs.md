## NOTE.

On Jude 7 Dr. Barnes says: "The phrase eternal fire is one that is often used to denote future punishment - as expressing the severity and intensity of the suffering. As here used it cannot mean that the fires which consumed Sodom and Gomorrah were literally eternal, or were kept always burning, for that was not true. The expression seems to denote, in this connection, two things: (1) That the destruction of the cities of the plains, with their inhabitants, was as entire and perpetual as if the fires had been always burning - the consumption was absolute and enduring - the sinners were wholly cut off, and the cities forever rendered desolate; and (2) that in its nature and duration this was a striking emblem of the destruction which will come upon the ungodly." And the apostle Peter expressly declares that God made Sodom and Gomorrah "an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly." 2 Peter 2:6.
