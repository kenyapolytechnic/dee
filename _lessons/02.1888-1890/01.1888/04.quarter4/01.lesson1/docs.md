## NOTES

THE marginal rendering of verse 1, the rendering given in the Revised Version, more nearly conforms to the Greek than does the text. While we may not use a marginal rendering as the basis of any doctrine, the absolute divinity of Christ is so well established by other scriptures, that we know that he is justly entitled to be called God as well as Saviour. For instance, Isaiah says of the Son to be given, that "his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Isa. 9:6. John says: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." John 1:1, 14. God the Father addresses the Son as follows: "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever." Heb. 1:8. And when the redeemed shall see Jesus their Saviour coming in the clouds of heaven, they will say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us." Isa. 25:9. Let none, therefore, find fault with the rendering, Our God and Saviour Jesus Christ," nor fear to worship as God, Him whom all the angels are commanded to worship. 

THE stress which the apostle Peter lays upon a knowledge of God is quite noticeable. Twice in this lesson it is mentioned. He would evidently impress upon our minds the necessity of a personal acquaintance with God - of knowing him as we would an intimate friend - and of loving him not simply because of what he does, but because of what he is. "God is love," and "we love him because he first loved us." It is this perception of his character which first draws us to him, - "the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance." Rom. 2:4. By this we are made partakers of the divine nature, that is, adopted into the family of God. As sons of God, it necessarily follows that our acquaintance with him must become more and more intimate. It is this intimate acquaintance with God which multiplies peace to us. "Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace." Job 22:21. In Gal. 4:6-9 the apostle Paul makes a knowledge of God equivalent to a state of sonship. It is evident, therefore, that the knowledge of God, of which the apostles speak, is far more than the simple knowledge and belief that God exists as Creator of the world.
