## NOTES

IN the epistles of Paul there are "some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction." Notice that it is not said that there is anything in Paul's epistles that is impossible to be understood. It is only "hard to be understood." But that which is hard to be understood may be understood by hard study. Moreover it is only the unlearned and unstable that wrest them to their own destruction. The double-minded, or unstable, will take the strongest statements concerning the law and the gospel, and will construe them so as to make them teach the abolition of the law and consequently of the gospel. It is only the "unlearned," those who do not look beneath the surface, who do this. Those who delight in the law of God, and who know Christ, "in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," have a key with which they may unlock any of the mysteries of that most profound writer. Notice further, also, that those who wrest the words of Paul out of their legitimate meaning, do the same thing also to the other scriptures.

"BUT grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." This text is misquoted in two ways. A very common misquotation is, "Grow in knowledge of the truth." There is no such text to be found in the Bible, although this text amounts to the same thing, because Christ is the truth, as well as the way and the life. John 14:6. The poet says of Christ,—

```
"In thy life the law appears
Drawn out in living characters."
```

He was the law personified. If one wishes to know just how much righteousness the law of God requires, he has only to study the life and character of Christ. All the beauty and holiness of Christ were simply the manifestation of the law of love which prompted every act. It is in the life and death of Christ that we can get more exalted ideas of the holiness and majesty of God's law. If we do not grow in knowledge of Christ, we can never have the law written in our hearts, for it is only in him that we can be made the righteousness of God. 2 Cor. 5:21. 

Another misquotation is sometimes heard in prayers to Christ, that we may "grow in grace and in thy knowledge." The , idea seems to be that we must grow in the knowledge that Christ has, so as to approach him in wisdom. But this is not the proper idea. We are simply and literally to grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. We must know him intimately. He must sup with us, and we with him; but he must be a constant companion, and not a transient guest. And in proportion as we know him intimately, know him as a friend, loving and true, know him as the " chiefest among ten thousand, and the one altogether lovely," we shall develop that purity of heart which will enable us to see God; for Christ cannot be comprehended except as we become like him.
