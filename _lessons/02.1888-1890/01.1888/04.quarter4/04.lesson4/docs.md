## NOTES

CHARITY, or love, is "the bond of perfectness." This may readily be understood when we remember that "love is the fulfilling of the law," and that the whole law of God, including every duty that can be required of man, is summed up in the two precepts, " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind," and, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." The love which is the bond of perfectness is not a mere emotion, but is a living, active principle, manifest in every deed and thought of one's life. Of course it is understood that love is the bond of perfectness only when there is underlying faith, for faith works by love, and love is the product of faith.

"GIVE diligence, to make your calling and election sure." Many are called, but few are chosen. How many are called? All. Here is the call: "Ho, every one that thirsteth,' come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price." Isa. 55:1. "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Rev. 22:17. But not all will heed the call; and of those who listen to it, very few comparatively will gain the final inheritance, because the great majority will not agonize to enter in. "Many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." Luke 13:24. A man may even be one of the elect, - one of the specially 24 loved of God, yet if he does not give diligence to make his election sure, he will certainly fall. The doctrine of the perseverance of the saints" is an excellent one, if the saints only persevere; but they must not imagine that because they have tasted that the Lord is precious, and have felt the power of the world to come, therefore they are bound to be kept to the end, regardless of their own actions. Only those who patiently continue in well-doing can have eternal life. To each Christian the warning is given, "Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown." Rev. 3:11.
