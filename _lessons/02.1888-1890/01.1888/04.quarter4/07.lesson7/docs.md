## NOTES

THEY are not afraid to speak of evil dignities." The dignities, or, more literally, glories, here referred to are doubtless supernatural powers, whether good or bad. The Syriac has it, " They shudder not with awe while they blaspheme." The meaning evidently is that these presumptuous, licentious teachers of what they claim is religion, have no regard for authority. This is shown by the first part of the verse, where it is said that they "despise government." There is no special class of people to whom the specifications of this chapter will apply, except Spiritualists. Not that all Spiritualists are actually openly immoral; but there is not one who does not hold to doctrines that naturally lead to immorality. They teach that man is himself a part of God, and so is amenable to no power but himself; that he is a law to himself, and is his own judge. Now it makes no difference how much men prate about culture, refinement, elevation, and morality, when they shut themselves off from the only Source of morality. When men teach 'that the impulses of their own natures are the only, law to be followed, they must eventually land in the pit of corruption.

BUT when men despise the government of God, it is but a step to the despising of all human authority. Indeed, when men do not regard the claims of God, whatever obedience they render to human laws is due solely to fear of immediate punishment. In the Bible, honor to earthly kings is placed next to the fear of God. Says Peter, "Fear God. Honor the king." 1 Peter 2:17. And the commandment to ancient Israel was: "Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people." Ex. 22:28, Revised Version. It is worthy of note that most Spiritualists are open sympathizers with anarchy. Respect for authority is the prime factor in true religion. The man who is not afraid to speak evil of those who are in authority, who rails at those who are in official position, whether in Heaven, or in earthly Governments, is a dangerous man. He may not do any great evil, because. of lack of opportunity; but once let him have an opportunity, without the fear of physical punishment to deter him, and there is nothing to restrain him from going to the greatest lengths. It is a bad sign to see a man railing at even a wicked ruler. When Peter wrote, " Honor the king," and Paul wrote, " Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers" (Rom. 13:1), wicked kings were reigning. But they occupied the place of authority, and their official position was to be respected, however wicked they might be.

SAYS the apostle: "They allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error." A man always falls, if he does fall, in the direction toward which he leans. Says Christ: "From within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness," etc. Mark 7:21, 22. Now with these propensities existing naturally in the heart, it inevitably follows that when a man heeds the words of those who " despise government," he will fall to the lowest depths of vice. 

So the apostle continues: "While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." These false teachers, and their name nowadays is legion, talk a great deal about "liberty." They refuse to be bound down by laws. They tell their dupes to assert their godlike power and be free. It was thus that Satan tempted Eve. "Ye shall be like God," said he, and he made her believe that the just law of God was arbitrary, and devised solely for the purpose of keeping man in an inferior position. Too late she found out the baseness of such a charge. " The bondage of corruption " is the worst bondage conceivable. Even in this life, men find that liberty is found only in obedience to law. Daniel Wise truly said that "perfect liberty is perfect obedience to a perfect law." Law is the best friend that man has. And "the glorious liberty of the sons of God "will be shared only by such as "keep the law of God." They will have the freedom of God's universe throughout eternity, while to those who seek liberty in following their own devices, is reserved " the blackness of darkness forever."
