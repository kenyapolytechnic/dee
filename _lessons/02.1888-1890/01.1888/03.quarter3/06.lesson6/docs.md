#### Lesson 6

August 11, 1888.

## THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BEAST.

1. WHAT power is represented by the first beast of Rev. 13? Ans. - The Papacy.
2. From what was it developed? Ans. -"A falling away." 2 Thess. 2:3.
3. In what was shown the first definite evidence of falling away from the truth of God? Ans. - The adoption of heathen rites and customs. "The bishops augmented the number of religious rites in the Christian worship, by way of accommodation to the infirmities and prejudices, both of Jews and heathens, in order to facilitate their conversion to Christianity." "For this purpose, they gave the name of mysteries to the institutions of the gospel, and decorated particularly the holy sacrament with that solemn title. They used in that sacred institution, as also in that of baptism, several of the terms employed in the heathen mysteries, and proceeded so far, at length, as even to adopt some of the ceremonies of which those renowned mysteries consisted." - Mosheim, Church History, century II, part II, chap. 4, par. 2, 5.
4. How early was this manifested? Ans.- "This imitation began in the Eastern provinces; but, after the time of Adrian [emperor A. D. 117-138] who first introduced the mysteries among the Latins, it was followed by the Christians who dwelt in the western parts of the empire." - Mosheim, Church History, century II, part II, chap. 4, par. 5.
5. What worship was the most widely prevalent among all ancient nations? Ans. - Sun worship - "the oldest, the most widespread, and the most enduring of all the forms of idolatry known to man, viz:, the worship of the sun." - Talbot W Chambers, in Old Testament Student, January, 1886.
6. When this worship was not directed to an image, how was it performed? Ans. - "Before the coming of Christ, all the Eastern nations performed divine worship with their faces turned to that part of the heavens where the sun displays his rising beams. This custom was founded upon a general opinion that God, whose essence they looked upon to be light, and whom they considered as being circumscribed within certain limits, dwelt in that part of the firmament, from which he sends forth the sun, the bright image of his benignity and glory." — Mosheim, Church History, century II, part II, chap. 4, par. 7. Eze. 8:16.
7. Was this custom adopted by some who called themselves Christian? Ans. — "The Christian converts, indeed, rejected this gross error [of supposing that God dwelt in that part of the firmament; but they retained the ancient and universal custom of worshiping toward the east, which sprang from it. Nor is that custom abolished even in our times, but still prevails in a great number of Christian churches." — Mosheim, Id.
8. What day was especially devoted to the sun?
9. Was that day adopted by these Christians also? Ans. — "That very day was the Sunday of their heathen neighbors and respective countrymen; and patriotism gladly united with expediency in making it at once their Lord's day and their Sabbath." — North British Review as quoted in History of the Sabbath, chap. 16
10. Upon what is the Papacy built? Ans. — Self-exaltation. 2 Thess. 2:4.
11. In behalf of what was manifested the first arrogant claims of the Papacy? Ans. — In behalf of Sunday.
12. By whom? Ans. — By Victor, who was bishop of Rome, A.D. 193-202.
13. What did he command? Ans. — "He wrote an imperious letter to the Asiatic prelates commanding them to imitate the example of the Western Christians with respect to the time of celebrating the festival of Easter [that is, commanding them to celebrate it on Sunday]. The Asiatics answered this lordly requisition ... with great spirit and resolution, that they would by no means depart in this manner from the custom handed down to them by their ancestors. Upon this the thunder of excommunication began to roar. Victor, exasperated by this resolute answer of the Asiatic bishops, broke communion with them, pronounced them unworthy of the name of his brethren, and excluded them from all fellowship with the church of Rome." — Mosheim, Id., chap. 4, par. II.
14. How early in the second century had this question been made an important one? Ans. — "About the middle of this century, during the reign of Antoninus Pius [about 160], the venerable Polycarp went to Rome to confer with Anicet, bishop of that See, upon this matter." — Id., par. 10.
15. What is the great characteristic of the Papacy as a world power? Ans. — The union of Church and State, — the religious power dominating the civil power and using it to further its own ends.
16. When was the union of Church and State formed, out of which grew the Papacy? Ans. — In the reign of Constantine, A.D. 313-337.
17. What was the condition and work of most of the bishops at this time? Ans. — "Worldly-minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns." — Neander, Vol. II., p. 16, Torrey's Edition.
18. What had these bishops determined to do? Ans. — "This theocratical theory was already the prevailing one in the time of Constantine; and ... the bishops voluntarily made themselves dependent on him by their disputes, *and by their determination to make use of the power of the State for the furtherance of aims"* — Id., p. 132.
19. What is the "theocratical theory"? Ans. — The theory of government of a State by the immediate power or administration of God.
20. What then is the effect of a man-made theocracy? Ans. — To put man in the place of God.
21. Was this the outcome of the theocratical theory of the bishops of the fourth century? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
