## NOTE

QUESTION 12. - It is not possible that it should refer to the literal river, because never in all history have the waters of the literal river Euphrates been a hindrance to any kings either of the East or of the West. A thousand years before Christ, the kings of Assyria crossed it regularly every spring - at the very time when the waters were the highest - in their campaigns. In the year 269 A.D., Tiridates, king of Armenia, swam it with his armor on. - Gibbon, chap. 13, par. 21. The view that the reference is to the power that rules the country of the Euphrates, and not to the literal river, is strengthened by the fact that Isaiah in speaking of the king of Assyria and his armies plainly calls them, "The waters of the river." " Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them [the people of Judah] the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks." Isa. 8:7.
