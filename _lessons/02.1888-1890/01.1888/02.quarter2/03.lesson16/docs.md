## NOTE.

The question may arise, "If Jacob had received only food to eat and raiment to put on, how could he have paid tithe?" We are not to suppose that when Jacob made his vow, he expected that the Lord would give him his clothes ready made. The idea was that he would give the Lord a tithe of all that he received, and would get his food and raiment out of the remainder, no matter how much or how little it might be. The lesson that we should learn is, that nine-tenths of what we think would support us, with the blessing of the Lord, is better than the entire amount that might seem necessary, without God's blessing. God is able to make a small amount furnish as good a support as a large sum. See 2 Cor. 9:8; also the case of the widow's cruse of oil and handful of meal (1 Kings 17:8-16), and the feeding of the multitudes by Christ.
