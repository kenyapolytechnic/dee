"THERE'S a wideness in God's mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There's a kindness in his justice,
That is more than liberty.

"There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good.
There is mercy with the Saviour;
There is healing in his blood.

"For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man's mind;
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.

"If our love were but more simple,
We should take him at his word;
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord."
