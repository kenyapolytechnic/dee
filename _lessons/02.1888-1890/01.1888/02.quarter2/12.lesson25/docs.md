## NOTES.

It is not in accordance with God's plan to punish any man, no matter how wicked he may be, without warning him, and giving him a chance to repent. Therefore, although he knew that Pharaoh was so churlish and stubborn that he would not listen to reason, he did not begin to send judgments upon him, at first, to force him to let Israel go, but sent a simple request, instead. Thus his justice was manifested.
In the demand, "Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness," an opportunity was offered to Pharaoh to recognize the God of Israel as the true God. It was, in fact, Pharaoh's chance for repentance. If Pharaoh had granted the simple request which Moses brought to him from the Lord, it would have indicated that he recognized the authority of God; and in that case he would have been willing to grant whatever else the Lord might demand.

FROM Ex. 4:23 and Ps. 105:43-45 we learn that the children of Israel could not serve the Lord in Egypt. In Deut. 5:14, 15 we find special emphasis given to that portion of the fourth commandment requiring the man-servant and the maid-servant to rest, and the Israelite was told to remember that he had been a servant in the land of Egypt; also in Ex. 5:5 we learn that Moses and Aaron made the people "rest from their burdens." From these facts we may conclude that the Sabbath was one of the things in which they could not serve the Lord in Egypt; and when Moses and Aaron came with the message of God (Ex. 4:29-31), they attempted a reform, which only increased their oppression. The Israelites were delivered, that they might observe the statutes of the Lord, including the Sabbath, and this placed upon them an additional obligation to keep the Sabbath strictly, as well as to keep all the commandments. Compare Deut. 24:17,18.
