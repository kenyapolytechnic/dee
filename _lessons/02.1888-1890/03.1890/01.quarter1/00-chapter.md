                       NOTES.

  HEBREWS 7 is a most interesting chapter. The
subject of the Melchizedek priesthood was intro-
duced in chapter 5: 6; but the depth of the subject,
and the reflection that the brethren to whom he was
writing had not properly improved their opportu-
nities, and were not well prepared to appreciate the
weighty truths of which he had to speak, led the
writer to make a digression, in which he first de-
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                5

scribed their condition, and then gave them a most
solemn admonition, pointing out their great danger;
and then gave them encouragement, setting before
them the example of Abraham, and the faithfulness
and righteousness of God in keeping his promises.
By a happy and natural process he turns the sub-
ject of our hope, which rests on the promises made
to Abraham, in the direction of the priesthood of
Christ after the order of Melchizedek, from which
he had been diverted, which is the great object of
this letter.


   WITHOUT indulging in any curious speculations,
or dealing in any inferences, we find at least ten
prominent points of difference between the two or-
ders of priesthood. We will enumerate them as
follows:—
    I. Christ's priesthood is kingly; it is on the
throne of his Father in Heaven.. Aaron had no
kingship.
    2. In his priesthood no genealogy was reckoned.
In Aaron's line no one could act unless his genal-
ogy was clear and undisputed.
    3. He was born of the tribe of Judah, though
that fact was in nowise material to his priesthood.
The other priests were of the tribe of Levi, and
this Was a necessity.
    4.- He can save completely, or to the uttermost.
Their priesthood and service made nothing perfect.
    5. His priesthood is in heaven. Theirs was
earthly.
    6. His priesthood is perpetual, not transferable.
 Theirs was temporary; their death caused a suc-
 cession.
     7. He is ever without sin. They had infirmity,
 and were sinners, even as others.
     8. He offered but one sacrifice. They offered
 many, daily, year by year continually.
6          LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

    9. He offered no sacrifice for himself They .
had to offer for themselves.
   1o. He was constituted priest by an oath of God.
Their priesthood was arranged through a mortal
man.
   It would he difficult to add anything to the evi-
dences of the dignity and efficiency of our high
priest. It was pertinent that the Lord should in-
quire what more could have been done to his vine-
yard—his people—that he has not done. Isa. 5:
1-7. What fruit shall we render to him for such
wondrous provision for our salvation?
   At this point the apostle sums up and applies the
argument, and then passes from the difference of,
the priests to the difference of the covenants under
which they served, including the difference of the
offerings. This line of argument he continues un-
til he conies to the close of all priestly work, and
the coming agaifi of the Son of God unto the full
salvation of them that look for him.

             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


                       NOTES.

   AT first glance it might seem that the reasoning
is not good, which decides that Christ could have
no priesthood on earth; for, if the law which con-
fined the priesthood to the family of Aaron were
abolished, what would hinder one serving though
he were of another tribe? But it must be remem-
bered that the priesthood and the law ordaining
the priesthood stood and fell together. The only
law for an earthly priesthood was that law which
gave the office exclusively to the family of Aaron,
and if any would act as priest on .earth he must
conform to the law of the earthly priesthood. It
was impossible for one of another tribe to act as
priest on earth. Further, it must be borne in mind
that the service in the temple was still kept up
by the Jews at the time when this letter was written,
so that the words in this verse were conformable to
the facts as they existed, as well as to the facts con-
cerning the change of dispensations. For no one
could possibly have then officiated as priest unless
he were of the family of Aaron.


  WEBSTER gives two principal definitions to the
word "covenant." The first is, "A mutual agree-
ment of two or more persons or parties, in writing
and under seal, to do or to refrain from some act or
thing." The second is, "A writing containing the
terms of agreement between parties." But neither
of these definitions is extensive enough to cover all
the uses of the word in the Bible. For instance,
in Gen. 9 :9-16 the word "covenant" is used with
reference to a promise of God, given without any
condition expressed or implied. The common
idea of a covenant more nearly fits the transaction
recorded in Ex. 19 : 5-8; yet even here we shall
find that the thing called a covenant, which God
             LETTER TO THE• HEBREWS.               9

made with the • people, does not in every particular
correspond to a contract made between two men.
It is only another instance of the impossibility of a
perfect comparison between divine and human
things. In other places in the Bible the word
" testament " or " will" is used with reference to
the same transaction, although a contract and a
will are greatly different. The transaction be-
tween Gdd and Israel partakes of the nature of
both. But it is of little consequence that a human
covenant does not perfectly represent the affair, or
that the Bible uses the word "covenant" in so
widely varying senses. The main point is to un-
derstand just what is meant in each instance, and
this the Scriptures themselves enable us readily to
do.


   STILL another sense in which the word " cove-
nant " is used in the Bible, is found in the text
under consideration. Ex. 19:5-8. The condition
of the covenant which the Lord made with Israel,
was that they should keep his covenant. Here was
something already existing, which God calls " my
covenant," concerning which he was about to
make a covenant with the people. What God's
covenant is, may be found from Deut. 4 : 12, 13.
It is the ten commandments. God's law—called
his covenant—was the basis of the covenant be-
tween him and Israel. The matter is so plain that
there is no necessity for confusion. It makes no
difference that the same term is applied to both;
it is sufficient to know that God's covenant—the
ten commandments--antedated and is entirely dis-
tinct from the transaction at Horeb—also called a
covenant. That to which the apostle refers as the
first covenant, was, therefore, simply this: A
promise on the part of the people to keep his holy
law, and a statement on the part of God, of the
result to them if they should obey him.

           LEP4SUN XST I.
                   JANUARY   18, 1890.

                HEBREWS 8:8-13.

    I. WHAT was the old covenant that was made
with Israel? Ex. 19: 5-8; 24: 3-8.
    2. How does the second covenant compare with
the first? Heb. 8: 6..
    3. What was the necessity for the second cove-
nant? Vcrse 7.
    4. Since the second covenant is better than the
first, in that it is founded upon better promises,
wherein must the first have been faulty? Ans. —
In the promises.
    5. What were the promises of the fist covenant?
Ex. 19:8; 24:3, 7.
    6. What Was God's covenant which the people
promised to perform?
    7. What is said of the nature of those command-
ments? Ps. 19 : 7; 119 :172.
    8. What of those who' do them? Ps. 119 : 1-3;
Eccl. 12:13.                                     •
    9. Then could the children of Israe-1 have prom-
ised anything better than tttli 'keep Gott)s command-
ments?
   io. Wherein, then, was the fault? Heb. 8:8,
first part.
    1. What did the people really promise to do?

   13. What renders the law thus powerless? Rom.
8:3.
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                11

  14. What is all human righteousness? Isa. 64: 6.
  15. What is the only true righteousness? Phil.
3:9.
  16. In the terms of the first covenant do we find
any mention of faith, or of divine assistance?
                       NOTES.
    LET the student note that the promises in the
 old covenant were really all on the part of the peo-
 ple. God said, " If ye will obey my voice indeed,
 and keep my covenant [the ten commandments],
 then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
 all people, . . . and ye shall be unto me a king-
 dom of priests, and an holy nation." God did not
 say that he would make them such, but that they
 would be such a people if they obeyed his com-
 mandments. It could not be otherwise. The keep-
 ing of God's holy law would constitute them a holy
 people; and as such they would indeed be a pecul-
 iar treasure, even as are all.who are zealous of good
 works. All that was set before them was simply
 what would result from obedience to the law, and
 that covenant contained no promise of help in
 doing that. Therefore the first covenant was a
 promise on the part of the people that they would
 make themselves holy. But this they could not do.
 The promise was a good one; with it alone there
'could be no fault; the fault lay with the people.
 The promise was faulty, through the weakness of
  the people who made it; just as we read in Rom.
8: 3, that the law was weak through the flesh.

  THE first thought in the minds of many, on
learning that in the first covenant the people made
a promise which they could not possibly fulfill, is
that God was unjust to require such a promise.
And since they know that God is not unjust, they
12         LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

conclude that the first covenant must have con-
tained pardon and promise of divine assistance, al-
though it contained no hint of it. If the student
will wait until the subject of the covenants is con-
cluded, he will see the justice and the mercy
of God's plan. But right here let us fasten these
two thoughts: First, if the first covenant had con-
tained pardon, and promise of divine assistance,
there would have been no necessity of any other
covenant. Pardon and divine aid are all that any
soul can get, and if the first covenant had had
these, it would not have been faulty. But, second,
let it not he forgotten that the fact that there was
no pardon, and no Holy Spirit's aid, in that cove-
nant does not imply that there was no salvation for
the people who lived under it. There was ample
provision for them, but not in the first covenant.
What the provision was, and why the first cove-
nant was given, will be learned later.

   20, What is the reason why many who profess
to desire righteousness do not obtain it? Rom.

  21. If they would humble themselves and sub-
mit to God, what would he do for them? Isa. 61:
  22.. 'Through whom alone can this righteousness
be obtained? Rom. 5 : 17, 19.

Rom. 3 : 22.
                      NOTES.
  THE first of the blessings of the gospel is the
forgiveness of sins. The term for this in the quo-
tation in Hebrews is, " I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness." The next is the writing of the
law in the hearts of the people. Then comes the
final blotting out of sins: " Their sins and their
iniquities will I remember no more." And then
comes the close of probation, and the eternal in-
heritance, when "they shall .teach no more every •
man his neighbor, and every man his brother,
saying, Know the Lord; for they shall. all know
me, from the least of them unto the greatest of
them, saith the Lord." Jer. 31 : 34. Then all the
people will be taught of the Lord. Isa. .54: 13.


   ISRAEL were indeed called the people of God;
but his dealings with them abundantly prove, what
the New Testament plainly declares, that only the
faithful are really Israel, and no others were truly
his people. The Lord sent word to Pharaoh, say-
ing, " Let my people go, that they may serve me."
Again he said, " Israel is my son, even my first-
born." He also said he had seen the affliction of
his people, and had come to deliver them, and to
bring them into the land of Canaan. He did in-
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.              15

deed deliver them out of Egypt, but of all the host
that went out, only two were brought into the land
of Canaan. The rest fell in the cksert because of
their unbelief. When they rebelled against God,
they cut themselves off from being his people.
And as he said in the prophecy, and in the text
we have been considering, when they refused to
continue in his covenant, he regarded them not.
To be the people of God in truth we must have his
law in our hearts.


          LESSON
                  FEBRUARY 1, 1890.


                HEBREWS 8:6-13.

    I. IN what does the difference between the old
covenant and the new consist? Heb. 8: 6. •
    2. What were the promises of the old covenant?
    3. What are those of the new?
    4. Was there any promise of pardon in the
old covenant? See Ex. 19:3-8 ; 24: 3-8. These
scriptures contain the complete record of the mak-
ing of the old covenant, but they contain no hint
of pardon, or of any help through Christ.
    5. Then how did people under the old covenant
find salvation? Heb. 9: 14, 15.
    6. Was there actual forgiveness for the people
at the very time they sinned? or was forgiveness
deferred until the death of Christ? Ps. 32:5 ;
78:38. Enoch and Elijah were taken to Heaven,
which shows that they had received the same full-
ness of blessing that those will receive who live
until the Lord comes,
16          LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


    7. Since there was present and complete salva-
tion for men who lived under the old covenant,
and forgiveness of the transgressions .that were
under the first covenant came only through the
second, what must we conclude? Ans.—That the
second covenant really existed at the same time as,
and even before, the first covenant.
    8. Tell again what is included in the blessings
of the second covenant?
    9. What will be received by those whose trans-
gressions are forgiven through the new covenant?
Heb. 9: 15, last clause.
   10. Whose children are all they who are heirs
of the eternal inheritance? Gal. 3: 29.
   11. Of how many is Abraham the father? Rom.
4: II, 12.
   12. Did Abraham have righteousness? Gen.
26: 5.
   13. How did he obtain this righteousness?
Rom. 4: 3 ; Gal. 3: 6.
   14. Through whom did Abraham receive this
righteousness? Gal. ,3: 14, first part.
 • 15. Then could the covenant with Abraham have
lacked anything? Ans.—No; having Christ, it
had all that can be desired—" all things that per-
tain to life and godliness."
   16. Since all the blessings which people receive
through the new covenant, they receive as chil-
dren of Abraham, can there be any difference be-
tween the second covenant and the covenant with
Abraham?
   17. How long before the old covenant was the
covenant with Abraham made? Gal. 3: 17.
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                 17

   18. Then why was that " first " covenant made?
See notes.
                        NOTES.
   THE question has often been asked, How could
any be saved under the old covenant, if there was
no pardon in that covenant? That there was
no pardon in that covenant is readily seen : i.
There is no hint of pardon in the covenant itself, as
recorded in Ex. 19 : 5-8, or in the reiteration and
ratification of it in chap. 24 : 3-8. 2. In the sanct-
uary service there was no blood offered that could
take away sin. Heb. 10 : 4. There was therefore
no chance for pardon in that covenant. But to
say they were under that covenant settles nothing as
to what was in the covenant. All were under that
covenant who lived while it endured. But that was
not all They were " beloved for the fathers' sake."
As chidren of Abraham, they were also under the
Abrahamic covenant, of which their circumcision
was the token. John 7 : 22 ; Gen. 17 : 9-14. This
was a covenant of faith, already confirmed by
the word and oath of the Lord, in Christ, the Seed,
and it was not disannuled by any future arrange-
ment. Gal. 3 : 15-17. All who were of faith were
blessed with faithful Abraham. Verses 6-9. Over-
looking this plain' fact, which indeed lies at the very
foundation of gospel faith in the new covenant,
 which is but the development of the Abrahamic,
some have ascribed salvation to the covenant at
 Horeb. But, according to both Scripture and
 reason, if salvation had been possible in that cove-
 nant, there was no need of the second. Heb. 7 : 11 ;
 io : i, etc.

  THOUGH much dissatisfaction is expressed by
commentators with the received rendering of Heb.
9: 1, their suggestions do not make it very greatly
different. The first covenant is said to have had
18          LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

ordinances of divine service and a sanctuary of this
world. But these were superadditions, not at all
necessary to the covenant, but quite necessary as
types of the sacrifice and priesthood of the new
covenant. They all recognized the existence of sin;
but no sin was taken away by them. Heb. Io : 3,
4. As a sanctuary of this world, and offerings that
could not take away sin, were connected to that
covenant, these things themselves were but recogni-
tions of the fact that there was no pardon in that
covenant. By those things the people expressed
faith in the mediation of the new covenant. If any
pardon had been contained in that covenant, we
must conclude that some means would have been
devised to make that fact manifest. But there was
not

   THE word sanctuary means a holy place, or the
dwelling-place of God. Indeed, the same word is
often used in the Hebrew for sanctuary and holiness.
All can see that it is derived from a verb which sig-
nifies to sanctify or make holy. The sanctuary
being a holy dwelling, and being divided into two
rooms, each of course was a holy place. And each
is called the holy . See Lev. 16 : 2. Here the word
  holy" is used, and we learn onljr by the descrip-
tion—within the veil before the mercy-seat, which
is upon the ark—that the inner holy is meant. In-
asmuch as in the second was placed the ark, con-
taining the tables of stone on which were the com-
mandments,—the most sacred things committed to
them,—it was called the most holy, or, properly,
according to the Hebrew, the holy of the holies.

  WHAT was in the ark? Few subjects have oc-
casioned more perplexity than this description of
what was in the ark. The apostle specifies, as be-
ing in the holy place, only the candlestick and the
            LETTER TO THE HEBREIVS.               19

table upon which was the bread ; whereas it is cer-
tain that the golden altar of incense was also therein.
Moses had direction to put the two tables of testi-
mony in the ark. Ex. 25 : i6, 2 I. This order he
obeyed. Ex. 40 : 20 ; Deut. Jo : 5. But we do,
not read of his putting anything else in the ark, or
of his being ordered to do so. In r Kings 8 : 9 it
is distinctly said that " there was nothing in the ark
save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there
at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the
children of Israel." This was spoken of the time
when the vessels of the sanctuary were brought into
their appropriate places in the temple built by Sol-
omon. Dr. Clarke says:—
    " As Calmet remarks, in the temple which was
afterwards built, there were many things added
which were not in the tabernacle, and several things
 left out. The ark of the covenant and the two
 tables of the law were never found after the return
 from the Babylonish captivity. We have no proof
 that, even in the time of Solomon, the golden pot
 of manna, or the rod of Aaron, was either in or
 near the ark. . . . We need not trouble our-
 selves to reconcile the various scriptures _which
 mention these subjects, some of which refer to the
 tabernacle, others to Solomon's temple, and others
 to the temple built by Zorobabel, which places
 were very different from each other."
    That changes took place is evident. If Paul
 wrote of the tabernacle in the days of Moses, then
 the rod of Aaron and the pot of manna had been
 removed from the ark before the time of Solomon,
 which some suggest might have occurred while the
 ark was in the hands of the Philistines. Or, other-
 wise, Paul was speaking of things as they existed
 some time after Solomon, of which we have no ac-
  count in the Scri-Aures. Which is the case is not-
 at all material.
20           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

    NONE should allow themselves to be confused
 by the terms first covenant and second covenant.
 While the covenant made at Sinai was called " the
 first covenant," it is by no means the first covenant
 that God ever made with man. Long before that
 he made a covenant with Abraham, and he also
 made a covenant with Noah, and with Adam.
  Neither must it be supposed that the first or old
 covenant existed for a period of time as the only
 covenant with the people before the promise of the
 second or new covenant could be shared. If that
 had been the case, then during that time there
. would have been no pardon for the people. What
 is called the "second covenant" virtually existed
  before the covenant was made at Sinai; for the
 covenant with Abraham was confirmed in Christ
 (Gal. 3: I 7) ; and it is only through Christ that there
 is any value to what is known as the second cove-
 nant. There is no blessing that can be gained by
 virtue of the second covenant that was not prom-
 ised to Abraham. And we, with whom the second
 covenant is made, can share the inheritance which
 it promises. only by being children of Abraham.
 To be Christ's is the same as to be children of
 Abraham (Gal. 3:29); all who are of faith are the
 children of Abraham, and share in his blessing
 (Verses 7-9); and since no one can have anything
 except as children of Abraham, it follows that there
 is nothing in what is called the second covenant
 that was not in the covenant made with Abraham.
 The second covenant existed in every feature long
 before the first, even from the days of Adam. It
 is called " second " because both its ratification by
 blood and its more minute statement were after
 that of the covenant made at Sinai. More than
 this, it was the second covenant made with the
 Jewish people. The one from Sinai was the first
 made with that nation.
           LETZER TO THE HEBREWS.               21

   WHEN it is demonstrated that the first covenant
—the Sinaitic covenant—contained no provisions
for pardon of sins, some will at once say, " But
they did have pardon under that covenant." The
trouble arises from a confusion of terms. It is not
denied that. under the old covenant, i. e., during
the time when it was specially in force, there was
pardon of sins, but that pardon was not offered in
the old covenant, and could not be secured by
virtue of it. The pardon was secured by virtue of
something else, as shown by Heb. 9: 15. Not
only was there the opportunity of finding free
pardon of sins, and grace to help in time of need,
during the time of the old covenant, but the same
opportunity existed before that covenant was made,
by virtue of God's covenant with Abraham, which
differs in no respect from that made with Adam
and Eve, except that we have the particulars given
more in detail. We see, then, that there was no
necessity for provisions to be made in the Sinaitic
covenant for forgiveness of sins. The plan of sal-
vation was developed long before the gospel was
preached to Abraham (Gal. 3: 8), and was amply
sufficient to save to the .uttermost all who would
accept it. The covenant at Sinai was made for the
 purpose of making the people see the necessity of
accepting the gospel.

   I. WHAT does the apostle say that the first
covenant had? Heb. 9:i.

Ex. 19 :3-8 ; 24 : 3-8.
22         LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

    3. What is meant by ordinances of divine serv-
ices? Ans.—Ceremonies of divine appointment.
There is no divine service without divine appoint-
ment.
    4. What is meant by a worldly sanctuary?
Ans.—A sanctuary of the world, in distinction from
the one in heaven.
    5. Where is the only real sanctuary? Heb.
8 : I, 2.
    6. What relation did the worldly sanctuary and
its services sustain to the heavenly? Verse 5.
    7. How many apartments were in the taber-
nacle? Heb. 9:2, 3.
    8. What were the two apartments called?—16.

   12. What was the cover of the ark called?
Heb. 9 : 5; Ex. 25 : 21.
   13. Why was it called the mercy-seat? Ans.—
It was there that mercy was dispensed. The
sanctuary was God's dwelling-place; the ark rep-
resented his throne; and from his throne he dis-
penses grace, or favor-, or mercy. See Heb. 4:16.
   14. How often did the priests go into the sanct-
uary? Heb. 9 : 6.
   15. How often was there service in the most
holy? Verse 7.

  17. What alone is sin? i John 3 :4.
  28. What was the basis of the old covenant?
  19. What, then, was it that made it necessary for
that covenant to have ordinances of divine service
connected with it?
  20. Does the new covenant have ordinances of
divine service? Heb. 9 : i. The word "also" in-
dicates that it had already been shown that the
second covenant had ordinances of divine service.
This was done in chapters 7 and 8.
  21. Then what must be the basis of the second
covenant?
                      NOTES.
  HEBREWS 9: 2 is a text that hinders many from
seeing that all of God's blessings to man are gained
by virtue of the second covenant, and not by the
first. That text reads: " Then verily the first
covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and
a worldly sanctuary." This, together with the
fact that when men complied with these ordinances
of divine service, they were forgiven (Leviticus 4),
seems to some conclusive evidence that the old
covenant contained the gospel and its blessings.
But forgiveness of sins was not secured by virtue of
those offerings; " for it is not possible that the
blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."
Heb. To: 4. Forgiveness was obtained only by
virtue of the promised sacrifice of Christ (Heb. 9:
25), the mediator of the new covenant, their faith
in whom was shown by their offerings. So it was
by virtue of the second or new covenant that par-
don was secured to those who offered the sacrifices
provided for in the ordinances of divine service
connected with the old or first covenant.

  MOREOVER, those "ordinances of divine service"

formed no part of the first covenant. If they had,
they must have been mentioned in the making of
that covenant; but they were not. They were
connected with it, but not a part of it. They were
simply the means by which the people acknowl-
edged the justice of their condemnation to death
for the violation of the law which they had cove-
nanted to keep, and their faith in the Mediator of
the new covenant.

   IN brief, then, God's plan in the salvation of
sinnersc-whether now or in the days of Moses, is:
The law sent home emphatically to the individual,
to produce conviction of sin, and thus to drive the
sinner to seek freedom; then the acceptance of
Christ's gracious invitation, which was extended
long before, but which the sinner would not listen
to; and lastly, having accepted Christ, and being
justified by faith, the manifestation of the faith,
through the ordinances of the gospel, and the
living of a life of righteousness by faith in Christ.

 transgressions committed under that covenant, that
 were pardoned, were pardoned by virtue of the
second covenant, of which Christ is mediator. Yet
 although Christ's blood was not shed until hun-
dreds of years after the first covenant was made,
sins were forgiven whenever they were confessed.
That covenant, as we have seen, was for the
purpose of directing the minds of the people to
the Abrahamic covenant, which God confirmed in
Christ. Gal. 3: 17. This confirmation was by an
oath, in addition to the promise. These " two
immutable things, in which it was impossible for
God to lie," made the sacrifice of Christ as effica-
cious in the days of Abraham and Moses as it is
now. This is made still more evident by the state-
ment that these two things given to Abraham are
the things which give us strong consolation.

 Ex. 24:6, 8.
   18. With what did he sprinkle the blood?
                       NOTES.
  VERSE 15 has a fund of instruction underlying
the first glance at the language. It is made very
sure that Jesus is the Mediator between the people
who lived under the first covenant, and the law
which God proclaimed to them, of which they
28             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

were transgressors. And it is absurd to suppose
that God will judge the family of Adam, moral
agents, by different moral standards. It is the
law given to the Jews, which David says is perfect;
that it is righteousness, etc. It is the same law that
Solomon says contains the whole duty of man, and
by which God will bring every work into judgment.
The commandments given to Israel in the wilder-
ness are the lively oracles which Stephen said
they received to give unto us. Acts 7: 38.

   IN verse 15 is again introduced the contrast
which was so successfully argued in chapter 4.
Though the children of Israel rejoiced that they
had had rest from their wanderings, and that the
Lord had subdued their enemies before them, and
given them homes for themselves and their chil-
dren, they were yet subject to cares, to sickness,
pain, and death. Joshua gave them a temporal
rest. But a greater than Joshua had become the
leader of his people, and the rest that remains is an
eternal inheritance. And God is so wise and mer-
ciful in the provisions of his grace that the faithful
even under the first covenant may share that in-
heritance.

                      NOTES.
  HERE again, in verse 21, is a statement of that
which we do not find in the writings of Moses.
But we learn that the Jews had a tradition that such
was the case, and in this instance their tradition
must have been correct. In the account of the
erection of the tabernacle, and the dedication of
the holy things, it is recorded that they were
anointed with oil, but the sprinkling of blood is
not mentioned. This, however, does not involve
any contradiction.

  THE fact that some things, and in some cases
persons, were purified without blood, as see Num-
bers 19, does not disagree with the reasonable state-
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                31

ment that without shedding of blood is no remis-
sion; for, in cases of purification with oil or water,
there was no sin. There were misfortunes, as in
certain sicknesses, or accidents, fleshly defilements.
But the wages of sin is death, always, and where
the penalty is death nothing but life can meet the
demand of the law. Now as the blood is the life of
man (Deut. 12:23), it is given to make atonement.
Lev. 17:11. The offering of blood for life signi-
fies life for life. Hence the statement that we have
redemption through the blood of Christ. It means
that our lives are purchased with his life. God's
appointments are in strict accord with reason and
justice.

   No objection against the true doctrine of the
atonement is more persistently urged than this,
that there can be nothing in heaven that needs
cleansing. Such pleading for heaven reminds us
of the zeal of Peter in vindicating his Lord. Matt.
16: 21-23. But to prove that the heavenly sanct-
uary does need cleansing, because of our sins
taken by our Priest, and that nothing but the
blood of Christ can cleanse it, is the whole drift of
the apostle's argument. Take away this great
truth, and his labored argument would be without
any logical conclusion. Not only were the earthly
sacrifices typical of Christ's sacrifice, and the
earthly priests typical of his priesthood, but the
earthly sanctuary was typical of the heavenly holy
places. And of course the cleansing of the sanct-,
uary on earth with the blood of bulls and goats
was typical of the purifying of the heavenly things
with better sacrifice. In the whole argument of
 this remarkable letter, nothing is made more plain
 than this.

                      NOTE.
  IT is to be regretted that commentators have so
generally overlooked the true intent of Heb. 9: 28,
and construed it to mean " without a sin-offering."
The original word occurs seventy-three times in the
New Testament, and is rendered " sinful," once;
"offense," once; "sin," seventy-one times. It
34           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

 is never claimed that it can bear the sense of sin-
 offering in the New Testament, except in 2 Cor. 5:
  21, and Heb. 9: 28. And we are very confident
 that it does not in either of these texts. In 2 Cor.
5: 21 the contrast and the force are measurably lost
 by so rendering it. " He hath made him to be sin
 for us, who [himself] knew no. sin." Our iniquity
 was laid upon him; he was bruised for our sakes--
 in our stead. He bore our sin, and suffered as if
 he had actually been the sinner. The Scripture
 doctrine of substitution is entirely too strong and
 clear-to admit of this text being changed into sin-
 offering. In Hebrews 9 there is presented a series
of events, mostly in contrast with the things of the
earthly service, each of which occurs without be-
ing repeated. He offered one sacrifice,' he offered
it but once; he entered once into the heavenly sanct-
uary. Man dies once (therefore there is but one
probationary life); and after this one death, the
judgment. So Christ was once offered to bear sin;
and he will once more (a second time) come, with-
out sin. He was once offered to bear sin; he bore
it on the cross; he bears our judgment—the iniquity
of his priesthood—before the throne. As a priest
he has continually taken sins, except from those
who choose to retain them. But when he comes
again, he will be separated from sin; he will
bear sin no more. As it reads, it signifies that a
his second coming his priesthood, his act -of sin- •
bearing, is forever ended.
   The difference is evident and material. He
might come without a sin-offering, he might not
renew his sacrifice, and yet not make an end of his
priestly service. He has made but .one offering in
more than 1,85o years, and his priesthood has con-
tinued all these centuries by virtue of that one offer-
ing. And it might continue indefinitely, in the
            LETTER TO THE HEBRE,117S.            35
--
same manner, by that one and the same offering.
All these centuries he has been receiving the sins
of penitents. But he comes without sin, separate
or apart from sin, as it really means. This indi-
cates that he will bear sin no more; that he has put
it from him: Then he that is unjust must so re-
main. Rev. 22: 10-12.
   The following remarks from Dr. Barnes on this
text, concerning the coming again of our blessed
Saviour, are interesting:--
   " There is a propriety. that he should thus return.
He came once to be humbled, despised, and put •
to death; and there is a fitness that he should come
to be honored in his own world.
    " Every person on earth is interested in the fact.
that he will return, for ' every eye shall see him.'
 Rev.      7. All who are now in their graves,
all who now live, and all who will hereafter live,
will behold the Redeemer in his glory.
    " It will not be merely to gaze upon him, and to
admire his magnificence, that they will see him. It
will be for greater and more momentous purposes
 —with reference to an eternal doom.
    " The great mass of men are not prepared to
 meet him. They do not believe that he will re-
 turn; they do not desire that he should appear;
 they are not ready for the solemn interview which
..they Aill have with him. His appearing now
 would overwhelm them with surprise and horror.
 There is nothing in the future which they less ex-
 pect and desire than the second coming of the Son
 of God, and in the present state of the world his
 appearance would produce almost universal conster-
 nation and despair. It would be like the coming
  of the flood of waters on the old world; like the
 sheets of flame on Sodom and Gomorrah."

perfect?--7b.
    5. If they could, what would have been the re-

    6. Why would they have ceased to be offered?
Ans.—They would have had the same power as the
offering of Christ, and would not have needed to

    13. Where was it written that he should thus
come? Heb. to : 7. The volume of the book
doubtless refers to the Pentateuch; for the Saviour
said that Moses wrote of him, 'and that all things
written in the law of Moses concerning him must
be fulfilled. John 5 : 46; Luke 24 : 44.

God in the verse from which this is quoted? Ps.

    17. Is the law the will of God? Ans.—There is

 accomplish this, if the law were not in his own

   VERSE 9 has also been obscured by the unwar-
 ranted additions of theologians, who have put their
38           LETTER TO THE HEBREIvs.

theories into their translations. In a certain trans-
lation of the New Testament, of high pretensions,
it is made to read, "He taketh away the first will
that he may establish the second." But there are
no.two wills spoken. of in the text. The rendering
is Intended to be equivalent to this: He taketh
away the first covenant, that he may establish the
second. No one is warranted in putting an idea
into a text which is not written in the text, merely
because the idea may be true. That construction
is altogether foreign to the apostle's train of reason-
ing. There is a contrast presented throughout in
verses 5-9, as follows:—
   I. "Sacrifice and offering thou didst not de-
sire." 2. " I come to do thy will."
   He takes away the first, that he may establish
the second. In this is found the only contrast in
the argument, and it is made very prominent.
The sacrifices and offerings of the Mosaic law
could not perfect the conscience, could not reform
the life, could not write the law of God in the heart.
These are taken away, that he may come in whose
heart is the law, and who alone can fulfill the
promise of the new covenant.

    25. What is that way?—./b. See note.
                       NOTES.
    BY 2 Tim. 3:16, 17 we learn that all truth is
profitable, but truths are not all of the same nat-
ure, and are not all equally profitable. Some
truths are firimary; some are secondary. In James
2 : 19 we are told that we do well if we believe that
there is one God; that is a very important truth,
which, unfortunately, some nations of the earth
have entirely forgotten. But it does not call for
obedience—nobody can obey an abstract statement
of that kind. It only calls for belief. And the
demons believe it, and they remain demons still,
even though they tremble before that truth. They
are not sanctified by their belief, because it works
no change of character; it is dead. But he who
does the will of that one God is sanctified thereby,
           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                 41

because he thereby forms a character in harmony
with that will. While the law of God is that pri-
mary truth, which directly sanctifies, other truth is
secondary; it can only work indirectly in our sanc-
tification. But it leads toward sanctification, even
indirectly, only when it leads us toward the law—
to the way of obedience.

   WE could be sanctified by obedience to the law
if we had never forfeited our justification and de-
stroyed our ability by disobedience. Instead of
now being justified by the law, we already stand
condemned, for we have all disobeyed it. Rom.
3: 9, 19, 23. Sin has perverted our natures, so that
alone we can do nothing. John 15:5. But that
does not destroy the fact that the law is perfect,
and is justifying in its nature. That the law can-
not justify us is not the fault of the law—it is our
own fault. The law did not fall in the fall of man;
 the law does not become sin because we sin. Rom.
7: 7-14. The law is the measure and rule of the
 righteousness of God; it witnesses to that right-
 eousness. Rom. 3: 21. By our fall we are far be-
 low the.righteousness of the law, and we are now
 dependent upon another to raise us up to where its
 righteousness may be fulfilled in us. Roni. 8: 4.

   THERE is a fund of instruction in this expression
in Heb. TO: 20, It is not a " way of life," as some
have construed it, but a way ever new, ever living.
Our sacrifice is alive forever, and his blood is ever
fresh, precious, incorruptible. I Peter 1:18, 19.
This great truth is denied by the Catholics by their
doctrine of transubstantiation. They affirm that
there is no sacrifice now available for man, except
upon their altars, where the wafer and wine are
turned into the actual body and blood of Christ.
 In that doctrine the sacrifice of Christ is riot even
42         LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

new, but needs ever to be renewed; the body and
blood need a constant re-creating. By it the con-
trast between the daily offerings of the old law,
and the one offering of Christ, is utterly destroyed.

44         LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

                       NOTE.
   MANY people mistake strong feeling for an as-
surance of faith, though they are essentially differ-
ent. Strong feeling may be an accompaniment of
faith, though it is not faith itself. And many sup-
pose that there can be no faith without a happy
state of feeling, which is a great mistake. Paul
had great faith, though circumstances caused him
to have great heaviness and continual sorrow of
heart. Rom. 9: 2. Compare Isa. 50: ro; Matt.
5:4. Faith rests entirely upon the word of God,
but feeling is often the outgrowth of impressions,
produced in various ways. Self-complacency, deep
satisfaction over one's own experience, is very often
mistaken for assurance of faith, while, oftentimes,
the individual has no faith at all—no clear concep-
tion of the teachings of God's word. Full assur-
ance of genuine faith is unwavering confidence in
God, with knowledge of his word and implicit be-
lief of the word. The clearer the word is to our
understanding, the better is the chance for full as,
surance of faith; for how can we have faith in that
of which we are ignorant? The mystical system
of interpreting the Scriptures, by which they are
made to mean anything that can be imagined, pre-
cludes faith. Under that system the mind is filled
only with fancies, while faith is something substan-
tial. This subject is fully considered in the next
chapter.
