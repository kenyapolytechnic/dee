   NOTE.—Belshazzar, or Belsharussur (Bel protects
the king), was a son of Nabonadius. Nabonadius,
formerly a Chaldean noble, reigned during the last
seventeen years of the Babylonian Empire. By
some it is supposed that Belshazzar is called the
son of Nebuchadnezzar by virtue of being his suc-
cessor; by others, Nabonadius, his father, is supposed
to have married the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar.
This latter supposition would make Nebuchadnezzar
the grandfather of Belshazz ir, •and this is probably
correct. When Cyrus began the siege of Babylon,
Nabonadius advanced to meet him; he was defeated
by Cyrus and retired to Borsippa, leaving Belshaz-
zar, whom he had associated with him on the throne,
in command at Babylon, and sole ruler of the city
when it fell, in 538 B. C. See ".Manual of Ancient
History of the East," by Lenormant, vol. i, pp.
488-490, and " Seven Great Monarchies," vol. 2,
P. 255.

   19. Between what years was this division of the

A. D. 351 and A. D. 476.

   NOTE. -It is clear that, if the four beasts rep-
resent four kingdoms, and the fourth beast stands
for the fourth great kingdom, each of the three
preceding beasts must represent successive king-
doms in the order in which the symbols are given.
Hence the third beast would stand for the third
kingdom, and so on to the first. The first great
empire being Babylon, it was symbolized by the
lion. The second beast, which was like a bear,
must indicate Medo-Persia; and the third, •or leop-
ard-beast, Grecia.

  22. What will destroy the Papacy? 2 Thess. 2:8.

   NOTE A.—About A. D. 476, the time when the
division of the Roman Empire was completed by
the establishment of the ten horns, a pretentious
power was noticed, seeking acknowledgment of
its claims. As early as the beginning of the sixth
century, the bishops of Rome had become power-
ful enough to exert considerable of that influence
at the imperial court, which was erelong to exalt
them to that station where they could command
the kings of the earth. There was only one hin-
drance to their supremacy, the opposition of the
Arian powers to the doctrines of the Catholics, es-
pecially to that of the Trinity. These opposing
powers were rooted up, the Heruli in 493, the Van-
dals in 534, and the Ostrogoths in 338. See "Stu-
dent's Gibbon," pp. 309-319.

   NOTE B.—The pope calls himself " The Vicar
of Christ." Leo X. blasphemously styled himself,
"The Lion of the tribe of Judah;" Leo X11. al-
lowed himself to be called " The Lord our God,"
and Pope Martin V. called himself, " The most
holy and most happy, who is the arbiter of Heaven
and the Lord of earth, the successor of St.
Peter, the anointed of the Lord, the Master of the
universe," etc. The following is quoted from W.
E. Gladstone, in the " Vatican Council," page 201 ,
as a portion of the infallibility dogma:-:--
   "All the faithful of Christ must believe that the
holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff possess
the primacy over the whole world, and that the
Roman pontiff is the successor of the bleised Peter,
 prince of the apostles, and. is true vicar of Christ,
and head of the whole church, and father and
teacher of all Christians."

  NOTE C.-A million of Waldenses perished
in France. Nine hundred thousand orthodox
a                    PROPHECY.

Christians were slain in less than thirty years after
the institution of the order of the Jesuits. The
duke of Alvah put to death, in the Netherlands,
36,000 in the space of a few years. The Inquisi-
tion destroyed by various tortures, 15,000 within
thirty years. These are a few specimens out of the
many which might be quoted from history, of the
work of this power against the saints. For further
evidence, one may read "Buck's Theological Dic-
tionary," article " Persecution," Dowling's "Ro-
manism," Charlotte Elizabeth's " Martyrology,"
" Wars of the Huguenots," etc.

   NOTE D.—The Papacy has changed the observ-
ance of the fourth commandment, as far as in its
power, in order to follow its pagan ancestors in
their dedication of a day to the worship of the sun:
In a work called "The Sure Way to Find Out the
True Religion," we read:—
  " The keeping holy the Sunday is a thing ab-
solutely necessary to salvation. And yet this is
nowhere laid down in the Bible. On the contrary,
the Bible says, ' Remember the Sabbath-day, to
keep it holy' (Ex. 20: 8), which is Saturday, and
not Sunday." For further evidence, see Catholic
catechisms, also " Plain Talks about the ProteSt-
antism of To-day," page 213.

  NOTE E.—In February, 1798, General Berthier
entered Rome at the head of a French army, took
Pope Pius VI. prisoner, and established a republic
in Rome. The pope died in exile the following
year, and for two years there was no pope. See
Chambers' Cyclopedia, article " Pius."

  NOTE F.—"In September, 187o, Rome, no
longer supported by the French, who had been de-
feated by the Germans, surrendered to Victor Em-
manuel, and the possession of the pope's dominion
was formally taken, October 2, 1870.—Chambers'
Cyclopedia, article "Italy."

resents a church. Eze. 23:2-4;; Rev. 17:3-6.

   NOTE B.—The original word from which
 "dragon" is derived, as used in the Old Testa-
ment, is applied to any savage beast which preys
on other living creatures. See Jer. 14:6; 9 : 1.
It was applied to Pharaoh, because he, like a wild
beast, tried to devour God's people. Eze. 29: 3.
This is the sense in which the word occurs in Rev.
13:11. While the two-horned beast appears to be
a gentle, lamb-like creature, he has the spirit which
finally causes him to speak and act like a dra
or devouring beast. This symbol, then, has al-
ways fitly represented Satan, who, from the first,
hated the Son of God, and was cast out from his
presence, and who, finding himself shut away from
Christ, persecuted, through his agents, the church,
in all its stages of existence. The Roman power
was his agent, at the opening of the Chrikian era.
Others may do the work of the dragon in succeed- •
ing ages, as it is he who is said to make war with
the remnant of the woman's seed.

  NOTE C.--Forty-two months are three and one-
half years, or, at thirty days to the month (compare
Gen. • 7 : it and 8: 4, also 8: 3), 1,260 days (years),
being the same as the time, times, and a half of
Dan. 7:25 and Rev. 12:14, 6.

   NOTE D. No power but the Papacy has ever
existed which could fulfill the specifications of the
prophecy. Other persecuting powers have ex-
isted, but none of these met the demands of the
symbols used, either in the methods of their work
or the time of their continuance.

   NOTE E.—In February, 1798, the French army,
under General Berthier, entered Rome, proclaimed
it a republic, and carried Pope Pius VI. a captive

to France, exhibiting him fron place td place, un-
til he died, in August of the following year.

   NOTE A.—In the time of Constantine, the bish-
ops of the church became worldly-minded, and, in-
stead of caring for the salvation of their flocks,
were often too much inclined to entangle themselves
in secular. concerns. They held what was called
the theocratical theory, which means that God
directly rules in the nations of the earth. This be-
lief made them quite willing to allow the emperor
to dictate in matters concerning the church, and
the bishops "voluntarily made themselves depend-
ent on him by their disputes, and by their deter-
mination to make use of the power of the State for
the furtherance of their aims." See "Neander's
History of the Christian Religion and Church,"
vol. 2, pp. 16 and 132.
   NOTE B.—"The question relating to the observ-
ance of Easter, which was agitated in the time of
Anicetus and Polycarp, and afterward in that of
Victor, was still undecided. It was one of the prin-
cipal reasons for convoking the Council of Nice,
being the most important subject to be considered,
after the Arian controversy."—Boyle' s Historical
 View of the Council of Nice, p. 2, ed. 1839.
  NOTE C. —" It appears that the churches of
Syria and •Mesopotamia continued to' follow the
custom of the Jews, and celebrated Easter on the
14th day of the moon, whether falling on Sunday
                     PROPHECY.                    1.3
or not. All the other churches observed that so-
lemnity on Sunday only, viz., those of Rome, Italy,
Africa, Lydia, Egypt, Spain, Gaul, and Britain."
—Boyle' s Council of Nice, fi. 22.

   NOTE D.—"Easter day was fixed on Sunday
immediately following the new moon which was
nearest after the vernal equinox."--Boy/e' s Coun-
cil of Nice, j5. 23.

power?
    2. What was the nature of the power, as repre-
sented by the preceding beast?
    3. By what means did that power enforce its
decrees? Ans.—The church used the civil power
for the propagation of its dogmas.
    4. If the two-horned beast makes an image to
the preceding one, then what will it do? Ans.—
It will have the church dominate the State, and em-
ploy the civil power to enforce its dogmas.
    5. Is there any prospect of the. United States
doing such a work? Ans.—Already an influential
organization, called the National Reform Associa-
tion,has succeeded in having bills brought before the
National Congress, which, if passed, will secure
that result.
    6. On what theory does this organization base
its work? Ans.—" Every government, by equit-
able laws,. is a government of God; a republic thus

theocracy as the commonwealth of Israel."—Res-
olution in Cincinnati National Reform Convention.

demand of the, government? Ans.—To stop all
Sunday trains, discontinue all Sunday papers, and
prohibit all manner of Sunday labor, so that'their
  devotions may not be hindered."
    9. Why do these people wish to compel others
to keep Sunday? Ans.—Because "he who does
not keep the Sabbath (Sunday) does not worship
God."—Elgin Sunday Convention, November,

  NOTE A.—" To secure such an amendment to
the Constitution of the United States as shall suit-
ably express our national acknowledgment of Al-
mighty God as the source of all authority in civil'
government; of the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler,
of nations; and, of his revealed will as of supreme
authority, and thus indicate that this is a Christian
nation, and place all the Christian laws, institutions,
and usages of the government on an undeniably
legal basis in the fundamental law of the land."—
Art. 2 of National Reform Constitution.

   NOTE B.--" Let a man be what he may, Jew,
seventh-day observer, or some other denomina-
tion, or those who do not believe in the Christian
Sabbath--let the law apply to everyone, that there
shall be no public desecration of the first day of
the week, the Christian Sabbath, the day of rest for
the nation. They may hold any other day of the
week as sacred, and observe it, but that day which
is the one day in seven for the nation at large, let
that not be publicly desecrated by anyone, by of-
ficer in the government, or by private citizen, high
or low, rich or poor."—Dr. McAllister, editor
Christian Statesman.

   NOTE C.-At the Lakeside National Reform
Convention of 1887, one said during the discussion
of the Sunday-law question, " There is a law in
the State of Arkansas enforcing Sunday observance
upon the people, and the result has been that
many good persons have not only been impris-
oned, but have lost their property and their lives."
To this Dr. McAllister replied, " It is better that a
few should suffer than the whole nation should lose
its Sabbath."

    6. If those who keep all of God's command-
ments, escape the worship and mark of the beast,
then what position may be safely taken, as regards
the nature of that worship and mark? See note.
    7. How many are said to worship the beast?
Rev. 13:8.
    8. In connection with the proclamation of the
Third Angel's Message, what did the prophet see?
Rev. 14:14.
    9. What was he to do with the sickle? Verse
16.
   10. What is the reaping or harvest-time else-
where called? Matt. 13: 39.,

12: 17.
  12. Where will they finally appear? Rev. 15: 2.
  13. What do they have in their foreheads?

their foreheads? Rev. 7: 3, 4.
  15. What is said of the song these sing on Mt.
Zion? Rev. 14: 3.
  16. From whence were they redeemed? Verse 4.
  17. What is said of their character? Verse 5.

  NoTE.—If the Third Angel's Message declares:,
those to be saints who keep the commandments of
God, and denounces unsparingly those who worship
the beast and his image, and hold his mark, it fol-
lows that the worship and mark of the beast are in
opposition to those commandments. Each persecut-
ing power of the past has in some measure been
an idolatrous nation. Even though some of them
may have acknowledged, in words, the God of the
Bible, their worship has embraced those forms
which originated in heathen mythology. It is the
same in the United States. While most of the peo-
ple acknowledge God in words, they persist in
maintaining a day of worship which originated in
the heathen custom of worshiping the sun as a god.
