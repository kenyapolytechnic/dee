              Intro ductory Note.
  THE student xvill find many texts and suggestions in the
notes to these lessons that are not directly brought out
in the questions, which will furnish material aid in the
preparation of the lessons. Let him first go through
the lesson, looking up and reading carefully each text
that is referred 10. Read the context in each instance,
and look up any passages of Scripture that may occur to
your mind as bearing on the same point. Do not mak
any special attempt at this time to trace the connection
of the various texts cited as answers to the questions, but
endeavor to get a good idea of each individual text.
Then read the notes carefully. Go through the lesson
again in the same way, only before turning to the texts
cited, see if you can recall the substance of them, and read
each text over slowly and carefully at least six times.
When you know what each text contains, and can recall
it by the question and the reference, go over the . lesson
again, trying to note the object of each question, and
the connection of the various texts. A lesson learned in
this way will prove a blessing to the student long after it
has been recited. The teacher should frame his extra
questions with reference to the notes.

               JE SON XXV11.
                     APRIL 5, 1890.
              HEBREWS 1o: 23-29.

    i. To what are we exhorted to hold fast? Heb.
to:23.
    2. What incentive have we for holding fast our
profession?—Ib.
    3. For what must we consider one another?
Verse 24.
    4. What should we not do? Verse 25, first part.
    5. While holding fast and meeting together,
what should we do?—Ib., last part.
    6. What promise is given to those who do thus?
Mal. 3: 16, 17.
    7. What hope is there for those who sin willfully
in the full light of truth? Heb. to : 26.

27.
    9. Are there any in the world who have not
sinned? Rom. 3: 9-125 23.
   10. Have they had sufficient light so that they

ing out of this rule? Num. 15: 32-36.
   15. Of what kind of sin was this an example?
Verses 30, 31.
   16. What led that man to do as he did? Ver4b
31, first part. His act was the result of contempt
for the law and the Lawgiver. It was a deliberate
insult to the Lord; a defying of his authority.
   17. Why could he not have forgiveness? Ans.
—Because he despised the law and its Maker, and
cut himself off from the source of forgiveness.
   18. What is the nature of the willful sin against
which the apostle warns? Heb. to: 29.
   19. What is the only hope of salvation for men?
Acts 4:12.
   zo. Then how can there be forgiveness for one
who deliberately turns from Christ, spurning him
with contempt, and counting his precious blood as
a common thing?
                       NOTES.
   " NOT forsaking the assembling of ourselves to-
gether, . . . but exhorting one another." Here
is undoubted reference to church gatherings for
mutual encouragement. The prayer and social
meeting is a means of grace which no one can
neglect except at the loss of spirituality. Since the
words of the apostle were inspired by the Holy
Spirit, we have here a divine injunction to assem-
ble for exhortation and prayer. To attend the
prayer-meeting and to take part in the service, is
a duty which everyone who joins the church of
Christ takes upon himself. The one who neglects
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                  5
this duty is unfaithful to his church vow's. It may
be noted here, for the encouragement of some and
for the instruction of others, that the best exhorta-
tion that can be given is a humble, grateful testi-
mony of praise to God for his goodness, and of
trust in his mercy.

   IT seems evident, however, from what follows,
that the apostle had more in mind than simply the
prayer-meeting, and that his language comprehends
the entire church as a body of believers. The ex-
hortation not to forsake the assembling of ourselves
together is really an exhortation against apostatiz-
ing. To forsake the assembling of ourselves to-
gether is a mark of indifference. So closely is the
assembling of Christians associated with the profes-
sion of Christianity, that one who willfully neglects
the one, inevitably gives up the other. The mem-
bers of the church are members 'of one body; and
when they cease to be as perfectly joined together
as are the members of the human body, they cease
to live.

   " IF we sin willfully after that we have received
the knowledge of the truth," etc. This language
has often been grievously misapplied, and has been
the means of discouraging people for whom there
was hope. It is a terrible mistake to apply it to
those to whom we have been presenting what we
see to be truth, and to which they assent, but
which they do not give evidence of intending to
obey. It is not for us to judge. We cannot know
the nature of the soil into which the truth has fallen,
and we cannot tell how long it may take for it to
take root and bear fruit. Neither should we say
that there is no hope for the professed Chris-
tian who falls into error. Our God is a God that
 " pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgres-
6            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

sion of th'e remnant of his heritage; he retaineth
not his anger forever, because he delighteth in
mercy." Micah 7: z8.

   THE twenty-sixth verse should be read in the
light of verse twenty-nine. The sin of which the
apostle speaks is the sin of one who deliberately
turns his back upon the assembly of God's people,
and not only sins, but despises the Saviour of sin-
ners/trampling him under foot, and counting his
blood as unholy and worthless. He not only de-
fies God's law, but he spurns his offer of pardon.
What greater insult could be offered to God? P For
such an one there can be no hope, because he re-
jects the only source of hope. ,

   NOTE the force of the language of verse 26, as
addressed to the Hebrews, in view of what has
gone before. /The apostle has demonstrated that
the sacrifices of the earthly sanctuary.never had any
virtue to cleanse from sin, but that they typified the
one sacrifice of Christ, and that even the shadow
has now passed away, since Christ has suffered
once for all. He is the only sacrifice for sin; there-
fore if one rejects him there is no hope.

                       NOTES.
 THIS lesson should be considered in connection
with the preceding one. After going through with
8            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


this; a general view of the subject should be taken,
from the beginning of the preceding lesson, observ-
ing the fact that judgment is never visited upon a
person unless he has brought it upon himself, and
that in the midst of wrath God remembers mercy.

   "GOD is love." This attribute is inseparable from
his character. His law, which is the transcript of
his character, is a law of love, and it was given in
love. Deut. 33: 1-3. The love of God is a living,
moving rock of adamant. Those who despise it
and oppose it are crushed by it, while those who
place themselves upon it, find it a sure and safe
refuge from all evil. Government exists for the
benefit of the subjects. Those who would impeach
God's love and kindness, because he punishes
rebels, would have him ignore the loyal subjects,
and administer his government with reference
solely to the benefit of rebels. Rebellion sets gov-
ernment at defiance, and endangers the welfare
of those who are loyal. When men despise God
and his law, and also his mercy:they
                                  ,      declare them-
selves not his subjects, and it is but a manifestation
of his love to those who trust him when God removes
the dangerous element from his kingdom. How
much better to place ourselves in the hands of God
than to fall into them in a vain attempt to escape
from him!

                         NOTES.
   IN studying the tenth chapter of Hebrews we
shall better keep the thread of the apostle's dis-
course if we consider verses 26-31 as parenthetical,
and connect verse 32 with verse 25. The apostle
urges the Hebrews, and us as well, to be diligent in
attending the assemblies of the saints, and not to
forsake them and turn back, but rather to call to
remembrance their former experience, when their
afflictions and persecutions proved to them the
power of Christ and the reality of the gospel.
Verses 26-31 are thrown in after the exhortation in
verse 25, to show the terrible results of apostasy.

   THE teacher and pupil may extend the study of
the subject of confidence at their pleasure. They
will find themselves well repaid for their time.
Few professed Christians realize the necessity of
confidence; of knowing whom they have believed.
2 Tim. I :12. Some people seem to think that it
is a virtue—a sign of humility—to doubt their ac-
ceptance with God, and to talk about the difficul-
ties in the way. They think that it would savor of
presumption to say that they can overcome and
have an abundant entrance into the kingdom of
God. Let such learn a lesson from `the twelve
spies. The unbelieving ones, who said, " We be
not able to go up against the people," did not go,
up; but the two who said, " We are well able to
overcome it," did go up. It was not presumption
in Caleb and Joshua to talk as they did, but it was
faith in God. All were rewarded according to
their faith, or the absence of it. The soul whose
trust is wholly in God cannot have too strong con-
fidence.
     " The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
       I will not, I will not desert to its foes;
       That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
       I'll never, no, never, no, never, forsake."

     THE writer of Hebrews in chapter to: 37, 38
   quotes from Hab. 2: 3, 4, who is speaking pro-
   phetically to the people living in the last days.
   The book of Hebrews, like a great part of the Bible,
   was written not simply to those who lived in the
   writer's day, but for all time until Christ should
   come. Prophecy is given as a light " until the day
   dawn." 2 Peter I : 19. While the practical teach-
, ing connected therewith would be always applicable,
   the entire scope of the _prophecy 'would only he
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS:                 13

met when that generation was reached to which it
applied, and whose dangers, needs, and experi-
ences accorded with the warnings and predictions.
The book of Hebrews is of especial interest to those
living in the last days. In the light which shines
upon the sanctuary question, it can now be under-
stood and appreciated; and • to the people who
Understand this it is true that " in a little while he
that shall come will come and will not tarry."
That Paul did not believe that Christ's coming was
imminent in his day is shown by 2 Thess. 2:1-3,
and yet he speaks in the, first epistle as though it
was near at hand._ See Thess. 1: Jo; 4:13-17;
5: 23. Those who were instructed as to the times
and seasons, who heeded the prophetic portion of
the word of God and the apostolic injunction, would
not be deceived in this respect. Again, the same
God who gave that word still lives, and his faithful
servants, of whom there heave always been some,
always have and will bring forth the " meat in due
season" to the household of faith. Matt. 13: 52;
24:45. When the time comes that the word is due,
God Will see that it is given.

   " Now the just shall live by faith." Some have
erroneously read this as though the first word were
the most prominent in the sentence, and that the
apostle refers to some special time when the just
shall live by faith. The word from which " now "
is rendered in this instance is not an adverb at all,
and is never used with any reference whatever to
time., It is a conjunctive participle, having the force
of moreover, nevertheless, besides, etc. It is often
used, as in this instance, to introduce an additional
thought. Such expressions are very common in
the English. For an instance, see Ex. 16:36.
Since the days of Adam there has not been a time
when the just could live in any other way than by
faith: -        --
14          LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

   FAITH requires no evidence but the simple prom-
ise of God. Its confidence in God is such that-it
grasps the promises and makes them real. Know-
ing that nothing is too hard for the Lord, and
that he cannot lie, it cannot do anything else but
believe, as Chrysostom says, " Since what God
giveth transcends reason entirely, it is but reason
that we have faith." God promises forgiveness of
sins to those who believe. If we believe, our sins
are forgiven; if we do not, they are not. Thus it
is faith that takes the promises of God, and trans-
forms them into facts.

   23. And what did he get besides the saving of

                        NOTES.
  " BY it the elders obtained a good report." The
word " elders " does not in this instance refer to a
particular office, but to those who lived "in that
elder day," in the olden time—the ancients. This
18            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

is shown by the citations which follow, all taken
from the men of old.

   THE Revised Version says that they " have wit-
ness borne to them?" This is an exact rendering of
the Greek. What this good report or witness was
is shown especially in verses four and five. Abel
obtained witness that he was righteous, and Enoch
obtained the testimony that he pleased God.

   " THROUGH faith we understand that the worlds
 were framed by the word of God, so that things
which are seen were not made of things which do
appear." There is no other way by which we can
know anything about creation; for reason cannot
grasp the idea of something brought from nothing.
So-called scientific speculation concerning the ori-
gin of things always proceeds on the basis of some-
thing already existing, from which other things
were evolved. How the first matter came into ex-
istence science cannot tell. Therefore since reason
cannot settle the method by which the worlds came
into existence, the most reasonable thing to do is
to accept the inspired declaration that it was by the
word of God. And this lies at the very foundation
of faith. If we believe that God created the uni-
verse from nothing, we can believe that he has
power to make something to his own glory out of
us, who are " less than nothing and vanity." And
so, in a discourse upon faith, it is eminently fitting
that the power of God as manifested in creation
should be the starting-point.

  DR. MACKNIGHT has the following thoughtful
comment on Heb. II: 3:—
     The account of the origin of-things given by
revelation, is very different from the cosmogony of
the, heathen philosophers, who generally held that_
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                17
   --
the matter of which the worlds are composed is un-
created and eternal; consequently, being independ-
ent of God, and not obedient to his will, they sup-
posed it to be the occasion of all the evil that is
the world. But revelation, which teaches us that
the things which are seen were not made of the
matter which did appear before they were made, but
of matter which God then brought into existence,
by thus establishing the sovereignty of God over
matter, hath enlarged our ideas of his power, and
strengthened our faith in his promises concerning
the felicity of good men in the life to come. For
the creation of the new heavens and the new earth,
and the glories of the city of the living God, do not
to their formation require more power than the
creation of the present universe; and therefore if
we believe that the worlds were framed by the word
of God from nothing, every other exercise of faith
will be easy for us."

   NOTICE the completeness and the simplicity of
the apostle's argument to prove his statement that
Enoch was translated by faith. He was translated
because he pleased God. He walked with God.
But without faith it is impossible to please God.
Therefore since Enoch did please God, and was
translated in consequence, it follows that he was
translated through faith.

   " HE that cometh to God must believe that he
is." To believe that God is, we must believe that he
is just what the Bible says he is. If we have any
notions of our own concerning God, then the god
whom•we worship is not the true God, but a god
of our making. To believe that God is just what
he is, as he has revealed himself to us in nature
and revelation, is the very foundation of faith. He
who thinks of God as he is, who has a just concep-
18           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

tion of his power, his glory, and his love, cannot
help having faith. Therefore " acquaint now thy-
self with him and be at peace; " for " being justified
by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ."

   " OUT of weakness were made strong." There
is no expression in the Bible that contains more of
encouragement than this. It brings us face to face
with the wonderful power of God. In this we see
the importance of meditating upon the Lord's
creative power, as an aid to faith. God could
make the universe from nothing. So great is his
power- that he takes " things which are not, to
bring to naught things that are." i Cor. 1:27,
28. Our very weakness may in his hands become
the source of our greatest strength. The fiercest
persecutor of the church became the greatest apos-
tle. Thus, instead of spending time bewailing our
weakness, let us commit the keeping of our souls
to God, as unto a faithful Creator (I Peter 4:19),
knowing that in his hands our weakness will be
transformed into " all might, according to his glo-
rious power.'

   " WHEREFORE seeing we also are compassed
about with so great a cloud of witnesses," etc. The
word rendered " witnesses " is the word marlyros,
" martyrs," signifying, in the singular, a witness;
one who bears testimony." It is never used in the
sense of " viewing," but always of one who gives
evidence. Those who suffered for the cause of
truth were called martyrs because they bore wit-
ness with their blood to the truth which they held.
So Christ is said by the apostle Paul to have " wit-
nessed a good confession ' before Pontius Pilate.

to prove that all the ancient worthies are looking

position does violence to the text, besides contra-
dicting scriptures which teach that the dead know

us; but they have by their lives borne a good testi-
mony to the power of faith; and of this testimony
there is an abundance. Seeing, then, that there is
so much unimpeachable testimony, we ought not
to doubt.
  There is another truth which may be suggested
by this text, and that is that God, Christ, and the
angels are intently watching us in our struggle, and
that the record they bear will testify for or against
us in the Judgment. This also should serve as a
spur and incentive to us to press forward.

    " WHO for the joy that was set before him en-
dured the cross, despising the shame." Phil. 2:
5-8, which is referred to in this connection, reads as
follows, according to the Revised Version: " Have
this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus;
who, being in the form of God [Greek, "originally
with God," compare John i : iJ, counted it not
a prize to be on an equality with God, but emp-
tied himself, taking the form of a servant, being
made in the likeness of men; and being found in.,
fashion as a man,he humbled himself, becoming obe-
dient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross."
The joy that was set before Jesus was the salvation
of souls. When he sees the travail of his soul, that
is, the result of the travail of his soul, he will be sat-
isfied. It was not for any personal good that he
could gain that he suffered; for he had all heaven
already. Equal with the Father, having life in
himself, the creator and upholder of the universe,
receiving the adoration of the highest angels, there
was nothing that could be added to him. But when
he saw mankind in sin and suffering, doomed to
eternal death, he did not account his lofty place in
heaven a thing to be desired. So great was his
love for fallen humanity, that he could not enjoy
heaven till he had rescued from perdition all who
would receive his kind offices, So he "emptied
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.              27-

himself,"—laid aside his joy,—that he might have
the (to him) greater pleasure of saving sinners.
Surely it is worth while to consider him. If we
would continually look upon him, viewing him in
his true character, who could become weary and
discouraged? Such love as that, combined with
divine power, will surely be sufficient to make us
" more than conquerors."

  "AND make straight [even] paths for our feet."
This must mean the removing of those obstacles
that would hinder us in running. The weights that
hold us back are, by a sli ht change in the figure,
considered as things lying in the path. This is
done in order that the thought may be impressed
that the things which hinder us in the race hinder
others also. The things which weigh us down in
the Christian race are stumbling-blocks to others.
And since no man liveth to himself, we should re-
move them, not alone on our own account, but in
order that feeble ones may not be turned out of the
way by them.

                       NOTES.
   " FOLLOW peace with all men, and holiness."
The word rendered " follow " is di5ko, meaning to
pursue, chase, hunt, as for beasts. As hunters dis-
play the utmost eagerness in pursuing their prey,
so we are exhorted to pursue peace and holiness.

   " LOOKING diligently . . . lest any root of bit-
terness springing up trouble you, and thereby many
be defiled." Simon the sorcererwas said by Peter to
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

be "in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iti-
iquity." And in Deut. 29:15-18 apostasy and
idolatry are called a " root that beareth gall and
wormwood." Hence we are justified in conclud-
ing that it means sin. The contaminating character
of sin is here brought to view. If the poisonous
herb springs up, it will defile all around it.

   " LEST there be any fornicator, or profane per-
son, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his
birthright." We do not read that Esau was a for-
nicator, and the text does not necessarily imply
that he was. The warning is against fornicators or
profane persons such as Esau. That Esau was a
profane person, a scorner,a rejecter of the faith of his
father, will be apparent to one who closely studies
the record in Genesis. The birthright carried with
it the blessings to Abraham and Isaac. The prom-
ises to Abraham were to be perpetuated through
the first-born, or the one who had the birthright.
These promises, as we have learned, were not tem-
poral, but eternal. The patriarchs looked to the
future life for their fulfillment. Their hope was in
the resurrection. Esau showed that he did not
possess this hope, and that he looked with con-
tempt upon the promised inheritance. Coming in
from the chase, faint and weary, he asked Jacob for
the food he was preparing. Jacob asked for the
birthright in return for the food, and Esau said,
 " Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit
shall this birthright do to me?" Gen. 25:32. When
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob came to die, their faith
was unshaken; they were sure that the promise
would be fulfilled, even though it was " afar off"
when they were " at the point to die." But Esau
did not believe in the resurrection; he scoffed at
the idea that the inheritance would be of any profit
to him, unless he received it before he died. And
SO           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

so, because he had no faith in God or his word, he
despised his birthright.

   "HE found no place of repentance," for the sim-
ple reason that having made a deliberate sale of his
birthright, he could not back out from the trade.
We need not necessarily conclude from this that
he had committed the unpardonable sin. He had
shown his infidelity, in selling his birthright, and
could not by any means be the one through whom
the promises were to descend; but we cannot de-
termine whether his infidelity was so deliberate and
persistent that he could not even have a share in
the blessing. It is not important that we should
know this. What we do learn is that it is impos-
sible to barter the blessings of Heaven for the en-
joyments of this life, and then have those blessings
besides.

  THE terrible phenomena that accompanied the
giving of the law, indicated the majesty and the
inflexibility of that law, which could not spare an
offender. The terror which struck the hearts of
the people was some of the same terror which the
wicked will feel when they are brought face to
face with that law, as it shines forth from heaven at
the last day. They literally could not endure that
which was spoken. They could not approach the
mount, because the law was there in its awful
majesty, and it cannot spare the guilty. In the
giving of the law we have a vivid representation of
the fact that "by the deeds of the law there shall
no flesh be justified." We are not come .to Mt.
Sinai, that is, to the law from Sinai, to find our
inheritance, because the inheritance is not of the
law, but of promise (Rom. 4:13-15; Gal. 3:18);
the inheritance is for the righteous, and righteous-
ness does not come by the law (Gal. 2: 21), but by
the faith of Jesus Christ (Rom. 3: 2 2 ; Phil. 3: 9).

   "-BUT ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company [myriads] of angels,
to the general assembly and church of the first-born,
which are written [margin, " enrolled"] in heaven,
and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator
of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprink-
ling that speaketh better things than that of Abel."
Heb. 12: 22-24.

    LET us note each of these cases, to see what
scene we have presented here before us. The
 Mount Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem; is the city of
 the living God,—the place where God sits as judge
 of all. In the temple in that holy city, he sits
 upon his throne, between the cherubim. Around
about the throne are ten thousand-times ten thou-
 sand, and thousands of thousands of angels. Rev.
'5: It. These are in the temple in heaven—in the
 heavenly sanctuary In that sanctuary, where God
sits in judgment, are the b )oks of record and the book
 of life, in which are written the names of the gen-
 eral assembly and church of Christ, the first-born.
 Around the throne are the elders,—men who have
 been redeemed unto God "out of every kindred,
and tongue, and people, and nation;" and who,
             LTITTSIZ TO TILE HEBREWS.            33

having been raised from the dead at the crucifix-
ion of Christ (Matt. 27: 50-53), were led by him
from captivity to heaven, when he ascended to the
Father (Eph. 4: 8), and were made unto God
kings and priests (Rev. 5:9, io). These repre-
sentatives of the human family are assistants of
Christ in his priestly work as mediator of the new
covenant. Thus we have in these verses a view
of the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ ministers
in behalf of sinners, with his own blood. Now we
can see the connection running through verses 18-
24. It is a vivid contrast between the old cove-
nant, with its ministration of death, and the new
covenant, with its ministration of the Spirit of life.
In the preceding verses the apostle gives a warn-
ing against apostasy, and then, as an encourage-
ment, tells us that we are not directed to Mount
Sinai, to trust in the law for righteousness, when it
has for us only curses, nor to the old covenant,
with its ministration of death, but to the Mount
Zion, where we may find the law of the Spirit of
life in Christ Jesus, the mediator of the new cove-
nant, and may find peace and help "exceeding
abundantly above all that we ask or think."

  HAVING this abundant help so freely offered, it
becomes us not to refuse the gracious offers of Him
who now speaks peace to us. Those who despised
the words spoken by Christ on Mount Sinai could
not escape; then how much less can any hope to
escape who not only violate the law spoken on
earth, but refuse the means of deliverance from
that transgression. When he spoke on earth, his
voice shook the earth. But when he speaks the
second time, his voice will shake not the earth
only, but heaven also. The first shaking was only
a shaking, but the second shaking means the re-
moval of everything which is not of God, or not
anchored to the throne of God, through faith in
Christ.

                       NOTES.
    "WE have an altar, whereof they have no right
 to eat which serve the tabernacle." The reference
 is undoubtedly to the feeding upon Christ, which
 is both the privilege and the duty of every Christian.
.See John 6 : 51-57. But the text must not be un-
 derstood as implying that Christ is the altar. The
 priests in the earthly sanctuary did not eat the
 altar, but they ate the flesh of victims offered upon
 it. Christ is not the altar, but the Lamb slain. Of
 him we eat.

   THE apostle seems in these verses to still con-
tinue the contrast between the two covenants as
shown by the differences of the sacrifices connected
with them. He shows that it was not an arbitrary
thing that the bodies of those beasts whose blood
was brought into the sanctuary, were burned out-
side of the camp. That was a type of Christ's
suffering outside of the camp, or outside of the
city of Jerusalem. The significance of this would
seem to be that salvation was not confined to those
within. the camp, but that the sacrifice is for all,—
that he should die, "not for that nation only, but
that also he should gather together in one the chil-
dren of God that were scattered abroad." John
11:52. Our going forth without the gate, bearing his
reproach, is the confession that we are here strang-
ers and sojourners, seeking an abiding city yet to
come.
