## NOTES

GOD knows the hearts of all men (Acts 15:8; John 2:25), and so he knew the full stubbornness of Pharaoh's nature before he sent Moses to him. Nevertheless he gave Pharaoh ample opportunity to receive the knowledge of God. At first God manifested his power to Pharaoh by simple miracles. But the king rejected this evidence, and not only allowed but invited the devil to destroy its force. Then the Lord began to bring judgments upon Pharaoh, and made himself known in a more marked manner; but still the king's stubborn heart willfully rejected light, even after his magicians—the agents of the devil—had confessed their own impotence, and the power of God. By this means Pharaoh hardened his own heart so much that it was impossible for him to see light. He was in the condition of those of whom Paul speaks when he says:— "

But if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is "the image of God, should shine unto them." 2 Cor. 4:3, 4.

Then God proceeded to harden his heart still more. Paul says of the heathen in general, who were wholly corrupt, that, " even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a mind void of judgment, to do those things that are not convenient." Rom. 1:28, margin. So of those in the last days who willfully reject light, he says that "for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believe not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." 2 Thess. 2:11, 12.

God always lets men have just what they are determined to have. If they hunger and thirst after righteousness, he will fill them with it; but if they fortify themselves in stubbornness, resist the strivings of his Spirit, and are bound to have their own evil way, then his Spirit ceases to strive with them, and he lets them have darkness to the full. Of those who hate knowledge, and despise God's reproof, he says: "Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them." Prov. 1:31, 32.

THE bearing of this lesson upon the doctrine of a future probation is obvious. In this life God gives to every man ample opportunity to know him, and to accept his salvation. The true Light " lighteth every man that cometh into the world." John 1:9. The rejection of this Light leaves the man in darkness. The light tends to soften and subdue his heart; the rejection of it hardens his heart. After a man has deliberately rejected light, and hardened his heart, additional light and favor only harden his heart the more. So then if, after this life, God should grant man another probation, it would tend, not to his salvation, but to increase his wickedness, and would thus be useless. So it is that if favor be shown to the wicked, his wickedness will not depart from him; and yet in the favor of God there is life, and it is his goodness that leads to repentance all who do repent. The same thing which saves some destroys others, according to the way in which they receive it, just as the same sun which melts wax hardens clay.
