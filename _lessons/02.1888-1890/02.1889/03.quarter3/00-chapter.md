  INTRODUCTORY NOTICE—TO TEACHERS.

   There is one thing I would like to impress upon the
mind of every teacher; that is, the importance of knowing
that his pupils understand the words of the lesson. The
letter to the Hebrews is among the things of which Peter
wrote (2 Peter 3..16), and not a little study is required to
obtain clear ideas of these things.
  I have had considerable opportunity to observe that
pupils often go groping through their lessons for want of
a proper understanding of the terms used. In the letter
to the Hebrews are found many words not often heard by
young people, the meaning of which may not be perfectly
clear to them. In studying such a book as this, the teacher
could not engage in a more profitable exercise than to
spend a minute or two in questioning the class on the
meaning of the words, before he engages in the regular
class work. In most cases he will not only find that he
has not lost time by so doing, but he will soon perceive
that his work has been more satisfactory, the truths of t;;e
lessons being more deeply impressed on the minds of tae
scholars.

                      NOTES.
  THIS letter evidently was written to those who
were familiar with the Scriptures—with those things
which the Lord had spoken by the prophets. It is
from the very beginning an argument from the
Scriptures on the dignity, the messiahship, and -
the priesthood of Christ. It argues most conclu-
sively the typical character of the sacrifices and
services of the Levitical law, and the insufficiency
of those offerings to take away sin. It was, no
doubt, written " to the Hebrews," being a commen-
tary on their laws. It contains convincing proof of
the truth of the gospel as it was then preached by
the apostles.

   IN all the other epistles, except those of John,
the writers place their names at the beginning.
This to the Hebrews gives no intimation of its au-
thorship. Luther suggested that it was written by
Apollos, and his suggestion has been taken up and
followed by a number of writers on the continent of
Europe. But we see no reason to believe that he
was correct. Paul was a ready writer, having
written thirteen letters under his own name, several
of them of considerable length. Of Apollos as a
writer we know nothing. Paul was a strong and
logical reasoner. The letter to the Hebrews shows
his cast of mind. Though Apollos, was mighty in
the Scriptures, of his style we have no possible
means of judging. For ascribing this letter to
Paul we have good reasons; ascribing it to Apollos
is a mere conjecture without satisfactory reasons.
It is a striking fact that no early writer ever sug-
gested Apollos as its author.
   This letter reminds us of the abrupt manner of
the beginning of Genesis and the Gospel according
6           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

to John, in announcing God and his works. It
does not deal with personal, or private, or even
church matters, as do the other letters. We can-
not be too thankful for the instruction it contains.


   THE expression "these last days" does not mean
the same in all places of its occurrence. When
spoken before the advent of the Saviour, it generally
means the last dispensation, the gospel age. Joel 2:
28 is not rendered "the last days " in the English
version, but Acts 2:16-20 contains an inspired com-
ment on the text, and proves that it means the last
days. The original will bear that construction.
Acts 2 also shows, by the events prophesied of,
that the expression there covers the entire gospel
dispensation. But when spoken in this dispensa-
tion, as in 2 Tim. 3:1 and 2 Peter 3:3, it refers to
the last days, or last part of this dispensation. The
words of Jesus in John 6 :39, 40, 44, 54, refer " the
last• day" to the day of his coming and the resur-
rection. Hence the last days of this age are the
days just preceding his coming. In Heb. 1: 2 the
last dispensation is meant.


  As God made the worlds by his Son, and all
things are upheld by him, and as " God was in
Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Cor.
5:19), it follows that we see and know absolutely
nothing of God the Father, either in creation,
providence, or in salvation and redemptiOn, but
what is revealed to us through his Son. The Lord
Jesus Christ is, in every respect, the manifestation
of God to man. " For it pleased the Father that
in him should all fullness dwell." Col. 1:19.
   HEB. I : 3 corresponds to Col. I: 16, 17, which.
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                 7

 says that by him, that is Jesus, " were all things
 created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth,
 visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
 dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things
 were created by him, and for him; and he is before
 all things, and by him all things consist." The
 word " consist" means, literally, " stand together; "
 and the text means that as Christ created all things
. so he preserves them; he upholds them by the
 word of his power—the same word that caused them
  to exist.

plying a negation; as if he had said, Was there

of his Father? Heb. I: 13.; 10:12, 13.

  26. To whom do they minister?—./b.
                      NOTES.
  THE scepter is an emblem of kingly power. A
scepter of righteousness implies just what Isa. 32:1
says, "A king shall reign in righteousness." In
Gal. 2: 17 the apostle declares that Christ is not
the minister of sin; that is, he does not serve the
cause'of sin; he does not advance sin. But he is
the minister of righteousness, or right-doing. Com-
pare I John 3:7. As the commandments of God
are righteousness (Ps. 119:172), he who does right-
eousness keeps the law of Go1. See Deut. 6: 25;
Isa. 51: 7.

   INIQUITY means, literally, lawlessness; workers
of iniquity (see Matt. 7: 23) means breakers of the
law. However much we may call on the name of
Christ, and profess faith in him, he will not accept
us unless we also do the will of his Father; he will
not accept law-breakers. While we cannot be jus-
tified, or please God, without faith (Rom. 5: I;
Heb.     :6); so faith without works is dead, being
alone. James 2 : 17, 20. Compare Rev. 14:12.

 VERSES 10-12 are quoted from Psalm 102:25-27.
By the reading of the psalm we could not deter-
10          LETTER TO THE HERREIVS.


mine that this was spoken to the Son rather than
addressed to the Father. And this is,the case with
a number of quotations in the New Testament from
the Old. We should never think of applying
them to the Son of God, if Inspiration did not so
apply them. And is this not an assurance to us that
the Son of God occupies a much larger place in the
Scriptures of the Old Testament than is generally
supposed? Is it not reasonable .to believe that
many other texts in that book refer to him, in which
he is not generally recognized? The great efforts
that are being made, in these days, to do away with
the Old Testament, or to weaken its authority, is a
direct blow against the divinity and work of the
Lord Jesus Christ. The Scriptures are not read
with that carefulness and feeling of dependence on
the Spirit of God that is necessary to appreciate it
as a revelation of God through his Son.


   "THE Lord said unto my Lord." Psalm i To : z.
In this text two different Hebrew words are ren-
dered Lord. Thus the original reads: Jehovah
said unto Adonai. And so in other places, as Isa.
6:3, 4, 12, Jehovah is used; in verses 1, 8, II, it is
Adonai. But this distinction is not recognized in
the Greek language. As Jehovah is a proper name,
and not a title, it should never be translated or
rendered Lord. If it were transferred as a proper
name, the distinction would be recognized in every
language.

  THE apostle Paul tells us in Rom.8: 14 that if
we are led by the Spirit of God we are the sons of
God; and John (I John 3: 2) says that we are even
now sons of God. The angels also are called sons
of',. God (Job 38: 7), and Luke (3:38) says that
           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                 11

Adam was the son of God. But all these are sons
in a far different sense from what Christ is. The
angels are sons by creation, just as Adam was, who
was created a little lower than they. But Christ is
the "only begotten Son of God," having " by in-
heritance a more excellent name than they." We
are " by nature the children of wrath " (Eph. 2: 3),
since we partake of the fallen nature of Adam; but
we become sons by adoption, and the Spirit of God
is the seal of that adoption. As adopted sons of
God, we become heirs of God and joint heirs with
Christ. Rom. 8:14-17. We shall be allowed to
share the glory and dominion of God's own Son.
Well may the beloved disciple exclaim: " Behold,
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the sons of
God."

                       NOTES.

  SCHOLARS should be taught, and it should be
impressed upon their minds, that, in studying the
Bible, they should pay no attention to the divisions
of chapters. They often break the connection in
a manner to cause the reader to_lose much of the
force of the Scriptures.

  "The word spoken by angels." It is certain that
when the law was given on Mount Sinai, there
were present myriads of holy ones, as it reads in
Deut. 33 : 2. Ps. 68 : 17 says: "The chariots of
God are twenty thousand, even thousands of an-
gels; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the
holy place." The words of Stephen plainly indi-
cate that the angels had some office to fulfill on the
occasion of the giving of the law: " Who have re-
ceived the law by the disposition of angels." Acts
7: 53. Yet just what part they had to act, is not
revealed. Professor Stuart, after noticing a num-
ber of opinions on this subject, says:—
   " We may stand aloof from being thus wise
above what is written, and content ourselves simply
with what our author teaches us, and what the
Scriptures confirm, viz., that angels did assist at
the giving of the law, or were in some way em-
ployed as ministering spirits by Jehovah on the oc-
casion of its being promulgated. This is all that
the text can well be interpreted as meaning, and
all that is requisite for the argument of the apostle."
   These words we can adopt, and here we shall
have to rest content. In this last dispensation God
has spoken to us by his own Son, the Maker and
Upholder of all things; and to turn away from the
words of such a Being, or to hear them idly, indif-
ferently, or carelessly, is to become guilty in the

                       NOTES.
  IT became the Father to make his Son perfect
through suffering. The attributes of God, both
love and justice, required that a worthy sacrifice
should be offered for man's redemption. Rom. 3:
25, 26 shows that the sacrifice of Christ was neces-
sary that God might be just, maintain the integrity
of his government and law, and yet justify peni-
tent sinners. In this view it was indeed fitting, or
becoming, in the Father to provide such a sacrifice
as the sufferings and death of his Son. In no other
way could God's justice be honored; in no other
way could sin be removed. Heb. 9: 22.

   IN what sense was he made perfect through suf-
fering? To some the idea may seem to be a great
mystery, but it contains the richness of the gospel;
not only in purchasing us by his blood, but in par-
taking of our trials, temptations, and afflictions, he
16            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


is brought near to our consciousness. Thus there
is a unity insured which could not be without his
suffering.
   Were a man of immense wealth, who had never
known suffering and care, to approach the poor
and wretched and endeavor to offer them consola-
tion, his words would be but sounds of mockery in
their ears. But suppose one who had been im-
mensely wealthy, and had resigned all, had be-
come poor for the sake of the poor, had taken their
severest sufferings upon himself, and even died
that they might have life, then the poor hungry
souls would hang upon his words with comfort and
delight. Every tear that he shed would fall like a
balm. There would be a union of hearts, for they
would know his heart; they would understand and
appreciate the strength of his sympathy, the depth
of his love. Such a Saviour has the Father given
to us, and the Scriptures assure us that he can be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities, because
of the temptations and agony through which he
has passed. Had he never suffered, he could
never be all that the weary heart longs for; but by
his sufferings he can satisfy every longing heart, be-
cause by his own experience he is able to enter the
secret chambers of human woe. Thus it is easy to
see that his perfect adaptation to our every want is
through his sufferings. Thanks be to God for.
such a Saviour.


  WILL the object of the death of Christ be accom-
plished? Will he destroy Satan? Most expositors
pass this idea by, as though this were a work too
great to be accomplished, or which the Saviour had
no desire or thought of accomplishing. It seems to
be taken for granted that Satan has, by some means,
gained a right to eternal life. We cannot imagine
              LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.             17

that the existence of Satan, or of any moral evil,
can be a desirable thing in the universe of God.
The Lord did not originate sin, he never created an
evil being. Angels and men were all created up-
right, but they fell, and have become desperately
wicked. Now it appears reasonable and just, yes,
necessary, that God should place intelligent creat-
ures on probation, and permit them to form their
characters as they should choose, for there could
be no character at all without choice;. and he
reserves all to the decisions of the Judgment.
But we could not vindicate the government of God
if he had originated sin, and planted moral evil in
the hearts of his creatures. And it would likewise
disparage his character and government, if, after
sin had intruded itself into his fair creation, and"
marred it with its hateful work, he would perpet-
uate it and give it an eternal abiding-place in his
dominions. Said the Saviour, " Every plant,
which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall
be rooted up." Matt. 15: 13. It is a cheering
thought that the universe of God will be restored
to its sinless, happy state, in which it was created.
See Rev. 5: 13.

   THE idea that Christ laid not hold of angels, or
partook not of their nature, brings up the ques-
tion of representation in the fall and recovery of
man. Adam's sin involved his whole poster-
ity in ruin. He stood as their representative, and
the gifts of God to him were intended for all his
race. See Gen. 1:28; Ps. tx5:16. But as nane of
Adam's posterity represented a race, none of them
could involve his posterity by his action. And
therefore none of them has sinned after the simili-
tude of Adam's transgression. See the argument
on representation in the fall and recovery, in Rom.
5: II-21.

   23. How, then, should we regard the book of
Psalms?
                       NOTE.

     MOSES was a servant, as a testimony of those things
  to be spoken after. That is, Moses, in his official
  capacity, was a type of Christ. See Deut. 18 : 15.
  And, of course, his house, the house of Israel, bore
  the same relation to the household of faith that he
  bore to Christ. This is the second point in the apos-
. tle' s argument on the Hebrew Scriptures concerning
20            LETTER TO TILE HEBREWS.

the dignity of Christ. First, he proves by the proph-
ets that the Messiah is above the angels; that they
are commanded to worship him; he is the Son of
God, by whom all things were made. Secondly,
being a Son, he is superior to Moses, who was but a
servant. As the one by whom the worlds were made,
he must have more honor than the creatures he
has made. It will be seen, as we proceed, that the
writer constructs his argument on the main points
of the Scriptures which they knew and believed,
so as to settle and establish them in the faith of the
gospel; for it was to Hebrew converts to Christian-
ity, to the brethren, that he was writing.

22            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


                      NOTES.
   WHEN the house of Israel is spoken of in distinc-
tion from the household of faith, we shall greatly
mistake if we suppose that faith was not required of
Israel. It will be seen by the whole argument in
this letter that it was. There have never been two
systems of salvation. As children of the covenant
of Abraham, of which their circumcision was the
token (John 7: 22; Gen. 17:10-14), they were un-
der covenant obligation to have the faith of Abra-
ham.

   THE rest to which the children of Israel were
journeying, was the land of Canaan. To the two
tribes and a half who chose their land on the east
of Jordan, Moses said: " The Lord your God hath
given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over
armed before your brethren the children of Israel,
. . . until the Lord have given rest unto your
brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also
possess the land which the Lord your God hath
given them beyond Jordan./ Deut. 3:18-2o.
Again: " For ye are not as yet come to the rest
and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God
giveth you." Deut. 12:9. The rest and the in-
heritance are the same. Joshua led them over Jor-
dan, and to the two tribes and a half he said: " The
Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given
you this land. . . . Ye shall pass before your
brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and
help them; until the Lord have given your breth-
ren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have
possessed the land which the Lord your God giv-
eth them." Josh. I: 13-15. When all was ac-
complished, the record says: "And the Lord gave
un10. Israel all the land which he sware to give unto
               LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.               23

their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
therein. And the Lord gave them rest round
about, according to all that he sware unto their
fathers; and there stood not a man of all their ene-
mies before them." Josh. 21: 43, 44. The rest
unto which the Lord was leading them, and which
they who fell in the wilderness never entered
into, was the peaceable possession of the land of
Canaan—the land of promise.

                       NOTES.
   IT has been seen that Moses was typical of
Christ, and the house of Israel represented, in like
manner, the household of faith. This being so,
analogy would prove that the land of Canaan is
typical of the true rest which God promises to his
people. The children of Israel inherited that land
according to a promise made to the fathers; but
the promise made to Abraham and his seed was of
the earth, or the world, which God first gave to
Adam, and which he lost by sin. The seed of the
woman who was to bruise the head of the serpent,
became also the seed of Abraham, and heir of the
 promises—heir of the world. Gal. 3 : 16; Rom.
4:'13. Through him all the faithful become heirs
to the promise to Abraham. Gal. 3 : 29; and they
shall inherit the earth. Matt. 5 :5. Ps. 37 :
says: "The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall
delight themselves in the abundance of peace."
When this is fulfilled, then the antitype of the peace-
able possession of the land of Canaan by the chil-
 dren of Israel will be fulfilled. Then shall the
weary saints of God have rest. The words of our
Saviour, the King, at his coming, show the relation
that Heb. .4 :3 bears to our future rest. Then will
he say: " Come, yo blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
 of the world." Matt. 25 : 38.

  THE apostle has now reached the third point in
his argument to the Hebrews. The first and sec-
26            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

and were the superiority of Christ to angels, and
to Moses. Moses was called to lead the chil-
dren of Israel into the land of promise; but he failed
in a single point, and was not permitted to cross
over Jordan. Joshua was appointed his successor,
and under him the people inherited the land, and
obtained rest from their homeless wanderings. But
here we learn that Joshua did not give them the
rest contemplated in the promise to Abraham and
his seed. Another leader must bring them into that
rest, when Abraham himself shall inherit the land.
See Acts 7 :5; Heb. i r : 9, 13. This leader, the
Captain of our salvation (Heb. 2:10), must be as
far superior to Joshua as the antitype is superior
to the type; as the peaceable and everlasting posses-
sion of the earth redeemed is superior to a tempo-
rary residence in the land of Canaan, surrounded
by envious foes.

   " THE word of God is quick [living] and powerful
. . . and is a discerner of the thoughts and in-
tents of the heart." It may be thought that this
applies to more than the law alone. But those who
think so forget the exceeding breadth of the law.
It is infinite, and includes all revelation, the entire
Bible, including the life of Christ, for that is but a
commentary on the law of God—an expansion of its
principles.

   MUCH misapprehension exists in regard to this
verse. If the rest remains, and if the brethren are
warned lest they should fail to reach it; the conclu-
sion is unavoidable that that rest is altogether
future, and that the saints have not yet entered into
it. Yet some claim that it is a present blessing, but
contrary to the whole tenor of the apostle's argument.
Lange's Commentari; says: "From the nature of
the rest of God it frjllows that for the people of God,
               LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.              27
so long as they are still on their pilgrimage to their
final goal, it must of necessity be in the future."
The whole argument proves it to be a future inher-
itance, not a present blessing.

  VERSES 12 and 13 are a fitting sequel to the warn-
ings that have been constantly urged upon the
brethren, to make sure work to enter the rest of
God. No deception can be practiced upon him
with whom we have to do.

final main point in his argument. After the heav-

enly beings, the angels, the Hebrews revered the
name of Moses, their leader from the land of Egypt,
through whom they received their rites, their eccle-
siastical and civil laws; and Joshua, the successor
of Moses, who led them into the promised land,
and who so victoriously conquered their enemies;
and Aaron, who was consecrated a priest to make
atonement for them, and whose sons alone held
that office. In this letter One is introduced of
whom the Scriptures speak as receiving the wor-
ship of angels, who made all things, and who bears
the name of God. He is above Moses, who was
but a servant, and a witness of the things relating
to Christ; above Joshua, who gave them but a
temporary rest, the true rest remaining to be given
by the Messiah; he is above Aaron; he is a priest
after the order of Melchizedek. The difference of
the two orders occupies specially the attention of
the writer. The priesthood whereby comes the
atonement being the central point of their whole
system, is the main point of consideration in this
letter.

   " THOU art a priest forever."1 So itwas said to
Aaron and his sons: " Their anointing shall surely
be an everlasting priesthood throughout their gen-
erations.'!' Ex.. 40:15; Num. 25:13. This signi-
fied that the priesthood should be theirs as long
as it endured. So also of Christ; he should be
priest continually and without interruption or suc-
cession. For this is often the meaning of everlasting
and forever. See Ex. 21 : 6. The servant was to
serve his master forever, which meant as long as he
lived. The priesthood of Christ will remain with
him only, but it will also end. His priestly robes
will he changed for " the garments of vengeance."
Isa. 59 : 17. Then he will come to take vengeance

on his foes. 2 Thess. I : 6-8. The day of salvation,
during which he pleads for man, will be succeeded

               HEBREWS 5 : 8; 6 :8.

   I. WHY can priests from among men be com-
passionate?
   2. Was Jesus a priest of that class? Heb.
2   :17.
    3. As the Son of God, was he subject to suf-
fering and temptation? Heb. 5 :'8. See chap.2:18;
4:85.
    4. What did he learn by suffering? Heb. 5: 8.
    5. In what sense did he learn obedience by
suffering? Ans.—By experience he learned to
take part with those for whom he acts as priest ; to
sympathize with them in their efforts to serve the
will of God.
    6. Being made perfect what did he become?
Verse 9.
    7. By whom was he called a high priest after
the order of Melchizedek? Verse io; also verse 5.
    8. Was Melchizedek called a high priest?
Gen. 14:18.
    9. What does Paul say of Melchizedek? Heb.
5:''.
  1o. Why were the things of which he was
speaking difficult to utter? See note,
              LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.             31

     t. What is meant by the expression, " When
for the time?" Verse 12. Ans.—They were not
new converts. For a long time they had known
the truth, so that they ought to have been able to
teach but had been negligent of their privileges.
This made it difficult to expound deep truths to
them.
   12. Of what had they need? Verse 12.
   13. What is meant by the first principles of the
oracles of God?—/b. Ans.—The context shows
that he referred to the primary truths of Christian
life and doctrine.
   14. What does he exhort or incite them to do?
Heb. 6:1, 2.
   15. What is meant by leaving the principles of
the doctrine of Christ? Ans.—The word ren-
dered principles means beginning. Not that they
should neglect the primary truths of Christianity,
but progress to greater knowledge and piety.
   16. What were the principles, or first truths, to
which he referred? Verses 1, 2. See note.
   17. What are we to understand by eternal
judgment? Verse 2. See note.
   18. How is the foundation for repentance laid
again by Christians?—/b. .Ans.—By backsliding.
See Rev. 2: 5: " Remember therefore from whence
thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first
 works." They had to begin again, at the very be-
ginning.
    19. What is said of •those who were once en-
 lightened, and fall away? Heb. 6:4-6.
    20. What does the description of their attain-
 ments here indicate? See note.
32            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

   21. How is the Son of God treated by an
apostate from the truth? Verse 6.
   22. Is not a person deeply guilty who treats
thus the Saviour, who has loved him, and given
him grace from the throne of Heaven?
   23. What lesson is taught in verse 7? Ans.—
It is encouragement to the brethren to persevere in
the way of right.
   24. And what in verse 8? Ans.—It is a sol-
emn warning against slighting the grace and bless-
ing of Heaven.
                     NOTES.
   SOME judicious critics do not refer this expres-
sion in Heb. 5: r i to Melchizedek, but render it
thus: " Concerning which we have many things to
say," and refer it to the subject of the Melchizedek
priesthood. It is not true, as sometimes supposed,
that Paul could not or did not say what he desired,
for his comments on the Melchizedek priesthood
are very clear and complete. Nor did he say that
the things of which he was speaking were difficult
to express, as our translation, hard to be uttered,"
would indicate. The meaning is, as the original
shows, that those things were hard to be explained
to them, seeing they were dull of hearing; not well
instructed in the faith they professed. The follow-
ing verses, even to chap. 6:9, are all constructed
on this fact. He had strong meat to give them,
while they had only the capacity of children to re-
ceive it. Their dullness of hearing not only made
it difficult for him to give them the instruction he
desired to give, but their failure to make progress
in Christian life and doctrine, was likely to en-
danger their salvation, unless they would change
their course and go "on unto perfection." The
              LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.             33

human mind, as the earth which was once culti-
vated and watered by rains from heaven, does not
stand idle. If it is not made to produce desirable
fruits, it will soon grow up to thorns and briers.
This is a most important passage for every Chris-
tian to consider.
   " Seeing ye are dull of hearing " does not ex-
press the sense of the original, which says, " ye
are become dull of hearing." And this indicates
that they had been in a better state; a state where
they could better appreciate the truth. This as-
sertion of their backslidden condition adds greatly
to the force of the admonitions following. It is a
fact, worthy of careful consideration, that luke-
warm professors, neither cold nor hot, are the
most difficult of all men to arouse to a true sense
of their condition. The conscience of the infidel,
the openly profane, may be touched and aroused,
but lukewarm Christians are so stupefied by self-
complacency, so satisfied with themselves, that
they are exceedingly difficult to reach. See Rev.
3:14-18.
   There is no mention in the Scriptures that Mel-
chizedek was a high priest. We have no reason
to believe that such a distinction- could have been
known in his time. As will be seen in.the prog-
ress of this argument, neither Melchizedek nor
Aaron was a complete type of Christ. It took
both together to present all the essential truths of
 the gospel in the priesthood of Christ. He was of
 the order of Melchizedek, but he was also the anti-
 type of Aaron (Heb. 8:1-5), and fills the office of
 high priest, as the high priest alone made the great
 atonement.

  THE apostle enumerates a few points of doctrine,
which, in the light of the Scriptures, are so plain
that every no lice in the faith was supposed to un-
derstand. But one expression, " the doctrine of
34           LETTER TO    THE HEBREWS.
 baptisms," has been the occasion of much trouble
 to commentators. Some have inferred that he re-
ferred to the difference between the baptisms of the
Jews and Christian baptism. But the Jewish bap-
tisms certainly could find no place in this connec-
tion. The following remarks by Professor Stuart
are worthy of notice:—
   " Another explanation is, that bafilisnion does
not differ in any important respect from bapismou."
   He then gives a number of instances, on different
subjects, where the plural is used in the sense of
the singular, and continues:—
   " Storr supposes baplismOn to be used here in a
kind of distributive sense, as the Hebrew plural
often is, so that the sentiment is, ' the doctrine
that every believer must be baptized.' But how-
ever this may be, no great stress can be laid upon
the use of the plural. Accordingly, the Syriac ver-
sion has the singular here. In regard to the doc-
trine of baptism being an elementary doctrine, there
can be no difficulty. The rite itself was an initia-
tory one, for all who professed to be Christians."
   It is of course admitted that elementary truths,
lying at the very beginning of Christian faith and
life, should be, and of necessity are, plain truths. It
is a great pity that party interests have been per-
mitted to obscure the doctrine of baptism, and
make it a question for the schools, to be under-
stood and made known by those only who 'are
versed in theology and languages. If left to the
words of the Saviour and his apostles, a few texts
would settle the question with every earnest soul
who is honestly and candidly seeking to follow the
Saviour in his example and precept.

  WE are not to suppose that eternal judgment
means, eternally judging or eternally being judged.
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                35
It means a judgment the decisions of which are
final; its consequences are eternal. On this form
of expression, the Critical Greek Lexicon of Bull-
inger has the following just remarks on " eternal
punishment " (Matt. 25: 46):—
   " The nature of which must be looked for in
other parts of the Scriptures as being there clearly
defined as a result and not a process. Eternal pun-
ishment is an expression analogous to eternal judg-
ment in Heb. 6: 2 (not judging); eternal redemp-
tion, Heb. 9: 12 (not redeeming); eternal salvation,
Heb. 5: 9 (not saving); i. e., the eternal effect of
an act. "0
   It is an awful thought that very soon that decis-
ion, that can never be reversed or modified, will
be made.

    THE apostle's description of graces and attain-
 ments (Heb. 6: 4, 5) applies to those who have en-
 joyed no small degree of gospel blessings. And
 on this subject there is great liability to misjudge.
 When we see one whose attainments in the divine
 life are considered high, who is esteemed especially
 rich in grace, it is quite common to think that his
 title is "clear to mansions in the skies." But great
 graces bring great responsibilities; and responsibil-
 ities are always accompanied by corresponding
 dangers. True graces, gifts of the Spirit, are not
 merits of the individual possessing them; they are
 favors by the free grace of Him who sits on the
 throne of grace. If these favors are abused, the
'recipient is more guilty than he who has never been
 thus blest. And, of course, the greater the gift,
 the greater the guilt in its abuse. Compare with
 Heb. 6:4-6; 2,Peter 2:21; Heb. to: 26-29.

   28. Does hope ever look back to the past? See
Rom. 8: 24.
                      NOTES.
  HEB. 6:14 is an intensive form of expression not
uncommon in the Hebrew. It denotes certainty.
Two instances are found in Genesis 2. Verse 16
reads: " Of every tree of the garden eating thou
shalt eat." It is translated, Thou mayest freely
eat." Verse 17 reads: "In the day that thou eat-
38           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


est thereof dying thou shalt die." Rendered,
" Thou shalt surely die." These translations are
literally correct, the words freely and surely repre-
senting the certainty contained in the form of the
original. Again in Ex. 3: 7 the Lord said, " See-
ing I have seen the affliction of my people." Ste-
phen, quoting this (Acts 7: 34), expressed the in-
tensive of the original by a repetition: " I have
seen, I have seen the affliction of my people."
And indeed duplication is another method of ex-
pressing intensiveness in the Hebrew, as "good
good," for very good. Our version very correctly
translates Ex. I:7, " I have surely seen."


   As faith rests only on the word of God (Rom.
to: 17), so hope rests only on the promise of God.
Where God has not spoken there can be no faith.
There may be opinion, or conjecture, or strong
feeling, and even much confidence, but no faith.
So where there is no promise of God there may
be feeling, and strong self-confidence, but no true
hope. And a promise fulfilled is no longer a prom-
ise—it is a matter of the past. Hope can no
longer rest upon it, " for hope that is seen is not
hope." Once received, it is no longer hoped for.
Losing sight of this evident truth many have been
led to indulge false hopes. They will profess to
hope in God, while there is not a promise within
their reach. For all the promises of God rest on
conditions, and if we neglect the conditions, we
cannot rightfully claim the promises. Claiming.
God's promises without fulfilling their conditions
is not an indication of faith but of presumption.
But if indeed we have fled for refuge to Christ, and
have laid hold upon the hope set before us, what a
strong consolation we have in the sure promise of
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS                 39

God confirmed by his oath, brought near by the
blood and intercession of our high priest in the

                       NOTES.
   IT is not possible within the space of a Sabbath-
school lesson to give a full description of the work
of the priest in the sanctuary. Every day in the
year the priests ministered in the holy place, or the
first room of the sanctuary. Ex. 27:20, 21; 30:1,
7, 8; Heb. 9:6. The tenth day of the seventh
month was the day of atonement, on which the
high priest went alone into the most holy place,
and sprinkled blood upon the mercy-seat, over the
             LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                41
ark which contained the law of God. Ex. 16. By
this act he cleansed the sanctuary from all the defile-
ment of sin. This was a type of the day of Judg-
ment. Our Lord ascended on high in the year A.
D. 31. He said to his disciples, " I will pray the Fa-
ther, and he shall give you another Comforter."
John 14: 16. And, " If I go not away, the Com-
forter will not come unto you." John 6 : 7. Within
ten days after his ascension to his Father, his
priesthood in the sanctuary in the heavens (Heb.
8:1, 2) begun, for on the day of Pentecost his
prayer was answered, and the Comforter came.
Acts 2. This was the beginning of his priesthood,
and he was then of course officiating in the holy,
or the first of the two holy places. It is not until
the seventh trumpet sounds, which is near the close
of this dispensation, that the temple in heaven is
opened where the ark of the testament is seen.
Rev. r r :14-19. This is the most holy, within the
second veil. Now, as Paul wrote the letter to the
Hebrews in A. D. 64, but a little more than thirty
years after the beginning of Christ's priesthood, the
veil within which he then entered must have been
the first.

  PAUL says of the name Melchizedek, that it is
"by interpretation, king of righteousness." It is
compounded of two Hebrew words, melek, king,
and tzedek, righteousness. Most Hebrew proper
names were thus significant. As Salem means
peace, king of Salem is, also, king of peace. In
both these names Melchizedek fitly represented the
Son of God, who is truly the king of righteousness
and the king of peace. It is on the throne of grace
that he is our peace. Eph.2:14; Zech. 6:12, 13.

  HEB. 7: 2, 3 contains some of the most signif-
icant and interesting of all the statements of this
42          LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.


wonderful argument. All that is known of Mel-
chizedek is contained in Gen. 14: 18-20, and in
these two verses in Hebrews 7.
   The truth is, that if we could ascertain his gene-
alogy, all the force of Paul's reasoning would be
lost, and he would no longer serve as the type of
the priesthood of Christ. For it is the evident in-
tention of the record to give Melchizedek as the
type of Christ, in whose priesthood no genealogy
or succession can be reckoned. Christ has indeed
a genealogy, but that serves solely to prove his
heirship to the throne of David, and does not refer
at all to his position as a high priest on the throne
of his Father in Heaven. This will be seen with
more and more clearness though all this chapter.
   The original Greek says he was agenealogeelos,
literally, without genealogy. Authorities to al-
most any extent may be quoted to show that the
method of expression used in Heb. 7:3 was com-
mon among the Hebrews where no genealogical
record was preserved.

of them, need to be changed on the change of the

   21. If the priesthood was so strictly given to
Aaron, how could Christ be accepted as priest?
Verse 12.
   22. If that law (Num 3: to, etc.) confining the
priesthood to Aaron and his sons, had continued
in force, could Christ have acted as priest? -
   23. What law, then, had to be changed in order
to have a change of priesthood?
   24. Was there ever a priest before Christ of the
tribe of Judah? Heb. 7:13, 14.
                       NOTE.
   WE are led, by all the Scriptures, to believe that
Melchizedek was greater than Abraham only in
respect to his position or office as priest-king.
Abraham was not a king; he was only a stranger
and pilgrim in the land. The priesthood of Mel-
chizedek and of Aaron were both typical of that of
Christ; but as a type the former stood highest, be-
cause Aaron had no kingship connected with his
priesthood. It is this fact that gives the priest-
hood of Melchizedek superiority over that of Aaron.
Inasmuch as Aaron had no kingship, were it not
for Melchizedek we should have but a limited and
very imperfect type of the priesthood of Christ. In
other respects, Abraham doubtless was not inferior
to Melchizedek.

us? Verse 25. See note.
  17. How is it that such a high priest became us?
Verse , 26. This means that he is a high priest

  19. Did any of the Levitical priests resemble
him in this respect? Ans.—The laws concerning
the purity, in both person and character, of the
high priest, were very strict. But no man ever
bore the character here described.
  zo. What is meant by his being higher than
the heavens? See Eph. I : i8, 22; I Peter 3:22.
                      NOTES.

   CARNAL means fleshly; a carnal commandment
means a commandment pertaining to the flesh.
Carnal does not always nor necessarily mean sin-
ful or evil. The Levitical system was not spiritual;
perfection was not by nor in it. The word seems
here to have reference to the frailty and mutability
of mortal priests. This is rendered quite certain
by the contrast: They were made priests by a car-
nal commandment; he after the power of an end-
less life.
            LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.                47

   OF course the commandment that is disannulled
is the same as the law of Heb. 7: 12. There was a
disannulling of the entire ecclesiastical law of that
dispensation, of which the priesthood was the
center. Verse 19 is obscured by the common ren-
dering. The first clause should certainly be in pa-
rentheses. " For there was verily a disannulling
of the preceding commandment, for the weakness
and unprofitableness thereof (for the law made noth-
ing perfect), but [there was] the bringing in of a
better hope by which we draw nigh unto God."
The actual contrast in the passage is destroyed by
the introduction of the word " did," in our version.
There was a disannulling of the one and there was a
bringing in of the other. The first made nothing
perfect—by the second we draw nigh unto God.
The first had to be taken away, that the second
might have place. There is a force to the expres-
sion "by which we draw nigh unto God," that is•
generally overlooked. Thus it is said that Moses
drew nigh unto God, while the people stood afar off.
Ex. 20: 2 I ; 24: I. And so the priests drew nigh unto
God in his sanctuary, even into his presence, but
it was death to the people to come near. But un-
der the intercession of our high priest we are all
said to draw nigh unto God. See the same con-
trast presented in 2 Cor. 3: 12-18. What gracious
privileges are conferred through the gospel of
Christ.

  BECOMING the surety of the covenant is a strange
expression; such an idea is nowhere else found in
the Scriptures. Jesus is not only the mediator of
the better covenant, but he becomes surety—he
seems to assume the responsibility of seeing that
the object of the covenant shall be accomplished.
This is an additional assurance to those who place
48           LETTER TO THE HEBREWS.

their cases in his hands. But in this word, or in
this transaction, there is no room given for pre-
sumption. It may not be said, I will do nothing,
or, I have nothing to do; Jesus is my surety, and
he will do all in my behalf. In any transaction no
one would become surety for another who made no
effort to be just: The first covenant had no surety,
for the priests could not insure perfection, either in
obedience, or by virtue of their offerings. How
great reason have we to be thankful, for, with such
a high priest as we have, there can be no failure in
this covenant, unless it be through our own neglect
or willfulness.

   BECAUSE Christ has unending life and a perpetual
priesthood, he is able to save completely—to the
uttermost—them that come to him. No case can
be forgotten or neglected in the transfer of office
from one to another, or by reason of the infirmity
and inefficiency of the advocate. Everything con-
nected with his priesthood is calculated to give en-
couragement and assurance to those who put their
trust in him.
