                      NOTES.
  IT is stated in answer to question 8 that man lost
by the fall holiness, dominion, and life. This will
be evident to all who will briefly consider the mat-
ter. 1. God created man upright and pronounced
him good. Eccl. 7:29; Gen. 1:31. Man was
therefore holy, not righteous; for righteousness im-
plies a character formed in harmony with 2. rule of
right, but holy in the sense that he belonged to
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.               3

God, and was wholly free from sin. He trans-
gressed the command of God and became a sinner,
or lost his holiness. 2. God gave him dominion
over the earth. Gen. 1:28; Ps. 115:16. But
when man transgressed he became a child of Satan,
a slave of sin (Rom. 7:14); and therefore his do-
minion passed to Satan, to whom he had yielded.
3. If man had continued to obey God, he would
never have died. Righteousness tendeth to life
(Prov. 1o:16, 17; 11: 3o); but man sinned, and the
wages of sin is death. Rom. 6:23. Therefore
man lost by the fall holiness, dominion, and life.

    " THE earth is given into th hand of the
wicked." Job. 9:24. The wicked of course in-
cludes wicked men, but it does not refer to them •
primarily. Satan is the root of wickedness—
wicked men are the branches. Said Jesus to the
Jews, " Ye are of your father the devil." John 8:
44. That is, as regards character, wicked men are
the offspring of Satan. When man was created,
God gave him dominion over the earth (Gen. 1:
26); but when man turned from God and yielded
to Satan, he became subject to Satan, and the
world passed under Satan's control. Hence Satan
is called in the Scriptures, " the prince of this
world " ( John 12:31), and " the god of this
world" (2 Cor. 4:4); or, according to another
Scripture, " We know that we are of God, and the
whole world lieth in the evil [wicked] one."
John 5: 19, Revised Version. Therefore when Job
says, " The earth is given into the hand of the
wicked; he covereth the faces of the judges thereof,"
 it means that Satan and his servants so rule that
 the faces of the righteous judges are covered for
 shame and grief. See 2 Sam. 19:4, and Jer. 14:4.

                       NOTES.
   HEB. 13:5 reads: " Let your conversation be
without covetousness." The word conversation
did not mean when the Bible was translated what
it now does. It is now generally used to denote
verbal intercourse between persons, familiar talks,
etc., whereas it formerly meant, behavior, con-
duct, deportment," and that is what it means in
the above passage. The Greek word translated
conversation in this text is trofios. and is defined by
6             TITHES AND OFFERINGS.


Bagster as " mode, manner, way; " " turn of mind
or action, habit, disposition." And this is the
meaning that the word conversation has in every
place where it occurs in the Scriptures, with the ex-
ception of Phil. i : 27 and 3: 2o, in which texts it
means citizenship. But these meanings take noth-
ing from the word as applied to our verbal inter-
course or the words which we speak; for " way,
manner of life, behavior," certainly include our
words

   COVETOUSNESS is an unlawful desire. It is
classed among the worst of sins, for it is directly op-
posed to every principle of the gospel of Christ.
The plan of salvation rests wholly on Heaven's gift
to man. It was a gift of infinite love, and was at
an infinite sacrifice. When there is one single
prompting of that spirit in the soul, it so far makes
men unselfish and generous. The two spirits are
as far apart as Heaven and hell, as light and dark-
ness. No man possessing the spirit of covetousness
is fit to bear any responsibility in a work so sacred
as that which is laid in such an infinite cost. Every
attempt to advance it by such a person would only
mar the work. Our efforts are weakened by such
a spirit. It paralyzes the greatest effort. But the
smallest act and the feeblest effort clothed with the
spirit of appreciation of the gift of Heaven, has a
power beyond description. It conquers Satan
every time, and only- works good. God would
have his people despise covetousness, and cultivate
the opposite spirit.
   In i Cor. 5: II we are told not to Keep company or
even eat with certain characters, and among others
are mentioned covetous persons. The keeping
company is walking in church-fellowship, and eating
is at the communion table. No stronger language
could be used to show how God regards that sin.
The tenth verse shows that we will have to min-
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.                 7

gle with them in this world as long as we are in
it. But to take them into Christian fellowship is
contrary to the principles of this gospel of Christ.
   Mankind are naturally selfish, but the grace of
Christ is unselfish. It is a heavenly plant growing
only in that heart which has been renewed. It is a
jealous principle, and will admit of no rival. It
makes a lovely character, admired by all. It can-
not live without action, and every act increases,
strengthens, and extends it. The unconverted heart
cannot originate or produce this plant of heavenly
growth, which lives and flourishes only where Christ
reigns. If this spirit of unselfishness is nourished,
it will prove an evergreen. Its branches will not de-
cay; its leaves will not wither. It is immortal, eter-
nal, watered continually with the dews of Heaven.
   But covetousness is the reverse of all this. It
withers the soul; it dries up every liberal feeling;
paralyzes unselfish emotions; prevents every'gener-
ous act, and while it may say, Yes, yes, to the op-
posite principles, there is nothing that can move
the individual to action. This is covetousness. It
should be hated as we would hate poison, and
dreaded as we would dread the.bite of a deadly vi-
per. It should not be so much as named among
saints.

   19. How many think it worth while to do this?
How many studying this lesson are doing it? How
many not doing it will do it?
                       NOTE

  Christ's position with the Father, being equal to
him, made him the only being who could pay the
penalty of the broken law. He was first and the
best that Heaven possessed. The first religious
services of which we have any account were the
bringing of offerings and sacrifices by man. The
sin-offering was a lamb without blemish, for it rep-
resented Christ. Men were also to bring the first-
fruits of everything which they received, as a wave,
or thank-offering to God. By withholding these
offerings, they robbed God, and showed that they
did not appreciate the sacrifice that Heaven had
made for their salvation. We do not read in so
many words in the New Testament that men were
to bring the first-fruits of all they received as an of-
fering to God, but the apostle, in writing his sec-
ond epistle to the Corinthians, referred directly to
their offerings, and taught them to believe that God
would help to make up their offerings if they had
               TITHES AND OFFERINGS.                 11

willing hearts, even to the working of a miracle
such as was wrought in the supplying of an omer of
manna to each man in the wilderness. Certainly
no one can read the eighth and ninth chapters of
Second Corinthians without feeling that the apostle
attaches great importance to this matter of weekly
offerings. More than this, it is an institution
owned and approved directly by God himself ; and
none will be poorer in this life for following the in-
struction thus given ; but it will secure to them
promises that they otherwise would fail to receive.
   Another important thought gathered from these
chapters is that the apostles would not have the
brethren give because they felt compelled to, but
from choice. This spirit is a most precious gift of
the grace of Christ. The natural feeling, to see
that self is cared for first, arises from a love of self
more than from a love for the cause of Christ; but
to do for the cause of Christ first, arises from a heart
renewed by the grace of God.

   20. What lesson can we draw from this?
                       NOTE.
  THE love of Christ flows spontaneously from the
heart. It is heavenly in its nature. It labors not
for a reward but it always receives a reward. It for-
gets itself in its labors for others' good. Angels
are interested for the development of its principles.
They watch its development in individuals who
possess it. They know all the circumstances of
their daily life. This is illustrated in the case of
Cornelius. All this shows the tender care which
God has for his people. An important lesson is
taught in the case of Simon the leper. He
loved Christ, but he never realized how much the
Saviour did for him in forgiving his sins. He ap-
preciated his blessing of health to a limited extent,
but the forgiveness of sin was of far greater value.
Mary realized the blessing of the forgiveness of her
sins. She showed the love she had for Christ on
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.               15

all occasions. She was the last at the sepulcher,
and the first to greet her Lord when he arose. Si-
mon must have known Mary's character before the
Saviour forgave her .sins. He had suspicions of
her when she came and anointed Christ. He did
not appreciate her motive. But her love knew no
bounds. This arose from the fact that she realized
how great a sinner she had been. But she was
now free from the power of Satan.
   "The Saviour had observed all that had taken
place and knew the motives of all who were there
assembled. He read the object of Mary in her costly
offering. Though she had been very sinful, her re-
pentance was sincere, and Jesus, while reproving her
guilt, had pitied her weakness, and forgiven her.
Mary's heart was filled with gratitude at the compas-
sion of Jesus. Seven times she had heard his stern
rebuke to the demons which then controlled her heart
and mind, and she had listened to his strong cries to
his Father in her behalf. She knew how offensive
everything impure was to the unsullied mind. of
Christ, and she overcame her sin in the strength of
her Saviour. She was transformed, a partaker of
the divine nature. Mary showed how highly she
prized the Saviour when she accounted the most
precious gift none too costly for him; but Judas
valued Jesus at the price for which he sold him.
His niggardly soul balanced the life of the Son of
God against a paltry sum of money. The same
cold, calculating spirit is manifested by many who
profess Christ to-day. Their offerings to his cause
are grudgingly bestowed, or withheld altogether
under various plausible excuses. A pretense of
wide philanthropy, unlimited by church or creed,
is not unfrequently one of them, and they plead, like
Judas, it is better to give to the poor. But the
true Christian shows his faith by investing in the
cause of truth; he is known by his works, for
faith without works is dead. Jesus in mercy had
16            TITHES AND OFFERINGS.

pardoned the sins of Mary, which had been griev-
ous, and her heart was full of love for her Saviour.
She had often heard him speak of his approaching
death, and she was grieved that he should meet
such a cruel fate. At great personal sacrifice she
had purchased an alabaster box of precious oint-
ment, with which to anoint the body of the Saviour
at his death. But she now heard many express
their opinion that he would be elevated to kingly
authority when he went to Jerusalem, and she was
only too ready to believe that it would be so.
She rejoiced that her Saviour would no longer be
despised and rejected, and obliged to flee for his
life. In her love and gratitude she wished to be
the first to give him honor, and, seeking to avoid
observation, anointed his head and feet with the
precious ointment, then wiped his feet with her
flowing hair. Her movements had been unob-
served by the others, but the odor filled the house
with its fragrance, and published her acts to all who
were present. Some of the disciples manifested
displeasure at this act, and Judas boldly expressed
his disapprobation at such vasteful extravagance.
Simon, the host, who was kL Pharisee, was influ-
enced by the words of Judas, and his heart filled
with unbelief. He also thought that Jesus should
hold no communication with Mary because of her
past life. " Judas, the prime instigator of this dis-
affection among those who sat at the table, was a
stranger to the deep devotion and homage which
actuated Mary to her deed of love."
   We learn a very important lesson from this:
First, we appreciate Christ in proportion as we re-
alize our past sinfulness, and the blessing of pardon
which has come to us; second, our oflerings to
his cause show that appreciation; third, conse-
quently our offerings are a manifestation of the
appreciation of the Saviour as a sin-pardoning God
to us. In taking this view of the matter we might
well inquire, " How much owest thou my Lord? "

   " THE brief but terrible history of Ananias and
Sapphira is traced by the pen of inspiration for the
benefit of all who profess to be the followers of
Christ. With others, Ananias and his wife Sap-
phira had the privilege of hearing the gospel
preached by the apostles. The power of God at-
tended the word spoken, and deep conviction
rested upon all present. The softening influence
of the grace of God had the effect upon their hearts
to cause them to release their selfish hold upon
their earthly possessions. While under the direct
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.               19

influence of the Spirit of God, they made a pledge
to give to the Lord certain lands; but when they
were no longer under this heavenly influence, the
impression was less forcible, and they began to
question and draw back from fulfilling the pledge
which they had made. They thought that they
had been too hasty, and wished to reconsider the
matter. Thus a door was opened by which Satan
at once entered, and gained control of their minds.
   " This case should be a warning to all to guard
against the first approach of Satan. Covetousness
was first cherished; then, ashamed to have their
brethren know that their selfish souls grudged that
which they had solemnly dedicated and pledged
God, deception was practiced. They talked the
matter over together, and deliberately decided to
withhold a part of the price of the land. When
convicted of their falsehood their punishment was
instant death. They knew that the Lord, whom
they had defrauded, had searched them out; for
Peter said: ' Why hath Satan filled thine heart to
lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of
the price of the land? while it remained, was it not
thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine
own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in
thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto
God.'
   " God, in his wise plans, has made the advance-
ment of his cause dependent upon the personal ef-
forts of his people, and upon their free-will offer-
ings. By accepting the co-operation of man in the
great plan of redemption, he has placed a signal
honor upon him. The minister cannot preach ex-
cept he be sent. The work of dispensing light does
not rest upon ministers alone. Every person, upon
becoming a member of the church, pledges himself
to be a representative of Christ by living out the
truth he professes. The followers of Christ should
carry forward the work which he left for them to
do when he ascended into Heaven."

  19. In what way are we to lead others to Christ?
Matt. 5: 16.
                         NOTE.
  CHRIST'S joy will be in bringing many souls into
glory (Heb. 2: TO); it was for this that he became
obedient unto death, and it is declared (Isa. 53:i1)
that " he shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall
be satisfied," and all who are saved will be par-
takers with him ; to each one it will be said, " Well
done, good and faithful servant; " " enter thou into
               TITHES AND OFFERINGS.-              23

-the joy of thy Lord." Matt. 25: 23. But Christ
 labored and suffered for the salvation of souls, and
 if we share the glory we must also share the labor
 and the suffering. As it is written (2 Tim. 2:12),
 " If we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we
 deny him, he also will deny us." To deny Christ
 it is not necessary that we say in words, as did Pe-
 ter, " I know not the man," but we may deny him
 by refusing to suffer hardship or self-denial for his
 sake or in his cause. To acknowledge Christ is to
 serve and obey him in all things, and this we can-
 not do without, to some extent, suffering with him.

  16. In what does their sin consist?
  17. Will there be a difference in the punishment?
Verses 47, 48.
  18. What solemn lesson do we learn from this
when applied to those who have so great light as
shines from God's word at the present day?
                       NOTES.
  To wait for Christ's second coming is to occupy
a position of constant expectation. It could not be
said that we were in a waiting position for a train of
cars unless we had reached the station, and were
ready for the train when it should arrive. Some
will be prepared when the Lord comes, and such
only can be said to be waiting.

  THE parable of the unfaithful steward is one of
the greatest importance. It shows that some will
be teaching that the time has come to get ready for
Christ's coming,—to sell and give alms. They
               TITHES Ago OFFERINGS.                25

urge the necessity of immediate preparation for the
event, while the unfaithful servant reasons that there
is no necessity of being so much stirred up about
the matter. He complains of the straight testimony,
and he pursues the course of those who do not pro-
fess the truth at all; yet he claims to believe the same
as the others, but in his heart he does not, and he
shows it in two ways: First, he says that the preach-
ing to move at once and act as though the day of
the Lord was right upon us is too strong; second,
his life is the same as those who do not make any
profession at all. The first is to beat his men-serv-
ants; the second, to eat and drink with the drunken.

the order of Melchizedek, what would we conclude

23: 23.
                       NOTE.
  IN the fourteenth chapter of Genesis, every princi-
ple of the tithing system is given. Abram gave a tithe
of all he possessed to Melchizedek, after which the
king of Sodom proposed that he should have the per-
sons, and Abram might keep the substance. That
which he had taken from the kings was his by right
of conquest, therefore it was his privilege to dispose
of it as he thought best. He first gave to God his
portion, the tithe of all; he then assured the king of
Sodom that he would himself not take anything,
even to a shoe latchet; but certain individuals who
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.              27
went with him were to receive their portion, and the
young men were to have what they had eaten, and
their portion.

priesthood?
                        NOTES.
   IN a certain sense, everything we have and are
belongs to God; but there are some things that be-
long to him in a special sense. Tnose things
which he has never given to man for his own use
are God's and his alone. The Sabbath, the tithe,
and the first-fruits in the former dispensation, illus-
trate this fact. God has also permitted men to
make gifts to him, and to consecrate a portion of
their substance, their talents, or their time, es-
pecially to his service. This the Lord also accepts,
and it becomes consecrated and holy. In the for-
mer dispensation after men had consecrated a por-
tion of their substance, if in any way they wished
              TITHES AND OFFERINGS.               29

to change it the Lord would have them add one-
fifth to it that they might realize the sacredness of
his claims. When men realize and acknowledge
the importance of God's claims, he has promised
to let a special blessing rest upon them. The pay-
ing of the tithe also secured the heart from covet-
ousness; for continual giving serves to cultivate
the spirit of benevolence, which is a part of the
grace of Christ.

  THE Levitical priesthood received the tithe from
the people, and they gave a tithe of what they re-
ceived to the ones who had special charge of the
work of God. Another tithe was taken for the
poor. Thus there were two tithes, one going
to the priests and the other going to the poor.
The apostle, in i Cor. 9, teaches the duty of
those who have received the gospel to support the
same. He appeals to the law, and then applies it
to the gospel. Men cannot give the tithe as a do-
nation, because it never was theirs; but God has
permitted them to handle the tithe, and then re-
turn it to God, that it may cultivate in them that
spirit of liberality which was manifest in Christ's
coming to this earth to die. The tithing system,
therefore, is one of the greatest blessings to man.

Because human nature is the same in al.' ages of the world. Hence he who would know
how to avoid error in the future must know Show errors have developed in the past. The
" FATHERS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH " shows the condition of the heathen world at
the time of Christ, briefly states the principles of ancient heathen philosophy, which was
largely responsible for the immorality of that time, and shows how the 'adoption of these
principles by prominent men in the Church, and the incautious lowering of the standard
of pure Christianity to accommodate the heathen element, developed the Papacy, which
was simply a new phase of Paganism. It shows that by the time of Constantine every
phase of the Papacy was fully developed, and was only waiting for supreme power.
                          THE        CHAPTER ON

                PUN-WORSHIP AlVD SUNDAY
                      IS ALONE WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK.
The chapter on " The Apostolic Church" consists largely of quotations from Scripture,
   showing that grave errors both of faith and practice existed in the church even
       in the days of the apostles, so that the early existence of a practice
                        proves nothing as to its correctness.
Then a chapter is devoted to each of the Fathers, and to his writings. The Sunday
     argument, so far as it is drawn from the Fathers, is completely demolished
          by the citation of other testimony from them in favor of some
                  of the grossest evils of the Catholic Church.
Lastly, several chapters are devoted to "The Great Apostasy," in which are traced
               the logical results of the teachings of the Fathers.
           EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK,
As all are constantly meeting quotations from the Fathers in behalf of Sunday. In
these cases it is only necessary to show that the same Fathers believed in Purgatory and
prayers for the dead, to nullify their testimony.
    The book is printed on fine tinted paper, neatly bound in cloth, with gilt side stamp,
and contains 392 pages.
