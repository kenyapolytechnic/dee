 THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page go.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school
lesson each day of the week.

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                             December 25, 1965

                            Australasian Division

   The eyes of the Sabbath school this quarter will be focused upon the
Solomon Islands. This group of islands lies in the southwestern Pacific
Ocean. Most of them are in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
Australia governs Bougainville, Buka, and a few nearby islands as United
Nations trust territories. The Solomons cover 16,000 square miles, and have
a population of roo,000. The climate is hot, damp, and unhealthful. The
soil is fertile, but is not widely farmed. The islands are mountainous,
heavily wooded, and well watered.
    The overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter will
go to help build a sixty-bed hospital on the island of Malaita, and to help
rebuild the Betikama Missionary School on Guadalcanal. The island of
Malaita is the last stronghold of heathenism in these lovely isles, and it
is believed that a hospital in the midst of the population of 55,000-850 of
whom are already Seventh-day Adventists—will help our missionaries in
our final witness to these poor people. The Betikama School has been
carrying on a good work for a number of years, and the buildings are
worn out. The Australasian Division is not proud of the appearance of
this school at the present time, but it is proud of the students who
have gone out from it to help carry on the Lord's work.
