 THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.

            My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school
lesson each day of the week.

in the study of the Sabbath School Lessons
               H 511,0,10
                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                  June 26, 1965
                       Central European Division
   The Central European Division is the great country of Germany,
and is comprised of the East, South, and West German Unions. In this
territory with a population of 74,605,800 people we have 833 churches
and nearly 41,000 church members and 48,600 Sabbath school members.
You can see that there are still many people in this land who need to
be reached with the message of a soon-coming Saviour. Germany be-
fore World War II was a very active home base for sending out mis-
sionaries to many parts of the world field. The war with all of its
aftermath restricted the missionary activities of the believers to their
own homeland, but the missionary zeal still burns in their hearts, and
despite the loss of homes and churches that our people suffered in the
war, from 1946 to 1963 they were able to baptize 17,500 souls. Un-
fortunately, they lost about 12,000 members by death during the same
period. A great number of our believers still live under very restricted
circumstances and are not able to contribute to the adVancement of
the work as they would like to do. Therefore, it is the privilege of
Sabbath school members around the world to contribute on June 26
toward a much-needed evangelistic center in the great city of Nurnberg.
