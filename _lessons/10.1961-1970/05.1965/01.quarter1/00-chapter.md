   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the sitid)1
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to gi'v
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If Godi'i

               ATTENTION, SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS!
        Are you using the Teacher's Edition of the "Sabbath School
    Lesson Quarterly"? If not, you should ask your Sabbath-school
    secretary to secure it for you. You will find it a great help in the
    preparation of your lesson as well as in teaching, for every other
    page in the quarterly is blank, thus giving space on which to
    write out answers to questions, notes, or special comments to use
    in class. It has been provided in response to requests from many
    teachers. It is designed to help you, but it cannot help you if you
    do not use it. Try it!

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                 March 27, 1965

                         SOUTHERN ASIA DIVISION

      The great Southern Asia Division, to which the overflow of the
   Thirteenth Sabbath Offering goes this quarter, has the lowest ratio of
   Seventh-day Adventists to total population of any of the world divisions
   except the Middle East Division. Surely the task of preaching the
   gospel in this division is gigantic! Increased means are needed to train
   laborers to carry out the task assigned God's people in Southern Asia.
      That is exactly what the overflow will be used for this quarter. It will
   help to provide additional secondary-school facilities for the Andhra
   Section of our work in the South India Union. Considering the meager
   educational facilities we have had in this field, it is remarkable what
   has been accomplished, but many of our own young people have had
   to turn to the schools of the world for their education. This trend must
   be stopped, for we need this trained leadership to give the message in
   these stressful times.
      Southern Asia wants to express in advance its thanks for the liberal
   and loyal support of the Sabbath school membership around the world
   in this project this quarter.

                Lessons for the Second Quarter of 1965
     Sabbath school members who have failed to receive a senior Lesson Quarterly
