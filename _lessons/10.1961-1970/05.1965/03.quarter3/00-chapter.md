THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge

myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school

                         Meeting Attacks on the Bible

MEMORY VERSE: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable

   the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
  2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," chapters 32 and 37; "Steps to Christ,"
   chapter "What to Do With Doubt;" "S.D.A. Bible Commentary;" "S.D.A. Bible
   Dictionary."
AIM: To discover the reasons behind Satan's special hatred of the Bible and how
   we may meet the arguments he has used against it.

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                           September 25, 1965

                 SOUTHERN EUROPEAN DIVISION

   The Southern European Division is made up of fifty-seven countries ,
and islands, including the Vatican State, with territory on three con-
tinents. Think of the tremendous task of covering such a vast territory
and of the great variety of languages in which the work must be con-
ducted. In this total population of 310,168,036, we have 1,567 Adventist
churches, with a membership of 114,419, but with a Sabbath school
membership of 161,803, as of June 3o, 1964.
   One of the greatest needs for carrying on the work in this inter-
national field is the need for trained workers. The French Adventist
Seminary at Collonges, France, has been filling this need for a number
of years. Our increasing membership means an increasing enrollment
at the seminary, and that is the reason this senior college has been named
to be the recipient of a part of the overflow from the Thirteenth Sab-
bath Offering on September 25, for the purpose of building a new girls'
dormitory. The rest of the overflow will go to build a new mission
station near Abong Mbang, South Cameroun, Africa, one of the mis-
sion fields of the Southern European Division.
