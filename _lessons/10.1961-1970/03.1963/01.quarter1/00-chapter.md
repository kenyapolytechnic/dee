                   THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 90.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 266.

                        My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

                         The Revelation of God's Love
MEMORY VERSE: "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and
  sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us,
  we ought also to love one another." 1 John 4:10, 11.
STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "God's Love for Man;" "The Acts of the
   Apostles," pages 539-545; "The Adventist Home," pages 195-199; "S.D.A.
   Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To show that (1) the gospel is the revelation of God's love to men,
    and (2) the most powerful argument in favor of its acceptance is the life of a
    loving and lovable Christian.

                  Meekness and Humility in Witnessing

MEMORY VERSE: "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as

   never receive Christ or represent Him successfully.

MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
   cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
   easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
   looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith; who for the joy that
   was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
   at the right hand of the throne of God." Heb. 12:1, 2.
STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," chapter 32; "The Acts of the Apostles,"
   pages 593-602; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To (1) expose Satan's snares and hindrances to successful service,
   (2) show that we are not unmindful of his devices, and (3) give assurance that
   we may surmount them victoriously.

                               March 30, 1963

    When Fulton Missionary College was established on the main island
of the Fijian group in the Central Pacific Union it was a bold new step
in multiracial coeducation in that part of the world. The now-rickety
buildings were erected by free native labor from lumber taken from
three old schools that were torn down and transported from three dif-
ferent islands. They have served well for twenty-one years. And the
school has proved its worth by sending out scores of workers to the
work of God.
   The time has come for another bold step forward. Plans are under
way for ten modern classrooms, a library, a chapel, and an administra-
tion office. In the spirit of our pioneer missionary, J. E. Fulton, in
whose honor the school was named, let us "arise and build" by giving
a liberal offering for this worthy project on March 30.
