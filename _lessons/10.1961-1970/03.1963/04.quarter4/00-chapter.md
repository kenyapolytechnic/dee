THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "There should be a living, growing interest in storing the mind with Bible
truth. The precious knowledge thus gained will build a barrier about the
soul."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 36.

   Let us resolve to be more diligent in the study of His word and "set apart
a little time each day for the study of the Sabbath school lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 41.


           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school
lesson each day of the week.

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                            December 21, 1963
                        Southern African Division
   Of all countries in the world today, Africa's are probably undergoing
the greatest change. Not only is the map of this continent changing,
but many newly independent nations have emerged from the political,
economic, social, and educational upheavals which accompany such
radical change.
   Among the emerging peoples, education and improved living stan-
dards are dominant aspirations. With many millions of dollars being
made available by overseas governments annually, local governments
have been able to increase the salaries and improve the living con-
ditions of their employees. Business concerns have been forced to keep
pace with the governments' trends, and mission organizations have had
to struggle along behind, doing the best they can with the funds avail-
able. In due course our members should be able to do more to support
the work in their fields, but at present their earning capacity is still
being developed.
   That is why we are asking our Sabbath school members around
the world to accept the project of improving African workers' housing
through the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on December 21.
