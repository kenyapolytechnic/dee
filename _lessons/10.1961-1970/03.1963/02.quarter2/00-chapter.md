THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "There should be a living, growing interest in storing the mind with Bible
truth. The precious knowledge thus gained will build a barrier about the
soul."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 36.
   Let us resolve to be more diligent in the study of His word and "set apart
a little time each -day for the study of the Sabbath school lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 41.


           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school
lesson each day of the week.

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                   June 29, 1963
                            Inter-American Division

   The Inter-American Division will benefit from the overflow of the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the second quarter, 1963. This is a far-
flung field covering great distances between thirty countries and island
groups. A tremendous responsibility rests on the 154,397 members in its
1,325 churches to give the message to the 90,000,000 inhabitants. Con-
secration to the spread of the third angel's message is in evidence by the
2,806,698 Bible studies given during 1961.
   In the capital city of Mexico alone nearly six million people are wait-
ing to hear the gospel. Perhaps no other city in Inter-America presents
such a challenge today to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The peo-
ple of Mexico respond to the gospel if only we bring it to them. Your
gifts to missions this quarter will help to establish an evangelistic center
in Mexico City and churches which will spread the story of salvation.
Part of the offering will also be used for the completion of the new
hospital in Port of Spain, Trinidad, West Indies.
   God is working miracles in Inter-America! Remember the thirteenth
Sabbath, June 29, 1963.
