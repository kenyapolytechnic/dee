 THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "There should be a living, growing interest in storing the mind with Bible
truth. The precious knowledge thus gained will build a barrier about the
soul."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 36.
   Let us resolve to be more diligent in the study of His word and "set apart
a little time each day for the study of the Sabbath school lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 41.



              My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school
lesson each day of the week.

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                 September 28, 1963
                                 Middle East Division

     Once more the Sabbath school members of the entire world will be
  looking toward the Bible lands, home of the Middle East Division.
  The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the third quarter
  goes to this division. Faithful Adventist members of all nations, among
  every kindred, tongue, and people will be joining in giving to advance
  the work of God in the Holy Land, where it first began.
     The project to benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering over-
  flow this quarter will be a church center in Damascus, with welfare,
  medical, educational, and temperance facilities. These are services
  greatly appreciated by the people. Our love and kindness can best be
  expressed by an understanding of the needs of the human family, and
  these services would not only be approved by the authorities but wel-
  comed by the masses. Won't you heed the call when the Thirteenth
  Sabbath Offering is taken, to "come over to Damascus and help us"?
