THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures.. . . If God's Word were studied as it should be, men
would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of
purpose rarely seen in these times." — Steps to Christ, page 9o.

               Introduction                       pointed forward to the establishment of

lines of prophecy in the book of Revelation.

one of the Old Testament prophets closes              Christ in the Book of Daniel
his message with a scene from the eternal
kingdom, and some, like Isaiah, return to

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                  March 25, 1967

                               Far Eastern Division

       The Far Eastern Division is to benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath
   Offering overflow the first quarter of 1967. This will be the twelfth time
   that it has benefited since World War 11. During the previous eleven
   times, it has received the grand total of $630,760.56. This has meant much
   to the various projects that have benefited.
       The division has eighteen medical institutions, not to mention an even
   larger number of clinics. During these past twenty years only five of
   its medical institutions have been helped by a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
   overflow. A total of $157,698.78, or 25 percent of the total received, has
   gone into medical work. This year the Seoul Sanitarium and Hospital is
   to benefit by one third of the overflow.
       Since 1946, twelve of our thirty-eight colleges and secondary school's
   have been assisted through the overflow gifts. The total assistance thus
   received amounted to $235,000, or better than 37 percent of the total
   received during this same period. Mountain View College on Mindano
   in the Philippines will benefit from this quarter's overflow.
       For years the Far Eastern Division has been trying to find a suitable
   location for an evangelistic center in the city of Hong Kong, with its
   almost four million people. The site has been secured, and the third
   portion of • the overflow will help in establishing this much-needed light-
   house in this great city. Give generously on March 25.
