THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to
give vigor to the facultieS, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
times."—Steps to Christ, page 9o.

                       Northern European Division

    The Northern European Division is a large and most challenging section
of the world field. In it dwell more than 200 million people in lands that
stretch from the Arctic Circle to Equatorial Africa. This multitude of peo-
ple is a heterogeneous group, conforming to varied national customs, speak-
ing a large number of languages and dialects, and influenced and motivated
by a wide range of educational and cultural standards. The proclamation
of God's message to this great mass of humanity is a colossal task, made
possible through the promised power; without measure, of the Holy Spirit,
    Three projects have been chosen to benefit from the overflow of the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for this quarter. They are:
    r. A new classroom building for our junior college in Sweden. This
school has grown and developed through the years, but the time has come
when it is impossible to continue with the facilities that exist.
    2. A young men's dormitory for Ethiopian Adventist College. We can
be justly proud of this school, but it still has many needs. One of the
most pressing is a men's dormitory, for some students are still housed in
huts with no windows for light and ventilation.
    3. Mission headquarters and evangelistic center for Togo. Togo was
until recently one of the few unentered countries of the Northern European
Division. The work has now been started. Prospects are bright, but the
needs are great.
