THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to
give vigor to the factilties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind,
a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."
—Steps to Christ, page 90.

            My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                   ATTENTION, SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS!
        Are you using the Teacher's Edition of the "Sabbath School
     Lesson Quarterly"? If not, you should ask your Sabbath School
     secretary to secure it for you. You will find it a great help in the
     preparation of your lesson as well as in teaching, for every other
     page in the quarterly is blank, thus giving space on which to
     write out answers to questions, notes, or special comments to use
     in class. It has been provided in response to requests from many
     teachers. It is designed to help you, but it cannot help you if you
     do not use it. Try it!

                       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING


                                December 23, 1967


                            Central European Division

   During this quarter the thoughts of Sabbath School members around
the world will be turned toward Germany, a country that represents the
heart of Europe. At the turn of the century we had in many cities along
the Rhine flourishing Adventist centers. However, these great churches
were dispersed by the second world war, and many church members did
not return. Most of the chapels were destroyed, and there were no church
homes for them to return 10.
    The work is again flourishing in Germany, however, and today there
are about 40,000 church members; but still church housing facilities are
inadequate for these members. It is impossible to preach the message in
an effective way with no places of meeting to which to bring new converts.
Therefore, the overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help
to build an evangelistic and welfare center in Hamburg, an evangelistic
center and an old people's hospital at Uelzen, and a domestic building
including a dining room for Marienhoehe College at Darmstadt. As you
plan your Christmas giving, remember your brothers and sisters in Ger-
many, not only that they may have suitable places in which to worship,
but also because these places will help them to bring others into the truth.
