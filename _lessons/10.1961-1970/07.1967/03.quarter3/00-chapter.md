THE JOYS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIAN STEWARDSHIP

        Senior Division, No. 289, Third Quarter, 1967
THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to
give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind,
a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these 'dines."
—Steps to Christ, page 90.

            My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                          THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                September 30, 1967
                               Southern Asia Division
      The two schools that are to benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offer-
  ing overflow are the Assam Training School in the Assam Hills, India, and
  the Kellogg-Mookerjee High School in East Pakistan. Both these projects are
  extremely worthy of consideration, and both are in need of immediate
  attention.
      Until recent years it could be said that the Assam Training School
  was almost inaccessible. In the early days the only means of access was a
  bridle trail, which later became a rough jeep trail. Now, with the new
  highway passing through the grounds of the school estate, this is no longer
  the case. Although a number of new reinforced concrete buildings have
  been added in the past eight years, the student dormitories, the adminis-
  tration buildings, and half of the staff quarters, which are of pine timber
  and mud plaster construction, are showing the ravages of time, wood-boring
  insects, and heavy rainfall of several hundreds of inches annually. Also, the
  Director of Public Instruction for Assam has demanded that we provide a
  more adequate physical plant.
      The Kellogg-Mookerjee High School is located on the banks of one of the
  tributaries of the great Brahmaputra River in East Pakistan. This school
  has suffered much because of floods and cyclones. The only access 'to the
  school is by launch or steamboat. The time has come when we must build
  in a new and better location. The young people of Southern Asia are look-
  ing to the Sabbath Schools around the world for help on September 30.

                       Lessons for the Fourth Quarter, 1967
