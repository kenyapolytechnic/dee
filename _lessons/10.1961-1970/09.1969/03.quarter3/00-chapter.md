   SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON



  Senior Division, No. 297, Third Quarter, 1969
THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "Set apart a little time each day for study of the Sabbath School lesson."—
Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, page 137.
    "Let the Sabbath School lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at the
lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week
on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus
the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."
—Education, pages 251, 252.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING


                             September 27, 1969

                             Far Eastern Division

   The lure of exotic tropical islands, the challenge of a land gripped in
the horrors of war, the demand for more national workers with graduate
degrees to keep pace with rising standards of nations newly proud of
their progress—these are all reflected in the projects chosen for special
assistance from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow this quarter.
   The three projects are:
   1. A training school in the islands of Palau. The administration build-
ing of the old school was destroyed by a typhoon; and now, with the
purchase of a new plot of ground in a better location, the time has come
to build a larger and better school that will serve the children and youth
of this whole area and prepare workers for the entire Trust Territories
of the South Pacific. The need is both urgent and outstanding.
   2. A new hospital for the city of Saigon. Our small hospital in this
war-torn city has done excellent service for the sick and injured. A new
hospital will be constructed less than a mile from the old one but in a
spot where there is not so much constant traffic. The new hospital will
enable the medical staff to give more efficient and effective service.
   3. The construction of the administration building for the Far Eastern
Division School of Advanced Studies on the grounds of the Philippine
Union College. This school is urgently needed to meet the demand for
qualified workers in all parts of the Far East.
