                           March 29, 1969

    Beautiful for situation is the location of Kendu Hospital, on the shores
of Lake Victoria near the town of Kendu Bay in Western Kenya, East
Africa. But when we look at this mission hospital, the beauty ends with
the situation. The buildings are about thirty years old and are in poor
condition—in fact, so poor that is is almost impossible to repair them.
Inside the wards space is so limited that beds are placed only a foot or
a foot and a half apart. In an average year 5,600 inpatients and 45,000
outpatients are treated.
    The Christian influence of Kendu Hospital is far-reaching. Patients
come from hundreds of miles even though travel is slow and difficult. The
closest government hospital is twenty-five miles away, and patients often
pass it by in order to come to Kendu.
    Kendu must prepare to educate young people as fully qualified regis-
tered nurses to go out and teach health education to their own people
as well as to be able to work in our own hospitals and others. The
government is imposing new requirements in order that nurses be better
trained. Don't you want to have a part in replacing the run-down
buildings of Kendu with a modern plant and modern medical facilities so
that it can care for the sick as well as train young people in the medical
arts? Remember Kendu Hospital on March 29.
