      REDEEMING GRACE

  SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON



Senior Division, No. 296, Second Quarter, 1969
THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath School lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week
on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus
the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 43.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                               June 28, 1969

                         South American Division


    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to be taken in Sab-
bath Schools around the world on June 28 will go to the South American
Division. Three schools in this great division will benefit from this offer-
ing. They are as follows:
    1.Chile College. This institution urgently needs a new dormitory for
the boys. For almost thirty years they have been living in a provisional
one, erected after the 1939 earthquake, which badly damaged the original.
It was built for 150 students. There are now 260.
    2. Northeast Brazil College. This college does not have a suitable
place in which to hold religious meetings. The present meeting place
provides no shelter against rain or sun. The most urgent need is for an
auditorium that would serve as a chapel.
    3. Espirito Santo Academy. This is a new institution at Colatina,
Espirito Santo, Brazil. The girls' dormitory is in bad shape. It is an old
house, completely inadequate.
    Our brethren in South America are counting strongly on the proverbial
Seventh-day Adventist liberality to provide funds to meet these urgent
needs. Won't you do your best when the offering is taken on June 28?
