Senior Division, No. 298, Fourth Quarter, 1969
THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "Set apart a little time each day for study of the Sabbath School lesson."—
Counsels to Parents ,Teachers, and Students, page 137.
    "Let the Sabbath School lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at the
lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week
on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus
the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."
—Education, pages 251, 252.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                             December 20, 1969
                           Southern Asia Division

    Southern Asia is not only the home of several powerful non-Christian
religions, it is the birthplace of two of the most aggressive of these;
namely, Hinduism and Buddhism. For centuries, even millenniums, the
views of life offered by these religions have cast their spell over the hun-
dreds of millions of people who live in these lands and have made it
extremely difficult for the gospel to penetrate.
    Of late, however, the Spirit of God is being poured out in unprece-
dented measure, and we are beginning to see each year hundreds accepting
Christianity. One of the agencies of the church in meeting the challenge of
spreading the gospel has been its educational system, which in mission
fields is open to the public. This avenue in Southern Asia has accounted
for almost one third of all baptisms through the years of our endeavor.
    The overflow this quarter will be used to supply additional dormitory
space for the students at Spicer Memorial College and to modernize and
improve the Lasalgaon High School. Part of the overflow will also be used
for new church buildings. These are all urgent needs. Southern Asia is
counting on fellow believers around the world to come to her aid at this
time. Make your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering a real Christmas sacrifice
offering.
