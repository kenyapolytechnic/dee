      The Blessing of Daily Study
   "He who by faith receives the Word is receiving the
very life and character of God. Every seed brings forth
fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul by faith the
incorruptible seed of the Word, and it will bring forth a
character and a life after the similitude of the character
and the life of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—
Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His
hungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is
a personal Saviour. As they feed upon His Word, they
find that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys the
natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 391.
 "The neglect of the Word means starvation to the soul."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                     My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayer-
ful study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

                   The Way
                to Lille Eternal!
                      First Quarter, 1970
    A knowledge of the way to life eternal is vital to times like these. The
great old themes of the New Testament are here presented in a new format
to show forth the strait pathway in an easy-reading guide.
    This unique lesson presentation, combining statement, exposition, ques-
tion, and application, has been prepared to enable you to gain the most from
your time spent in the study of the Word. This new format makes it possible
for one who may have as little as two minutes for study to glance over a page
of the lesson and grasp the theme and main thought for the day. With the
help of the "second-mile" suggestions given at the end of each lesson, this
new format lends itself to several hours of intensive study and reflection.
    Each day's outline begins with a passage of Scripture which gives the
prime thought for that section of the lesson. This enables you to have before
you the key text for the day's meditation while you are leafing through your
Bible looking up the other references cited in the exploratory material.
    Some other features that are intended for your study convenience are:
    1. The wide margins and space between paragraphs for jotting in your
own ideas or questions for the class discussion.
    2. The "Think It Through" questions to give opportunity to make per-
sonal "life situation" applications of the lesson.
    Before you participate in the Sabbath School lesson discussion, you are
encouraged to complete the summary page found at the end of each lesson.
We hope that these simple questions will bring to your mind the thoughts
you have gained during this week's study that will make your contribution
to the class discussion relevent to today's needs.
    "The mind must be stored with pure principles. Truth must be graven on
the tablets of the soul. The memory must be filled with the precious truths
of the Word. Then, like beautiful gems, these truths will flash out in the
life."—Messages to Young People, page 69.

                                                   OUR FATHER GOD 1
"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew
Him not." 1 John 3:1.


   The aim of this study is to increase our       4. Our Privileges and Responsibili-
understanding of God's fatherhood and our      ties. God invites us to have confidence in
sonship. God's love for His children found     His beneficent purposes, to enter upon the
fullest expression after Christ's birth. The   privileges He accords erring members of

is a Father to each believer.                               LESSON OUTLINE

             KEY THOUGHTS                             1. The New Name
   1. God Knows and Cares. The Archi-                    Luke 11:2
tect of the universe knows its myriad stars
and maintains each in its appointed course.           2. The Father Revealed in Christ
The same Infinite One has given us life and              John 14:8-10
being and desires us to accept Him as the
Architect of our lives.                               3. The Privilege of Sonship
   2. Love Constrains God. God provides                  1 John 3:1, 2
for the welfare and happiness of the crea-
tures of His hand. When His earthborn                 4. The Discipline of Sonship

toration.                                             5. The Father's Love
   3. Divine Love Constrains Us. The                     Rom. 8:35-39
love of God constrains us to reflect His in-
finite love and to cooperate with Him in the          6. Approaching the Father
restoration of our lives.                                John 4:23, 24

Our Father-God          LESSON 1                                             ❑   Sunday

                Part 1       "And He said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our
                          Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy
       THE NEW NAME       kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in
            Luke 11:2     earth."

                            In Old Testament times God had been so misrepresented
                         that the common people looked upon Him as an exacting,
                         harsh judge with no feeling of compassion for His children.
                         Desiring to remove this misconception and to restore again
                         the confidence of men in the great love of God, Christ began
                         His ideal prayer with the words, "Our Father."
                            While God is the common Father of all mankind by virtue
                         of creation (see Mal. 2:10; Acts 17:28), in a special sense He
                         is a Father only to the saints. Only a true believer in Him can
                         be called a child of God, and only a true child can address God
                         as Father. "But if you call God your Father you acknowledge
                         yourselves His children, to be guided by His wisdom and to
                         be obedient in all things, knowing that His love is changeless.
                         You will accept His plan for your life."—Thoughts From the
                         Mount of Blessing, page 105.
                         How personal an interest does our heavenly Father take
                         in His children on earth? Matt. 10:29-31.

                            Since God is willing to be called our Father, we can there-
                         fore expect that He will take a personal interest in us. See Matt.
                         He gladly gives us that which is good. Luke 11:11-13. As a
                         good Father, He will do all He can to save us. Mal. 3:17.
                         What is the supreme evidence of God's paternal love?
                         1 John 4:8-10.

    THINK IT THROUGH What other names could appropriately be applied to God
                      the Father?




   "In order to strengthen our confi-        gard and relationship to us. Spoken
dence in God, Christ teaches us to ad-       when asking His favor or blessing, it

               Part 2        "Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and
                         it sufficeth us.
         THE FATHER          "Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with
        REVEALED IN     you, and yet host thou not known Me, Philip? he that hath
              CHRIST    seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then,
                         Show us the Father?
                             "Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the
                         Father in Me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not
                         of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth
        John 14:8-10    the works."

                            Near the close of His ministry Jesus told the disciples of His
                         soon coming death and how He would return again to this
                         earth after His ascension to take them home with Him. John
                         13:31 to 14:3. But the disciples were slow to comprehend.
                         Grappling with his doubts, Philip said, "If you are going away,
                         then give us some crowning demonstration. 'Lord, show us
                         the Father, and it sufficeth us.' "
                         How did Christ answer Philip? Verse 9.

                            It is only as we behold Jesus Christ that our eyes are
                         opened to see beyond to our Father-God. "Only He who knew
                         the height and depth of the love of God could make it known."
                         —The Desire of Ages, page 22.
                         How is the Father's love as revealed in Christ impressed
                         upon our hearts today? Rom. 5:5; Gal. 4:6.

 THINK IT THROUGH Is there any other way to know God than through Jesus
                   Christ? Matt. 11:27; John 14:6.

                Part 3      "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be-
                         stowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of
        THE PRIVILEGE    God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew
          OF SONSHIP     Him not.
                            "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not
                         yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
                         He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see
         1 John 3:1, 2   Him as He is."

                            What an astonishing passage this is. We who by nature are
                         sinful and under the curse of God and who in times past have
                         been disobedient, unthankful, and unholy are pronounced the
                         sons of God. John cannot help but say, "Behold, what manner
                         of love !" It is beyond comprehension that the holy God is not
                         ashamed to be called our Father and to call us His sons.
                            John here uses the phrase "sons of God" to describe the
                         new relationship between God and the one who is born again.
                         The same Greek expression is translated as "children of God"
                         in verse 10 and in 1 John 5:2. This relationship is a gift which
                         is "bestowed upon us." Verse 1. In mutual relationships be-
                         tween friends one party contributes as much as the other, but
                         in the new birth God gives all and with thanksgiving we re-
                         ceive all.
                         What privilege awaits the child of God? Verse 2, last part.
                         How may we enter upon this new relationship with God?
                         John 1:12, 13.

                             "The thange of heart _by- which we become children of God
                         is in the Bi6le spoken-gLas
                             "It is only through the-life which God Himself has im-
                         parted, that either plant or animal can live. So it is only
                         through the life from God that spiritual life is begotten in the
                         hearts of men."—Steps to Christ, page 67.

    THINK IT THROUGH How can a child of God express his love to his Father?




   "God stands toward His people in          ness blended with equity and justice,

              Part 4    "My son, despise net thou the chastening of the Lord,
                     nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him:
     THE DISCIPLINE     "For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and sceurg-
       OF SONSHIP eth every son whom He receiveth.
                        "If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as
                     with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth
                     not?"
                        "Now no chastening for the present seeineth to be
                     joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth
                     the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are
     Heb. 12:5-7, 11 exercised thereby."

                           In Hebrews 12:5, 6 Paul quotes an Old Testament passage
                        to remind his readers that trials are not inconsistent with the
                        love of God. See Prov. 3:11, 12. Only a father who is deeply
                        concerned about his children will chasten them when he feels
                        it necessary. Children without a loving father do not receive
                        the benefit of discipline.

                        upon us to submit to the training that is necessary that we
                        may become mature Christians.
                        What privilege is accorded the one who endures God's

                        What is the end result of divine discipline? Verse 11.

                      through Him that loved us.
                          "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor

                      be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
        Rom. 8:35-39 Christ Jesus our Lord."

                           These are words in which every Christian should immerse
                        his soul. Paul asks the question: "Will anything ever make
                        God cease to love us?" The answer is obvious. The Father of
                        the universe could never forsake His children. There can never
                        be a situation which would diminish God's feelings for us. God
                        is not only loving and eternal, but He is "greater than all,"
                        and "no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand."
                        John 10:29.
                        Through whom is God's love demonstrated? Verse 39.

                        What does God intend that His love, operating through
                        Christ, shall do for us? 2 Cor. 5:14.

                           The word translated "constraineth" means "impels," "con-
                        trols." As an automatic pilot controls an airplane on a pre-
                        determined course, so Christ will control the person who has
                        chosen to be guided by His love. Compare Rom. 8:3, 4.
 THINK IT THROUGH What evidence have I been given of God's love?




   "Neither life nor death, height nor     the One who is behind all the prom-
depth, can separate us from the love       ises. Our grasp on Him may seem fee-

                              In the Old Testament sanctuary service the high priest drew
                           near to God on the Day of Atonement, and the people stood
                           afar off. In Christ the people draw near to God themselves.
                           Under the old system they were told, "Let him not approach."

                           "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
                       (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only Be-
       John 1:1-3, 14 gotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."

                           This portion of Scripture describes the mystery of the in-
                        carnation of Jesus Christ. With strong, majestic lines John
                        portrays the supreme event of all ages, the invasion of this
                        planet by God Himself wrapped in the outward form of a
                        child. See Luke 2:7-14. This event fulfilled the prophecy of
                        Isaiah: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and
                        shall call His name Immanuel." Isa. 7:14. Matthew quotes this
                        prophecy and defines the name Immanuel: "Which being in-
                        terpreted is, God with us." Matt. 1:23.
                           "God with us." What beautiful, mysterious, unexplainable
                        words! In Christ two natures, the divine and the human, were
                        mysteriously blended into one person. He became one of a
                        kind, a God-man, the only being that ever has or ever will
                        be such. Surely, "the limited capacity of man cannot define
                        this wonderful mystery—the blending of the two natures, the
                        divine and the human. It can never be explained. Man must
                        wonder and be silent."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                        Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 904.
                        How full and complete was the deity of the incarnate
                        Christ? John 1:1. See also Col. 1:15-19; 2:9; Heb. 1:1-3, 8.

                        How full and complete was the humanity of the incarnate
                        Christ? John 1:14. See also Heb. 2:14, 17; Phil. 2:5-8.

                           Sin alienated man from his Creator, severing his connection
                        with the source of life; but the reunion of divinity with hu-
                        manity at Christ's birth made it possible for humanity to be
                        united again with divinity. Thus the incarnation was essential
                        to salvation, for it bridged the gap between the sinner and God.

                           The purpose of Christ's mission to earth is described in sev-
                        eral ways in the Bible. Paul says that Christ gave Himself
                        as "an offering and a sacrifice to God." Eph. 5:2. And again,
                        that He "gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from
                        all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people." Titus
                        2:14. He came "to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
                        of God" (2 Cor. 4:6) and to "bear witness unto the truth."
                        John 18:37.
                         How did our Lord Himself describe the purpose of His
                         mission to earth? John 10:10.

                            When Adam and Eve were created, they were candidates
                         for eternal life; but they sinned and lost this privilege. Christ
                         came to restore this life to any who choose to accept it. Like
                         a criminal who is pardoned, or a sick man who is cured, so
                         the sinner can have life and can have it even more abundantly
                         than did Adam and Eve, without sin, and without fear of
                         death.
                            Read again John 10:9, 10 and note how the phrases used
                         to describe the safety of God's children are drawn from the
                         Old Testament. Compare verse 9, on entering in and going
                         out, with Num. 27:17 and Deut. 28:6. We may feel like Sol-
                         omon, "I know not how to go out or come in" (1 Kings 3:7),
                         but we hear a Greater than Solomon saying, "By Me if any
                         man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
                         find pasture."
                         Whom did Jesus name as the objects of His mission to
                         earth? Luke 19:10.

       1 Peter 2:21-23   Him that judgeth righteously."

                           Jesus took man's nature but not man's sinfulness. There
                         was nothing in Him that responded to sin. This has raised
                         endless discussion, some of it good, some of it unprofitable. A
                         few questions may be helpful here:
                            Was Jesus subject to the laws of heredity that affect
                         every human being?

                           ."Like every child of Adam He accepted the results of the

                         page 49.
                             Was Jesus a normal child, or was He supernaturally
                         gifted above all others?

                           "He gained knowledge as we may do. . . . Every child may
                         gain knowledge as Jesus did."—Ibid., p. 70.
                            Was He perfect throughout His whole life?

                           "At each stage of His development He was perfect, with
                         the simple, natural grace of a sinless life."—Christ's Object
                         Lessons, page 83. Compare 2 Cor. 5:21—"knew no sin."
                            Was Jesus tempted to sin?

                           He was "tempted like as we are, yet without sin." Heb. 4:15.
                         Though tempted, He had no bias or propensity toward sin.
                           "He could have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for
                         one moment was there in Him an evil propensity."—Ellen G.

                             "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to
                         God by the death of His Son, much more, being recon-

                             "And not only so, but we also joy in God through our
                         Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
         Rom. 5:8-1 1    atonement."

                            In verse 7 of this chapter Paul states that a righteous man
                         might give his life for another good man. But Christ gave
                         His life for us "while we were yet sinners," enemies, traitors,
                         rebels. What greater demonstration of love could be given?
                            Notice this sequence: we are justified by His blood (verse
                         9) ; reconciled by His death (verse 10) ; saved by His life (verse
                         10). By His death we are justified and reconciled to God. Then
                         God can work in us to perfect the character that is needed if
                         we are to be saved in His kingdom.
                         Is God reconciled to man, or is man reconciled to God?
                         Verse 10.

                            In another text Paul says, "God was in Christ, reconciling
                         the world unto Himself." 2 Cor. 5:19. See also Eph. 2:16;
                         Col. 1:20. Nowhere in the Bible is it said that God has to be
                         reconciled to man. God hates sin, but His love for sinners is
                         so great that He spared nothing to bring about a reconciliation.
                         Christ died, not to win God over to man, but to win man back
                         to God.
                         How fully did Christ accept the responsibility for our sins
                         and reconcile us to God? 2 Cor. 5:21.

 THINK IT THROUGH Should the Christian attempt to be reconciled to his ene-
                mies? Why?

      1 Cor. 15:19-22    be made alive."
                             About twenty-five years after Christ's ascension Paul wrote
                         to the Corinthians and recounted the arguments for the resur-
                         rection of Jesus. "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain;
                         ye are yet in your sins." 1 Cor. 15:17. This would make the
                         Christian the most miserable of all men. Verse 19. His point
                         is this: If Christ had not risen from the dead, all our religion
                         is in vain; for He cannot save us from our sins. And this is
                         the one thing for which we need a savior. Without His resur-
                         rection, there can be no redemption. Without the resurrec-
                         tion, there is no reconciliation. Without the resurrection, there
                         is no life eternal.
                         What triumphant declaration did Paul make concerning
                         Christ's resurrection? Verse 20.
                            This term "firstfruits" is in reference to the ancient custom
                         of waving the first sheaf of the barley harvest before the Lord.
                         As the wave sheaf was a pledge of the bountiful harvest to
                         follow, likewise Christ's death and resurrection is our guaran-
                         tee that we shall be made alive in Him.
                         At His ascension what comforting assurance was given
                         to His disciples? Acts 1:9-11.

                       that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time
        Heb. 4:14-16   of need."

                          When Jesus ascended into heaven, He sat down at the right
                       hand of God (Heb. 1:3) and entered into His priestly work.
                       The work of Christ on earth was completed, but it was still
                       necessary for Him to apply to each individual the benefits of
                       the atonement.
                       Why is Christ worthy to be our High Priest? Verse 15.
                       What is His priestly work? Heb. 2:17; 7:25; 9:24.

                          Christ our High Priest is able to love and sympathize with
                       us in the most perfect, complete, godlike way possible. He suf-
                       fers with the struggling Christian. Verse 15. This is why we can
                       "come boldly unto the throne" (verse 16), fully expecting all
                       the graces that are available to us there. As the sinner ap-
                       proaches the throne of grace, he sees the lovely, sinless char-
                       acter of Jesus. He becomes aware of how Jesus dealt with
                       temptation and recognizes this as the godlike way to act. In
                       contrast, he sees his own utter sinfulness; and, casting himself
                       before the throne, he pleads for the forgiveness of sin. Then our
                       "merciful and faithful high priest" makes "reconciliation for
                       the sins," and the sinner is made right with God.

"All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to HiMself by Jesus Christ, and
hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, rec-
onciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
committed unto us the word of reconciliation." 2 Cor. 5:18, 19.

                      times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires
                      of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the
          Eph. 2:1-3 children of wrath, even as others."

                            According to Paul the miserable condition of a man living
                         in sin can be described as follows:
                            1. He is condemned. Verse 1. Because he is cut off from
                                God, the fountain of life, he is already considered as
                                "dead in trespasses and sin." He has nothing to look
                                forward to but death.
                            2. He is a slave. Verse 2. The sinner must live according to
                                the dictates of Satan, the "prince of the power of the
                                air." There is no freedom in sin.
                            3. He is controlled by lust. Verse 3. The sinner's "conversa-
                                tion" (better translated "conduct") is determined by the
                                wishes of his lustful flesh rather than by the higher dic-
                                tates of his spiritual nature. See Gal. 5:19-21; Rom.
                               1:24-32.
                            It is no wonder that Paul goes on in verse 12 of Ephesians
                         2 to describe the sinner as an alien and stranger "having no
                         hope, and without God in this world."
                         What is the attitude of the unregenerate heart toward
                         God and spiritual things? Rom. 1:21-23; 8:7, 8.
                         Why has the sinner become alienated from God? Eph.
                         4:18, 19.

               Part 2     "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us
                       to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the min-
         THE GREAT istry of reconciliation;
        RECONCILER        "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world
                       unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them;
      2 Cor. 5:18, 19 and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."

                           Did you notice that Paul repeats in verse 19 what he has just
                        said in verse 18? Let it be said over and over again. We have
                        been reconciled to God by Jesus Christ. Out of heaven itself
                        came the Saviour to work the greatest miracle of all history,
                        the saving of a lost world. See Col. 1:19, 20. Jesus Christ did
                        not come to appease God by making a sacrifice to His wrath.
                        Rather, God took the initiative, for "God was in Christ, rec-
                        onciling the world unto Himself." 2 Corinthians 5:19.
                            Jesus died in the place of the sinner and for his mistakes.
                        The enmity that resulted from the sinner's violation of the
                        law was set aside, and reconciliation between the sinner and
                        his God became a reality. It is proper, then, to say that God
                        is the author, man is the object, and the death of Christ is the
                        medium, of reconciliation.
                        What responsibility has been committed to those who
                        are already reconciled? Verses 18, 19, last parts.

                         What causes great joy in heaven? Luke 15:7, 10.

 THINK IT THROUGH Why doesn't God allow sinners to go their own way with-
                   out interference?

               Part 3     "But God commendeth His love toward us, in that,
                      while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
          REUNITED        "Much more then, being now justified by His blood,
       BY HIS DEATH we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
                         "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled
                      to God by the death of His Son, much more, being recon-
                      ciled, we shall be saved by His life.
                          "And not only so, but we also joy in God through our
                      Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
         Rom. 5:8-11 atonement."

                           Notice that we were reconciled to God by the death of
                        Christ "when we were enemies." Verse 10. This does not mean
                        that God made Himself our enemy. We made ourselves ene-
                        mies of God. God did not need reconciling, but man did.
                           The reconciliation is described in several ways in the Bible.
                        Paul speaks of it as "redemption through His blood" (Eph.
                        1:7), and as "reconciliation for the sins of the people" (Heb.
                        2:17). In 1 John 4:10 we read that God sent His Son to be
                        "the propitiation for our sins," and in Romans 5:11 it is said
                        that through Jesus Christ "we have now received the atone-
                        ment." Different words are used, but all describe the same
                        process that brings us together again with our Father-God.
                        See 1 Peter 3:18.
                        How should the Christian react to his reconciliation?
                        Verse 11.

 THINK IT THROUGH 1. Why do we need to be reconciled?
                 2. How could the death of one man make atonement for
                    the sins of the whole world?

                         "For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted,
      Heb. 2:17, 18 He is able to succor them that are tempted."

                           Hebrews 2:9-18 portrays a wonderful unfolding of the work
                        of Jesus Christ in reconciling sinners to God. The writer begins
                        by describing how Jesus came to this earth that He might
                        "taste death for every man." Verse 9. He was made "perfect
                        through sufferings" (verse 10) ; He was not ashamed to call
                        us brethren (verse 11). By His death He destroyed "him that
                        had the power of death, that is, the devil." Verse 14. Now He
                        has become "a merciful and faithful High Priest . . . , to make
                        reconciliation for the sins of the people." Verse 17.
                           Christ died for the entire world (see 2 Cor. 5:19), but each
                        individual must make his own personal reconciliation with God
                        through faith in Jesus Christ. This work of reconciliation is
                        the work which Jesus has entered into as our High Priest.
                        How did the sufferings of Christ fit Him for His priestly
                        work? Heb. 2:18.

                          "Christ must become man so completely and fully that it
                        can never be said that He is a stranger to any temptation, any
                        sorrow, any trial or suffering that men must pass through."—

                            Israel was God's "peculiar people." Deut. 26:18. He chose
                         them for "a special people unto Himself, above all people that
                         are upon the face of the earth." Deut. 7:6. It could be ex-
                         pected that they would accept Christ with open arms. But they
                         denied Him. They turned Him out and gave Him over to the
                         Gentiles. They had Him put to death in a manner of deep
                         disgrace. "His own received Him not."
                            But not all failed Him, and "as many as received Him"
                         were given the opportunity to become the sons of God. A per-
                         son's salvation does not depend on the race, nation, or church
                         to which he belongs. It is a gift to the one who believes on
                         the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and accepts by faith the
                         promise of salvation through Him.

                           This can also be translated "keep on growing." We are to
                         grow in both grace and knowledge, and to keep it up. "Those
                         who believe the truth are to be newly converted every day."

                         accepting the power that comes from God we become sons of
                         God, members of the divine family. See 1 John 3 :1; Rom. 8:14.

                     what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of
        Rom. 12:1, 2 God."

                           Here Paul brings theology down to practical terms. The
                        phrase "a living sacrifice" comes from the Old Testament Le-
                        vitical law and is used by Paul to contrast the sacrifice of a
                        lamb with the sacrifice of a living believer. In the Old Testament
                        the sacrifices were killed, but under the new way of life we are
                        "dead with Christ," so far as sin is concerned, and "alive unto
                        God." See Rom. 6:8-11.
                        What does Paul caution us against? Rom. 12:2, first part.

                           Another translation reads, "Don't let the world around you
                        squeeze you into its own mold." Phillips. But if we are hot to
                        conform to the world, what should we do? "Be ye transformed
                        by the renewing of your mind." This is grace in action. The
                        sinner is taken from his degraded position and transformed
                        into a new individual, acceptable to the perfect will of God.
                        What is the result of the transforming power of God in
                        the life? Gal. 5:22, 23.

                           It is interesting to compare these nine qualities with similar
                        lists in 2 Peter 1:5-7; Col. 3:12; 2 Tim. 3:10. When grace
                        comes into the life of a man, he will 'be transformed and,
                        brought into an intimate fellowship with God which.it is the
                        privilege only of the Christian to know. See Phil73:9, 10.

                Part 1   "From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say,
                      Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
       THE KINGDOM       "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is
        ESTABLISHED come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our
                      God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our
                      brethren is cast down, which accused them before our
                      God day and night.
                         "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
          Matt. 4:17 and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not
       Rev. 12:10, 11 their lives unto the death."

                           The kingdom of heaven cannot be clearly understood by
                         comparing it with earthly governments. His kingdom is a king-
                         dom of grace. Wherever the King is, wherever He rules with
                         grace and power, that is where His kingdom is to be found.
                         Thus when Jesus came it was very appropriate to say, "The
                         kingdom of heaven is near," for the King Himself was very
                         near. See Matt. 3:2; 12:28; Luke 16:16.
                         By what event was the permanent establishment of the
                         kingdom of divine grace made possible? Heb. 2:14, 15.
                         How did the permanent establishment of the kingdom
                         change Satan's status? Rev. 12:10, 11.

                            At the cross two certainties were irrevocably established.
                         First, Christ was victorious in making an atonement for sin.
                         "Every barrier was then broken down which intercepted the
                         freest fullness of the exercise of grace, mercy, peace, and love

                         92, 1899. Second, "Satan saw that his disguise was torn away."
                         He stood revealed as a "murderer," and "the last link of sym-

              Part 2      "And when He was demanded of the Pharisees, when
                       the kingdom of God should come, He answered them and
           NATURE      said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
  OF THE KINGDOM          "Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, be-
     Luke 17:20, 21    hold, the kingdom of God is within you."

                          The Jews looked forward with longing and anticipation to
                       the coming of the Messiah, for they felt that when He came
                       He would establish a glorious, visible kingdom here on earth.
                       Before Jesus came on the scene, the Jewish leaders had heard
                       John the Baptist preach that "the kingdom" was at hand.
                       Later, Christ Himself had proclaimed that the kingdom was
                       near. By now several years had passed, but a physical literal
                       kingdom was not in sight. The Pharisees came to Jesus and
                       chided Him with His failure to produce the kingdom He had
                       promised. See verse 20.
                       How did Jesus reply to the Pharisees? Verse 21.

                          "The Pharisees sit in their observation towers in vain; the
                       kingdom, being spiritual and internal, comes right under their
                       noses, and with their unspiritual eyes they never see a thing
                       of it or of its coming."—R. C. H. Lenski, The Interpretation
                       of Luke's Gospel, page 882.
                          The Revised Standard Version translates the last part of
                       Luke 17:21 as "the kingdom of God is in the midst of you."
                       This rendering avoids the idea that the kingdom was in the
                       hearts of the Pharisees.
                       How did Jesus explain the nature of His kingdom to
                       Pilate? John 18:36.

 THINK IT THROUGH Has the kingdom of grace been established in my life?
                  My home? My church?

                Part 3      "Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The
                         kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed,
           LIKE UNTO which a man took, and sowed in his field:
     A MUSTARD SEED         "Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is
                         grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a
                         tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the
       Matt. 13:31, 32 branches thereof."

                             Christ chose the smallest seed that was ordinarily planted
                         in ancient gardens to illustrate the phenomenal growth of the
                         kingdom of God. It was difficult for the disciples to under-
                         stand how the kingdom could increase. They were but a

                         of the world. But even as the mustard seed grows from such
                         a small beginning to a full-grown bush the size of a tree, so
                         the kingdom of God has grown from its humble beginnings to
                         its magnificent outreach today. See Christ's Object Lessons,
                         pages 77, 78.
                         What other parable illustrates the nature and purpose of
                         the kingdom of God's grace? Matt. 13:33.

                             While the mustard seed represents the extensive growth of
                         God's kingdom, the parable of the leaven describes the inten-

           John 3:3-5    into the kingdom of God."

                            Nicodemus, a Jewish official, Pharisee, and member of the
                         Sanhedrin, came secretly to Jesus inquiring of the kingdom
                         of God. Christ's answer was straight and startling: "Except
                         a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." This
                         was a devastating blow to Nicodemus. What higher birth could
                         he have than to be born a son of Abraham in Palestine the
                         Promised Land! What about his parentage, birth, position,
                         prestige—? Was all this worthless?
                         How did Nicodemus reply to Christ's statement? Verse 4.

                            Birth is the beginning of life. To be "born again" is to start
                         life over. At our first birth we are born corrupt, sinful, subject
                         to death. See Rom. 5:12. If we are to inhabit the kingdom of
                         God, we must be born again from above. The natural man
                         must become a spiritual man. We must be changed from enemies
                         of God (Rom. 8:7) to friends of God. We must be born again.
                         What is man's part in the new-birth experience? John
                         1:12, 13.

                        hand," had raised the hopes of the people to a high pitch—
                        hopes that He might indeed be the One to conquer Rome. In
                        this great declaration of the principles and laws of His king-
                        dom, Jesus gave a succession of blessings listing the qualities
                        that should be found in those who belonged to His kingdom.

                        of loving fellowship and the very real and intense satisfaction
                        that comes from serving God is greater by one hundredfold
                        than anything he has lost. See Ps. 37:16; Prov. 15:16; 16:8;
                        2 Cor. 6:10; 1 Tim. 6:6. In addition to all this he will have

                        infinitely more than any loss that is suffered here. See 2 Cor.
                        4:17.

        Rom. 3:10-12     not one."

                             Paul very clearly expresses in this passage why men need
                         to be justified. We are all born guilty: "There is none righteous
                         . . . there is none that doeth good." Every man is born with
                         tendencies to evil and is placed in a world where he is sur-
                         rounded with wickedness. He is destined to be a sinner. The
                         odds are stacked against him. This is man's hopeless condition.

                         1:21-24.

                         In what other words does Paul emphasize man's sinful
                         condition? Rom. 3:23.

                            Another writer translates this verse as: "Everyone has
                         sinned; everyone falls short of the beauty of God's plan." Phil-

        Rom. 3:24-26    in Jesus."

                           In Romans 3:10-23 Paul describes the hopeless condition of
                        the sinner: "there is none righteous" (verse 10) ; "there is none
                        that doeth good" (verse 12) ; "there is no fear of God" (verse
                        18) ; "all have sinned" (verse 23). But he does not leave us
                        on this discouraging note. In verse 24 he assures us that despite
                        our sinful condition we can be "justified freely by His grace."
                        How does the sinner receive this free gift? Verse 26.

                          A man has nothing in himself of which he can boast. See
                        verse 27. If he is to be made right with his Creator, it must
                        be by an act of God, His own gift, not by any works which
                        man can do.
                        How did Christ earn the right to impute His righteousness
                        to us? Rom. 5:19.

                           All are sinners, but all can become righteous because of
                        God's free gift which justifies the sinner through Jesus Christ.
                        See Rom. 5:16-18. How can the Judge of heaven and earth be
                        just and yet declare righteous any sinner who cries out to
                        Him? Only because Jesus Christ perfectly satisfied God's jus-

                            Abraham, called in the Bible the "friend of God" has left
                         on record a notable example of faith in his offering of Isaac.
                         It was promised to him that he would be "a father of many
                         nations." Gen. 17:5. The Jews called him their father (John
                         8:39), and in James 2:21 he is called "our father," that is, the
                         father of all Christians. Thus, when Paul wishes to give an
                         illustration from the Old Testament of justification by faith
                         alone, he naturally turns to Abraham, the spiritual father of
                         all who believe in God.
                         Upon what basis was Abraham declared righteous? Rom.
                         4:3.

                            The word "counted" recalls Gen. 15:6, which is sometimes
                         called the most important verse in the Old Testament: "He
                         believed in the Lord; and He counted it to him for righteous-
                         ness." "Counted," "reckoned," "imputed," all are from the
                         same Greek word signifying an act of God resulting in the
                         sinner's justification.
                         How does Paul describe the process by which the righ-
                         teousness of Christ is transferred to the sinner? Verse 5.

                          What was God's response to the two prayers? Verse 14.

  THINK IT THROUGH Is there a danger that some Christians today might think

"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him: rooted
and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abound-

                        "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus

      Phil. 3:12-15 shall reveal even this unto you."

                           Paul had been a Christian for many years when he wrote
                        this passage; yet at no point during those years did he say,
                        "I am sinless," or "I have reached the goal." Rather, he is
                        pushing forward "if that I may apprehend that for which also
                        I am apprehended of Christ Jesus." To be apprehended by
                        Christ means to be seized and held by Him. Here Paul refers
                        to his conversion. This is the moving power in his life. Now
                        his only goal is to fulfill the ideal that Christ had for him.

                        13.

                           Paul is not ashamed of his past life as a Christian. But he
                        cannot be satisfied with what he has done. He must press on
                        toward the goal which is continually advancing before him.
                        Akbar, the ancient Mogul emperor, said, "I have lived a long

      1 Tim. 6:11, 12 profession before many witnesses."

                            Paul often used vigorous terms in speaking of the Christian
                         life: "flee," "follow after," "fight," "lay hold of." In the pre-
                         vious verses he warned Timothy of the dangers of seeking
                         after material security. See verses 3-10. He says, "Flee these
                         things" which would keep the Christian back, and "lay hold
                         on eternal life."
                             It is not enough that a man of God flee evil things. The
                         evil must be replaced with good. Verse 11. We are to "hunger
                         and thirst" for righteousness (Matt. 5:6) ; we are to live "in
                         all godliness and honesty" (1 Tim. 2:2) ; we are to exercise
                         faith (Heb. 10:38) ; we are to remember that all other quali-
                         ties are but meaningless noise without love (1 Cor. 13:1) ; we
                         are reminded that we need patience and endurance (James
                         1:3) ; meekness is a virtue which we should feel in our heart
                         in relation to God and His work (Matt. 5:5). The Christian
                         is to fight the fight of faith. But this fight is a "good fight,"
                          for we have a worthy cause. We are in the right. Satan is in
                          the wrong. More than this, the good fight is a "fight of
                          faith." Our weapons are not of our own making. Salvation
                         is of the Lord, not men.
                         How only can we be assured of victory? Col. 2:6, 7.

                         In what other words does Paul describe the work of sanc-

                            It is the lot of every Christian to "fall into divers tempta-
                         tions," but this is not to be a source of discouragement. "Count
                         it all joy," says James, for the "trying of your faith worketh
                         patience." The word "patience" is from a Greek term which
                         means steadfastness or endurance. It emphasizes not merely
                         passive submission but an active staying power that makes us
                         triumphant over our temptations. See Rom. 2:7; Heb. 10:36.
                         What example of character transformation is seen in one
                         of Christ's disciples? Mark 3:17; John 13:23.

                            "John did not naturally possess the loveliness of character
                         that his later experience revealed. By nature he had serious
                         defects. He was not only proud, self-assertive, and ambitious
                         for honor, but impetuous, and resentful under injury. He and
                         his brother were called 'sons of thunder.' Evil temper, the
                         desire for revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the

                            Another outstanding example of divine discipline and its
                         consequences is found in the life of Jacob. Without the long

                           Extensive wardrobes went with wealth in the East, and
                        great honor was attached to wearing a robe worn and given

                        alty. In the parable of the wedding feast the king provided

                        possessed, they clearly did not find salvation by their works.
                        Paul commends them that they have a "zeal of God," but this
                        zeal was not "according to knowledge." Jesus Christ came to
                        the Jews and proved Himself to be the Son of God, giving
                        them the most convincing evidence of His Messiahship. Yet
                        they refused to accept Him. They shut their eyes against the
                        truth, and their zeal for the law became blind groping.
                        What errors led the Jews to reject the righteousness of-
                        fered by God? Verse 3.

                         Into what danger are we likely to fall today if we do
                         not submit to God's righteousness? Rev. 3:17.

                           This text reveals the inevitable delusion which accompanies
                        self-righteousness. "Self-righteousness is not true righteousness,
                        and those who cling to it will be left to take the consequences
                        of holding a fatal deception."—Christ's Object Lessons, page

                             There will doubtless be many excluded from heaven who
                         thought themselves well-suited because of their own good
                         works. But in the day of judgment they find that they are not

                           We have studied in this lesson what is involved in the
                        miracle of spiritual growth. Now we turn to a number of texts
                        which describe the end result of sanctification: "Not having
                        spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing." Eph. 5:27. "That ye
                        may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God." Col.
                        4:12. "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
                        glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory
                        to glory." 2 Cor. 3:18. "To the end He may stablish your
                        hearts unblamable in holiness before God." 1 Thess. 3:13.
                           The last quotation is in the form of a prayer in which Paul
                        requests two things. First, he desires that the Thessalonians
                        might "increase and abound in love one toward another, and
                        toward all men." Verse 12. Love is an evidence that the miracle
                        of spiritual growth is taking place in the life. The closer we
                        come to Jesus Christ, the more loving we will be toward our
                        fellowmen. Second, he prays that they might be established
                        "unblamable in holiness." Verse 13. The more we grow in
                        grace, the more we are established and confirmed in God's way
                        of life.

     Heb. 10:38 to 11:1 evidence of things not seen."

                            Two blind men came to Jesus one day asking for mercy,
                         which to them could only mean the restoration of their sight.
                         Jesus asked them, "Believe ye that I am able to do this?"
                         They answered Him, "Yea, Lord." Then He touched their eyes
                         and said, "According to your faith be it unto you." Matt.
                         9:28, 29.
                            Our capacity to receive the boundless blessings of heaven is
                         determined by our faith in Him. We may be just as much in
                         need of divine mercy as were these blind men. Are we spiritu-
                         ally impoverished, defeated, unfruitful in service, or unhappy
                         in soul, in home, in church, or in society? Are we "wretched,
                         and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked"? Rev. 3:17.
                         Then we also must cry out for mercy, and God will say to us,
                         "According to your faith be it unto you."
                         What is faith? Heb. 11:1.

                            This outstanding text does not really give us a formal defini-
                         tion of faith, but rather a description of what it does for the
                         believer. The Greek word hupostasis, translated "substance," is
                         used in the ancient papyri when referring to the legal docu-
                         ments by which a person proved his ownership of property.
                         Obviously the documents were not the actual property, but
                         they provided evidence of its existence and of his right to it.
                         Accordingly, hupostasis might here be rendered "title deed"—
                         faith is the title deed of things hoped for.
                            The word translated "evidence" means "proof," "convic-
                         tion." Genuine faith rests upon a firm underlying "substance"
                         of sufficient evidence to warrant confidence in what is not yet
                         seen.
 THINK IT THROUGH To what does Paul compare faith? Eph. 6:16; 1 Thess.
                5:8.

                            The heavy Roman shield was large enough to protect the

                         leather or metal coat worn to protect the body.




   "Faith looks beyond the difficulties,        "Genuine faith is life. A living faith

              Part 2     "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see

 AN ESSENTIAL GIFT he pleased God.
                         "But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for
                     he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that
       Heb. 11:5, 6 He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."

                          Faith is an essential gift, for "without faith it is impossible
                       to please Him." God is infinite, divine; we are mortal, finite.
                       Consequently there are many things which we cannot know
                       about God unless we accept them by faith. To take God at
                       His word is the most exalted exercise that the human mind
                       can perform.
                       What two things are we to believe about God? Verse 6.

                          Compare Heb. 11:6 with Rom. 1:17 and Rom. 5:2. Note
                       the reasoning in these texts: (a)- It is impossible (a strong
                       word used also in Heb. 6:4, 18) to come to God without faith
                       (Heb. 11:6). (b) The righteousness of God in the gospel "is
                       revealed through faith for faith" (Rom. 1:17, RSV) ; that is,
                       faith leads us progressively near to God. (c) It is by faith that
                       we have access into the grace of God and by faith we con-
                       tinue to "stand" and rejoice in the glorious hope. Rom. 5:2.
                       Faith gets us started, provides the power, and clears the way
                       to God.
 THINK IT THROUGH Why is God so insistent that we have faith in Him?
                  How can we develop faith in a God whom we have never

                           Some have concluded that this passage contradicts Paul's
                        teaching that a man shall live by faith alone. However, James
                        is not saying that works save a person, but that the test of
                        one's faith is his actions. Paul is talking of justification; James
                        is talking of morality. True religion is both devotion and duty.
                        Profession without practice is not enough. James argues his
                        point by saying that a man of faith would not tell a starving
                        person that he ought to eat and then allow him to walk away
                        without giving him food. How could a person who would do
                        this have real faith in a God who gave His life for humanity?
                        True faith produces a corresponding practice.
                        What does Paul say is the condition of faith that does
                        not work? Verse 17.

              Part 4       "So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
                       word of God."
        THE SOURCE         "Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our

                       the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the

                          How do we obtain faith? (1) "Faith cometh by hearing ...
                       the Word of God." Rom. 10:17. Genuine faith is not a blind
                       groping about in the absence of adequate evidence. True faith
                       is a conviction that is founded upon knowledge based upon
                       the Word of God. See 2 Tim. 3:15. (2) Jesus is "the Author
                       and Finisher of our faith." Heb. 12:2. If we read the Scrip-
                       tures with an honest heart, we will become established in our
                       faith in Jesus as He is revealed to us. He becomes then not
                       only the Author of faith but the Finisher. He will fill us with
                       faith, keep us in the faith, and finally reward our faith. (3)
                       Faith is a "fruit of the Spirit." Gal. 5:22. It is by the Spirit
                       that Christ is made to "dwell in your hearts by faith." Eph.
                       3:17.
                       What does our faith enable Christ to do in and for us?
                       Gal. 2:20.

                             In Matthew 6:19-21 Jesus discredits the accumulation of
                          worldly goods. He indicates that it is far more valuable to store
                          up treasure in heaven than on earth. The Christian should not
                          be indolent in providing for the needs of his family (1 Thess.
                          4:11; 1 Tim. 5:8), but if the accumulation of material wealth
                          becomes the focal point of life, then the emphasis is wrong.
                          How, then, can we be sure that the necessities of life will be
                          provided us? The answer is found in Matt. 6:31-33.
                          What is to be the Christian's first desire? Verse 33.

                              The Christian should realize that anxiety is wasted energy
                          if it is directed to such things as lie beyond his control. There
                          are some things which should be left to God to care for. It will
                          be a joyful surprise to find how all of life fits into place and
                          everything is provided for when we seek first the kingdom of
                          God and His righteousness.

       1 Peter 5:6, 7   you."

                           This passage is an allusion to Ps. 55:22: "Cast thy burden
                        upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee." Compare Ps. 37:5.
                        How is it that we can cast all our care upon God without
                        fear? Because "He careth for you." 1 Peter 5:7. God is willing
                        to take from us all our care because He loves us. What we
                        fear, He will either remove or give us added strength to bear.
                        He will order all events so as to convince us of His tender,
                        fatherly love toward us. No evil, no danger, shall come to us
                        but that it shall be for our best good. Rom. 8:28.
                        What further assurance is given us of God's care? Heb.
                        13:5.

                           The author here takes a promise made to several of the
                        greatest men of the Old Testament (see Gen. 28:15; Joshua
                        1:5; Gen. 26:24) and applies it, in strengthened words, to the
                        life of every Christian. Compare the promise in similar form
                        in 1 Chron. 28:20 and Isa. 41:17. This teaching of a personal,
                        unchanging, faithful God runs all through the Bible. Can we
                        not with the psalmist express our faith and trust in our Father
                        in these words: "This God is our God forever and ever: He
                        will be our Guide even unto death." Ps. 48:14.
                        Where do we draw the line between unnecessary worry
                        and appropriate concern about the future?

 THINK IT THROUGH Do I really trust in God, or is this a meaningless concept

                         on such texts as Lev. 19:18. But they understood that "neigh-

                           No deeper thought on love was ever penned than the three

                        love for us? Eph. 3:17-19.

                            Jesus clearly indicates in this passage that sincere love for
                         Him will lead us to do whatever He asks us to do: "This is
                         the love of God, that we keep His commandments." 1 John

               Part 4        "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love

      ONE ANOTHER            "By'this shall all men know that ye are My disciples,
      John 13:34, 35     if ye have love one to another."

                            The new commandment that Jesus gave to His disciples
                         was not new in the sense that it never existed before. See Lev.
                         19:18. It was new because of the restored emphasis given to
                         it by Jesus and the new demonstration of love which the
                         disciples were encouraged to emulate.
                            At the time, the disciples found these words hard to under-
                         stand, but as they reflected upon them after the crucifixion
                         and resurrection they had a clearer conception of what Jesus
                         meant. They had witnessed with their own eyes the sufferings
                         of Christ in behalf of men. This demonstration of love pro-
                         duced a change in the lives of the disciples and the other
                         believers.
                             A writer declared with some astonishment in regard to these
                         early Christians, "They love each other even without being
                         acquainted with each other." And another scoffer said, "Their
                         Master has implanted the belief in them that they are all
                         brethren."
                         What strong incentive do we have for being merciful to
                         our fellowmen? Matt. 6:14, 15; Eph. 4:32.

                         What practical measure do we have by which to gauge
                         our love for others? Matt. 7:12.

                            It is not enough for a Christian to demonstrate his love for
                         God by obedience to the commandments. Sincere love for God
                         finds its truest expression in love for our fellowmen. See Christ's
                         Object Lessons, pages 384, 385.

                         "And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place,
                      came and looked on him, and passed by on the other

                         "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came

       Luke 10:30-34 brought him to an inn, and took care of him."

                           The parable of the Good Samaritan very aptly illustrates
                        the way in which sincere love for our fellowmen will find ex-

                        itan do for the wounded man? Verses 33, 34.

                        With what question did Jesus bring the parable to a
                        close? Verses 36, 37.

                           This was an actual occurrence that took place near the city
                        of Jericho. Both the priest and the Levite involved in the
                        story were present when Jesus told the story. See The Desire
                        of Ages, page 499. A Samaritan was the last person from whom

                        over and over in 1 Corinthians 13 the Greek word agape to
                        explain the nature and value of love. Agape refers to a love
                        that finds its source in God's love. It is a love directed not by
                        feeling but by principle.
                           Why is love the greatest gift? Because love makes us like
                        God, "for God is love." 1 John 4:8. "For love is of God; and
                        everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."
                        1 John 4:7.
                         What are the characteristics of love? 1 Cor. 13:4-8.

                            A noted Puritan preacher used to say that substituting our
                         individual name for "charity" in this passage (1 Cor. 13:4-8)
                         would make us all blush to think how far we fall short in the

                          salvation are promised only to 0"them that obey Him." Heb.

                          Matt. 7:22.

                          Of what is obedience to God's revealed will the visible
                          evidence? John 14:15, 23, 24.

                             The RSV translation of John 14:15 reads: "If you love
                          Me, you will keep My commandments." Obedience is a nat-
                          ural response when love controls the life, and only when the

                             "God's law is fulfilled only as men love Him with heart,
                          mind, soul, and strength, and their neighbor as themselves. It
                          is the manifestation of this love that brings glory to God in

                           John 5:30 in RSV reads: "I can do nothing of My own

                        who sent Me." The Son of mar during His earthly sojourn
                        was obedient to His Father's will in all things, as in the proph-
                        ecy: "I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea, Thy law is
                        within My heart." Ps. 40:8. We should remember that Jesus
                        here had been charged with "making Himself equal with God"
                        (John 5:18), and He is replying as the obedient Son, witness-
                        ing of His Father and His will.
                        What was Christ's purpose in coming to earth? John 6:38.

                           An example of Christ's obedience to the Father's will is seen
                        in Mark 14:36: "And He said, Abba, Father, all things are pos-
                        sible unto Thee; take away this cup from Me: nevertheless
                        not what I will, but what Thou wilt." Three times this prayer
                        was offered in the garden of Gethsemane. Each time the fate
                        of humanity trembled in the balance. Then came victory as
                        Christ breathed the prayer of submission, "Thy will be done."
                           "As Jesus rested by faith in the Father's care, so we are

                          thing that God requires."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 301,
                          How can this be? Because "the love of Christ constraineth
                          us." 2 Cor. 5:14. In Jesus divine love is linked to omnipotent
                          power. This divine, controlling love does for us "what the law
                          could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh." Rom 8:3,
                          What change will come in the life of a sinner who ac-
                          cepts Christ? 2 Cor. 5:17.

                          will of God? Rom. 8:3, 4.

                             This does not say that the law itself was weak, but rather
                          that it was "weak through the flesh." The law was actually
                          strong in pointing out sin. But it could not save the sinner.
                          The law became effective if a man, realizing his sinful condi-
                          tion, went to God and found forgiveness and grace in Christ.
                          1 Tim. 1:8; Gal. 3:24. Righteousness is obtained only through
                          Jesus Christ. "We can receive of heaven's light only as we
                          are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern the character

               Part 4 "But be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only,
                   deceiving your own selves.
           WHAT       "For if any be a hearer of the Word, and not a doer,
     GOD REQUIRES he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a
                   glass:
                      "For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and
                   straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
                      "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
                   continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but
                   a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his
     James 1:22-25 deed."

                           The thought expressed in James 1:22, 23 is very similar to
                        that of Paul in Rom. 2:13: "For not the hearers of the law
                        are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
                        This does not mean it is wrong to hear the Word of God.
                        Faith "cometh by hearing" and hearing is by the Word of God.
                        Rom. 10:17. The danger lies in hearing the Word but not
                        applying it to the life.
                        How did Jesus illustrate the danger of neglecting known
                        duty? Matt. 7:24-27; 21:28-32.

                          This same lesson is taught in James 4:17: "To him that
                        knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." A
                        man is judged according to what he knows to be right. The
                        omission of good deeds makes a person as guilty as the com-
                        mission of evil deeds.
                        What do men often substitute for obedience to God's ex-
                        pressed will? Mark 7:7-9.

                          Men may write their own human commandments, and they
                        may seek to obey them by the exercise of all the fanatical
                        zeal, willpower, and meticulous external observances of the
                        Pharisees, yet all their "obedience" is vanity.

                          "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for
                       His seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because
         1 John 3:6-9 he is born of God."

                            The tense of the verb in verse 9 above indicates that the
                         words "doth not commit sin" would be more accurately ren-
                         dered "does not continue to sin," or "does not habitually sin."
                         The Greek verb forms clearly do not mean that the one who
                         has been born of God will never again fall before temptation.
                         Rather, they imply that he has committed himself to a pattern
                         of life in which he makes no provision for sinning, that it is
                         his continuing firm purpose to live in harmony with that
                         commitment, and that his life gives marked evidence of in-
                         creasing freedom from sin.
                         If we are born of God, what kind of obedience will we
                         manifest? Rom. 6:17; Eph. 6:6.

                         How does Paul describe the new birth experience? Rom.
                         12:2.

                            Do people who know us intimately sense that we are
                         changed or transformed since becoming Adventists? Or is
                         there very little difference? Have we "obeyed from the heart"
                         (Rom. 6:17), or do we have the "form of godliness" without
                         "the power thereof" (2 Tim. 3:5)? See Testimonies, Vol. 1,

                      ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate
    1 John 1:9 to 2:1 with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."

                            Here is a positive statement of our guilt: "If we say that
                         we have not sinned, we make Him a liar." Notice, if we make
                         this claim, we are doing more than just lying, more than
                         simply deceiving ourselves. We are making God a liar. Dare
                         we ever claim "not to have sin" when we realize the blas-
                         phemous nature of such a statement! However, even though
                         we are all sinners, God gives us strength to strive against sin.
                            Some might say that since God so readily forgives our sins,
                         let Him forgive a few more sins. To avoid this conclusion
                         John says, "These things write I unto you, that ye sin not."
                         His purpose is to get us away from the sin habit; but for one
                         who slips we have the assurance that Christ is "faithful and
                         just to forgive us our sins."
                            John has reference here to the washing away of the guilt
                         of sin: "The blood of Jesus Christ . . . cleanseth us from all
                         sin." 1 John 1:7. On this cleansing compare Acts 15:9; Eph.
                         5:26; Titus 2:14; and Rev. 1:5. It is the wonderful grace of
                         God that our sins with all their guilt are to be removed as far
                         as the East is from the West. Ps. 103:12; Isa. 43:25; 44:22;
                         Micah 7:9.
 THINK IT THROUGH What word in the last part of 1 John 2:1 describes the

                            Believers should not sin, but if the human instrument fails,
                         Jesus, our merciful and righteous Advocate, is ever ready to
                         accept the erring one and to renew His saving grace.

          THE IDEAL is in heaven is perfect."
     OF PERFECTION
          Matt. 5:48
                            In the Sermon on the Mount Christ presents a seemingly
                         impossible ideal: "Be ye therefore perfect." But notice this
                         statement in its context. In Matthew 5:43-48 Christ depicts
                         what it means to be like the Father. "Love your enemies," He
                         says, "that ye may be the children of your Father which is
                         in heaven." Jesus refers here to the Jewish practice of con-
                         sidering a Gentile as no better than a dog. A true Christian
                         will treat all men with respect as does God. Having said this
                         Jesus adds: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
                         which is in heaven is perfect."
                            God is to be our model. We are to follow Him in all His
                         perfections. This does not mean that we can reach complete
                         equality with God, for God's attributes are infinitely superior
                         to our finite virtues. But like God we can be fair and upright
                         in dealing with our enemies. Jesus describes the perfect in-
                         dividual as one who is completely committed to the law of
                         love and like God treats even his enemies with genuine love.
                            Unfortunately, the English word "perfect" does not ade-
                         quately express the meaning of the Greek word teleios used
                         in Matt. 5:48. In Biblical times this word could refer to an
                         animal without blemish or deformity or to someone who was
                         full-grown, mature, complete. It does not refer to absolute
                         sinlessness in this life. See Steps to Christ, page 62. A child
                         can be perfect for its age, a plant can be perfect for its stage
                         of maturation; but both grow, and graduated perfection marks
                         the developing life. See Christ's Object Lessons, pages 65, 66.

                          "Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
                       minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God
        Phil. 3:12-15 shall reveal even this unto you."

                            The word "perfect" is used with two different meanings
                         in Phil. 3:12-15. In verse 12 Paul denies being "already per-
                         fect." He has not yet reached that stage of holiness that God
                         wishes him to attain. But he presses on, like a runner straining
                         for a prize, seeking for "the high calling of God in Christ
                         Jesus." Verse 14.
                             In verse 15 he says: "Let us therefore, as many as be
                         perfect, be thus minded." Here the word "perfect" means
                         "mature Christians," people who are no longer "babes" that
                         need to be nursed in their Christian experience. While Paul
                         places himself among these mature individuals, he does not
                         mean that he or any other Christian of his day had reached
                         a stage of perfect holiness. This idea is excluded by the denial
                          found in verse 12. But some of the Philippians had, with Paul,
                          reached a level of spiritual maturity described in verse 15 as
                         "perfect."
                         How did Paul refer to certain Corinthian Christians?

                            The pathway to Christian maturity is illuminated by the
                         study of His Word. See Ps. 119:105. Or as Paul says, "Scrip-
                               . . . is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correc-
                         tion, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God
                         may be perfect." The word here translated "perfect" is from
                         a Greek word meaning "fitted," "equipped." As used in this
                         text, the perfect individual is one who through his study of
                         the Bible is fitted for all that is required of a man as a
                         Christian.
                         How is perfection made possible for the Christian? Heb.
                         13:20, 21.

                             Notice that perfection "in every good work" comes through
                         Jesus Christ. Such perfection does not come suddenly, for
                         Jesus "leads His people on step by step, purifying and fitting
                         them for translation."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 333. If perfec-
                         tion comes through Christ, the Living Word, it follows that
                         the inspired Written Word is an important aid to perfection,
                         because it presents the fullest revelation of "our Lord Jesus,
                         that great Shepherd of the sheep."
                            "The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ,
                         exists also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all 'given
                         by inspiration of God'; yet they are expressed in the words
                         of men and are adapted to human needs."—Testimonies, Vol.

                Part 4      "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with
                        so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every
             CHRIST weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and
        OUR EXAMPLE let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
                            "Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our
                        faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured
                        the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the
         Heb. 12:1, 2 right hand of the throne of God."

                            The runner who competes in a race often provided Paul
                         with an apt illustration of the Christian seeking eternal life.
                         See Gal. 2:2; Phil. 2:16; 1 Cor. 9:24-27. An athlete must put
                         forth every effort to win the contest that has been marked
                         out for him. Likewise, if we expect to be successful in achiev-
                         ing the goal, we must "run with patience the race that is set
                         before us." The word "patience" means "fortitude," "perse-
                         verance." We are to run "with patience" because this race is
                         not won till it is completed. It was not until the end of his
                         life that Paul could say, "I have 'finished the race." 2 Tim.
                         4:7, RSV. See also Heb. 10:36; Rev. 2:10.
                            "To win a perishable prize, the Grecian runners spared
                         themselves no toil or discipline. We are striving for a prize
                         infinitely more valuable, even the crown of everlasting life.
                         How much more careful should be our striving, how much
                         more willing our sacrifice and self-denial!"—The Acts of the
                         Apostles, page 312.
                          How did Jesus demonstrate the need for patient endur-
                          ance? Heb. 12:2.

                          What experiences contribute to our character develop-
                          ment? Heb. 2:10; 12:11; James 1:12.

                    How is this accomplished?

       OF MATURITY        "But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may
                       be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."
      James 3:2; 1:4;     "And above all these things put on charity, which is
           Col. 3:14 the bond of perfectness."
                            In the texts above can be found three marks of perfection
                         that will be seen in a growing Christian:
                             (1) Pure speech. James indicates that the maturing Chris-
                         tian should be careful about his speech. James 3:2. "We must
                         have perfect control over our own spirit. `If any man offend
                         not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle
                         the whole body.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 308.
                             (2) Patience. James 1:4 in the RSV reads: "Let steadfast-
                         ness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete."
                         This patience or steadfastness may be passive as under trial or
                         chastisement permitted by God. See Luke 21:19; 2 Cor. 6:4;
                         2 Tim. 3:10; Heb. 12:7. It may also be active, persistent, per-
                         severing, as in "well-doing." See Rom. 2:7 ; Luke 8:15.
                             (3) Love. The apostle Paul encourages the Christian to
                         "put on love, which binds everything together in perfect
                         harmony." Col. 3:14, RSV. "When consecrated believers as-
                         semble, their conversation will not be upon the imperfections
                         of others or savor of murmuring or complaint; charity, or
                         love, the bond of perfectness, will encircle them. Love to God
                         and their fellowmen flows out naturally in words of affection,
                         sympathy, and esteem for their brethren.—Testimonies, Vol.
                         1, p. 509.
                         What attitude will a mature Christian have toward the
                         problems of life? Acts 20:24; 2 Cor. 4:8-11.

 THINK IT THROUGH Should a Christian ever become discouraged? Is it a sin if
                   he does?




   "In Christ, God has provided means           "Let no one say, I cannot remedy my

                           In Eph. 4:13-15 Paul compares the church, Christ's mystical
                        body, with the human body. Like the physical body, the
                        church is to grow to a state of maturity or perfection in con-
                        trast to the childish state of immaturity. Verse 14. The task
                        of church leaders then is to assist church members to attain
                        unto full Christian maturity. This maturity is a fullgrown
                        manhood in faith and knowledge in contrast with the inexperi-
                        enced and immature faith of the spiritual child.
                           How does this growth come about? By growing "up into
                        Him, . . . even Christ." Take away Christ, and all that is left

        THE HOPE OF        "Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
     CHRIST'S COMING lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in
                       this present world;
                           "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious ap-

                             Because of the promises given by Jesus Himself, the "blessed
                         hope" of the second coming was very real to the early Chris-
                         tians. Christ repeatedly directed the minds of the disciples to
                         that glad reunion. Other writers of the New Testament made
                         it a major Christian teaching. "The hope whith is laid up for
                         you in heaven" (Col. 1:5) ; "The Lord Himself shall descend"
                         (1 Thess. 4:16) ; "This same Jesus . . . shall so come . . . as
                         ye have seen Him go" (Acts 1:11) ; "The Son of man shall
                         come in . . . glory" (Matt. 16:27).
                         What promise did, our Lord make with respect to His
                         return? John 14:1-3.

                            "Let not." The form of the verb in Greek implies, "stop
                         letting" your heart be troubled. Christ's going away was to
                         be the disciples' assurance that He would come again. See
                         Acts 1:11.
                            The word for "mansions" (monai) means "permanent abid-
                         ing places." Compare Ps. 23:6. "While He [Christ] was build-
                         ing mansions for them [the disciples], they were to build
                         characters after the divine similitude."—The Desire of Ages,

 THINK IT THROUGH Who will be ready for Jesus when He comes again? Heb.
                9:28.

                            The words "look for Him" literally mean, "wait it out
                         for Him," that is, keep on waiting until Christ actually appears.
                         Only those who patiently wait for Him now will be able to
                         say at His return, "Lo, this is our God; we have 'waited for
                         Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited

                       holy still.
                           "And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with
        Rev. 22:10-12 Me, to give every man according as his work shall be."

                             One purpose of Christ's coming is. to "give every man ac-
                          cording as his work shall be." Jesus uttered a similar prom-
                          ise: "The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father
                          with His angels; and then He shall reward every man accord-
                          ing to his, works." Matt. 16:27.
                             Reward is taught in the Scriptures as God's compensation
                          to the saints, rather than their motive in service: "In keeping
                          of them [God's commandments] there is great reward." Ps.
                          19:11. "He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."
                          Heb. 11:6. See also Ps. 58:11. In contrast to the reward of the
                          righteous is God's judgment on the wicked. To the one, He
                          gives "a crown of righteousness" (2 Tim. 4:8) ; to the other,
                          "sudden destruction" (1 Thess. 5:3).
                          What solemn announcement is made prior to Christ's
                          coming? Rev. 22:11.

                          At what exact time will the saints be given their reward?
                          2 Tim. 4:1,8.

                            When our Lord returns, His coming will be announced
                         "with a great sound of a trumpet" (Matt. 24:31), and He
                         will appear "as the lightning cometh out of the east, and
                         shineth even unto the west" (Matt. 24:27). "Behold, He corn-
                         eth with clouds," said John the Revelator; "and every eye
                         shall see Him." Rev. 1:7. From these verses it is clear that
                         His appearance will not be hidden away in some isolated place.
                         Every living human will see Him come in all the brilliance of
                         His heavenly glory.
                         What change will take place in the righteous at His com-
                         ing? 1 Cor. 15:51-54.

                            Corinth was full of pagan ideas about the life of the soul
                         after the death of the body; hence the Christian church in
                         that city needed explicit statements that set forth: (1) the resur-
                         rection of the whole being; (2) a sudden resurrection of the
                         dead at the Lord's coming; (3) the granting of immortality
                         and incorruptibility "in a moment," when "the trumpet shall
                         sound" and the Lord shall appear.

  THINK IT THROUGH Does Matt. 24:24 mean that many of the righteous will
                   be deceived by Satan before the coming of Christ?

                        "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as
    Matt. 24:42-44 ye think not the Son of man cometh."

                           Verse 44 goes beyond "ye know not what hour" of verse 42
                        and says: "In such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man
                        cometh." The one indicates ignorance of the time; the other,
                        surprise when it comes. The uncertainty as to the exact time
                        of the coming of Christ requires that every generation be in
                        perpetual readiness.

                           "Sinful man cannot cleanse himself; he is sold under sin

                        John 3:3; 15:4, 5; Rom. 8:7). Nevertheless, there is some
                        work that man, with divine aid, must do for himself (see on
                        Phil. 2:12, 13). This work demands diligent watching and
                        prayer (Eph. 6:13-18; Col. 4:2; Rev. 3:3). The central strug-
                        gle is to maintain faith in the victory that Christ has gained
                        for us, and to live believing that His grace is sufficient to give

                            A similar passage to the one above is 1 John 2:25: "And
                         this is the promise that He hath promised us, even eternal

                         of God's promise which was made "before the world began."
                         See also 1 Peter 1:20. "The plan of salvation had been laid
                         before the creation of the earth; for Christ is 'the Lamb slain

                         ets, page 63. The Christian's hope is sure, for it rests upon the
                         promise of the One who "cannot lie."
                         How did God restore the hope of everlasting life to sin-
                         ners? John 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:10.

                            Our assurance of resurrection is based upon the historical
                         fact that Jesus Christ Himself came forth from the tomb.
                         Without the resurrection of Christ salvation for the sinner

                         not been resurrected? 1 Cor. 15:14, 17-20.

                            "Now is Christ risen from the dead." This is the triumph
                         song of the church, and we should never lose its challenging

               Part 4    "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and
                      now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
 THE RESURRECTION God: and they that hear shall live."
        DESCRIBED        "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the
                      which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice,
                         "And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto
                      the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto
  John 5:25, 28, 29 the resurrection of damnation."

                           In His vivid account of the moment when He shall return
                        to this planet, Jesus describes "the Son of man coming in
                        the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." There is
                        "a great sound of a trumpet." Then the angels who have come
                        with Him "gather together His elect from the four winds, from
                        one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:30, 31.
                           Another description `wonders
                                                      the clouds of glory, the heavenly
                        angels, and the celestial wonders emphasizes the appearance of
                        Christ: "In solemn silence we all gazed on the cloud as it drew
                        nearer, and became lighter, glorious, and still more glorious,
                        till it was a great white cloud. 'The bottom appeared like
                        fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it were ten
                        thousand angels, singing a most lovely song; and upon it
                        sat the Son of man. His hair was white and curly and lay on
                        His shoulders, and upon His head were many crowns. His feet
                        had the appearance of fire; in His right hand was a sharp
                        sickle, in His left a silver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame
                        of fire, which searched His children through and through."
                        —Testimonies, Vol. 1. p. 60.
                        Which of the dead will be resurrected at this time?
                        1 Thess. 4:13-17.

                           Some modern theologians console the bereaved by assuring
                        that their departed loved ones are even now enjoying the bliss
                        of heaven. But if the Thessalonian believers who had fallen
                        asleep in Jesus were indeed in heaven, we may properly ask
                        why Paul did not console their living loved ones with this
                        reputed fact. If the apostle believed the righteous dead to be
                        already in heaven, he certainly missed a perfect opportunity
                        to enlighten and console the living.

 THINK IT THROUGH       If Christ were to come at this moment, would it bring fear
                        or joy to my heart?

                        mortal must put on immortality.
                           "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorrup-

                        shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death
      1 Cor. 15:51-54 is swallowed up in victory."

                           This is the end of the corruptible life that men have always
                        known. This is the moment when the universe is restored to
                        God's control and eternity is ushered in for all those who have
                        gained the "victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor.
                        15:57.
                         What is the signal for the dead to be raised? Verse 52.

                           The trumpet will announce Christ's coming as it did His
                        appearance at Sinai. See Ex. 19:16 and Matt. 24:31. "The
                        sound of a trumpet summoned Israel to meet with God. The
                        voice of the Archangel and the trump of God shall summon,
                        from the whole earth, both the living and the dead to the
                        presence of their Judge."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 339.
                           "Put on" (verse 54) is a metaphor which refers to clothing.
                        It is also used in 2 Cor. 5:2: "We groan, earnestly desiring to
                        be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven." The
                        kind of flesh and blood we now know are to be replaced by
                        immortal, incorruptible bodies. Each of the redeemed will re-
                        tain his own personal identity. See Christ's Object Lessons,

               Part 6     "And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear
                       as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of
         TOKENS OF the Lamb.
       IMMORTALITY        "In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of
                       the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve
                       manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and
                       the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the na-
         Rev. 22:1, 2 tions."

                           There was such a tree in the Garden of Eden which pos-
                        sessed a supernatural quality. With continued access to it man
                        would have lived forever, for its fruit perpetuated life. Because
                        of their disobedience Adam and Eve were no longer allowed to
                        stay in the garden, and that beautiful tree which held the key
                        to immortality was forbidden to the children of men. Later
                        God "transplanted the tree of life to the Paradise above,"
                        where it will remain with the saints throughout eternity as a
                        token of life everlasting. See Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 288.
                        What special function is performed by the tree of life?
                        Verse 2, last part.

                           There is an interesting use of the phrase "leaves of the tree"
                        in the The Ministry of Healing, page 122: "It is in these prom-
                        ises [in God's Word] that Christ communicates to us His grace
                        and power. They are leaves from that tree -which is 'for the

                        Nothing besides can impart the courage and faith which give
                        vital energy to the whole being."
                        What other tokens of immortality will be found in the

               Part 2    "When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and
                     all the holy angels with; Him, then shall He sit upon the
     THE KING AND throne of His glory:
      HIS SUBJECTS       "And before Him shall be gathered all nations: and
                      He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
                      divideth his sheep from the goats:
                         "And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the
                      goats on the left.
                         "Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand,
                      Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom pre-
     Matt. 25:31-34 pared for you from the foundation of the world."

                           The throne on which Christ sits is called both "the throne
                        of His glory" (verse 31) and "the throne of grace" (Heb.
                        4:16). The King of grace is also the King of glory, since He
                        is the dispenser of grace and also the executor of judgment.
                        With what gracious invitation will the King of glory wel-
                        come His subjects to their eternal home? Matt. 25:34.

                           Notice that the saints are called "ye blessed of My Father."
                        When Jesus promised a heavenly abode to His followers, He
                        spoke of it as His "Father's house" (John 14:2), and as the
                        "kingdom of their Father" (Matt. 13:43). It was not to come
                        by gradual progress, but suddenly, by a breaking in pieces of
                        earthly kingdoms. Dan. 2:31-43. It would last forever (Dan.
                        2 :44), and the redeemed would be with their Redeemer for-
                        ever. 1 Thess. 4:17. The saints are then nevermore to be sep-
                        arated from the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. See Early
                        Writings, page 110.
                        What honor will the saints have in the eternal kingdom?
                        Rev. 22:5; Matt. 13:43.

                Part 3      "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to

                         abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
      2 Peter 1:10, 11   Saviour Jesus Christ."
                            The RSV translates the words "give diligence" as "be the
                         more zealous." Diligence is often used in the Bible in connec-
                         tion with a saintly endeavor to do God's will. In Gal. 2:10 the
                         KJV speaks of forwardness in remembering the poor. In Eph.
                         4:3 it is rendered "endeavoring" in connection with keeping
                         "the unity of the spirit." In 2 Peter 3:14 it is applied to those
                         who should be "diligent" in seeking to be at peace with God
                         "without spot, and blameless."
                            How can we be diligent in seeking blamelessness? "As your
                         soul yearns after God, you will find more and still more of
                         the unsearchable riches of His grace. As you contemplate these
                         riches you will come into possession of them and will reveal
                         the merits of the Saviour's sacrifice, the protection of His
                         righteousness, the fullness of His wisdom, and His power to
                         present you before the Father 'without spot, and blameless.' "
                         —The Acts of the Apostles, page 567.
                         What reward awaits those who diligently seek to make
                         their calling and election sure? 2 Peter 1:11.

                         Through what experience will all pass who gain en-
                         trance to the kingdom of heaven? Acts 14:22; 2 Tim 2:12.

                           The word "suffer" in 2 Tim. 2:12 may be rendered "endure."
                         This is not referring to all forms of suffering, but suffering
                         "with Him," or for Christ's sake. See Rom. 8:17.
 THINK IT THROUGH Who are accounted worthy to become heirs of the king-
                  dom God has promised? 2 Thess. 1:4, 5.
                            Faith and patience are rungs in the ladder of Christian
                         progress in 2 Peter 1:5-7. See The Acts of the Apostles, pages
                         530-532. Persecution is not to be sought; but when it comes
                         in the line of Christian duty, its severity becomes a means of
                         developing the Christian graces of patience and faith. That
                         is God's way of thwarting Satan's destructive designs. What
                         is intended as a hardship becomes a road to the kingdom.

                          God will eventually destroy all those who endanger the lives
                       of the saints and the very existence of the universe. For this
                       reason the coming of Christ and the establishment of His king-
                       dom will be a time of joy for the saints but a time of great
                       "wailing and gnashing of teeth" for the wicked. God has suf-
                       fered long with sin. Now it is time that sin shall reign no
                       more. At the second coming the wrath of God shall be dis-
                       played "in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know
                       not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
                       Christ." 2 Thess. 1:8. Following the millennium the final de-
                       struction of the wicked will take place, when those who are
                       "not found written in the book of life" are "cast into the lake
                       of fire." Rev. 20:15.

                       What vivid contrast is apparent between the fate of the
                       wicked and the reward of the righteous? Matt. 13:42, 43.

                         Like the glory that broke forth upon Jesus at the time of
                       His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2), so the saints will "shine
                       forth as the sun." See also Dan. 12:3. This is a glorious scene
                       —the final coronation and enthronement of Christ, the saints
                       shining as the sun and taking possession of the new earth—
                       but it will be marred by the fate of those who have refused
                       to respond to the love of God. See Rom. 2:4-6.

                      Himself shall be with them, and be their God.
                         "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
                      and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
                      crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the
                      former things are passed away."
                         "And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that
                      defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or
                      maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's
      Rev. 21:2-4,27 book of life."
                           The Holy City comes "down from God out of heaven, pre-
                        pared as a bride adorned for her husband"; and, wonder of
                        wonders, God Himself will "dwell with them . . . and be their
                        God." All tears shall be wiped away, and "there shall be no
                        more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
                        be any more pain." How can this be? The answer is given
                        at the end of verse 4: "For the former things are passed
                        away." The curse has been removed, and sin shall be no more.
                           The eradication of sin is seen in the absence of death (1 Cor.
                        15:55, 56), as well as the strong evidence of Rev. 21:8; 22:3.
                        All earthly kingdoms have been destroyed and replaced by the
                        kingdom of glory. This kingdom will be everlasting because
                        of its sinlessness and the added gift of immortality which has
                        been given to its inhabitants. See Dan. 2:44. This is the land
                        of perfection longed for, dreamed of, and sought by the faith-
                        ful in every age.

                          One of the glorious privileges of the saints in the new earth
                       will be to live in the presence of God Himself. "The throne
                       of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; . . . and they shall see
                       His face." This reunion is brought about by the removal of
                       the curse that came upon this earth as a result of sin. Christ
                       "redeemed us from the curse . . . , being made a curse for
                       us." Gal. 3:13. The universe now beholds the full significance
                       of what Christ accomplished at Calvary. The saints are wel-
                       comed to the New Jerusalem, and they shall reign in glorious
                       union with God and with Jesus Christ.
                       For how long will this condition continue? Rev. 22:5. See
                       also Rev. 11:5.

                       What does Peter say of the stability of Christ's glorious
                       kingdom? 2 Peter 1:11.

                          The Greek word aiOnios, which in 2 Peter 1:11 is translated
                       "everlasting," actually means "eternal" and has a wider mean-
                       ing than just everlasting time. For instance, the eternal king-
                       dom includes all the world (Rev. 11:15) which "the prince
                       of this world" once ruled. The eternal kingdom is a kingdom
                       of righteousness, glory, and peace, and will transcend time and

         Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
    MARCH 28, 1970 • NORTHERN EUROPEAN DIVISION
   The Northern European Division is a far-flung one, embrac-
ing 120 million people in eight countries of Europe, 80 million peo-
ple in nine countries some 3,000 miles away in West Africa, and a
further 23 million in modern Ethiopia 2,000 miles across the con-
tinent and still proud to be remembered as the ancient land of the
Queen of Sheba. A project in each of these areas will benefit from
the warm-hearted giving of God's people around .the world.
    The new Empress Zauditu Memorial Hospital in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, will receive one third of the overflow from the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering. To what Sabbath School members will give on
March 28 will be added the help in many forms that has come from
all sides: from His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie, from
the public of Addis Ababa, from funds of the hospital itself, and
from the General Conference and the division. A well-planned hos-
pital building will stand as another monument to the fine medical
ministry of this church and its devoted workers.
    The opening of work in the unentered land of the Republic of
Upper Volta, in West Africa, is another project to benefit from the
overflow.
    The third project to benefit from the overflow is our training
school in Poland. Its facilities are limited, and there are a thousand
urgent needs if this little institution is to fulfill its purpose in train-
ing men and women to carry the message to Poland's 32 million
people.
