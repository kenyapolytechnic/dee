         The Blessing of Daily Study
    "He who by faith receives the Word is receiving the
very life and character of God. Every seed brings forth
fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul by faith the
incorruptible seed of the Word, and it will bring forth a
character and a life after the similitude of the character
and the life of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.
    "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—
Ibid., p. 132.
    "God will make the most precious revelaions to His
hungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is
a personal Saviour. As they feed upon His Word, they
find that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys the
natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 391.
  "The neglect of the Word means starvation to the soul."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                       My Pledge
     As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayer-
ful study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

           To Make Man WhoIle
                  FOURTH QUARTER, 1970

   "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical,
mental, and spiritual nature,- a likeness to his Maker. 'God created man in
His own image' (Genesis 1:27), and it was His purpose that the longer man
lived the more fully he should reveal this image—the more fully reflect the
glory of the Creator. . . . Throughout eternal ages he would have continued
to gain new treasures of knowledge, to discover fresh springs of happiness,
and to obtain clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the wisdom, the power,
and the love of God. More and more fully would he have fulfilled the object
of his creation, more and more fully have reflected the Creator's glory.
   "But by disobedience this was forfeited. Through sin the divine likeness
was marred, and well-nigh obliterated. Man's physical powers were weak-
ened, his mental capacity was lessened, his spiritual vision dimmed. He had
become subject to death. Yet the race was not left without hope. By infinite
love and mercy the plan of salvation had been devised, and a life of proba-
tion was granted. To restore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him
back to the perfection in which he was created, to promote the development
of body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might be
realized—this was to be the work of redemption. This is . . . the great object
of life."—Education, pages 15, 16.

                               THE RESTORATION OF MAN
  "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that who-
soever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16.

                                                     LESSON OUTLINE
                                              1. Original State of Man
  "The very essence of the gospel is res-
toration."—The Desire of Ages, page 824.         Gen. 1:27, 31
At the heart of John 3:16 is the idea that    2. Man's Moral Fall
God will restore to man what he had lost         Gen. 3:6
through sin.
  The meaning of "restoration" is to bring    3. The Curses Pronounced
back to a former or original condition.          Gen. 3:16, 17
Through the gospel the Lord brings sin-       4. Promise of a Saviour
ning, weak man back to his sinless state.        Gen. 3:15
  As we study God's Word this quarter we         Rom. 5:12, 20
shall see how Christ "the Restorer" (The
Desire of Ages, page 622) cleanses man from   5. Jesus' Mission—to Restore
the defilement of sin (The Ministry of           Luke 19:10
Healing, page 451) and by virtue of His          Matt. 20:28
atonement restores him to his unfallen           Rom. 5:8
Adamic state.                                 6. Dimension of Restoration
                                                 Acts 3:20, 21

                                                                               5

                                                                    September 27
              Part 1     "So God created man in His own image, in the image
      ORIGINAL STATE of God created He him; male and female created He
            OF MAN them."
                         "And God saw everything that He had made, and,
        Gen. 1:27, 31 behold, it was very good."

                           Adam and Eve, the original man and woman, were created
                       in the image of God. All human life derives from them, but
                       the moral character of Adam's descendants is unlike the orig-
                       inal character of the first man. Innocent and holy, our first
                       parents had "noble traits of character, with no bias toward
                       evil."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 49. They were capable
                       of growth and development in every sense.
                           Adam and his beautiful companion were free moral agents
                       but not immortal. Before they could be granted the gift of an
                       immortal life their loyalty to God must be tested, and this
                       test God accomplished through the tree of knowledge of good
                       and evil.
                           Think of the original state of the first human pair:
                           Physically: "He [Adam] was more than twice as tall as
                       men now living upon the earth, and was well proportioned.
                       . . . His complexion was neither white, nor sallow, but ruddy,
                       glowing with the rich tint of health. Eve was not quite as tall
                       as Adam. Her head reached a little above his shoulders."—Spir-
                       itual Gifts, Vol. 3, p. 34.
                           Spiritual
                                   y: Ellen White wrote of "dignified Adam" in Eden
                       with a "halo of glory . . . covering him as a garment."—Se-
                       lected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 270. "He was without the taint of
                       sin. He stood in the strength of his perfection before God. All
                       the organs and faculties of his being were equally developed,
                       and harmoniously balanced."—Ibid., p. 267.
                           Mentally: "Man came from the hand of God perfect in
                       every faculty of mind and body."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 29.
                       But he was capable of mental expansion, a new and distinct
                       order of being (see Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                       mentary, Vol. 1, p. 1081), "with a power akin to that of the
                       Creator—individuality, power to think and to do."—Education,
                       page 17.
                          What was God's appraisal of His own creation includ-
                       ing Adam and Eve?

    THINK IT THROUGH      Did God "take a chance" when He created Adam and
                       Eve as free moral agents? Was there really a great risk?

The Restoration of Man      LESSON 1                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                    September 28
             Part 2       "And when the woman saw that the tree was good
            MAN'S      for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree
        MORAL FALL     to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit
                       thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband
            Gen. 3:6   with her; and he did eat."

                          One Christmas Day a hiking party discovered a natural falls
                       which tumbled over a smooth rock surface down a precipitous,
                       slippery stone face. A young man in the group, challenged by
                       the danger, straddled the narrow current of water. His friends
                       had warned him of the peril, but the excitement of his dan-
                       gerous position fascinated him. Then, suddenly he lost his
                       balance and slid down to the rocks below.
                          As soon as his friends could reach him they removed his
                       broken body from the rocky shelf. He regained momentary
                       consciousness but died seven days later.
                          Eve knew when she approached the tree of knowledge of
                       good and evil that she was on slippery, dangerous ground. This
                       tree was "off limits" to Adam and his wife. But there was
                       something hypnotic about the whole adventure. For one thing
                       it was a new and unnatural experience. (In Testimonies, Vol.
                       8, p. 291, our condition 'through sin is called "preternatural"
                       —unnatural.) Think of how many people get into trouble for
                       the thrill of trying something tantalizingly new.
                           But think soberly now about the results of one experiment
                       —Adam's sin. "In Adam all die." 1 Cor. 15:22. "All have
                       sinned." Rom. 5:12. And "the wages of sin is death." Rom.
                       6:23. Like Adam, we have all taken "the plunge."
                          Was sin an invention of the Creator or the creature?
                       Eccl. 7:29.

                           "Whatever evil may be now found among men and women,
                       it is not of God; for God made them all upright."—Clarke's
                       Commentary, on Eccl. 7:29. The "strange uses and shameful
                       abuses" man has made of his physical, mental, and spiritual
                       powers in the millenniums that have followed Eden are evi-
                       dences of man's moral fall. There is no evidence of growth of
                       any kind except through the restorative gospel of Jesus Christ.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Compare definitions: (1) preternatural; (2) supernat-
                       ural. Why is supernatural power required to restore us
                       from the defilement of sin?

The Restoration of Man LESSON 1                                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        September 29
                Part 3      "Unto the woman he said, . . . In sorrow thou shalt

         Gen. 3:16, 17   said, ... Cursed is the ground for thy sake."
                            A number of curses resulted from man's moral fall. Before
                         the Flood, "A heavy, double curse, first in consequence of Adam's
                         transgression, and second, because of the murder committed by
                         Cain, was resting upon the earth." — Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, pp.
                         61, 62. (Italics supplied.)
                            "The whole surface of the earth was changed at the Flood.
                         A third dreadful curse now rested upon it in consequence of
                         man's transgression."—Ibid., p. 76. (Italics supplied.)
                            Notice, a curse rested upon the earth or "the ground" for
                         man's sake. God's curse rested upon the serpent: "Thou art
                         cursed." Gen. 3:14. The Noachian flood inundated the world
                         and defaced it. Gen. 7:19, 21-24; 2 Peter 2:5.
                            The man and woman were not cursed; but for their sakes,
                         that they might observe the results of sin and turn from it, God
                         permitted His judgments to come.
                            Upon the woman rested a heavy punishment—pain in child-
                         bearing and every discomfort identified with it. Yet the world
                         would be saved from sin by a Son born to a woman.
                            The inevitable curse or result of sin is death—the wages of
                         sin. Satan promised life as the result of sin. Adam and Eve
                         suffered death in consequence. Satan said, "Ye shall not surely
                         die." God said they would die, and they did. Finally, there is
                         the second death and eternal separation from God, all the result
                         of sin.
                            What did the wise man say about the coming of a
                         curse? Prov. 26:2.

         Gen. 3:15        "But where sin abounded, grace did much more
      Rom. 5:12, 20    abound."

                          "Death spread to all men because all men sinned," is the
                       RSV rendering of part of Rom. 5:12. Phillips translates the last
                       part of verse 20, "Though sin is shown to be wide and deep,
                       thank God His grace is wider and deeper still!"
                          With the curse pronounced upon Satan is the prediction of
                       complete restoration through the coming of Christ the De-
                       liverer. The restoration of many to God's favor and to His
                       moral likeness would entail a fierce struggle between the ser-
                       pent's seed (Satan's followers) and the woman's seed (Christ
                       and His people) united against the hosts of evil.
                          The serpent's head was to be bruised—crushed—while the
                       heel of Christ would be wounded. Since the head is more vul-
                       nerable than the heel, and more vital, it is seen that the judg-
                       ment upon Satan will be conclusive.
                          Jesus' death on the cross—where His "heel" was "bruised"
                       —was not permanent. His resurrection was to eternal life. Sa-
                       tan's death will be for eternity. He is destroyed finally and
                       utterly in the lake of fire. Said Paul, "And the God of peace
                       shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." Rom. 16:20. "Crush
                       Satan under your feet." Weymouth.
                          Malachi declares that "root" and "branch" shall be burned
                       up—Satan and his seed. And the wicked shall be ashes under
                       the feet of God's saints in that day. Mal. 4:3. The restoration
                       will be complete with the creation of new heavens and a new
                       earth.
                         Is the provision for our restoration from sin adequate?
                       Rom. 5:20, last part. (See Rom. 5:15, 17.)

 THINK IT THROUGH          Was God prepared or caught off guard when sin en-
                       tered the world? What is the best argument against the
                       complaints: "I didn't choose to live in this vale of tears";
                       "I had nothing to do with my birth"?

The Restoration of Man        LESSON 1                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                               October 1
                Part 5      "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
     JESUS' MISSION—     which was lost."
         TO RESTORE         "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered
                         unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for
          Luke 19:10     many."
          Matt. 20:28       "But God commendeth His love toward us, in that,
            Rom. 5:8     while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."

                             During World War II an airman was adrift on the broad
                         Pacific in a little rubber raft. When finally rescued, he explained,
                         "The thing that kept me from giving up was the knowledge
                         that someone was searching for me."
                             The mission of Jesus to our world was a searching mission.
                         He came to seek and to save those lost in sin.
                             That which distinguished Jesus' earthly mission was His
                         redemptive work. At the center of Christ's redemptive service
                         was the cross. Important, of course, are the incarnation, the
                         resurrection, the sinless life, the ascension, the intercessory
                         priesthood, the second advent; but the cross is the glorious
                         heartbeat of it all! All physical, mental, and spiritual restora-
                         tion is made possible because Jesus died for us, because a com-
                         plete atonement was made for our sins.
                             Our Lord's final words on Calvary's cross, "It is finished,"
                         announced to the world that the restoration of man was now
                         reality. Jesus had conquered the human sin problem. Every act
                         of restoration in Jesus' ministry was subordinate to the cross.
                           ' Now let us think of the fullness of Jesus' earthly ministry of
                         restoration for humanity.
                             The records of the four Gospels reveal that He restored sight
                         to the blind, hearing to the deaf, strength of limb to the crip-
                         pled, health and cleanness to lepers, sanity to the insane, life
                         to the dead, hope and grace to the hopeless, innocence to guilty
                         sinners, joy to the brokenhearted, knowledge of divine truth to
                         the ignorant and uninformed. In short, Jesus' ministry on earth
                         implemented the complete recovery of man, made man whole!
                            How did Jesus summarize His life's goal?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Which brings greater satisfaction and happiness—to be
                         ministered unto or to minister to others? Is it by living or
                         by dying to sin that we experience life?

The Restoration of Man      LESSON 1                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                          October 2
             Part 6       "He shall send Jesus Christ . . . : whom the heaven
    DIMENSION OF       must receive until the times of restitution of all things,
     RESTORATION       which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy
      Acts 3:20, 21    prophets since the world began."

                           The New English Bible (also Phillips) describes the time
                       of "universal restoration." This period begins when Jesus
                       returns. Then our sins will have been all wiped out.
                           Peter said, "God, having raised up His Son Jesus, sent Him
                       to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniq-
                       uities." Acts 3:26. The blessing of God consists in turning us
                       away from our iniquities. The blessing of God assumes its
                       highest form in saving man from his "evil ways" (Phillips)
                       —from the evil deeds done in the body which bring disease and
                       death. Keep this in mind the next time you say to someone,
                       "God bless you."
                           Paul labored to "present every man perfeCt in Christ." Col.
                       1:28. "If possible," he said, "we may bring every man up to
                       his full maturity in Christ." Phillips.
                           "As the sacrifice in our behalf was complete, so our restora-
                        tion from the defilement of sin is to be complete. No act of
                        wickedness will the law of God excuse; no unrighteousness can
                       escape its condemnation. The ethics of the gospel acknowledge
                        no standard but the perfection of the divine character. The
                        life of Christ was a perfect fulfillment of every precept of the
                        law. He said, 'I have kept My Father's commandments.' His life
                        is our example of obedience and service."—The Ministry of
                        Healing, pages 451, 452.
                           The dimensions of restoration will be complete enough to
                        have purged man from sin's guilt, to have broken sin's power
                        in the body as well as the mind, emancipated man from sin's
                        very existence and its morbid consequences. As time merges
                        into God's eternity, in the very nature of things sin will be
                        forgotten. And "affliction shall not rise up the second time."
                       Nahum 1:9.
                         What is included in the restitution or restoration? How
                       complete will the restitution be?
  THINK IT THROUGH        Could God have done more to effect the restoration of
                       the fallen human race? Who has suffered more as the
                       result of the sin experience—man or God?

                         produces, as it were, a mass of infected, open sores filled with
                         purulent matter and neither bandaged nor treated with 'oint-
                         ment.'"—SDA Bible Commentary, on Isa. 1:6.
                            The charm and glamour of sin disappear after a time. Then
                         there is the painful result of sin to experience and the inevi-
                         table awakening—the realization that the sinner's life has been
                         lived in a fool's paradise. The drunkard, the dope addict, the
                         playboy, walk on the devil's enchanted ground—strangers to
                         genuine happiness. The highest exercise of man's mind is to
                         know and to enjoy God. See Deut. 28:1-14; Ps. 107:43.
                            Happiness is "such and such a thing" or "such and such a
                         state." We hear numerous definitions. But what is happiness?
                         See Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 132; Messages to Young People, page
                         210. Certainly happiness is not sin, or the result of sin. Esau,
                         for example, "bent on self-indulgence, . . . desired nothing so
                         much as liberty to do as he pleased. To him power and riches,
                         feasting and reveling, were happiness. He gloried in the un-
                         restrained freedom of his wild, roving life."—Patriarchs and
                         Prophets, page 178. How many today are like that! Esau
                         wanted to do exactly as he pleased.
                            Years ago while speaking to a group of Adventists in the
                         large church in College View, Nebraska, Ellen White said with
                         deep feeling, "Oh, brethren and sisters, if we only realized that
                         we cannot now do just what we want to do." Then she added
                         with deep earnestness, "We have a heaven to win and a hell
                         to shun." But so many people want to do as they please—not
                         as God pleases.
                            Adventists are to be like Enoch, who, before he was trans-
                         lated, "had this testimony, that he pleased God." Heb. 11:5.
                            In what language did Isaiah describe the unhappy
                         state of Israel and the effect of sin upon human nature?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Should we seek happiness for ourselves? If not, why
                         not? What should we seek?

            Part 2       "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
            HAPPY righteousness: for they shall be filled."
       CONDITION         "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
        OF SAINTS heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
                     with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And
          Matt. 5:6 the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neigh-
     Mark 12:30,31    bor as thyself."

                            "How blest are those who hunger and thirst to see right
                        prevail [or "to do what is right," margin] ; they shall be satis-
                        fied." Matt. 5:6, NEB.
                            "To do what is right"—this is righteousness. All God's com-
                        mandments are righteousness, and love for God and love for
                        man (Mark 12:30, 31) are the prompting forces.
                            "The love of Christ," said Paul, "constraineth ["controls,"
                        RSV] us." 2 Cor. 5:14. This was the actuating principle of his
                        ministry—his motive power. "The very spring of our actions
                        is the love of Christ." Phillips.
                            Even "the physical powers are to be brought into service
                        from love to God," wrote Ellen White. "The Lord wants the
                         physical strength, and you can reveal your love for Him by the
                         right use of your physical powers, doing the very work which
                        needs to be done....
                            "God desires the love that is expressed in heart-service, in
                        soul-service, in the service of the physical powers. We are not
                         to be dwarfed in any kind of service for God."—Fundamentals
                        of Christian Education, pages 314, 315.
                            It is the man who seeks to do what is right in God's sight
                         who is most likely to be happy and healthy. The love of Christ
                         in his heart prompts action of the right sort. Love yields a
                         healthy function and state of mind, body, and soul. Love is a
                         healing current that pours through the whole being of man
                         resulting in a pulsating life filled with proper activities and
                         leaving the healing touch and blessing on every act.
                             It is not an exaggeration to say that most of the world's
                         emotional and temperamental afflictions could be healed by
                         Christ's love in the heart bringing happiness and thus markedly
                         decreasing the physical and emotional ailments of men.
                            How great is the dimension of love's service?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Is Christian life or service possible apart from love
                        to God and man?

              Part 3         "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of
         NEW LIFE IN      the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God,
           THE BODY       and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price:
                          therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
      1 Cor. 6:19, 20     which are God's."

                            The body is a living temple delicately arranged and bal-
                         anced, with hundreds of intricate, pulsating parts working in
                         unison—a beautiful, throbbing testimony to the wisdom of the
                         Creator. When the body is healthy and every part is working
                         in harmony, it becomes a fit dwelling place for the Holy Spirit.
                            It is not unreasonable for God to speak to us and say,
                         "Glorify Me in your body. In eating and drinking and what-
                         ever you do, do it to My glory" (see 1 Cor. 10:31), for the
                         body temple is His.
                            The body temple can be desecrated too—by smoking or
                         drinking, by the use of LSD and pot, or by impurity of any
                         kind. Indeed, it is in the context of spiritual and physical adul-
                         tery that our text (1 Cor. 6:19, 20) was written. Read also
                         verses 15-18. In Romans 1:24-27 Paul deplores the perversion
                         of the natural, physical powers. Those who destroy the body
                          temple by sinful vices will be destroyed by the temple Builder.
                         1 Cor. 3:17.
                            A Sabbath School teacher was speaking to a group of juniors
                         on the subject of "physical morality." He concluded his speech
                         by asking the youngsters if they would like to give their hearts
                         to Jesus. Every hand went up. "Would you like to give your
                         body to your Creator to be used as the dwelling place of His
                         Spirit?" Yes, all were willing to do this. "Are you willing to
                         let Jesus control every organ of your body including your
                         stomachs?" Every hand was raised, except Billy's. "Aren't you
                         going to surrender your stomach to Jesus," said the teacher.
                         "No," he said firmly, "I want my stomach for myself."
                            "Our bodies are Christ's purchased property, and we are not

                       Gen. 1:31. In every aspect of Adam's being this was so. The
                       divine purpose in re-creating fallen man is to restore him to
                       soundness and harmony in his whole being. The gospel of Jesus
                       Christ makes man whole—"very good," as in the beginning.
                           Health depends upon harmonious action of the many work-

                            Much more attention needs to be given to health than many
                         think. The human body is not indestructible. It has marked
                         limitations. Hard work will not be harmful—not nearly as
                         harmful as worry, fear, and guilt—but it is possible to wear
                         out by overdoing and drawing upon future reserves of vital
                         energy. Conserve your nervous, emotional, and physical re-

          Hosea 4:6    dren."

                           Literally, Hosea is saying, "for lack of the knowledge."
                           "The particular knowledge that is missing is the knowledge
                       of God, the most essential of all knowledge. . . They might
                       have had the knowledge had they put forth the effort to obtain
                       it. Men are held responsible not only for what they know
                       (John 9:41; 15:22, 24; James 4:17), but also for what they
                       might have known had they put forth the effort to obtain essen-

                       on Hosea 4:6.
                           This missing knowledge includes information provided by
                       the Creator and by science concerning how to live. Many are
                       willfully ignorant of the laws of health and regard them with
                       amused scorn, thinking that they can transgress nature's phys-
                       ical code with impunity—and squeak through!
                           "When persons are spoken to on the subject of health," wrote
                       Ellen White, "they often say: 'We know a great deal better
                        than we do.' They do not realize that they are accountable for
                        every ray of light in regard to their physical well-being, and
                        that their every habit is open to the inspection of God."—Tes-

     IN PROPHECY
        Rev. 14:12         Read verses 6-14.
                            The advent movement is described prophetically in Rev.
                         14:6-14 along with the unique threefold message it proclaims.
                         The angelic messengers represent the remnant people engaged
                         in preaching and teaching the everlasting gospel in the setting
                         of the judgment-hour message. "With a loud voice" the "pres-
                         ent truth" is given on an international scale, timely and perti-
                         nent to the needs of men in the last days. The work is prepara-
                         tory—Christ is coming again as the long-awaited King.
                            The prophecy of Rev. 14:6-12 and also Isa. 58:12-14 brings
                         to view a church which keeps the commandments of God—
                         including the Bible Sabbath.
                            The message calls upon all to keep God's commandments.
                         And without obedience to God's commandments, no worship
                         can be pleasing to God. Obedience accompanies "the faith of
                         Jesus." Rev. 14:12. It is a timely message, for Isaiah speaking
                         of the last days writes: "The earth lies polluted under its in-
                         habitants; for they have transgressed the laws, violated the
                         statutes, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse
                         devours the earth, and its inhabitants suffer for their guilt."
                         Isa. 24:5, 6, RSV.
                            How does the revelator picture a latter-day reforma-
                         tory movement?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Adventists hold the belief that they have been called
                         by God to keep His holy law and to give the last warn-

                           The pioneers also found support in the New Testament for

                        saw that we should not be silent upon the subject of health
                        but should wake up minds to the subject."
                           "It is not safe nor pleasing to God to violate the laws of
                        health and then ask Him to take care of our health and keep
                        us from disease when we are living directly contrary to our
                        prayers."—Ms. 1, 1863.
                           In a remarkable manner God worked in the early days of
                        the Adventist Church to bring His commandment-keeping peo-
                        ple into harmony with physical law. It was at the house of
                        Aaron Hilliard, at Otsego, Michigan, June 6, 1863, that the
                        important subject of health reform was opened before Mrs.
                        White in vision. See Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 481.
                        This was less than two weeks after the adjournment of the
                        first General Conference session in Battle Creek.
                           Instruction was given not only for the church, but also for
                        Mrs. White and her husband as it concerned their own physical
                        welfare. At that time Elder White was a sick and exhausted
                        man.
                           This vision was providentially timed to coincide with the
                        organization of the church into a general body. A united ad-
                        vance in temperance and godliness could now be effected among
                        the Sabbath-keeping Adventists with the better organizational
                        facilities at hand to prosecute this new concept.
                           A twofold duty was laid upon God's remnant people by the
                        Otsego health vision. It should not be forgotten that it is just
                        as much a sacred duty to arouse others to a sense of physical
                        morality as it is to practice health reform ourselves. The Testi-
                        monies, however, should not be used as a club to pound fellow
                        Adventists into a submissive posture about healthful living or
                        anything else!
 THINK IT THROUGH          Has the passing of more than a century removed or
                        intensified the obligation to live healthfully and godly?
                        Why?




   The passing of many decades has           which was preached of me is not after

                                                                       October 14
            Part 4      Arthur L. White wrote of the large scope of the 1863 health
        THE 1863     vision (see Part 3) with real insight. How many facets of the
    HEALTH VISION    subject are mentioned?
                        "Mankind suffered as, turning from God's plan, they made
                     flesh food a part of the diet; intemperance in eating and in
                     drinking and the indulgence of base passions had benumbed
                     the fine sensibilities; the use of intoxicating beverages had be-
                     clouded men's reasoning faculties; tobacco in whatever form
                     it was used was a slow poison; tea and coffee were stimulating,
                     with effects similar to those of tobacco ; in harmony with mor-
                     bid appetite, rich desserts and every hurtful thing had been
                     crowded into the stomach, bringing pain and various ills; appe-
                     tite was to be denied, and they were to eat sparingly of food
                     that was healthful; the use of swine's flesh had ever been for-
                     bidden and hurtful, and there were other animals that God had
                     forbidden man to eat; children had been led by their parents
                     to eat improperly and had suffered greatly; drug taking was
                     baneful, resulting in more deaths than all other causes combined
                     —strychnine, opium, mercury, and quinine were specifically
                     named as having destroyed their millions; in sickness, nature
                     was to be aided by the common blessings of pure air, pure
                     water, and a simple diet, and this would result in a speedy and
                     safe cure; water was especially beneficial, but many had never
                     experienced its helpful effects; multitudes remained in inexcus-
                     able ignorance, wondering why the race was feeble and life
                     short; there were many who had neglected personal cleanliness;
                     strict habits of cleanliness should be observed, and this in-
                     volved the proper disposal of body wastes; houses were to be
                     built with the value of sunlight taken into account; rooms,
                     especially those slept in, should be well ventilated; healthful
                     dress was an important factor; a diseased body affects the
                     brain; Satan triumphs in the ruinous work of causing members
                     of the human family to destroy themselves through wrong
                     habits; all are required to preserve healthy bodies and sound
                     minds."—Arthur L. White, Review and Herald, June 6, 1968.
                         Note the balance between "don'ts" and "dos" in this counsel:

                         These health principles and teachings took definite shape in
                      such inspired books as The Ministry of Healing and Counsels
                      on Diet and Foods, and represented light from heaven as real
                      as any counsel given elsewhere by Ellen White.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How many bad habits does it take to cripple or kill
                     a man? How many health principles can be violated—
                     safely?

                Part 5      The obituaries in the Review and Herald for 1862 report 63
     EARLY ADVENTIST     deaths. Of these 18 were children under seven years of age, 9
      VITAL STATISTICS   were between 7 and 20 years old, 14 between 21 and 40. Four-
                         teen reached 60 years, and only 8 passed the 60 mark.
                            The general health picture among Adventists in the 1860's
                         and before the light of health reform came to us in the 1863
                         health-reform vision was decidedly unfavorable. There was, as
                         we note above, a high infant mortality rate.
                            "Annie Smith, Uriah's talented sister, died at the age of
                         27. Nathaniel and Anna, brother and sister of James White,
                         died at the ages of 21 and 26, respectively, one in 1853 and the
                         other in 1854, while living with the White family at Rochester,
                         New York. Robert Harmon, Ellen White's brother, closed his
                         life at the age of 27. If, in the winter of 1853 to 1854, Ellen
                         White had not been providentially relieved of a serious heart
                         condition and of a threatening cancer of the eye, she would
                         have closed her lifework at the age of 27. . .
                            "Our forefathers, giving but little attention to health, took
                         the situation in stride. Little known to them at that time was
                         the fact that health was close to religion, and that God, who
                         was leading a people who were preparing to meet their Lord
                         through the means of His choice, was about to lead His people
                         into a new and helpful experience."—Arthur L. White, Review
                         and Herald, June 6, 1968.
                            Seventh-day Adventists in those days did not understand
                         health principles to any extent. Prior to 1863 Adventists had
                         taken several basic steps, however, away from tobacco, tea,
                         coffee, and rich, greasy foods. Some progress had been made,
                         but it was "slow going." At the time of the 1863 vision most
                         of the principle "messengers" or preachers were down flat on
                         their backs, the victims of exhaustion or dyspepsia. Ellen White
                         had lived and struggled back to health through three strokes.
                            There was, as we can see, a crying, painful need for knowl-
                         edge about healthful living !
                             Was Sister White "providentially relieved" of her phys-
                         ical afflictions before or after the light came on healthful
                         living?
                             Does God miraculously heal the sick of their afflictions
                         while they are disobeying known health principles?

 THINK IT THROUGH            If Ellen White, the instrument of revelation, had died
                         at the age of 27 instead of 87, in 1854 instead of 1915,
                         would it have made any difference to the Adventists?
                         To the world?

            Part 6       "In the vision given me in Rochester, New York, December
 HEALTH TEACHING     25, 1865, I was shown that our Sabbath-keeping people have
   IN THE CHURCH     been negligent in acting upon the light which God has given
                     in regard to the health reform, that there is yet a great work
                     before us, and that as a people we have been too backward to
                     follow in God's opening providence as He has chosen to lead us.
                         "I was shown that the work of health reform has scarcely
                     been entered upon yet."
                         "There is a much greater work before us than we as yet
                     have any idea of, if we would ensure health by placing our-
                     selves in the right relation to life."
                         "There are but few as yet who are aroused sufficiently to
                     understand how much their habits of diet have to do with their
                     health, their characters, their usefulness in this world, and their
                     eternal destiny....
                         "I was shown that we should provide a home for the afflicted
                     and those who wish to learn how to take care of their bodies
                     that they may prevent sickness."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 485-

                         At the fourth annual meeting of the General Conference in
                     1866 the church leaders passed a number of resolutions includ-
                     ing the following, which represented a new sense of duty to
                     spread the knowledge of healthful living:
                         "Resolved, That we acknowledge the health reform as set
                     forth in the testimony of Sister White, as part of the work of
                      God incumbent on us at this time; and that we pledge our-
                     selves to live in accordance with these principles, and that we
                      will use our best endeavors to impress their importance upon
                      others."—Review and Herald, May 22, 1866.
                         Our first health paper, The Health Reformer, appeared in
                      1866. The editor was H. S. Lay, M.D. That same year this gen-
                      tleman became the medical director of The Western Health Re-
                      form Institute in Battle Creek, our first "sanitarium."
                          The purpose of that health institution was primarily to save
                      souls and to teach natural principles of healing and living. With
                      foresight of the perils that lurked in institutional work, Mrs.
                      White wrote of the patients:

                      working only from a worldly standpoint instead of adding to
                      the hygienic practice the blessings and virtues of nursing fathers
                      and mothers in Israel."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 561. Or as we
                      would say today—the spiritual and the scientific blended in a

           Part 1  "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
     THE MESSAGE keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
      OF CLIMAX
       Rev. 14:12 The pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church called
                    the three angels' messages of Rev. 14:6-14 "present truth," that
                    is, truth for the present time—the last and final times of the
                    world. Reduced to the lowest common denominator, the third
                    angel's message became "the commandments of God and the
                    faith of Jesus." This was the expression that represented the
                    life and substance of Seventh-day Adventism.
                       The health-reform message associated with the third angel's
                    message was designed to equip God's children with stamina and
                    strength of mind and body to live and represent the truth in
                    times of great stress and tension. It was identified with the
                    preaching of Adventists from early days. Its role is best de-
                    scribed as follows:
                       "Our preachers should teach the health reform, yet they
                    should not make this the leading theme in the place of the
                    message. Its place is among those subjects which set forth the
                    preparatory work to meet the events brought to view by the
                    message; among these it is prominent. We should take hold of
                    every reform with zeal, yet should avoid giving the impression
                    that we are vacillating and subject to fanaticism."—Testi-
                    monies, Vol. 1, p. 559.
                       Any careful student who examines the Adventist health
                    teaching as propounded by Ellen White and by representative
                    Seventh-day Adventist nutritionists observes the absence of
                    sectarian faddism. They also note that diet and the power of
                    right thinking, for example, are not the totality of Adventism.
                    Christ, His teachings and commandments in the setting of the
                    last solemn judgment message to the world, is Adventism.
                       Nevertheless, because Adam and Eve lost Eden and fell
                    through intemperance, temperate habits must be acquired by
                    God's children before redemption is assured. In His forty-day
                    fast Christ redeemed Adam's failure and overcame appetite
                    and made victory over intemperance and the lusts of the flesh
                    a certain accomplishment.
                       The great sin of the Noachian world was indulgence of
                    perverted appetites, so with Sodom and Gomorrah, so with
                    ancient Babylon and Rome. Today one of the special sins of
                    this generation is overindulgence, "surfeiting and drunken-
                    ness." Luke 21:34. God's last message calls people out of and
                    away from intemperance and gluttony.
                       What two qualities distinguish God's saints? Is it pos-
                    sible to have one without the other?
 THINK IT THROUGH      Think how the work of the third angel's message would
                    have been hindered, divorced from the health and tem-
                    perance emphasis. What loss the Seventh-day Adventist
                    Church would have sustained without our physicians,
                    nurses, hospitals, mission launches, food factories, health

            Part 2        "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy,
  HOW TO PRESENT       Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up
   GOD'S MESSAGE       thy bed, and walk? But that ye may know that the Son
                       of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (He saith to
                       the sick of the palsy,) . Arise, and take up thy bed, and
        Mark 2:9-11    go thy way into thine house."

                           In the healing of the paralytic, Jesus restored the diseased
                       soul of a man before He healed the body.
                           In the case of the blind man of John 9:1-7, Jesus began
                       the work of restoration differently. He began with the physical
                       —the opening of the man's eyes, closed since birth. Verses
                       14-17 and 24-38 of John 9 reveal that the step from physical
                       healing to conversion was short and rapid. As soon as the
                       grateful man, with eyes freshly opened, knew that Jesus the
                       healer was also the Messiah, he believed with enthusiasm and
                       gave his heart freely to the Saviour. See The Desire of Ages,
                       page 270.
                           There are real reasons why the body must be restored physio-
                       logically. Strange as it may seem, these reasons are mostly
                        spiritual. Wrote Ellen White: "The body is the only medium
                        through which the mind and the soul are developed for the
                        upbuilding of character. Hence it is that the adversary of souls
                        directs his temptations to the enfeebling and degrading of the
                        physical powers. His success here means the surrender to evil
                        of the whole being. The tendencies of our physical nature, un-
                        less under the dominion of a higher power, will surely work
                        ruin and death."—The Ministry of Healing, page 130.
                           "One of the most deplorable effects of the original apostasy
                        was the loss of man's power of self-control. Only as this power
                        is regained can there be real progress."—Ibid., p. 129.
                            There are also very practical reasons why the health reform
                        —like the right arm of the body—is needed by the body, that
                        is, the church. The right arm protects and strengthens the
                        church.
                           What pointed question did Jesus ask the scribes?

  THINK IT THROUGH         Should ministers qualify themselves to teach health
                        principles publicly? Should physicians and professional
                        medical workers qualify themselves to present spiritual
                        themes? Are the objectives of the work of physicians and
                        the work of ministers similar?

               Part 3      "Behold My servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in
       PROPHECY OF whom My soul delighteth; I have put My Spirit upon
             CHRIST'S Him: He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles."
      PERSEVERANCE         "He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set
                       judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for His
                       law."
                          "The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, He shall
                       stir up jealousy like a man of war: He shall cry, yea,
      Isa. 42:1, 4, 13 roar; He shall prevail against His enemies."

                           The courage and perseverance of Jesus Christ is needed
                        more perhaps in the conquest of bad physical habits than in
                        any of the wrestlings of the soul with evil. Often the health
                        reform is attended with difficulties, not only in living it, but
                        also in teaching it to the world.
                           A great deal of moral courage is required to change a life-
                        time of bad habits—for example, to abandon smoking and the
                        use of liquor or to overcome the viselike grip of heroin and
                        certain other drugs. To conquer marijuana and LSD takes
                        moral stamina. Even to abandon the use of tea and coffee is
                        for some a deadly struggle.
                           In some mission lands the chewing of betel nut has a slavish
                        hold upon the people. Some have never heard of, or choose to
                        ignore, God's instruction regarding unclean flesh foods (Deut.
                        14:3-19) and feast upon such things as swine's flesh, lobster,
                        and crab. Christ has power to break the hold of vice upon the
                        human organism. The challenge to part company with sin is a
                        challenge to courage and faith.
                           Some have trouble adopting the lactovegetarian diet, feel-
                        ing faintness and a loss of strength when meat is abandoned.
                        Read Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 482, 483, 394, 395. This
                        feeling disappears with perseverance.
                           For all of the conflicts of mind and spirit over the body
                        there is the example and help of Jesus, the world's best re-
                        former, to encourage us. He never failed nor did He become
                        discouraged. He persevered and won the victory. So may we.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Since the conquest of perverted appetite is a possibil-

  "Those who proclaim the message           couraged at this, or cease their efforts

           Part 4     "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of

      Rom. 12:1, 2 God."

                           Phillips renders Rom. 12:1, 2 as follows: "With eyes wide
                        open to the mercies of God, I beg you, my brothers, as an act
                        of intelligent worship, Ito give Him your bodies, as a living
                        sacrifice, consecrated to Him and acceptable by Him. Don't
                        let the world around you squeeze you into its own mold, but
                        let God remold your minds from within, so that you may
                        prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets
                        all His demands and moves toward the goal of true maturity."
                           The great apostle labored to win the heathen from their
                        debasing physical practices. Rom. 1:24-27; Rom. 6:19 ; Col.
                        3:5-7. Paul pleaded with his converts to turn over their physical
                        "members" to God as "instruments of righteousness" and not
                        unrighteousness. Enlightened reason was to control, operating
                        through a divinely strengthened will; but reason was to be
                        subject to the guidance of God's Word, not to impulses and
                        impressions. Sanctification of the whole man would result.
                        1 Thess. 5:23.
                           "This is no arbitrary requirement. God's purpose for be-
                        lievers is their complete restoration. This necessarily includes
                         the purification and strengthening of their physical as well as
                         their mental and spiritual powers. Therefore, the Christian who
                        by faith submits himself to God's way of saving man will
                        gladly obey this command to regard the health of his body as
                        a matter of the highest importance. To do otherwise is to
                         hinder the divine work of restoration."—SDA Bible Commen-
                        tary, on Rom. 12:1.
                            What is the character of the service we are to render
                         to God?

 THINK IT THROUGH           It has been said facetiously that some people die at
                        thirty and are buried at sixty. Some people seem to be
                        half dead. Since God asks for a living sacrifice, how can
                        we improve the sacrifice we dedicate to Him?




   "True sanctification ... is not merely    the preservation of physical, mental,
a theory, an emotion, or a form of           and moral health, that we may present
words, but a living, active principle,       to the Lord our bodies, not an offering
entering into the everyday life. It re-      corrupted by wrong habits, but 'a liv-
quires that our habits of eating, drink-     ing sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
ing, and dressing be such as to secure       God.' "—"The Sanctified Life," page 28.

             Part 5       "Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in
 POWER OF EXAMPLE conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
                          "Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; con-
                      tinue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thy-
     1 Tim. 4:12, 16 self, and them that hear thee."

                             The Phillips translation of 1 Tim. 4:16 reads, "Keep a critical
                         eye both upon your own life and on the teaching you give, and
                         if you continue to follow the line I have indicated you will not
                         only save your own soul but the souls of many of your hearers
                         as well."
                            All who profess to believe in dietetic reform should be an
                         example. The Ministry of Healing, page 318. True reformers
                         are not bigoted or self-sufficient, but humble, kind, and cour-
                         teous, the meekest and most gracious people on earth. See
                         Evangelism, page 303; The Ministry of Healing, page 157.
                            It is better to be moderate and move forward slowly than
                         to outdistance the people. Unity and goodwill prevail in the
                         church when all sense their duty to live healthfully and prac-
                         tice their beliefs.
                            "It is our duty to understand and respect the principles of
                         health reform. On the subject of temperance we should be in
                         advance of all other people; and yet there are among us well-
                         instructed members of •the church, and even ministers of the
                         gospel, who have little respect for the light that God has given
                         upon this subject. They eat as they please and work as they
                         please."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 158.
                            In how many ways may the Christian lead others in
                         the pathway of life?

  THINK IT THROUGH          Where does all true reform begin? Can true health
                         reform be experienced along purely intellectual or senti-
                         mentalist lines?




   "As the dew and the still showers         we become partakers of His nature;
fall upon the withering plants, so let       henceforth we live His life. The won-
words fall gently when seeking to win        derful example of Christ, the matchless

Healthful Living and the Third Angel's Message             LESSON 4         ❑ Friday

                                                                          October 23
             Part 6       "I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
   SOLEMN NATURE       by the words of My mouth: and Thy judgments are as the
         OF DIVINE     light that goeth forth."
      INSTRUCTION         "But they like men have transgressed the covenant:
        Hosea 6:5, 7   there have they dealt treacherously against Me."

                           The prophets Amos and Hosea protested against the sins of
                       God's people. Concerning this Ellen White wrote: "Against
                       . .. the unwonted luxury and extravagance, the shameless feast-
                       ing and drunkenness, the gross licentiousness and debauchery,
                       of their age, the prophets lifted their voices." And with what
                       results? "In vain were their protests, in vain their denunciation
                       of sin."—Prophets and Kings, page 282.
                           The gift of prophecy in the Seventh-day Adventist Church
                       scores the evils of our own day including "the shameless feast-
                       ing and drunkenness," "the gross licentiousness and debauch-
                       ery," the physical habits that destroy health and lessen the
                       powers of the mind and soul to grasp spiritual truth and find
                       salvation.
                            The New Testament prophets as well as the Old cried out
                       against physical sins. Eph. 4:17-24; 1 Cor. 6:18; Rom. 1:18,
                       22-28; 13:13, 14; James 1:21; 2 Peter 2:9-14.
                            Weymouth translates Rom. 13:12-14 as follows: "The night
                        is far advanced: day is about to dawn. Let us therefore lay
                        aside the deeds of darkness, and put on the armor of light. As
                        in the daytime, let us behave becomingly, not indulging in
                        revelry and drunkenness, nor in lust and debauchery, nor in
                        quarreling and jealousy. But put on as your armor the Lord
                        Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the passions of your
                        lower nature."
                            And Jesus said, "Be on your guard—see to it that your
                        minds are never clouded by dissipation or drunkenness or the
                        worries of this life, or else that day may catch you like the
                        springing of a trap—for it will come upon every inhabitant
                        of the whole earth. You must be vigilant at all times, praying
                         that you may be strong enough to come safely through all that
                        is going to happen, and stand in the presence of the Son of
                        man." Luke 21:34-36, Phillips.
                            The God of heaven is seeking to refine and purify His church.
                         He sits as a refiner of silver. Mal. 3:2, 3. At the very heart of
                         this reformatory movement are the health counsels of the Lord.
                          What three things has God undertaken for the good
                       of His people?

  THINK IT THROUGH         The spirit of prophecy books which present guidance
                       in the principles and details of well-balanced, healthful
                       living are for our good. Have you read "The Ministry of
                       Healing" and "Counsels on Diet and Foods"?

                      nesses and deformities have been found to be due to the harbor-

                          "The sympathy which exists between the mind and the body
                      is very great. When one is affected, the other responds. The
                      condition of the mind has much to do with the health of the
                      physical system. If the mind is free and happy, under a con-
                      sciousness of rightdoing and a sense of satisfaction in causing
                      happiness to others, it will create a cheerfulness that will react
                      upon the whole system, causing a freer circulation of the blood
                      and a toning up of the entire body. The blessing of God is
                      a healer, and those who are abundant in benefiting others will

                         "It is the duty of everyone to cultivate cheerfulness instead
                      of brooding over sorrow and troubles. Many . . . sacrifice
                      health and happiness to a morbid imagination. . . . These de-
                      pressing emotions are a great injury to them healthwise; for by
                      hindering the process of digestion, they interfere with nutrition.
                      While grief and anxiety cannot remedy a single evil, they can
                      do great harm ; but cheerfulness and hope, while they brighten

FATS, SUGARS, AND throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor .
 THE HUMAN HEART blood."
         Lev. 3:17
                         Smoking, drinking, and faulty diet throw a burden upon the
                      heart and upon the blood vessels as well. Animal fat, for ex-
                      ample, was never intended by the Creator as food for man.
                      Neither fat nor blood was to be eaten.
                         Ellen • White cautioned about animal fats as food, and also
                      against excessive use of sugar, long years ago.
                         "Both the blood and the fat of animals are consumed as a
                      luxury. But the Lord gave special directions that these should
                      not be eaten. Why? Because their use would make a diseased
                      current of blood in the human system. The disregard for the
                      Lord's special directions has brought a variety of difficulties
                      and diseases upon human beings."—Counsels on Diet and
                      Foods, pages 393, 394.
                          "The eating of flesh meats has made a poor quality of blood
                      and flesh. . . . You are liable to acute attacks of disease and to
                      sudden death."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 61 (1868). (Italics sup-
                      plied.)
                          There is a widespread movement today to reduce the intake
                      of fats, especially animal fats, in order to reduce the blood
                      cholesterol and the dangers of atherosclerosis and death from
                      heart attacks. Mrs. White wrote, "Nuts and nut foods are

                       When properly prepared, olives, like nuts, supply the place of
                       butter and flesh meats. The oil, as eaten in the olive, is far
                       preferable to animal oil or fat."—The Ministry of Healing,

                          "There are those who ought to be awake to the danger of
                       meat eating, who are still eating the flesh of animals, thus
                       endangering the physical, mental, and spiritual health."—Coun-

  THINK IT THROUGH        Many people who switch to a simple diet, free of flesh
                       meat and excessive desserts, will experience a new glow
                       of health and a buoyant sense of well-being. If there
                       were no other compensations than this, it would be worth-
                       while. What are the other compensations?

             Part 3        "As thy days, so shall thy strength be."
       STRESS AND
        LONGEVITY          We are to live one day at a time—with strength always
        Deut. 33:25     available for the needs of each day. But many live over their
                        unhappy yesterdays and borrow the troubles of tomorrow. This
         (last part)    produces stress and tension.
                           The meaning of the word "stress" is "compulsion" and "pres-
                       sure." As applied to life in our high-tension environment it
                       suggests the influences exerted on heart, nerve, brain, and soul
                       by these stimuli. It is the privilege of the Christian to learn
                        to cast his cares on God who cares for him. 1 Peter 5:7. Or as
                       Phillips translates this verse: "You can throw the whole weight
                        of your anxieties upon Him, for you are His personal concern."
                           There are very good reasons why worry and anxiety should
                       not be tolerated by the Christian. Not only is worry blind and
                       unreasonable, expressing a distrust in God, but it is also de-
                       structive of life and the energy forces of the brain. "Continual
                       worry is wearing out the life forces."—The Ministry of Heal-
                       ing, page 481. (See also page 241.) These life forces may be used
                       up rapidly or made to last our allotted time.
                           Writing in the year 1905, Ellen White stated a scientific truth
                       when she said, "God has endowed us with a certain amount of
                       vital force. He has also formed us with organs suited to main-
                       tain the various functions of life, and He designs that these
                       organs shall work together in harmony. If we carefully pre-
                       serve the life force, and keep the delicate mechanism of the
                       body in order, the result is health; but if the vital force is too
                       rapidly exhausted, the nervous system borrows power for pres-
                       ent use from its resources of strength, and when one organ is
                       injured, all are affected."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 234,
                       235. See also Fundamentals of Christian Education, pages 153,
                       154.
                          Hans Selye, a research physiologist, has expressed similar
                       thoughts in his well-known book The Stress of Life:
                          "Every living thing has a certain innate amount of adapta-
                       tion energy or vitality. This can be used slowly for a long
                       and uneventful life or rapidly during shorter and more stressful
                           existence."—Page 269.
                          "Life is essentially a process which gradually spends the
                       given amount of adaptation energy that we inherited from our
                       parents. Vitality is like a special kind of bank account which
                       you can use up by withdrawals but cannot increase by deposits.
                       Your only control over this most precious fortune is the rate
                       at which you make your withdrawals."—Page 274.
                          What is God's plan for man's life?
 THINK IT THROUGH         Is it not wise to control the expenditure of our "de-
                       posits" of vital energy if it is true that they cannot be
                       increased?

             Part 4      "Unto God the Lord belong the issues from death."
      CANCER AND
        ITS CAUSES        Among death-dealing illnesses cancer sometimes seems more
                      menacing than others. But to the Lord belong the "issues," or
          Ps. 68:20
                      "exit" (Smith and Goodspeed), of death. Death is not beyond
                      His control. He stands as it were at the "exit" and is in full
                      charge.
                          Many years ago Ellen White gave us counsel about some of
                      the causes of cancer.
                          "Cancers, tumors, and all inflammatory diseases are largely
                      caused by meat eating.
                          "From the light God has given me, the prevalence of cancer
                      and tumors is largely due to gross living on dead flesh."—Coun-
                      sels on Diet and Foods, page 388.
                          "Flesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly
                      objectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing.
                      Those who use flesh foods little know what they are eating.
                      Often if they could see the animals when living and know the
                      quality of the meat they eat, they would turn from it with
                      loathing. People are continually eating flesh that is filled with
                       tuberculous and cancerous germs. Tuberculosis, cancer, and
                       other fatal diseases are thus communicated."—The Ministry of
                       Healing, page 313.
                           It is recognized today that chemicals can cause cancer. With
                       regard to one chemical, calomel (which was widely used for-
                       merly as a medicine), Ellen White says this: "It frequently
                       manifests itself in tumors, ulcers, and cancers, years after it
                       has been introduced into the system."—Selected Messages, Bk.
                       2, p. 449.
                           In 1956, Dr. Wendell Stanley, a virologist of the University
                       of California, asserted his belief that "viruses cause most all of
                       human cancers." He theorized that cancer virus might remain
                       dormant in the human body and then "become active" "by
                       aging, dietary indiscretions, hormonal imbalance, chemicals,
                       radiation, or a combination of stresses."—Newsweek, June 18,
                       1956. "Today no line of investigation into the origins of human
                       cancer is being pressed more vigorously than that implicating
                        viruses as at least partly responsible."—Time, October 27, 1958.
                         What is it that concerns man's existence that "belongs"
                      to God?
  THINK IT THROUGH        "Light is sown for the righteous," said the psalmist.
                       Psalm 97:11. The harvest of that light is health.
                          Some cancers can be prevented.

                           Tobacco, indicted by Mrs. E. G. White in 1864 and again
                        in 1905 as a "slow, insidious, and most malignant poison" (The
                        Ministry of Healing, page 327), is found to be the almost ex-
                        clusive cause of more than 60,000 deaths annually from lung
                        cancer and to be a major factor in 100,000 annual deaths from
                        cardiovascular diseases. Keep in mind that lung cancer is "slow"
                        and also "insidious" in its development, usually taking twenty
                        to twenty-five years to "mature."
                           The relationship of the tobacco habit to the dread diseases
                        emphysema and chronic bronchitis, as well as lung cancer, is
                        seen by experts in the field. Medical men are appalled as they
                        face the prospect that no less than 1,000,000 children presently
                        in school will die of lung cancer if cigarette consumption con-
                        tinues at its present rate. At this writing 10,000,000 Americans
                        have emphysema. Ten percent of all males have it. Its death
                        rate has increased about 300 percent since 1950.
                           According to T. H. Biggs, M.D., medical director of State
                        Tuberculosis Hospital in Connecticut, the average young man
                        who refuses to smoke lives about eight years longer than does
                        the one who takes up the habit and continues it until he dies.
                        "More than 500 chemical compounds have been discovered in
                        cigarette smoke. Some of them are found in the gases of the
                        smoke, and others are discovered in the particles of the smoke.
                        Some of the compounds are absorbed directly into the blood
                        from the mouth membranes, some are absorbed from the air
                        sacs in the lungs, and some remain on the surface of the bron-
                        chial tubes and cause irritation, bronchitis, emphysema, and
                        cancer."—Life and Health, June, 1969.
                          The law of cause and effect works inexorably. Is any-
                       one excluded?
 THINK IT THROUGH        Does God deliberately destroy those who destroy the

                        In her earliest experiences Ellen White was shown the perils
                     of hypnosis and from time to time warned against it. At the
                     turn of the century she spoke out against the employment of
                     hypnosis in medical practice, a procedure which placed one
                     mind under the control of another human mind. She declared
                     that while "this science may appear to be something beautiful,"
                     we should leave it alone. Medical Ministry, page 111.
                         Warnings are now being sounded by some medical authori-
                     ties which point out the serious peril of mind controlling mind
                     and of following a procedure which would hide the symptoms
                     of disease and weaken the will of the patient.
                         To an Adventist physician, Ellen White wrote in the year
                     1901: "No man or woman should exercise his or her will to
                     control the senses or reason of another, so that the mind of
                     the person is rendered passively subject to the will of the
                     one who is exercising the control. This science may appear to
                     be something beautiful, but it is a science which you are in no
                      case to handle. . . . There is something better for you to en-
                      gage in than the control of human nature over human nature."
                      —Ibid.
                         One of the most profound statements made on the subject
                      of hypnosis and its aftermath follows:
                         "The theory of mind controlling mind was originated by
                      Satan, to introduce himself as the chief worker, to put human
                      philosophy where divine philosophy should be. Of all the errors
                      that are finding acceptance among professedly Christian peo-
                      ple, none is a more dangerous deception, none more certain
                      to separate man from God, than is this. Innocent though it
                      may appear, if exercised upon patients it will tend to their
                      destruction, not to their restoration. It opens a door through
                      which Satan will enter to take possession both of the mind that
                      is given up to be controlled by another, and of the mind that
                      controls."—The Ministry of Healing, page 243.
                          What must a man do who wishes to have his life dis-
                      tinguished by "righteousness"?

  THINK IT THROUGH       Does hypnosis sometimes affect the therapist ad-
                      versely? What happens to the patient's will under hyp-
                      nosis? May self-reliance and self-respect be developed
                      as a result of hypnosis therapy? Is dependence shifted
                      away from God to man?

                           Sunlight. The value of sunlight to good health is not dis-
                       puted. Vitamin D is produced in the body when it is exposed
                       to sunlight. It is found also in the liver oils of some fish, in
                       butter, and in egg yolk. Deficiency of Vitamin D may cause
                       rickets in children and certain bone abnormalities in adults.
                           One benefit of sunlight is its power to destroy harmful
                       bacteria. "Every form of uncleanliness tends to disease. Death-

                       Oxygen vitalizes the whole person and assists in the metabolism
                       of food and the release of energy. "The pure air, the glad

              Part 3     "And the apostles gathered themselves together unto
        WORK, REST, Jesus, and told Him all things, both what they had done,
     AND RECREATION and what they had taught. And He said unto them, Come
                     ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile:
                     for there were many coming and going, and they had no
       Mark 6:30, 31 leisure so much as to eat."

                          Read Mark 2:27.
                            The provisions God has made for our welfare include: (1)
                        Work, (2) Rest, (3) Recreation.
                            (1) Work. Exercise like jogging, swimming, calisthenics, and
                        hiking is excellent; but physical work with something construc-
                        tive accomplished is even more beneficial.
                            "Let men and women work in field and orchard and garden.
                        This will bring health and strength to nerve and muscle. . . .
                        Every part of the human organism should be equally taxed.

                        of every part. . . . God made nerve and muscle in order that
                        they might be used. It is the inaction of the human machinery
                        that brings suffering and disease."—My Life Today, page 136.
                            (2) Rest. "Come ye yourselves apart . . . and rest awhile,"
                        said Jesus. The rest God gives includes (1) physical rest, (2)
                        Sabbath rest, (3) rest from the load of sin through Christ.
                            (3) Recreation. In the year 1867 the spirit of prophecy made
                        the first general appeal to Seventh-day Adventists to allow
                        time in their busy lives for recreation.
                           "I was shown that Sabbath keepers as a people labor too
                        hard without allowing themselves change or periods of rest.
                        Recreation is needful to those who are engaged in physical
                        labor and is still more essential for those whose labor is prin-
                        cipally mental. It is not essential to our salvation, nor for the
                        glory of ,,God, to keep the mind laboring constantly and ex-
                        cessively, even upon religious themes."—Testimonies, Vol. 1,
                        p. 514. See also Gospel Workers, pages 243-245.
                           Remember: Jesus was intense but never tense. Prayer and
                        trust and rest in God made the difference. So may we have
                        energy and cheerfulness and deep earnestness in the performing
                        of life's duties.
                           What provisions did God make for man's welfare?

          Part 4     "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb
  GOOD FOOD FOR bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and
    GOOD HEALTH every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding
        Gen. 1:29 seed; to you it shall be for meat."

                         The original diet provided by God for man consisted of fruit,
                     grains, and nuts. Even vegetables, or green "herbs" were not
                     allowed until after •the fall. Gen. 3:18. Dairy products and flesh
                     foods were not a part of the Edenic fare, but were later al-
                     lowed under certain circumstances.
                         The ideal diet for those preparing for the Lord's return is
                     here described:
                        "Grains and fruits prepared free from grease, and in as
                     natural a condition as possible, should be the food for the
                     tables of all who claim to be preparing for translation to
                     heaven. . . . Gratification of taste should not be consulted
                     irrespective of physical, intellectual, or moral health."—Testi-
                     monies, Vol. 2, p. 352.
                         "Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord,
                     meat eating will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to
                     form a part of their diet. We should ever keep this end in
                     view, and endeavor to work steadily toward it. I cannot think
                     that in the practice of flesh eating we are in harmony with the
                     light which God has been pleased to give us."—Counsels on
                     Diet and Foods, pages 380, 381.
                         Man's need for a safe and adequate diet should be recog-
                     nized. Dairy products might well be used along with plant
                      foods to guarantee the "most healthful diet."        •
                         "Fruit, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a simple way,
                      free from spice and grease of all kinds, make, with milk or
                      cream, the most healthful diet. They impart nourishment to

                         The answer was as follows:
                         "It is possible, but somewhat difficult. Special care must be
                      taken to include whole-grain cereals, legumes, nuts, and nut-
                      like seeds as well as a wide variety of vegetables and fruits.
                      This wide variety is necessary in order to be assured of an
                      adequate intake of the more difficult to obtain vitamins, folic
                      acid, and vitamin B12 as well as calcium and iron.
                         "The lactovegetarian has an easier time since eggs, milk, and
                      milk products may be consumed. These foods help assure ade-
                      quate amounts of protein, calcium, and the B vitamins."
                         What foods were originally provided for man?

                                                                      November 5
             Part 5    "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not
          TRUST IN unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowl-
     DIVINE POWER edge Him, and He shall direct thy paths."
        Prov. 3:5, 6
                         Trust in God opens the door for healing to flow to sick-
                     hearted and to sick-bodied men and women. Trusting means
                     "an assured reliance" on the character and ability of God to
                     help us with all our problems. Trust is built on the knowledge
                     of Him whom to know aright means to trust and love com-
                     pletely.
                         Paul's admonition to the Philippians, "Be careful for noth-
                     ing" (Phil. 4:6), is offered in the context of, "The Lord is at
                     hand" (verse 5). "The Lord is coming soon." Goodspeed. Phil-
                     lips translates this clause, "never forget the nearness of your
                     Lord."
                         The last days are troubled days. We need to learn the lesson:
                     "In nothing be anxious," ASV; "Let no care trouble you,"
                     Conybeare; "Do not worry about anything," Montgomery;
                     "Entertain no worry," Berkeley.
                         Prayer is open to you, and you may "tell God every detail
                     of your needs in earnest and thankful prayer." Phil. 4:6, Phil-
                     lips.
                         Trust lifts off the weight and pressure of business and health
                     cares and anxieties. Trust resigns itself to God's supervision,
                     accepting the path marked out by Providence as the best way
                     to travel.
                         "Having done all, . . . stand," said Paul. Eph. 6:13. This
                     suggests trusting and fighting the battle of life till the end.
                         There is a four-walled fortress of strength in the psalmist's
                     words: (1) "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou
                     dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed." Ps. 37:3. (2)
                     "Delight thyself also in •the Lord; and He shall give thee the
                     desires of thine heart." V. 4. (3) "Commit thy way unto the
                     Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass." V. 5.
                     (4) "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him: fret not
                     thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of
                     the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass." V. 7.
                         Above all other aids in building good health, "trust in God"
                     is the first ingredient.
                        What promises are given to those who trust in God?

 THINK IT THROUGH        Ellen White wrote, "Sickness of the mind prevails
                     everywhere. Nine tenths of the diseases from which men
                     suffer have their foundation here."—"Testimonies," Vol.
                     5, p. 444. What might happen if people who are upset
                     and nervous about many things could learn to carry their
                     cares and perplexities to the great Burden Bearer?

God's Healing Remedies LESSON 6                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                     November 6
            Part 6      "Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that
    HEALING BALM thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when
      OF SERVICE thou seest the naked, that thou cover him ...? Then shall
                     thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health
                     shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall
                     go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy re-
       Isa. 58:7, 8 reward."

                        Read Isa. 50:4.
                        "Thine health shall spring forth speedily," literally, "Thy
                     new flesh shall speedily grow," Rotherham; according to a
                     footnote in this translation, "in the healing of wounds." The
                     heart, mind, and body are healed by the precious balm of the
                     Word of God which the Christian proclaims.
                        And notice the rich reward promised: "Then shall thy light
                     break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth
                     speedily."
                        "Here [Isa. 58:7, 8] is an abundantly precious promise for
                     all who will interest themselves in the cases of those who need
                     help. How can God come in and bless and prosper those who
                     have no special care for anyone except themselves, and who do
                     not use that which He has entrusted to them, to glorify His
                     name on •the earth?"—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 332.
                        "If the mind is free and happy, under a consciousness of
                     rightdoing and a sense of satisfaction in causing happiness to
                     others, it will create a cheerfulness that will react upon the
                     whole system, causing a freer circulation of the blood and a
                     toning up of •the entire body. The blessing of God is a healer,
                     and those who are abundant in benefiting others will realize
                     that wondrous blessing in their hearts and lives."—Ibid., Vol.
                     4, pp. 60, 61.
                         Many elderly Christians, retired and bored with life, have
                     prolonged their days by lengthening their witness. Thousands
                     have experienced relief from ills and infirmities by involvement
                     in church activities—selling or giving away or mailing Chris-
                     tian literature or participating in welfare or Dorcas work—even
                     Ingathering!
                         "Good deeds are twice a blessing, benefiting both the giver
                     and the receiver of the kindness. The consciousness of right-
                      doing is one of the best medicines for diseased bodies and
                      minds. When the mind is free and happy from a sense of duty
                     well done and the satisfaction of giving happiness to others,
                      the cheering, uplifting influence brings new life to the whole
                      being."—The Ministry of Healing, page 257.
                         What two promises are made to the Christian who is
                      involved in a life of service? Explain.

                            " 'Merry' has changed its meaning since 1611. It did not then
                        have the meaning of boisterous mirth. 'God rest you merry,
                        gentlemen' meant, 'God keep you in glad peace, gentlemen.'
                        The face glows with joy when the heart is full of light and
                        peace. But the spirit is broken by continued sorrow of heart.

                            Dr. Floyd L. Ruch wrote: "Illnesses are very often caused
                        by faulty emotional patterns. One physician, for instance, points
                        to evidence indicating that persistent and repeated emotional

                            The result of cheerfulness or the consequences of depression
                        are felt in every nerve and organ of the body. Therefore the

                        with and directed toward "the God of peace." Phil. 4:9.
                            (1) The spirit that comes from God is "of power, and of
                        love, and of a sound mind," but not of fear and doubt and
                        anxiety. 2 Tim. 1:7.
                            (2) The "peace of God" is to rule in our hearts. Col. 3:15.
                        This suggests peace presiding and governing over the entire life.
                           (3) It is in "returning" to God that peace and confidence and
                        rest are found. "For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One

                          What are the fruits of joyfulness? of gloom and sad-

The Mental Outlook   LESSON 7                                          El Monday
                                                                      November 9
             Part 2   "That He would grant you, according to the riches of
         GAINING His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in
       EMOTIONAL the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by
        STRENGTH faith."
      Eph. 3:16, 17
                       Read Isa. 41:10.
                        Note the following translations of the latter part of verse
                     16: "To be strengthened by His Spirit with power permeating
                     your inmost being," Weymouth; "In your inner nature," Good-
                     speed; "To know the strength of the Spirit's inner reinforce-
                     ment," Phillips; "The mighty inner strengthening of His Holy
                     Spirit," Taylor.
                         Paul commanded the Ephesians to "be filled with the Spirit."
                     Eph. 5:18. It is by the Holy Spirit that Christ dwells in us.
                     "Hereby we know that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which
                     He hath given us." 1 John 3:24. "Christ is the wellspring of
                     life."—The Ministry of Healing, page 247.
                         The Christian can enjoy the presence of God and the infilling
                     of the Holy Spirit by faith. One need not feel that presence nor
                     experience ecstasy to know that it is reality.
                         "Many suppose . . . that they cannot have faith unless they
                     feel the power of the Spirit. Such confound faith with the
                     blessing that comes through faith. The very time to exercise
                      faith is when we feel destitute of the Spirit. When thick clouds
                     of darkness seem to hover over the mind, then is the time to
                      let living faith pierce the darkness and scatter the clouds. True
                      faith rests on the promises contained in the Word of God, and
                      those only who obey that Word can claim its glorious prom-
                      ises."—Early Writings, page 72.
                         The emotions and feelings are to be subject to the reason
                      and will of an enlightened Christian mind. The kingly fac-
                      ulty of reason bears sway. Many make the mistake of living by
                      feeling, judging of their acceptance with God on the grounds
                      of a happy or depressed feeling. But passing moods are no
                      evidence of Heaven's favor or frown.
                        What five reasons did Isaiah have for being unafraid
                     and undismayed?

  THINK IT THROUGH       If true religion is dependent on the intensity of one's
                     feelings, who can be saved but the emotional ones! Jesus
                     was a "Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief." Isa.
                     53:3. Yet He had a constant strength in God—a deep
                     abiding joy. Can this be our experience? Is our health
                     influenced by the emotional drives in our spiritual life?

                         Read 2 Peter 1:4.
                          We are to "pray all the time" (Taylor) in harmony with
                       the Holy Spirit's wishes expressed in Holy Scripture and the
                       spirit of prophecy. "The Holy Spirit is the Author of the
                       Scriptures and of the spirit of prophecy."—Letter 92, 1900.
                          God's promises are true and trustworthy and "not yea and
                       nay," but yea. See Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 631. "Not one of them
                       will fail."—Ibid., p. 630. They are scattered "like pearls all

                       Health of mind and body is encouraged by religious exercise
                       based upon God's Word.
                          We are to inquire what are God's promises and what are
                       His commands. Knowing these (through Bible study) we are to
                       trust the one and obey the other.
                          "Duty is duty, and should be performed for its own sake.
                       But the Lord has compassion upon us in our fallen condition,
                       and accompanies His commands with promises. He calls upon
                       His people to prove Him, declaring that He will reward obe-

                                                                     November 11
           Part 4    "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it
      THE GOSPEL is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that
     PRESCRIPTION believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
        Rom. 1:16
                         The power that works effectively in man's recovery from
                     sin is the gospel. This is man's only hope. The New Testament
                     in Basic English reads: "For I have no feeling of shame about
                     the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation
                     to everyone who has faith."
                         No Christian should have a "feeling of shame about the
                     good news" but should freely tell what Christ has done for his
                     soul.
                         "When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is
                     a cure for the maladies that originated in sin. The Sun of
                     Righteousness arises, 'with healing in His wings.' . . . Not all
                     that this world bestows can heal a broken heart, or impart
                      peace of mind, or remove care, or banish disease. Fame, genius,
                      talent—all are powerless to gladden the sorrowful heart or to
                      restore the wasted life. The life of God in the soul is man's
                      only hope."—The Ministry of Healing, page 115.
                         There is need in the church for skillful pastors, counselors,
                      and physicians to help the emotionally ill, but human resources
                      and therapies succeed to the degree that they become channels
                      for the flow of the divine healing. Christian psychiatrists and
                      psychologists recognize their dependence upon God for success
                      in treating patients.
                         "The love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is
                      a vitalizing power. Every vital part—the brain, the heart, the
                      nerves—it touches with healing. By it the highest energies of
                      the being are roused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt
                      and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life forces.
                      With it come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul,
                       joy that nothing earthly can destroy,—joy in the Holy Spirit,
                       —health-giving, life-giving joy.
                          "Our Saviour's words, 'Come unto Me, . . . and I will give
                       you rest' (Matt. 11:28), are a prescription for the healing of
                       physical, mental, and spiritual ills."—Ibid.
                          "If human beings would open the windows of the soul
                       heavenward, in appreciation of the divine gifts, a flood of heal-
                       ing virtue would pour in."—Ibid., p. 116.
                         What is the gospel said to be? What earthly power
                      can substitute for it?

  THINK IT THROUGH        The gospel means good news! "Somebody" to get
                      excited about! Christ, the Great Healer, IS the gospel.
                      Without Him, is a formula for straight thinking enough?
                      Is a wholesome philosophy of life enough?

              Part 5      "Never pride yourself on your own wisdom, revere
     TRUE MIND CURE the Eternal and draw back from sin: that will mean
                      health for your body and fresh life to your frame." Mof-

                          Read Jer. 10:23, 24.
                            Health of mind and body is related to dependence upon
                        "the Eternal" One.
                            The pride of man is destructive and separates man from the
                        Life-giver. That humility and faith which acknowledges God
                        the Creator and Redeemer as supreme and man as utterly de-
                        pendent is worth everything.
                                       O God, our help in ages past,
                                          Our hope for years to come,
                                       Our shelter from the stormy blast,

                            To know that God is good is even more important than to
                        recognize that He is supreme and all-powerful and all-wise. The
                        faith that builds on the fact that the great God is a good God
                        is fundamental.
                                       Yet in the maddening maze of things,
                                          And tossed by storm and flood,
                                       To one fixed trust my spirit clings;

                        troubled mind and heart the knowledge of God is the first and
                        most important knowledge. The troubled heart finds peace and

The Mental Outlook     LESSON 7                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                       November 13
            Part 6     "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
  GOD, OUR HEALER Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight,
                    and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all
                    His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee,
                    which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the
         Ex. 15:26 Lord that healeth thee."

                           All healing comes from God—whether healing of mind or
                       healing of body. Persons suffering from nervous breakdowns are
                       ill. While the organs of their bodies may not be diseased, there
                       is often functional disturbance of different kinds. This results
                       from excessive stimulation caused by uncontrolled emotions.
                       The nervous system suffers injury from anxiety. Although the
                       patient may look well, he is not well. If his arm were broken
                       and in a sling, he would have sympathizers; but when the trou-
                       ble is with nerves and glands, the damage cannot be seen and
                       sympathizers are few.
                            To recover, the mind must be relieved of the pressures of
                       anxiety, guilt, fear, and worry. This relief comes when helpful
                       counsel and guidance is available from a minister or physician
                        who takes the weak, trembling hand of the sufferer and places
                        it in the hand of the Great Physician.
                            There is a form of treatment, however, that is an agency
                        for evil. Speaking of the kind of mind cure we now call hyp-
                        notism, Ellen G. White wrote: "This method of cure has been

                            In the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve were beguiled and
                        deceived by Satan through the hypnotic power of suggestion.
                        Their minds were attracted away from Christ and His Word
                        to the impostor who promised to give more than God could
                        give.
                            Today people listen to false physicians and healers and sub-
                        scribe to new and subtle philosophies of life which turn the
                         mind away from the only sure Source of help and healing. To
                         do this is to be deceived as Eve was. Gen. 3:13 ; 1 Tim. 2:14.

                        22:35-40.

                            "As Christ's followers, we should, in eating and drinking, act
                        from principle."—Temperance, page 213. An illustration that
                        still speaks with force is the case of young Daniel. See Daniel 1.
                           To live by principle is distinct from living by strong im-
                        pulses of the fleeting moment or by feelings. Many times "your
                        feelings, your impressions, your emotions, are not to be trusted,
                        for they are not reliable."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 513. But prin-
                        ciple is always a safe guide. Many, with regard to diet and dress
                        and entertainment, follow inclination and the fashions and
                        practices of the world rather than consulting principle and the
                        will of God.
                           The kind of life most conducive to good health is described
                        in Isa. 58:6-8. The last part of verse 7 records the call of God
                        to the Christian to hide not himself from his own flesh. We
                        are to love our neighbors as ourselves, •that is, with the same
                        concern. It is not that we are to disregard our own needs and
                        well-being, but rather that we should have the same concern
                        for the needs and well-being of others that we have for our own.
                           Religious enthusiasts may be inclined to deny the body nec-
                        essary food and clothing. This is not good religion but a form
                        of Pharisaism. God wants us to be healthy and happy.

                         one that avoids extremes and chooses the sane pathway.
                             A caution is sounded by the wise man in Ecclesiastes 7:16:
                         "Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise:
                         why shouldest thou destroy thyself?"
                             Clarke's Commentary on Ecclesiastes 7:16 observes: "Why
                         shouldest thou be so singular? ... You carry things to extremes.
                         Why should you wish to be reputed singular and precise?"
                             To a conscientious physician who had eliminated essential
                         food from his diet, God's messenger wrote:
                             "Do not go to extremes in regard to the health reform. Some
                         of our people are very careless in regard to health reform. But
                         because some are far behind, you must not, in order to be an
                         example to them, be an extremist. You must not deprive your-
                          self of •that class of food which makes good blood. ... Put into
                         your diet something you have left out. It is your duty to do
                         this."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, pages 366, 367.
                             "If you err, let it not be in getting as far from the people
                          as possible, for then you cut the thread of your influence and
                          can do them no good. Better err on the side of the people than
                          altogether away from them, for there is hope in that case that
                          you can carry the people with you, but there is no need of
                          error on either side. You need not go into the water, or into
                          the fire, but take the middle path, avoiding all extremes."—
                          Ibid., p. 211.
                             With what does Paul equate "the kingdom of God"?

            Part 3          "And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your
  INTEMPERANCE OF        hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness,
        OUR TIMES        and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you
                         unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that
       Luke 21:34,35     dwell on the face of the whole earth."

                             Here an earnest admonition is given to God's children, espe-
                         cially those living in the last days.
                             Verse 34 in Weymouth's translation reads: "Take heed to
                         yourselves, lest your souls be weighed down with self-indul-
                         gence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life, and that
                         day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap." See also
                         Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 31.
                             There is no support in Scripture for the use of beverage
                         alcohol. John 2:1-11 and 1 Tim. 5:23 do not contradict Prov.
                         23:29-35. Read and compare all three passages.
                             The Wine of Cana. "The wine created by Christ at this time
                          [at the marriage feast in Cana] was the best wine those present
                         had ever tasted, but it was entirely free from all fermentation.
                         Christ Himself had forbidden the use of fermented drink, say-
                         ing: 'Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons
                         with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation,
                         lest ye die; it shall be a statute forever throughout your gen-
                         erations.' "—Ellen G. White, The Signs of the Times, Septem-
                         ber 6, 1899.
                             The Wine Recommended by Paul. "Fermented liquor con-
                         fuses the senses and perverts the powers of the being. God is
                         dishonored when men have not sufficient respect for them-
                         selves to practice strict temperance. Fermented wine is not a
                         natural production. The Lord never made it, and with its
                         production He has nothing to do. Paul advised Timothy to
                         take a little wine for his stomach's sake and oft infirmities, but
                         he meant the unfermented juice of the grape. He did not advise
                         Timothy to take what the Lord had prohibited. . . .
                             "Be assured that He did not make intoxicating wine on the
                         occasion of His first miracle. He gave to those present a drink
                         which it is safe to give to all humanity,—the pure juice of the
                         grape. Christ never placed a glass of fermented liquor to His
                         lips or to the lips of His disciples. Drunkenness was rare in
                         Palestine, but Christ looked down the ages, and saw in every
                         generation what the use of wine would do for the users, there-
                         fore at this feast He set a right example."—Ibid.
                             What sins are to characterize the last days?
 THINK IT THROUGH            It was Johann Heinrich Voss who wrote: "Who loves
                         not women, wine, and song, Remains a fool his whole
                         life long." This has been wrongly ascribed to Martin
                         Luther as it has been wrongly ascribed to the Bible that
                         beverage alcohol is Christian.

       VICTIMS OF lost their lives because of their intemperance and pre-

       Lev. 10:1-11
                       Read Matt. 14:3-12.
                         "Nadab and Abihu would never have committed that fatal
                     sin had they not first become partially intoxicated by the free
                     use of wine. . . . They could not discern the difference between
                     the sacred and the common....
                         "When intoxicants are used, the same effects will follow as
                     in the case of those priests of Israel. The conscience will lose
                     its sensibility to sin, and a process of hardening to iniquity will
                     most certainly take place, till the common and the sacred will
                     lose all difference of significance."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     pages 361, 362.
                          "God has not changed. He is as particular and exact in His
                      requirements now as He was in the days of Moses. But in the
                     sanctuaries of worship in our day, with the songs of praise,
                      the prayers, and the teaching from the pulpit, there is not
                      merely strange fire, but positive defilement. Instead of truths
                      being preached with holy unction from God, it is sometimes
                      spoken under the influence of tobacco and brandy. Strange fire
                      indeed! Bible truth and Bible holiness are presented to the peo-
                      ple, and prayers are offered to God, mingled with the stench
                      of tobacco ! Such incense is most acceptable to Satan! . . .
                          "Professed Christians eat and drink, smoke and chew to-
                      bacco, and become gluttons and drunkards, to gratify appetite,
                      and still talk of overcoming as Christ overcame!"—Ellen G.
                      White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p. 1111.
                           Intemperance and the indulgence of appetite are related to
                      criminal action. Read Matthew 14:3-12. When John the Bap-
                       tist was beheaded, Herod gave his guests at the feast "oppor-
                       tunity to speak in the prisoner's behalf. . . . They were too
                       besotted to interpose a remonstrance.... They had given them-
                      selves up to feasting and drunkenness until the senses were
                       benumbed....
                           "Oh, how often has the life of the innocent been sacrificed
                       through the intemperance of those who should have been guard-
                       ians of justice! He who puts the intoxicating cup to his lips
                       makes himself responsible for all the injustice he may commit
                       under its besotting power. . . . Those who have jurisdiction
                       over the lives of their fellowmen should be held guilty of a
                       crime when they yield to intemperance. All who execute the
                       laws should be lawkeepers. They should be men of self-control.
                       They need to have full command of their phsyical, mental, and
                        moral powers, that they may possess vigor of intellect, and a
                        high sense of justice."—The Desire of Ages, pages 221, 222.
                        Who were the objects of divine wrath when common
                      and sacred fire were mingled in the sanctuary?

     STIMULANTS AND        "Thou shalt not commit murder." Rotherham.
          NARCOTICS
            Ex. 20:13       Clarke's Commentary on Ex. 20:13 reads: "All riot and ex-
                        cess, all drunkenness and gluttony, all inactivity and slothful-
                        ness, and all superstitious mortification and self-denials, by
                        which life may be destroyed or shortened; all these are point-
                        blank sins against the sixth commandment."
                            Anything that shortens or destroys human life—whether
                        our own or another's—is "point-blank" sin against the sixth
                        commandment. The use of heroin, LSD, pot (marijuana), and
                        tobacco would be included. The use of tea, coffee, and cola
                        drinks is harmful, not alone because of their enslaving nar-
                        cotic properties, but because they alternately stimulate and
                        depress the human nervous system, weakening and damaging
                        it and the human brain.
                            Three areas of indulgence appeal to the victim of appetite:
                         (1) condiments; (2) tea and coffee; (3) tobacco. Looking at
                        each one we observe:
                            Condiments. "In this fast age, the less exciting the food, the
                        better. Condiments are injurious in their nature. Mustard, pep-
                        per, spices, pickles, and other things of a like character, irritate
                        the stomach and make the blood feverish and impure. .. . Soon
                        ordinary food does not satisfy the appetite. The system feels a
                        want, a craving, for something more stimulating."—The Min-
                        istry of Healing, page 325.
                            Tea and Coffee. "Tea acts as a stimulant and, to a certain
                        extent, produces intoxication. The action of coffee and many
                        other popular drinks is similar.. . .
                            "What seems to be strength is only nervous excitement.
                        When the influence of the stimulant is gone, the unnatural
                        force abates, and the result is a corresponding degree of languor
                        and debility.
                            "The continued use of these nerve irritants is followed by
                        headache, wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, indigestion,
                        trembling, and many other evils; for they wear away the life
                        forces."—Ibid., p. 326.
                            Tobacco. "Tobacco is a slow, insidious, but most malignant
                         poison. In whatever form it is used, it tells upon the constitu-
                         tion. . . . Its use excites a thirst for strong drink and in many
                        cases lays the foundation for the liquor habit."—/bid., pp. 327,
                        328.
                            Consider this: The waste of money and energy and life itself
                        involved in the use of tea, coffee, and tobacco is colossal. No
                        human being needs these poisons.
                            The use of tobacco by youth is increasing. "To this cause
                        in no small degree is owing the physical, mental, and moral
                        deterioration which is becoming such a cause of alarm."—Ibid.,
                        pp. 328,329.
                          What commandment was given to protect and preserve
                        human life?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Which pleasure is more enduring and satisfying: To
                        indulge appetite? To control it?

      TEMPERANCE,       perate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corrup-
      A SAFEGUARD       tible crown; but we an incorruptible."
         1 Cor. 9:25
                            Temperance is a virtue which characterizes every true be-
                        liever. Notice three points:
                            1. "Our first duty toward God and our fellow beings is that
                        of self-development."—Temperance, page 137.
                            2. "That time is spent to good account which is directed to
                         the establishment and preservation of sound physical and men-
                        tal health."—Ibid.
                            3. "We cannot afford to dwarf or cripple a single function
                         of mind or body by overwork or by abuse of any part of the
                        living machinery."—Ibid.
                            "Intemperance, in the true sense of the word, is at the foun-
                         dation of the larger share of the ills of life, and it annually
                         destroys its tens of thousands. For intemperance is not limited
                         to the use of intoxicating liquors; it has a broader meaning, and
                         includes the hurtful indulgence of any appetite or passion."—
                        Ibid.
                            Temperance is a safeguard against the creeping moral paraly-
                         sis and physical and mental decline of millions of moderns.
                         While the great nations are spending billions to erect strong
                         defense systems against intercontinental missiles for physical
                         protection of human life, the Seventh-day Adventist Church
                         has a goal to safeguard the church and the world from intem-
                         perance, disease, and premature death. How well are we suc-
                         ceeding? Is there need for enlarging our temperance witness?
                             Temperance has an important place in the ladder of Chris-
                         tian perfection. 2 Peter 1:4-10. In the believer's life "knowl-
                         edge" precedes "temperance," and "patience" follows it. Here
                         is announced a physiological truth. A knowledgeable man will
                         be temperate and a temperate man will be patient. Temperance
                         is the fruit of divine knowledge. So the words of Peter become
                         stairs upon which to climb to a safer and happier life.
                             What is meant by Paul's expression, "Temperate in
                         all things"?

  THINK IT THROUGH           Think of the temperance principle in the light of the
                         following statement in "Counsels on Diet and Foods,"
                         page 333. Do you own this book? Is one piece of simple
                         pie harmful? or too much pie? or pie eaten too often? Is
                         there anything wrong with simple desserts per se?

    "Plain, simple pie may serve as des-     great to be resisted, and two or three
sert, but when one eats two or three         pieces of pie are added to the load
pieces merely to gratify an inordinate       placed upon the already overworked

   "Indulgence of appetite is the greatest cause of physical and mental debility, and lies

        A FACTOR rupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
       2 Cor. 11:3
                        Simplicity—is_a_Christian_ virtue. The Biblical expressions,
                     "The simplicity that is in Christ"—(2 Cor. 11:3) and, "In sim-
                     plicity and godly sincerity . . . we have had our conversation
                     in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward" (2 Cor.
                     1:12) need to be understood by Christians. Paul is here de-
                     scribing the Christian life unspoiled by artificiality and with
                     undivided allegiance.
                        Simplicity will mark (1) the personal manner and appear-
                     ance, (2) the dress, (3) the diet, (4) the recreation, (5) the
                     business dealings, (6) the witnessing, and (7) the worship, of
                     every Christian.
                        God loves to see simplicity in the church. See Early Writings,
                     page 115. The early denominations lost much of their power
                     by yielding it, and Seventh-day Adventists must never get
                     above it.
                        The profound things in religion and philosophy are simple.
                     The great things of God are simply conceived and simply
                     wrought. A converted man has a simple faith like a little child.
                     Matt. 18:3. The terms of God's requirements in the new cove-
                     nant are simplicity itself—believe and follow and live.
                        Simplicity marked the life and ministry of John the Bap-
                     tist. "The simplicity of his dress . . . was a standing rebuke
                     to the extravagance and display of the Jewish priests, and of
                     the people generally. His diet, purely vegetable, of locusts and
                     wild honey, was a rebuke to the indulgence of appetite and
                     the gluttony that everywhere prevailed."—Testimonies, Vol.
                     3, p. 62.
                        Jesus said that John was a great man. Matt. 11:7-11. In
                     what did his greatness consist? "He closed his mind to the
                     mass of tradition presented by the teachers of the Jewish
                     nation, and opened it to the wisdom which comes from above."
                     —Counsels to Teachers, page 445. John's character and fearless
                     testimony were the fruit of simple faith and surrendered obe-
                     dience to the expressed will of God. Seventh-day Adventists
                     are to do a work of reform similar to John's. We should study
                     his life and learn from his simplicity. See Testimonies, Vol. 3,
                     pp. 61-63.
                        How did Paul live before the believers in Corinth?
                     2 Cor. 1:12.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Human beings with their complex ways of thinking
                     and living find it difficult to exercise simple faith and to
                     live a simple, uncomplicated Christian life. But does sim-
                     plicity mean shallow thinking, shallow views and ideas
                     about God and the church? Is not simplicity compatible
                     with true greatness of thought and achievement?

             Part 2  "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye
     A SIMPLE DIET do, do all to the glory of God."
       1 Cor. 10:31
                         Paul urged all Christians to eat and drink to God's glory.
                     Ellen White wrote:
                         "In eating, dressing, . . . we want to preserve the simplicity
                     of true godliness."—Testimonies to Ministers, page Irrifow
                     can this be done? We must presuppose a knowledge of God's
                     will for us in this regard and a study of the principles which
                     should regulate and modify the dress and diet. The diet origi-
                     nally given to man in Eden before sin entered was simple, ade-
                     quate, and satisfying. See Gen. 1:27-30.
                         "We learn from the divine record that man was to eat of
                     the products of both field and tree, in other words of grain,
                     nuts, and fruit; the animals, to eat of 'every green herb,' vege-
                     tables, or green plants, and grass.
                         "The wording of this regulation reveals that it was not the
                     will of God that man should slaughter animals for food, or
                     that animals should prey upon one another; consequently, the
                     violent and often painful destruction of life by man and animals
                     is a result of the entry of sin into the world."—SDA Bible
                     Commentary, on Gen. 1:29.
                         Factors working against simplicity in diet would include:
                          1. Irregularities in Eating. "Regularity in eating should be
                     carefully observed. Nothing should be eaten between meals,
                      no confectionery, nuts, fruits, or food of any kind. Irregularities
                      in eating destroy the healthful tone of the digestive organs, to
                      the detriment of health and cheerfulness."—The Ministry of
                      Healing, page 384.
                          2. Too Much Variety at One Meal. "There should not be
                      a great variety at any one meal, for this encourages overeating
                     and causes indigestion."—Ibid., p. 299.
                          3. Serving Food in Courses. "Custom has decreed that the
                      food shall be placed upon the table in courses. . . . If all the
                      food intended for a meal is placed on the table at the begin-
                      ning, one has opportunity to make the best choice."—Ibid.,
                      p. 306.
                          4. Eating Too Heartily. "Many who discard flesh meats and
                      other gross and injurious articles think that because their food
                      is simple and wholesome they may indulge appetite without
                      restraint, and they eat to excess, sometimes to gluttony. This
                      is an error. The digestive organs should not be burdened with
                      a quantity or quality of food which it will tax the system to
                      appropriate."—Ibid.
                        May the Christian dishonor God by his habits of eat-
                     ing and drinking?

  THINK IT THROUGH       Alexander the Great fell through indulging appetite.

The Appetite and Health LESSON 9                                         ❑ Tuesday

                                                                       November 24
           Part 3     "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb
 THE ORIGINAL DIET bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and
                   every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding
        Gen. 1:29 seed; to you it shall be for meat."

                          The grains, fruits, and nuts of the fields and forests and
                      groves of the earth are still the best sources of man's food
                      supply—and the most nutritious and delicious. This was true
                      not simply for the first generation of mankind, but it is true
                      for mankind today. With the exploding world population (over
                      3,500,000,000 in 1970) the earth's supply of available foods must
                      increase dramatically to prevent the spread of famine. Plant
                      foods can conceivably supply this need. Animal products in
                      the form of meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products are
                      inadequate and will remain so. Wrote Ellen White:
                         "The Lord has given His life to the trees and vines of His
                      creation. . . . We are to regard the trees laden with fruit as
                      the gift of God, just as much as though He placed the fruit in
                      our hands."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                      mentary, Vol. 1, p. 1081.
                          God never intended to feed the human race with the flesh
                      of dead animals.
                         "Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen
                      for us by our Creator. These foods, prepared in as simple and
                      natural a manner as possible, are the most healthful and nour-
                      ishing. They impart a strength, a power of endurance, and a
                      vigor of intellect, that are not afforded by a more complex
                      and stimulating diet."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 363.
                         "He will teach us how to prepare wholesome food free from
                      the taint of flesh meat."—/bid.
                          If special care and selection is exercised, plant foods may
                      still prove to be an adequate supplier of our dietary needs—
                      especially with soybean products available and the Vitamin B12,

                          After the fall of man, vegetables were allowed on man's bill
                       of fare. These "green herbs" were originally for the beasts.
                          "We evidently are to conclude that the quantity and quality
                       of grains and nuts and fruits originally given to man were, as
                       a result of the curse, reduced to such an extent that man would
                       be required to look to the herbs for a portion of his daily
                       food. This change may also have been due in part to the loss
                       of certain elements from the tree of life, to a change in climate,
                       and perhaps most of all to man's sentence to hard labor in the
                       process of earning a livelihood."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                       Gen. 3:18.
                           Regarding flesh food: "It was not till after the Flood that
                       God gave man permission to eat of the flesh of animals. . . .
                       Even ancient pagan legends speak of a golden age of inno-
                       cence, when man abstained from killing animals."—Ibid., on
                       Gen. 1:29.
                           The use of meat was permitted in the emergency after the
                       Flood—"as once I gave you the green growth" (Gen. 9:3,
                       Moffatt), that is, in the same sense as in the emergency of
                       man's fall into sin God gave him vegetables. But the average
                       age of postdiluvian man as compared with the antidiluvian was
                       greatly diminished. Compare Genesis 5 and 11.
                           "This [Gen. 9:3, 4] implies the newness of the permission
                       to eat flesh food, in addition to the vegetables and fruits that
                       had originally been destined to be man's food. Not only was
                       the temporary absence of plant life, as a result of the Flood,
                       the reason for God's permission to man to supplement his
                       vegetarian diet with meat, but probably also the fact that the
                       Flood had so thoroughly changed this earth's outward form
                       and diminshed its fertility that in some lands, such as the far
                       north, it would not produce sufficient vegetarian food to sus-
                        tain the human race."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Gen. 9:3.
                           What supplementary foods did God permit man to

          FOR MAN         The Lord's messenger was shown in vision "again and again
                      . . . that God is trying to lead us back, step by step, to His

                          "Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord,
                      meat eating will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to
                      form a part of their diet. We should ever keep this end in view,
                      and endeavor to work steadily toward it. I cannot think that
                      in the practice of flesh eating we are in harmony with the
                      light which God has been pleased to give us."—Counsels on
                      Diet and Foods, pages 380, 381.
                          "It is for their own good that the Lord counsels the remnant
                      church to discard the use of flesh meats, tea, and coffee, and
                      other harmful foods. There are plenty of other things on which
                      we can subsist that are wholesome and good."—Ibid., p. 381.
                          We are counseled to leave meat alone because of the increase
                      of disease in the animal kingdom.
                          "Flesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly
                      objectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing.
                          "Animals are becoming more and more diseased, and it will

                      taken when dead, you would turn with loathing from your

                          "From the light God has given me, the prevalence of cancer

             Part 6         Emergency conditions sometimes justify the use of clean
        EMERGENCY       meats as food. This may be true in lands where flesh food is
        SITUATIONS      obtainable but not fruits, vegetables, et cetera. It may also be
                        true in other lands where certain individuals are unable to
                        secure proper nourishment from natural foods. Let no one
                        judge another and be critical of him.
                            "In certain cases of illness or exhaustion it may be thought
                        best to use some meat, but great care should be taken to secure
                        the flesh of healthy animals. It has come to be a very serious
                        question whether it is safe to use flesh food at all in this age
                        of the world....
                            "A meat diet is not the most wholesome of diets, and yet
                        I would not take the position that meat should be discarded
                         by everyone. Those who have feeble digestive organs can often
                         use meat, when they cannot eat vegetables, fruit, or porridge."
                         —Counsels on Diet and Foods, pages 394, 395.
                            When meat is no longer used, what foods are best to re-
                         place it? The answer is, a variety of foods.
                            "When flesh food is discarded, its place should be supplied
                         with a variety of grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits that will
                         be both nourishing and appetizing. This is especially necessary
                         in the case of those who are weak or who are taxed with con-
                         tinuous labor. In some countries where poverty abounds, flesh
                         is the cheapest food. Under these circumstances the change will
                         be made with greater difficulty; but it can be effected. We
                         should, however, consider the situation of the people and the
                         power of lifelong habit, and should be careful not to urge even
                         right ideas unduly. None should be urged to make the change
                         abruptly. The place of meat should be supplied with wholesome
                         foods that are inexpensive."—The Ministry of Healing, pages
                         316, 317.
                           Are real emergency situations which justify the use
                        of meat rare or numerous?

  THINK IT THROUGH          How can one verify what pleases the Lord? In health
                        reform? In any kind of reform? The question of the con-
                        trol of the appetite is a large one. The true follower of
                        Jesus will, like Paul, bring under control the body with
                        its appetites and passions. "Live and act as sons of Light,"
                        said the apostle, "and learn in your own experience what
                        is fully pleasing to the Lord." Eph. 5:8-10, Weymouth.

    JESUS' VICTORY to be tempted of the devil. And when He had fasted
     OVER APPETITE forty days and forty nights, He was afterward anhun-
                     gered. And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If
                     Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be

                     Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
        Matt. 4:1-4 that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
                           Jesus supported His teaching by His own example and self-
                       control. Think of the dimension of suffering He endured in the
                       forty-day fast in the wilderness.
                           "All was lost when Adam yielded to the power of appetite.
                       The Redeemer, in whom was united both the human and the
                       divine, stood in Adam's place, and endured a terrible fast of
                       nearly six weeks. The length of this fast is the strongest evi-

                       ily, and its indulgence so fearful that the Son of God subjected

                            Paul was aware of the need for temperance in all things.
                        He imitated the Example. See 1 Cor. 9:24-27. "Paul was a
                        health reformer. Said he: 'I keep under my body, and bring it
                        into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached
                        to others, I myself should be a castaway.' He felt that a re-
                        sponsibility rested upon him to preserve all his powers in their
                        strength, that he might use them to the glory of God. If Paul
                        was in danger from intemperance, we are in greater danger,
                        because we do not feel and realize as he did the necessity of
                        glorifying God in our bodies and spirits, which are His."—
                        Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 454.
                            Peter viewed fleshly lusts as warring against the soul. "Dearly
                         beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from
                         fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." 1 Peter 2:11.
                            The wise man gives good counsel: "Be not among wine-
                         bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: for the drunkard and
                         the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe
                         a man with rags." Prov. 23:20, 21.
                            On the other hand, many—especially among the fairer sex
                         —undermine their health by carrying dieting to extremes and
                         robbing the body of necessary food. Vanity can be as destruc-
                         tive of health as overeating! Is this glorifying God?
                           How long did Jesus fast in the wilderness?

  THINK IT THROUGH         Christ came to grips with the power of appetite after
                        a fast of nearly six weeks, and He gained the victory.
                        If He could exercise such self-discipline, without using
                        divine power in His own behalf ("The Desire of Ages,"
                        page 119), what excuse have any of us for failure on this
                        point?

                         things that ye would."
                            "These cravings of our earthly nature conflict with the
                         Spirit, and the Spirit with our earthly nature—they are
                         two contrary principles—so that you cannot do what you
         Gal. 5:16, 17 wish." Verse 17, Twentieth Century New Testament.

                            A battle rages in every Christian's life. See Gal. 5:16-25;
                         Eph. 6:10-18. This battle is of the body as much as of the
                         spirit.
                            "The seemingly interminable warfare goes on, the struggle
                         between the inclination to do right and the inclination to do
                         evil. As Paul analyzed this conflict in his own past experience
                         he saw victory possible only through Jesus Christ (see Rom.
                         7:24 to 8:2)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Gal. 5:17.
                            "Paul's teaching concerning the weakness of the flesh is out
                         of harmony with the belief that there is latent in man a force
                         by which he can overcome evil tendencies."—Ibid.
                            It is through Christ that the victory over appetite is gained,
                         as it is through Christ that victory over pride, bad temper,
                         vanity, and every other sin is gained. Christ is the answer to
                         the sin problem—all of the sin problem. He alone. "Neither is
                         there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under
                         heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts
                         4:12.
                            But remember: "Pure religion has to do with the will. The
                         will is the governing power in the nature of man, bringing all
                         the other faculties under its sway. The will is not the taste or
                         the inclination, but it is the deciding power which works in

                             What is the only way to prevent the living of a life
                         of lust and sin?

 THINK IT THROUGH            A cooperative action prevails throughout the Christian
                         life, from beginning to end. God and man working hand
                         in hand—this is the invincible partnership plan. Are we

The Appetite and Character Development              LESSON 10         ❑   Wednesday
                                                                          December 2
             Part 4        "And He said to them all, If any man will come after
       STRENGTH IN      Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,
         THE CROSS      and follow Me."
                           "Then He said to all, 'Anyone who wants to follow Me
                        must put aside his own desires and conveniences and
                        carry his cross with him every day and keep close to
           Luke 9:23    Me!' " The Living New Testament.

                            The cross is a symbol of our death to the world. This dying
                        to the world does not come without a struggle, but the effort
                        involved develops spiritual muscle and soul strength.
                            We are all to some degree like Peter, who wanted Christ
                        but not His cross. "The disciple shrank from fellowship with his
                        Lord in suffering. But in the heat of the furnace fire he was
                        to learn its blessing....
                            "Jesus . . . explained to His disciples that His own life of
                        self-abnegation was an example of what theirs should be. Calling
                        about Him, with the disciples, the people who had been linger-
                        ing near, He said, 'If any man will come after Me, let him
                        deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.'
                        . . . No more complete self-surrender could the Saviour's words
                        have pictured. But all this He had accepted for them. Jesus
                        did not count heaven a place to be desired while we were lost.
                        He left the heavenly courts for a life of reproach and insult, and
                        a death of shame. He who was rich in heaven's priceless trea-
                        sure, became poor, that through His poverty we might be rich.
                         We are to follow in the path He trod."—The Desire of Ages,
                        pages 416, 417.
                            What is the man to do who would follow Jesus?

 THINK IT THROUGH          There is a cross to bear in living simply and temper-

            DEATH     die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life
                      shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall
     John 12:24, 25   keep it unto life eternal."

                          Jesus illustrated the way to a happy Christian life. He re-
                      ferred to the planted seed and its fruitful harvest. "If it dies,
                      it makes a rich yield" is Weymouth's rendering of verse 24.
                          The next verse is an amplification: "He who holds his life
                      dear, destroys it." He is like seed that is eaten but not planted.
                      The seed does not reproduce or bear fruit, but the planted seed
                      which dies lives in the fruit it bears—on and on forever.
                         "All who would bring forth fruit as workers together with
                      Christ must first fall into the ground and die. The life must be
                      cast into the furrow of the world's need. Self-love, self-interest,
                      must perish. And the law of self-sacrifice is the law of self-
                      preservation. The husbandman preserves his grain by casting
                      it away. So in human life. To give is to live. The life that will
                      be preserved is the life that is freely given in service to God
                      and man. Those who for Christ's sake sacrifice their life in
                      this world will keep it unto life eternal."—The Desire of Ages,
                      pages 623, 624.
                          This great goal of living to bless the world and glorify God
                      is the prime consideration in living a life of temperance. One
                      cannot live for others while he is living for himself. But when
                      He is living for Christ and to save souls for whom Jesus died,
                      self dies and is plowed under in "the furrow of the world's
                      need" while precious fruit springs up to testify to the new and
                      abundant life that comes from God.
                          An intemperate man is seldom interested in the spiritual wel-
                      fare of other people—even in his own. "The end of such men
                      is ruin; for their appetites are their god." Phil. 3:19, Twentieth
                      Century New Testament. He is not concerned about persuading
                      people to worship the Lord. "Their future is eternal loss, for
                      their god is good food." Taylor.

          VICTORY"        "For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world:
         John 16:33    and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even
          1 John 5:4   our faith."
                          "Keep up your courage," (Weymouth) ; "Be confident,"
                       (Berkeley) ; "Never lose heart," (Phillips) ; "Cheer up," (Tay-
                       lor)—all are translations of part of John 16:33.
                          The basis for courage and confidence is Jesus' affirmation:
                       "I have overcome the world," or (Phillips), "I have con-
                       quered the world."
                           In the wilderness of temptation Christ gained an outstand-
                       ing victory in His conquest of the world, the flesh, and the
                       devil. Our victory lies in this Person, whom faith is to grasp
                       —not in faith itself.
                          "Christ fought the battle upon the point of appetite, and
                       came off victorious; and we also can conquer through strength
                       derived from Him. Who will enter in through the gates into
                       the city?—Not those who declare that they cannot break the
                       force of appetite. Christ has resisted the power of him who
                       would hold us in bondage; though weakened by His long fast
                       of forty days, He withstood temptation, and proved by this
                       act that our cases are not hopeless. I know that we cannot
                        obtain the victory alone; and how thankful we should be that
                       we have a living Saviour, who is ready and willing to aid us!
                           "A pure and noble life, a life of victory over appetite and
                        lust, is possible to everyone who will unite his weak, wavering
                       human will to the omnipotent, unwavering will of God."—
                        Counsels on Diet and Foods, pages 169, 170.
                           We can make an entire change in our lives by God's grace
                       if we place our will on God's side.
                           What part does faith have in overcoming the world?

 THINK IT THROUGH          "If thou couldst in vision see thyself the man God
                        meant, thou ne'er wouldst be the man thou art—content!"
                        Does not the challenge of victory and eternal life demand
                        arousement of every faculty of mind and body and spirit?

     MARRIAGE AND Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
     THE EDEN HOME
           Gen. 2:15 There were no cities in the very beginning—only rural sur-
                       roundings. The Eden home and its environs were to be an
                       example of what every earthly home should be in the cen-
                       turies that stretched ahead. God made the country. Man made
                       the city. The happy and healthful home institution was con-
                       ceived and created by Christ Himself.
                           Christ "ordained that men and women should be united in
                       holy wedlock, to rear families whose members, crowned with
                       honor, should be recognized as members of the family above."
                       —The Ministry of Healing, page 356. Our Lord "sanctioned
                       marriage, recognizing it as an institution that He Himself had
                       established."—Ibid. It was not His intention in the beginning
                       that the marriage ties should ever be broken, for He declared,
                       "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
                       shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." Gen.
                       2:24. "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man
                       put asunder." Mark 10:9.
                          Divorce, while it serves a purpose in cases of marital infi-
                       delity (see Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12), was not known among
                       men until long centuries after sin entered the world. Polygamy
                       came in the wake of sin, as did the crimes of sodomy, child
                       marriage, and other perversions of the divine institution of
                       marriage.
                          Broken homes often bring about broken health. And the
                       heartaches, mental breakdowns, and suicides caused by divorce
                       can never be measured. Divorces were allowed, Jesus told the
                       people, because of "the hardness of your heart." Mark 10:5.
                       Ellen White traced the problems back to the problem-maker:
                       "Satan is ever ready to take advantage when any matter of
                       variance arises, and by moving upon the objectionable, heredi-
                       tary traits of haracter in husband or wife, he will try to cause
                       the alienation of those who have united their interests in a
                       solemn covenant before God."—The Adventist Home, page 106.
                          "Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may
                       arise, let neither husba
                                              nd nor wife harbor the thought that

                       happy, as in your marriage pledge you promised to do."—Ibid.,
                       p. 112.
                           Where was the first home established—in the city or
                       the country?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Marriages fail because human love fails. But what
                       of marriages where the human love is strengthened and
                       purified by divine love? Can they survive?

  THE BENEDICTION Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: and both
        AT CANA Jesus was called, and His disciples, to the marriage."
       John 2:1,2
                         Christ during His earthly ministry honored the marriage re-
                     lation. John 2:1-11. His presence at the wedding at Cana and
                     His interest in the services and the feast that followed brought
                     joy to His heart and happiness to others. See The Desire of
                     Ages, page 144.
                         At the marriage service Jesus turned the water to wine and
                     added His blessing 'to the festivities. "He who gave Eve to
                     Adam as a helpmeet, performed His first miracle at a marriage
                     festival. In the festal hall where friends and kindred rejoiced
                     together, Christ began His public ministry."—The Ministry of
                     Healing, page 356.
                         Paul tells us that marriage is a symbol of the union between
                     Christ and His church. See Eph. 5:25-33.
                         "Christ honored the marriage relation by making it also a
                     symbol of the union between Him and His redeemed ones. . . .
                         "The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred,
                      of any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind.
                     And it is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant is entered
                     into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due considera-
                      tion for its responsibilities."—Ibid., pp. 356, 357.
                         People planning to get married should look beyond the joy
                      of "having each other"—pleasant as that may be—to respon-
                     sible citizenship and parenthood. They should think in terms
                      of (1) improving the capacity of their service to God and
                      men; (2) building a happy home in which their children will
                      learn to love God, to respect law and order, and to honor all
                      the races of men; (3) serving God in spirit and truth and en-
                      couraging their neighbors to have faith in God and His Word.
                         "Those who are contemplating marriage should consider
                      what will be the character and influence of the home they are
                       founding. As they become parents, a sacred trust is committed
                      to them. Upon them depends in a great measure the well-being
                      of their children in this world, and their happiness in the world
                      to come. To a great extent they determine both the physical
                      and the moral stamp that the little ones receive. And upon
                      the character of the home depends the condition of society; the
                      weight of each family's influence will tell in the upward or the
                      downward scale."—Ibid., p. 357. (Italics supplied.)

                                                                         December 8
             Part 3  "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in
      HOMES IN THE Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed."
 CITY OR COUNTRY?
           Gen. 2:8 Notice that God located the first man's home in a rural set-
                       ting. Adam's employment was gardening and fruit farming.
                       There were no cities then nor houses as we know them today.
                       The first couple lived in arbors they framed for themselves
                       from living vines.
                          "The physical surroundings in the cities are often a peril to
                       health. The constant liability to contact with disease, the prev-
                       alence of foul air, impure water, impure food, the crowded,
                       dark, unhealthful dwellings, are some of the many evils to be
                       met.
                          "It was not God's purpose that people should be crowded
                       into cities, huddled together in terraces and tenements."—The
                       Ministry of Healing, page 365.
                          The first urban center or city was built by Cain, Adam's
                       rebellious son and the first criminal. Gen. 4:17.
                          "It is worthy of note that the world's first 'city' was founded
                       by the world's first murderer, a perversely impenitent individual
                       whose life, wholly and hopelessly dedicated to evil, was spent
                       in defiance of God. God's plan that man should live amid nature
                       and behold in it the Creator's might and power was in this
                       way thwarted. Many present-day evils are the direct result of
                       the unnatural gathering together of human beings into great
                       cities, where man's worst instincts bear rule, and vice of every
                       type flourishes."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Gen. 4:17.
                          Note carefully the following prophetic words:
                          Tide of Crime Swelling. "The world over, cities are becoming
                       hotbeds of vice. On every hand are the sights and sounds of
                       evil. Everywhere are enticements to sensuality and dissipation.
                       The tide of corruption and crime is continually swelling. Every
                       day brings the record of violence—robberies, murders, suicides,
                       and crimes unnamable."—The Ministry of Healing, page 363.
                          Cities Will Be Destroyed. "I am bidden to declare the mes-
                       sage that cities full of transgression, and sinful in the extreme,
                       will be destroyed by earthquakes, by fire, by flood. All the
                       world will be warned that there is a God who will display His
                       authority as God. His unseen agencies will cause destruction,
                       devastation, and death. All the accumulated riches will be as
                       nothingness."—Evangelism, page 27.
                          Where did God put the man whom He had formed?

Health and Family Life     LESSON 11                               ❑   Wednesday
                                                                       December 9
            Part 4    "Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot
 LOT'S BIG MISTAKE dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent
        Gen. 13:12 toward Sodom."

                         Read Gen. 19:1-3, 12-26.
                        A terrible mistake was made by Lot, Abraham's nephew,
                     when he moved into Sodom, a city of the plains—a city in
                     which wealth, idleness, and moral decadence predominated.
                     Here he reared his family, and here they lost their spirituality.
                     Here their material resources increased. Here the majority of
                     Lot's family exchanged the riches of God for the treasures of
                     this life. As Lot fled the doomed city with the pitiful remnant
                     of his family, his wife became a pillar of salt. Gen. 19:26. His
                     sons and daughters—except two—perished in the fires of God
                     which devoured the place.
                         "Lot chose Sodom for his home because he saw advantages
                     to be, gained there from a worldly point of view. But after he
                     had established himself, and grown rich in earthly treasure, he
                     was convinced that he had made a mistake in not taking into
                     consideration the moral standing of the community in which
                     he was to make his home."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p. 1092.
                         In view of the dangers to health and life and virtue inci-
                     dental to city living, the Lord has given counsel:
                         "Educate our people to get out of the cities into the country,
                     where they can obtain a small piece of land, and make a home
                     for themselves and their children."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2,
                     p. 142.
                         This move should be made prayerfully, cautiously and not
                     precipitously. Employment, property, school privileges, travel
                      problems, must all be considered, among other things. But the
                      Lord promises to open the way for His children.
                          And how far out is "country"? At the turn of the century
                      Takoma Park—about seven miles from Washington, D.C.—was
                      considered appropriate enough to build our institutions there;
                      Loma Linda in relation to Redlands and San Bernardino was
                      rural; Glendale in relation to Los Angeles was proper. Today
                      the cities have engulfed them. What the encroachments of the
                      cities will do in the future poses a great problem to the Lord's
                      people.
                          Keep in mind that the great cities need the witness of God's
                      light bearers and that the cities may be worked by Adventists
                      coming in from suburban or rural areas. See Testimonies, Vol.
                      2, p. 115; Selected Messages, Bk. 2, pp. 357, 358.
                          What was Lot's big mistake?

  THINK IT THROUGH       Have you noticed that plants growing too close to-
                      gether are spindly? Transplant half of them to areas
                      where there is more sunshine and nourishment in the soil
                      and observe the dramatic change.

            Part 5      "Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled:
HUSBAND-AND-WIFE     but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."

         Heb. 13:4   mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be
        Gen. 2:24    one flesh."

                         Read Eph. 5:28-31.
                        "Everybody should think highly of marriage." Heb. 13:4,
                     Beck. The Scripture idealizes the blending of two lives into
                     one, physically as well as spiritually, but "only where Christ
                     reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish love. Then soul will be
                     knit with soul, and the two lives will blend in harmony. Angels
                     of God will be guests in the home, and their holy vigils will
                     hallow the marriage chamber."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 362.
                        "Many parents do not obtain the knowledge that they should
                     in the married life. They are not guarded lest Satan take ad-
                     vantage of them and control their minds and their lives. They
                     do not see that God requires them to control their married lives
                     from any excesses."—Ibid., Vol. 2, p. 472.
                        "When the sacred nature and the claims of marriage are
                     understood, it will even now be approved of Heaven; and the
                     result will be happiness to both parties, and God will be glori-
                     fied."—Ibid., p. 252.
                        Many a marriage fails because the spouses are religiously
                     incompatible. "Be ye not unequally yoked together with un-
                     believers." 2 Cora 6:14. "Do not be mismated with unbelievers."
                     Norlie. And what is meant by "unbelievers"?
                        After quoting this text, Ellen White wrote to a sister in the
                     church: "The commands I have quoted are not the word of
                     man, but of God. Though the companion of your choice were
                     in all other respects worthy (which he is not), yet he has not
                     accepted the truth for this time; he is an unbeliever, and you
                     are forbidden of heaven to unite yourself with him. You cannot,
                     without peril to your soul, disregard this divine injunction."

                        "If men and women are in the habit of praying twice a day
                     before they contemplate marriage, they should pray four times
                     a day when such a step is anticipated."—Messages to Young
                     People, page 460.
                         What should be our attitude toward the marriage in-
                     stitution?

 THINK IT THROUGH        The Bible says of Solomon, "His wives turned away
                     his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect
                     with the Lord his God." 1 Kings 11:4. The king's mistake
                     was not polygamy alone. His wives were religiously
                     diverse and pagan. How could he remain true to "the
                     Lord his God" under such influences! The sad memory
                     of Solomon's apostasy is in the Bible for a purpose.

                          The husband and father occupies a unique position as head
                      of •the home, but "it is no evidence of manliness in the husband
                      for him to dwell constantly upon his position as head of the
                      family. . . . Let every husband who claims to love God care-

                      Her husband may depend on her, and never lose by that; she
                      brings him profit and no loss, from first to last." "Her sons
                      congratulate her, and thus her husband praises her: 'Many a
                      woman does nobly, but you far outdo them all!' Charms may
                      wane and beauty wither, keep your praise for a wife with
                      brains; give her due credit for her deeds, praise her in public
                      for her services." Prov. 31:10-12, 28-30, Moffatt.
                          The successful wife will observe these ideas thoughtfully:
                          "Married life is not all romance; it has its real difficulties and
                      its homely details. The wife must not consider herself a doll,
                       to be tended, but a woman; one to put her shoulder under real,
                       not imaginary, burdens, and live an understanding, thoughtful
                      life, considering that there are other things to be thought of
                       than herself."—The Adventist Home, pages 110, 111.
                          And children are the special treasure of the home. See Ps.
                      128:3.

                          "When two compose a family, . . . and there are no children
                       to call into exercise patience, forbearance, and true love, there
                       is need of constant watchfulness lest selfishness obtain the
                       supremacy, lest you yourselves become the center, and you
                       require attention, care, and interest, which you feel under no
                       obligation to bestow upon others."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 231.
                           If a home is truly Christian, it will be a center of health
                       and happiness—a glad and glorious place where angels will
                       dwell and from which will radiate light to break the spell of
                       darkness in the world.
                         What is to be the relationship of husband and wife
                      in marriage?

  THINK IT THROUGH       How can we account for the distance between some
                      youth today and their parents and their parents' religion?
                      Does this bear any relationship to the degree in which
                      the parents have failed to follow the Lord's plan for a
                      happy home? Are the youth to blame for the generation

         POWER OF and his household after him, and they shall keep the
         PARENTAL way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the
          EXAMPLE Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken
         Gen. 18:19 of him."

                         "God could trust Abraham, for he would 'command' his
                      family, not by dictatorial methods, but by clear precept and
                      consistent example. In training children, every word, look, and
                      act has its effect. In many homes, there is little training by way
                      of either instruction or example. Parents are held accountable
                      for the sacred trust of children and should therefore combine
                      firmness with love, as did Abraham. This task of training up
                      children in the way they should go cannot be delegated to
                      another, custodian or teacher, without grave danger of loss.
                      The influence of godly teachers should not be expected to sup-
                      plant, but rather to supplement, home training. Each has its
                      place, and is incomplete without the help of the other to aid
                      and reinforce it."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Gen. 18:19.
                         The great power of influence is inherent in the life of every
                      parent. Read these texts to see how influence weighs upon all
                      we touch with our lives: 1 Tim. 4:12; Phil. 4:9; Titus 2:7;
                      1 Cor. 5:6; 8:9, 13.
                         Ellen White wrote to a man and his wife these words: "You
                      both need home piety, sweet, satisfied contentment, without
                      faultfinding, pettishness, scolding, or severity. Let kindness and
                      love be the rule of your household. Whoever does not let the
                      light of truth shine in his home dishonors the Saviour."—Testi-

                         In another place she said: "Every influence surrounding the
                      youth needs to be on the right side, for youthful depravity is
                      increasing."—Child Guidance, page 325.
                         Youth lose confidence in God, the church, the whole "estab-

                         How did the Lord express His confidence in the patri-
                      arch Abraham?

                      responsibility and obligation that rests upon all of us in

                       "Fathers, don't overcorrect your children or make it
                   difficult for them to obey the commandment. Bring them
                   up with Christian teaching in Christian discipline." Phil-

                         "The father should enforce in his family the sterner virtues
                      —energy, integrity, honesty, patience, courage, diligence, and
                      practical usefulness. And what he requires of his children he
                      himself should practice, illustrating these virtues in his own
                      manly bearing.
                         "But, fathers, do not discourage your children. Combine
                      affection with authority, kindness and sympathy with firm
                      restraint. Give some of your leisure hours to your children;
                      become acquainted with them; associate with them in their
                      work and in their sports, and win their confidence. Cultivate
                      friendship with them, especially with your sons. In this way
                      you will be a strong influence for good."—The Ministry of
                      Healing, pages 391, 392.
                         The father should be the religious leader in the family, un-
                      ashamed and open in his faith in God and his love for Jesus
                      Christ. In •this way an image of benevolent authority is created
                      that will teach his children wholesome respect for God and all
                      who occupy positions of influence. This image will do much to
                      safeguard the home and society from crime. Millions of boys
                      long for such a father image but do not see it at home. These
                      boys are most likely to become criminals.
                         The father's spiritual leadership is basic. He cannot shift
                      this burden to his wife.
                         "The father should do his part toward making home happy.
                      Whatever his cares and business perplexities, they should not
                      be permitted to overshadow his family; he should enter his
                      home with smiles and pleasant words.
                         "In a sense the father is the priest of the household, laying
                      upon the family altar the morning and evening sacrifice. But
                      the wife and children should unite in prayer and join in the
                      song of praise. In the morning before he leaves home for his
                      daily labor, let the father gather his children about him and,
                      bowing before God, commit them to the care of the Father in
                      heaven. When the cares of the day are past, let the family
                       unite in offering grateful prayer and raising the song of praise,
                      in acknowledgement of divine care during the day."—Ibid.,
                      pp. 392, 393.
                          How can a father discourage his children?
 THINK IT THROUGH         The body is dead without breath. Home religion is
                      dead without spirit and love and affection. The letter
                      kills. The spirit gives life. Affection and authority go to-

                     prayed this prayer: "Teach us what we shall do unto the child
                    that shall be born." Verse 8. When the angel appeared to •them,
                    Manoah asked, "How shall we order the child, and how shall
                    we do unto him?" Verse 12. Their questions might well be
                    asked by all modern parents.
                       "Not only the habits of the mother, but the training of the
                    child were included in the angel's instruction to the Hebrew
                    parents. It was not enough that Samson, the child who was to
                    deliver Israel, should have a good legacy at his birth. This was
                    to be followed by careful training. From infancy he was to be
                    trained to habits of strict temperance."—The Ministry of Heal-
                    ing, page 379.
                       "The carefulness with which the mother should guard her
                    habits of life is taught in the Scriptures.
                       "The reform should begin with the mother before the birth
                    of her children; and if God's instructions were faithfully
                    obeyed, intemperance would not exist."—Child Guidance, page

                       Prenatal influence is not the same thing as inheritance of
                    traits of character through the genes. It is the influence directly
                    of all of the habits of the mother upon her unborn child during
                    her pregnancy. Physicians today recognize this influence as a
                    potent force in the new life for good or ill.
                       Wrote Dr. Ashley Montague: "All this is not to say that
                    every mother who is emotionally disturbed during pregnancy
                    will give birth to a neurotic baby. Nor does it mean that every
                    baby with intestinal disturbances or other symptoms mentioned
                    is neurotic. The existence of a physical cause for a baby's trou-
                    ble must always be thoroughly considered.
                       "However, there is now sufficient evidence from many sources
                    to indicate that the unborn child can be variously affected by
                    physical changes in the mother, and that although a woman
                    cannot 'mark' her baby by seeing something unpleasant before
                    he is born, nor make him a poet by reading Keats and Shelley
                    during her pregnancy, there are ways in which she definitely
                    can influence his behavior pattern. It is largely up to her, and
                    to those surrounding her during her pregnancy, whether her
                    infant will be born a happy, healthy, sweet-tempered individual
                    or an ill-adjusted neurotic."—Ladies' Home Journal, February,
                    1954, page 43.
                       What instruction did the Lord give to Manoah's wife?

 THINK IT THROUGH      Does the father's influence figure at all in the life of
                    the unborn? How can he contribute to his wife's happiness
                    during this period?

                         Instruction was given to Zacharias and Elisabeth in regard
                     to the habits of the son to be born to them in their old age.
                     The parents of John the Baptist were obedient to the Lord's
                     instruction concerning John.
                         "The work committed to him [John] was one demanding
                     not only physical energy and endurance, but the highest quali-
                     ties of mind and soul. So important was right physical train-
                     ing as a preparation for this work that the highest angel in
                     heaven was sent with a message of instruction to the parents
                     of the child."—The Ministry of Healing, page 379.
                         "Nothing which affects the child's physical well-being is to
                      be neglected. Nothing is unimportant. Every influence that
                      affects the health of the body has its bearing upon mind and
                      character."—/bid., p. 380.
                         The early years in training children are far more important
                      to the future years than the college years or any time spent
                      in gaining a formal education in the best of schools.
                         "Too much importance cannot be placed upon the early
                      training of children. The lessons learned, the habits formed,
                      during the years of infancy and childhood, have more to do
                      with the formation of the character and the direction of the
                      life than have all the instruction and training of afteryears.
                         "Parents need to consider this. They should understand the
                      principles that underlie the care and training of children. They
                      should be capable of rearing them in physical, mental, and
                      moral health. Parents should study the laws of nature. They
                      should become acquainted with the organism of the human
                      body. They need to understand the functions of the various
                      organs, and their relation and dependence. They should study
                      the relation of the mental to the physical powers, and the
                      conditions required for the healthy action of each. To assume
                      the responsibilities of parenthood without such preparation is
                      a sin.
                          "Far too little thought is given to the causes underlying the
                       mortality, the disease and degeneracy, that exist today even in
                      the most civilized and favored lands."—Ibid., p. 380. (Italics

         CHARACTER
       DEVELOPMENT           An area of child training often neglected is teaching children
                          the control of their appetites and fancies.
          Prov. 26:2
                            "Parents should train the appetites of their children and
                         should not permit •the use of unwholesome foods. But in the
                         effort to regulate the diet, we should be careful not to err in
                         requiring children to eat that which is distasteful, or •to eat
                         more than is needed. Children have rights, they have prefer-
                         ences, and when these preferences are reasonable they should
                         be respected.
                            "Regularity in eating should be carefully observed. Nothing
                         should be eaten between meals, no confectionery, nuts, fruits,
                         or food of any kind. Irregularities in eating destroy the health-
                         ful tone of the digestive organs, to the detriment of health and
                         cheerfulness. And when •the children come to the table, they
                         do not relish wholesome food; their appetites crave that which
                         is hurtful for them.
                            "Mothers who gratify the desires of their children at the
                         expense of health and happy tempers, are sowing seeds of evil
                         that will spring up and bear fruit."—The Ministry of Healing,
                         page 384.
                            The wise man wrote of the law of cause and effect as fol-
                         lows: "As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so
                         the curse causeless shall not come." Prov. 26:2. The sparrow
                         has a reason for the way he flutters and the swallow for flying
                         as he does; so any malediction that appears is the result of a
                         provoking cause.
                            Ellen White wrote that "nine tenths of the wickedness among
                         the children of today is caused by intemperance in eat-
                         ing and drinking."—Temperance, page 150. She also declared,
                         "The diet materially affects the mind and disposition."—The

                            There are scientific evidences now coming to light which
                         support the correlation of certain diet practices to moral de-
                         linquency and behavior patterns.
                            Why do sorrows and troubles come to man?

    PARENTAL LOVE       proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her
     AND CONCERN        daughter."
        Ezek. 16:44
                           Read Hos. 4:9; Prov. 22:24, 25.
                            In ancient times this parable was used sneeringly by the
                         Lord's enemies to humiliate the Israelites. The parable has
                         truth in it. As is the cause, so is the effect. An old proverb goes:
                         "As is the breeding, so is the practice." Another says: "You
                         cannot make a velvet purse out of a sow's ear." Such old prov-
                         erbs show the necessity of early holy precepts supported by
                         suitable example.
                             Parents who love their children will amend their own ways.
                         Since the parents illustrate God to their offspring, how impor-
                         tant that they keep this holy pattern ever before them!

                         the lesson of helpfulness should be taught the child. As soon
                         as strength and reasoning power are sufficiently developed, he
                         should be given duties to perform in the home. He should be
                          encouraged . . . to put others' happiness and convenience be-

                             Is the influence of mothers felt by the children?

  THINK IT THROUGH          Concern! We hear much about it today. Where should
                         concern begin? How many should be concerned and in-

          Ex. 15:26 healeth thee."
                          Read Ps. 107:17-21.
                            The Lord described Himself to Moses as "the Lord that
                        healeth thee."
                            "The Egyptian physicians were famous all over the ancient
                        Near East, but extant texts show that they did not consider
                        the power of healing to be their own, but their gods'. In their
                        medical handbooks, . . . diseases are divided into three classes:
                        (1) those that can be treated; (2) those that can be arrested;
                        (3) those that cannot be cured. Though medical science has
                        advanced tremendously since the days of Moses, the above
                        classification still stands. The surgeon can make an incision,
                        remove an organ, and sew up the wound, but he cannot heal
                        it. The physician can administer certain drugs, which he knows
                        to have certain effects on certain ailments, but there his skill
                        ends. The actual healing process is performed by a power over
                        which human science has no control. It is still true in the 20th
                        century as it was in the time of Moses that God alone imparts
                        healing. He is the Master Physician."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                        on Ex. 15:26.
                            The psalmist expressed confidence in the Lord's healing
                        power. "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul: and all that is within me,
                        bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not
                        all His benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth
                        all thy diseases." Ps. 103:1-3.
                            When Jesus came to earth, the work of mercy that He
                        undertook was to teach and heal. See Matt. 9:35; Acts 10:38.
                        The Healer of Moses' time and of David's was the Healer of
                        John's time and of Paul's.
                            "Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied
                        servant of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare
                        our sicknesses,' that He might minister to every need of hu-

                        perfection of character."—The Ministry of Healing, page 17.
                           How did the Lord describe Himself to Moses?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Why cannot the sick be restored apart from the divine
                        healing? With all the scientific knowledge of modern med-
                        icine, is it not possible for man to heal himself?


   "During His ministry, Jesus devoted      His compassion were rejoicing in health

                      "Jesus Christ is the same today that He was yesterday, and
                      He will be so forever." Heb. 13:8, Goodspeed. This means that
                      He still hears the prayers of the sick and discouraged ones. And
                      that He still heals!
                         "God is just as willing to restore the sick to health now as
                      when the Holy Spirit spoke these words through the psalmist.

                      In Him there is healing balm for every disease, restoring power
                      for every infirmity. His disciples in this time are •to pray for
                      the sick as verily as the disciples of old prayed. And recoveries
                      will follow; for 'the prayer of faith shall save the sick.' We
                      have the Holy Spirit's power, the calm assurance of faith, that
                      can claim God's promises. The Lord's promise, 'They shall lay
                      hands on the sick, and they shall recover' (Mark 16:18), is just
                      as trustworthy now as in the days of the apostles. It presents
                      the privilege of God's children, and our faith should lay bold
                      of all that it embraces."—The Ministry of Healing, page 226.
                          In Takoma Park, Maryland, a man dying of terminal cancer
                       requested three of our ministers to pray for his healing. One of
                       of the preachers read to him the promise of James 5:14, 15. He
                       asked that he be anointed with oil in harmony with the divine
                       instruction. All was quiet and still as God's work of restoration
                       began, but in three weeks he was well and back on the job at
                       the Pentagon, where he served as an auditor. He lived many
                       years afterward. He gave God the glory for the healing and
                       never doubted that he had been the object of a special act of
                       divine mercy.
                          What fact about God should give to us all assurance?
 THINK IT THROUGH         We have all known sick people who in faith sought
                       the Lord for healing but were not restored. Were these
                       people less righteous than the Takoma Park auditor? Is
                       God partial? Why are some people healed and others
                       permitted to die?

             TODAY     shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and
      James 5:14, 15   if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."
                          Read John 14:13-15; 15:7; James 5:16.
                           In the New Testament is a command and promise (James
                       5:14, 15) which must be followed carefully if we expect to see
                       the sick restored to health. Bizarre methods employed by fake
                       "healers" will allow for Satan to work fake cures, but there is
                       no healing life for the sick—no permanent restoration.
                           "Christ's servants are the channel of His working, and
                       through them He desires to exercise His healing power. It is
                       our work to present the sick and suffering to God in the arms
                       of our faith. We should teach them to believe in the Great

                           Sins Confessed and Surrendered. There are conditions given
                       for answered prayer as the psalmist indicated: "If I regard
                       iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me." Ps. 66:18.
                           "To those who desire prayer for their restoration to health,
                       it should be made plain that the violation of God's law, either
                       natural or spiritual, is sin, and that in order for them to receive
                       His blessing, sin must be confessed and forsaken....
                           "When wrongs have been righted, we may present the needs
                       of the sick to the Lord in calm faith, as His Spirit may indi-

                           An Attitude of Faith. An attitude of faith and trust must
                       be assumed in prayer. Note the following by Ellen White: "A
                       case was held up before me of a . . . minister; eighty miles he
                       was sent for, to pray for a sick sister who sent for him in com-
                       pliance with the teaching of James. He went and prayed in
                       earnest, and she prayed; she believed the minister to be a man
                       of God, a man of faith. Physicians had given her up to die of
                       consumption. She was healed immediately. She arose and pre-
                       pared supper, a thing she had not done for ten years. Now the
                       minister was vile, his life was corrupt, and yet here was a great
                       work. He took the glory all to himself.
                          "Then again the scene mentioned above passed before me.
                       I saw that the woman was a true disciple of Christ; her faith
                       was that she should be healed."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                          "In prayer for the sick it should be remembered that 'we
                       know not what we should pray for as we ought.' Rom. 8:26.
                       We do not know whether the blessing we desire will be best
                       or not."—The Ministry of Healing, page 229.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Should we defer prayer for the sick because we may
                       not have confidence in the participants? Does God honor
                       His word? To whom shall we go if not to the Great
                       Healer? Is James 5:14, 15 valid today?

                       remedial agencies. Hezekiah, king of Israel, was sick, and a
                       prophet of God brought him the message that he should die.
                       He cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard His servant, and
                       sent him a message that fifteen years should be added to his
                       life. Now, one word from God would have healed Hezekiah
                       instantly ; but special directions were given, 'Let them take a
                       lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall
                       recover.' ...
                           "On one occasion Christ anointed the eyes of a blind man
                       with clay and bade him, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. . . .
                       He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.'
                       . . . The cure could be wrought only by the power of the Great
                       Healer, yet Christ made use of the simple agencies of nature."
                        —The Ministry of Healing, pages 232, 233.
                          What was Hezekiah bidden to do while suffering from
                       an eruption?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Of what value are figs in combating infection? Sup-
                       pose Hezekiah had questioned the procedure. Was there
                       real healing power in the fig poultice? In any case, who
                       did the healing?




   "It is not a denial of faith to use      energy, thanking God that we have the
such remedies as God has provided to        privilege of cooperating with Him, and
alleviate pain and to aid nature in her     asking His blessing on the means which

                                                                        December 24
             Part 5        "But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey My
      OBEDIENCE TO      voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be My people:
      NATURAL LAW       and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you,
           Jer. 7:23    that it may be well unto you."

                            What is one of the characteristics of God's faithful ones in
                        every age? Obedience to the Lord's commands.
                            Note the potential of health and growth found in every per-
                        son who obeys God and uses his mental and physical powers
                        wisely:
                            "Every man has the opportunity, to a great extent, of mak-
                        ing himself whatever he chooses to be. The blessings of this
                        life, and also of the immortal state, are within his reach. He
                        may build up a character of solid worth, gaining new strength
                        at every step. He may advance daily in knowledge and wisdom,
                        conscious of new delights as he progresses, adding virtue to vir-
                        tue, grace to grace. His faculties will improve by use; the more
                        wisdom he gains, the greater will be his capacity for acquiring.
                        His intelligence, knowledge, and virtue will thus develop into
                        greater strength and more perfect symmetry."—Counsels on
                        Health, pages 107, 108.
                           "To keep the body in a healthy condition, in order that all
                        parts of the living machinery may act harmoniously, should be
                        a study of our life. The children of God cannot glorify Him
                        with sickly bodies or dwarfed minds. Those who indulge in
                        any species of intemperance, either in eating or drinking, waste
                        their physical energies and weaken moral power."—Counsels

                           "Since the laws of nature are the laws of God, it is plainly
                        our duty to give these laws careful study. We should study
                        their requirements in regard to our own bodies and conform
                        to them. Ignorance in these things is sin."—Testimonies, Vol.
                        6, p. 369.
                           What promise is made to those who obey the Lord?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Is not ignorance of natural law a sin? Sickness results
                        because someone—we, our parents, or our ancestors—
                        violated natural law. Is it not then our duty to help our-
                        selves as much as possible by obeying the laws of health?
                        May not every case of sickness be a subject of prayer?
                        If not, why not?




   "Disease never comes without a           less their duty to ascertain what are
cause. The way is prepared, and dis-        and what are not violations of the laws
ease invited, by disregard of the laws      of health. They should avoid the wrong
of health. Many suffer in consequence       habits of their parents and, by correct

While they are not responsible for what     ditions."—"The Ministry of Healing,"

                                                                       December 25
            Part 6    "For there shall arise false christs, and false prophets,
     FALSE HEALERS and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that,
           TODAY if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."
       Matt. 24:24
                         Read 2 Thess. 2:8-12.
                          One sign of the times that is to precede the second advent
                      is the appearance of false healers and false christs. We have
                      this prophetic word that these healers will display "wonderful
                      signs" (Weymouth), "miracles and portents" (Rieu).
                          "Men under the influence of evil spirits will work miracles.
                      They will make people sick by casting their spell upon them,
                      and will then remove the spell, leading others to say that those
                      who were sick have been miraculously healed. This Satan has
                      done again and again."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                      Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 939. See also The Great Controversy,
                      page 464.
                          Then there are the cranks and the charlatans of whom there
                      were many in Bible times as well as today. See Ps. 101:7;
                      120:2 ; 144:11; Prov. 6:12-14. Even in our own church we
                      have had in the past self-appointed physicians who boasted of
                       their knowledge and ability to treat disease.
                          The third angel's message is to be given to the world by an
                       intelligent people who serve God from principle and who live
                       under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.
                       Motivated by the love of Christ, their zeal grows as their
                       knowledge increases and they labor to make more and more
                       disciples for the Lord.
                           "The evangelization of the world is the work that God has
                       given to those who go forth in His name. They are to be co-
                       laborers with Christ, revealing to those ready to perish His
                       tender, pitying love. God calls for thousands to work for Him,
                       not by preaching to those who know the truth, going over and
                       over the same ground, but by warning those who have never
                       heard the last message of mercy. Work, with a heart filled with
                       an earnest longing for souls. Do medical missionary work. Thus
                       you will gain access to the hearts of the people. The way will
                        be prepared for more decided proclamation of the truth. You
                        will find that relieving their physical suffering gives you oppor-
                        tunity to minister to their spiritual needs.
                           "The Lord will give you success in this work; for the gospel
                       is the power of God unto salvation when it is interwoven
                        with the practical life, when it is lived and practiced. The union
                        of Christlike work for the body and Christlike work for the
                        soul is the true interpretation of the gospel."—My Life Today,

            Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
    DECEMBER 19, 1970 • INTER-AMERICAN DIVISION
    The Inter-American Division, with its 255,385 members, be-
lieves in Christian education. Because the church membership has
increased by more than 100,000 in the last decade there are now
about 35,000 students enrolled in our schools throughout the divi-
sion. Thousands more are "outside" waiting to get in. For each
child or youth in our schools there are three others who need to be
preparing their lives for the service of the Lord.
    The Inter-American Division has plans for these "outsiders."
These plans will make room for many of these students to be in
our own schools. Inter-America has twenty-seven boarding schools.
 The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow is destined to help three
 training centers:
    1. The men's dormitory at Antillian College will be enlarged.
    2. A library will be built at Dominican Academy.
    3. A brand-new boarding academy will be constructed on the
       island of Martinique.
     Besides this, an evangelistic center is badly needed in Pointe-a-
 Pitre, Guadeloupe.
     These four projects will benefit by your generous offering at this
 Christmas season.
