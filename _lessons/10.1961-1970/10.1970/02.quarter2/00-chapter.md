         The Blessing of Daily Study
    "He who by faith receives the Word is receiving the
very life and character of God. Every seed brings forth
fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul by faith the
incorruptible seed of the Word, and it will bring forth a
character and a life after the similitude of the character
and the life of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.
    "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."
Ibid., p. 132.
    "God will make the most precious revelations to His
hungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is
a personal Saviour. As they feed upon His Word, they
find that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys the
natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 391.
  "The neglect of the Word means starvation to the soul."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                       My Pledge
     As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayer-
ful study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

                            "In the company about Jesus there were shepherds, and also
                         men who had money invested in flocks and herds, and all could
                         appreciate His illustration."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 187.
                            Note the immediate circumstances for this parable as outlined
                         in Luke 15:1, 2. The verb indicates they continually came to
                         Jesus. Jesus identified the owner of the flock as being also the
                         shepherd. He had a double interest—personal affection as well
                         as personal investment. His heart was with his treasure. Did he
                         hesitate because only 1 percent of his sheep was lost? It is as

                         one lost soul, Christ would have died for that one."—Ibid.,
                         p. 187.
                            Who are the ninety-nine that need no repentance? Is there
                         any such person since Adam's fall? Rom. 5:12. Whom does the
                         psalmist identify as the lost sheep? Ps. 119:176. And God's
                         saints in every age know the answer. Do you? Micah 7:18.
                         What is Christ's warning? Ezek. 34:2-6.
                            Upon whom is attention focused—the shepherd who sought,
                         or the sheep that strayed? What is meant by "the wilderness"
                         or "the mountains"? Why do sheep stray?
    THINK IT THROUGH      Christ willingly left all to seek His lost sheep. Do I appre-
                          ciate what He has done for me? Am I willing to follow

             Part 2    "Jesus said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
THE IDEAL SHEPHERD you, I am the door of the sheep. . . . I am the door: by

                          Read also Luke 15:5-7.

                          "Again Jesus found access to the minds of His hearers by the
                       pathway of their familiar associations.... No picture was more
                       familiar to His hearers than this, and Christ's words linked it
                       forever with Himself. Never could the disciples look on the
                       shepherds tending their flocks without recalling the Saviour's
                       lesson. They would see Christ in each faithful shepherd. They
                       would see themselves in each helpless and dependent flock."—
                       The Desire of Ages, page 476.
                           In the Scriptures Christ is termed the "Great Shepherd" (Heb.
                       13:20) and the "Chief Shepherd" (1 Peter 5:4). "The Great
                       Shepherd has undershepherds, to whom He delegates the care
                       of His sheep and lambs."—Gospel Workers, page 182. He calls
                       Himself the "Good Shepherd." John 10:11. "The Bible reveals
                       Christ to us as the Good Shepherd, seeking with unwearied
                       feet for the lost sheep."—Counsels to Teachers, page 261.
                       Everyone who accepts the care of the Good Shepherd is himself
                       to be an undershepherd. Christ told Peter to show his love by
                       feeding His sheep and lambs. John 21:15, 17. See also Evan-
                       gelism, page 346.
                           Who is the door of the fold? John 10:9; 14:6. Is it blood-
                       marked? Ex. 12:7. Does a door keep out (shelter) or let in
                        (protect)?
                           What is suggested of Christ through the characteristics of
                        effective shepherds? Tender and careful; watchful and solicitous
                        (Luke 15:4, 5) ; sacrificial and unselfish (John 10:14, 15) ;
                        known by His sheep and knows them (John 10:14) ; prepared
                        to help (Ps. 80:1) ; seeking the straying (Ps. 119:176).
                           What warnings to undershepherds are given in some char-
                        acteristics of evil shepherds? They feed themselves (Ezek. 34:
                        2-6) ; are idol (worthless) shepherds (Zech. 11:17, margin) ;
                        foolish shepherds (Zech. 11:15) ; hireling, fleeing ones (John
                       10:11-13).
  THINK IT THROUGH      With such a Shepherd and fold and provisions, why would
                        I as a sheep want to stray? Am I a shepherd or a sheep?
                        Do I always wish to get or to give of myself?

              Part 3      "Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she
     THE LOST DOWRY lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the
                       house, and seek diligently till she find it? And when she
                       hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbors
                       together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the
         Luke 15:8, 9 piece which I had lost."

                           In the parable of the lost sheep the creature was aware that
                        it was lost but was helpless to do anything. The lost coin was
                        not aware of its condition. This thought applies particularly to
                        children, lost to Christ in our very homes. The coin is stamped
                        with the image of the king. Compare Gen. 1:27. Does it cease
                        to be silver though it is lost? "The lost coin represents those
                        who are lost in trespasses and sins, but who have no sense of
                        their condition. They are estranged from God, but they know
                        it not. Their souls are in peril, but they are unconscious and
                        unconcerned."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 193, 194.
                           The shepherd searches the wilderness, the woman her home.
                        The woman in this story well illustrates a mother in the home
                        as well as the maternal church. What three things does the
                        woman do to meet her problem? She lights a candle to dispel
                        darkness (in her environment) ; she carefully sweeps her
                        house to remove all defilement (her negligence has allowed to

      Luke 15:11-13 ing."

                          This has been called the pearl and crown of all parables.
                       Who is represented by the "father"? the "sons"? Are they Jews
                       and Gentiles, Pharisees and publicans, classes of Christians in
                       the same church? Where do you think you fit in? The first
                       boy was young, inexperienced, and brash. Unlike the sheep and
                       the coin, he knew what he wanted and how to get it!
                          What attitude toward his father did the boy show by his
                       request? Luke 15:12. Would it have profited the father or the
                       boy if the father had insisted that he remain at home? Com-
                       pare Rom. 1:24, 26, 28. How much of the father's property
                       would the younger of two sons inherit? The elder brother al-
                       ways received a "double portion," and the other sons shared
                       the rest equally. So he would get one third.
                          "Not many days after" (Luke 15:13) suggests a slight delay.
                       Do you agree with Bernard of Clairvaux that apostasy of the
                       heart runs ahead of apostasy of the life and deed?
                          List some of the resources which our heavenly Father has
                       to divide to us. Into what did the boy change his resources?
                       Cash! To where did he journey? Do you think Augustine was
                       right in suggesting this "far land" is forgetfulness of God? Who
                       were his new "friends" and what "substance" did he squander?
                       Contrast all he "gathered" in his father's house with what he
                       "scattered" (literal Greek) in the foreign land. The son sought
                       freedom from restraint. Did he get it?
 THINK IT THROUGH Do I value my share of my Father's home? Am I demand-
                   ing my rights without earning them? Am 1 longing for
                   freedom from restraint, or freedom to serve?

          LIFE OF A famine in that land; and he began to be in want. And
          PRODIGAL he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
                      and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he
                      would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
       Luke 15:14-16 swine did eat: and no man gave unto him."

                           Read Luke 15:17-24.

                           What things in his new life were "foreign" to those of his
                        father's home? Is it true that all who seek freedom from the
                        Father find captivity with Satan? Rom. 6:16. What is suggested
                        by the "mighty famine"? Read Amos 8:11-13 and Jer. 2:13. Do
                        these texts bear upon life apart from God?
                           He found himself in "want." This means complete empti-
                        ness. In what ways may the life of a sinner be empty in spite
                        of his endless round of activities? What did the boy actually
                        do when he hired himself (literally "glued himself") to a citi-
                        zen of that land? Why is he not called a citizen himself? With
                        all his guilt and desire to rid himself of his father, why was the
                        boy not yet a citizen of the bad land? Something in his heart
                        evidently made him feel alien. What are "husks"? What sort
                        of companions did the prodigal now have? Consider Christ's
                        words in Matt. 7:6.
                           How do Paul's words apply to the prodigal? Rom. 7:24.
                        What is the answer to Paul's question? Rom. 7:25; 8:1.
                           What did Christ mean when He observed of the prodigal
                        that "he came to himself" before "he came to his father"? In
                        order to come to himself he must have gone out of himself.
                        What does this mean to you? John 6:44.
                           What part did the son play in his reinstatement in his fath-
                        er's home? Luke 15:18. The word for "hired servants" places
                        these in the lowest category in the household. Was he able to
                        announce all his own plans for his future to his father? Com-
                        pare his confession with that in Ex. 10:16 and Ps. 51:4. Did
                        his father have better plans? What do you understand by the
                        "robe" (Rev. 19:8; Zech. 3:4), and the "ring" (Eph. 1:13, 14;

                        6:15.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How do I see my Father's character in this story? How does

            Part 6         "Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came
        HOW GOOD      and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
          WAS HE?     . . . Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the
                      fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
                      And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came
      Luke 15:25-28   his father out, and intreated him."

                        Read also Luke 15:29-32.
                         The prodigal son had been dead in sin (Eph. 2:1-5) and
                      was not alive to God and righteousness. To all outward ap-
                      pearances this elder son was a "good son." He did not share the
                      obvious faults of his brother—filial ingratitude, greed, uncon-
                      cern for others—but this incident shows up what was in his
                      heart—pride and malignity.
                         He was working "in the field." What does this suggest to
                      you? Does this quiet questioning of one of the servants indicate
                      a suspicious character? Why should his father not have a feast
                      when he wished? The servant read the father's heart and ex-
                      pressed it in the words "safe and sound." But the elder brother
                      showed no concern for his brother's condition and experienced
                      no joy at his return. He was coldly "angry" (Matt. 5:22) and
                      heartless. How did the father treat him? In response, the elder
                      son spoke of "this thy son"—not "my brother"! There was
                      nothing in Christ's story about "harlots" (though it was true)
                      but the "senior saint" called attention to this fact!
                          Was the elder brother falling into the sin of the younger man
                      in demanding "his portion" of his father's goods? He did not
                      identify with his father's joys. In what sense was he also
                      "dead"? Why did not the father strongly rebuke the elder son?
                      Like others of the Master Teacher's stories, the end of this one
                      is not given. It is still being enacted. It rests with each one to
                      see what the outcome is. This other son's part in this parable
                       points out to us the danger of self-righteousness and of harbor-
                       ing a cold, critical spirit. What is the only way to counteract
                       this? Isa. 58:6, 7. What is included in "all that I have is thine"?
  THINK IT THROUGH Am I a "sour saint" wanting to put his father straight?
                   The older brother was right; yet how wrong he was in
                   proving his righteousness. He never left home, but he was
                   lost! Did Christ focus attention on the father or on his
                   sons? What is the significance for me in this? Am I to all
                   outward appearances a law-abiding Christian, while in-
                   wardly I harbor a cold, critical self-righteousness that is
                   an offense to God? Am I guilty of playing the part of the
                   "older brother"? Do I go off in a huff? Why did Christ
                   end with, "He would not go in"?

     TREASURE TROVE field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
                      for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and
         Matt. 13:44 buyeth that field."

                           In this parable, spoken to those in "the house" (Matt.
                        13:36), Jesus referred to the ancient custom of hiding treasure
                        for safety. Treasure is the center of this story. Whenever dan-
                        ger threatened by invasion, by hordes of robbers, or by the gov-
                        ernment tax gatherers demanding illegal amounts in tribute
                        money, those who had possessions hid them till times were
                        better. Burying them in the earth was a common practice. On
                        occasion the treasure was abandoned either because the owner
                        had been killed or because he had forgotten where he hid it.
                        It was not uncommon for a man plowing in a field to unearth
                        jewelry or coins.
                           In Christ's parable of the treasure, who do you think hid
                        it? What was an occupation of some in olden times? Job 3:21;
                        Prov. 2:4. It was while he was about his daily tasks that the
                        farmer came upon the treasure. This was a result of his per-
                        sonal effort. Was he actually looking for it? Contrast this atti-
                        tude with the man who deliberately set out to find good pearls.
                        How do these two men illustrate characters on their way to
                        heaven?
                           "A man might pass over the place where treasure had been
                        concealed. In dire necessity he might sit down to rest at the
                        foot of a tree, not knowing of the riches hidden at its roots. So
                        it was with the Jews. As a golden treasure, truth had been en-
                        trusted to the Hebrew people. The Jewish economy, bearing
                        the signature of Heaven, had been instituted by Christ Himself.
                        In types and symbols the great truths of redemption were
                        veiled. Yet when Christ came, the Jews did not recognize Him
                        to whom these symbols pointed. . . . The spiritual import of
                        the sacred writings was lost. The treasure house of all knowl-
                        edge was open to them, but they knew it not."—Christ's Object
                        Lessons, pages 104, 105.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I really searching for true treasure? Or am I content
                  with what is actually tinsel? How diligently am I plowing
                  the Scripture fields?

     AND BOUGHT
       Matt. 13:45

                          In the previous parable the kingdom of heaven is like trea-
                       sure. Here it is like a merchant seeking. What is the difference?
                       With deliberate intent Christ has set side by side the finders
                       and the seekers. This parable has a double meaning. It repre-
                       sents those who seek the kingdom of heaven, but it also ap-
                       plies to Christ who seeks for His lost inheritance. Why did
                       Christ call the man a "merchantman"? He "represents a class
                       who were sincerely desiring truth."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                       page 116.
                          The term "merchantman" means one who travels around
                       and buys. His search shows resolution, planning, and appropri-
                       ate direction. "Christ, the heavenly merchantman seeking
                       goodly pearls, saw in lost humanity the pearl of price. In man,
                       defiled and ruined by sin, He saw the possibilities of redemp-
                       tion. Hearts that have been the battleground of the conflict with
                       Satan, and that have been rescued by the power of love, are
                       more precious to the Redeemer than are those who have never
                       fallen. God looked upon humanity, not as vile and worthless;
                       He looked upon it in Christ, saw it as it might become through
                       redeeming love. He collected all the riches of the universe, and
                       laid them down in order to buy the pearl. And Jesus, having
                       found it, resets it in His own diadem. Tor they shall be as the

                          How will Christ regard those who give up all to obtain the

                       10:41, 42.

     BARGAIN HUNTER       "Who, when he had found one pearl of great price,
          Matt. 13:46 went and sold all that he had, and bought it."

                          Read Col. 2:3.

                          As he went from market to market, the merchantman kept
                       his eyes open for an exceptional pearl. At last he found just
                       what he had long been searching for—a lustrous, beautiful pearl
                       of great value. He longed to have it for himself, but he did not
                       immediately have the money it would take to purchase it. What
                       do you understand is involved in his "selling his all" to obtain
                       it? Compare Isa. 55:1; Matt. 25:9, 10; Rev. 3:18; Prov. 23:23.
                       How do we indicate our eagerness to possess the Pearl? Does
                       Christ's parable apply to us? Matt. 6:21. What is the measure
                       of the value of the salvation Christ offers us? I Peter 1:18, 19.
                          "All that can satisfy the needs and longings of the human
                       soul, for this world and for the world to come, is found in
                       Christ. Our Redeemer is the pearl so precious that in compari-

                          Of what are the gates of the New Jerusalem made? Rev.
                       21:21. What is suggested by the history of a pearl? The pearl
                       is the product of an injury or irritation to the living oyster.
                       By the defense mechanism of the mollusk the irritant becomes
                       the nucleus of a pearl as it is encrusted by layer upon layer of
                       nacre. Thus the injury is turned into a precious jewel. It was
                       only through injury inflicted on the Pearl of great price, our
                       Lord Himself, that we can obtain an entrance to the heavenly
                       city.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I appreciate the Pearl of great price enough and value
                       the suffering He endured to provide for my entrance into
                       the city of life? How much am I prepared to exchange for
                       this eternal reward?

                            Through all ages and in every land thinking men have been
                         seeking for the Pearl of great price without realizing exactly
                         what they wanted. Centuries ago Augustine put this longing
                         into beautiful language: "0 Lord, Thou hast made us for Thy-
                         self, and our heart is restless till it find rest in Thee." At the
                         beginning of our Saviour's life on earth "wise men" came from
                         the "east" seeking Him. Matt. 2:1. Just before the end of His
                         earthly sojourn Greeks came from the "west." What was their
                         request? John 12:21. What kind of men are represented by
                         these two groups? Do you think that these two incidents are
                         a representation of man's response to the plan of salvation?
                         What did Jesus mean by His response? John 12:23.
                            "When Christ heard the eager request, 'We would see Jesus,'
                         echoing the hungering cry of the world, His countenance
                         lighted up, and He said, 'The hour is come, that the Son of
                         man should be glorified.' In the request of the Greeks He saw

      John 12:24, 25 keep it unto life eternal."

                            This parable given at the time of the Greeks' inquiry, has a
                        double meaning. It refers to Christ's dying to obtain our re-
                        demption. It also refers to His disciples, who must die to self
                         before they can live for Christ. Does what Jesus meant in Matt.
                        16:24 apply to you? Who is represented by the "corn of
                        wheat"? When does it fall? What causes its death? The botanist
                        observes that a potato rots in the soil before the new crop is
                        produced. What does this mean in your life? Rom. 7:9, 10. Is
                        there significance to the "ground" where it is buried?
                           "The life must be cast into the furrow of the world's need.
                        Self-love, self-interest, must perish. But the law of self-sacrifice
                        is the law of self-preservation. The seed buried in the ground
                        produces fruit, and in turn this is planted. Thus the harvest is
                        multiplied. The husbandman preserves his grain by casting it
                        away. So in human life, to give is to live. The life that will be
                        preserved is the life that is freely given in service to God and
                        man. Those who for Christ's sake sacrifice their life in this

                           What do you understand by "the furrow of the world's
                        need"? What does Christ mean by saying we should hate our
                        lives? How may we keep our lives unto eternal life? What is
                        the death to which Christ refers? Read Paul's point of view
                        in Phil. 1:21; Gal. 2:20, 21.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I willing to be cast like the seed into the soil to die
                  to self before I can live for Christ? Was it easy for our

                      part by searching for the food that is all around them. In the

                Part 1     "And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted
       EARNING MERIT Him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal
     POINTS WITH GOD life? He said unto him, What is written in the law? how
                        readest thou? And he answering said, Thou shalt love
                        the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
                        soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind;
         Luke 10:25-27 and thy neighbor as thyself."

                             Was the lawyer genuinely worried about what he should
                         "do"? What is meant by "tempting Him"? Compare Matt.
                         22:35. Tempting means testing and may not have bad conno-
                         tations. James 1:13; Gen. 22:1. Most of us would rather "do"
                         than "be." But can we sinful persons become right before God
                         by what we do? Rom. 3:12, 20. The lawyer wondered whether
                         he could "inherit."
                             How only does one become an heir? John 3:3, 5. Inheritance
                         is thus the natural result of being. How may we become "heirs"
                         of God? Gal. 3:29. Does it ever follow that eternal life comes
                         naturally on the heels of "doing"? Rom. 6:23.
                             Jesus in His reply to the lawyer asked two questions—
                         "What is written in the law?" and "How readest thou?" What
                         did He mean? How may we read what we want into the Bible?
                         Would you apply Christ's questions to our situation today?
                         What passages did the lawyer readily quote? Deut. 6:5; Lev.
                         19:18.
                            "The words of Deut. 6:5 were recited by every devout Jew
                         morning and evening as a part of the shema' . . . , and were
                         worn also in the phylacteries. . . . Jews who had an insight
                         into the inner meaning of 'the law' . . . should have realized
                         that its principles were not arbitrary but based on fundamen-
                         tal principles of right which might properly be summed up in
                         the command 'to love.'"—SDA Bible Commentary, on Luke
                         10:27.

       WHY WORRY          "And he said unto him, Thou host answered right: this
       ABOUT HIM? do, and tho-u shalt live. But he, willing to justify himself,
      Luke 10:28, 29 said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?"

                          The lawyer's reply to Christ's question about what was
                       written in the law was right. Love is the answer—love to God
                       and toward our fellowmen. Figure out how this applies to each
                       command of God. Christ commended him for his good response,
                       and said, "This do, and thou shalt live." What are "works"
                       in God's sight? John 6:29. Our doing consists in loving. Has
                       loving to do with "being" or "doing"? But the lawyer felt
                       threatened by Christ's question. The Teacher before him was
                       aware of the secrets in his life.
                          "The lawyer knew that he had kept neither the first four
                       nor the last six commandments. He was convicted under Christ's
                       searching words, but instead of confessing his sin he tried to
                       excuse it. Rather than acknowledge the truth, he endeavored to
                       show how difficult of fulfillment the commandment is. Thus he
                       hoped both to parry conviction and to vindicate himself in the
                       eyes of the people. The Saviour's words had shown that his
                       question was needless, since he was able to answer it himself.
                       Yet he put another question, saying, 'Who is my neighbor?'"
                       —Christ's Object Lessons, pages 378, 379.
                          He wanted to draw Christ into a controversy by this ques-
                       tion, for it was heatedly disputed among the Jews. This would
                       distract attention from his personal religion by irrelevant dia-
                       logue. He wanted an argument to confirm his own ideas, which
                       limited the circle of those about whom he felt he should worry.
                       But to whom is every true Christian in debt? Rom. 13:8.
 THINK IT THROUGH Do I ever try to evade vital issues by sidetracking the
                  discussion into theoretical arguments? Am I really honest
                  with myself and others in all my speaking and doing and
                  believing? What does self-justification reveal in my char-

              Part 3     "And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down
       SHOULD I GET from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which
         INVOLVED? stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and de-
                      parted, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came
                      down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him,
                      he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite,
                      when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and
       Luke 10:30-32 passed by on the other side."

                           Jesus was relating what had recently occurred. The details
                        were fresh in the memories of his hearers. Compare what the
                        bandits did with Satan's work against mankind in Eden—
                        "stripped" them (Gen. 3:7)—left them "half dead" (Gen. 2:17).
                        Who is the arch robber? John 8:44.
                           " 'Down' is the correct word to describe the descent from
                        Jerusalem, more than 2,500 ft. above sea level, to Jericho,
                        about 700 ft. below sea level. The main road from Jerusalem
                        to Jericho follows the Wddi Qelt down through a portion of
                        the dry, barren, uninhabited hills of the wilderness of Judah.

                        rows into a rocky defile that from time immemorial has been
                        the haunt of robbers. The entire region, with its many caves and
                        rocks, provides a perfect hideout for outlaws."—SDA Bible
                        Commentary, on Luke 10:30.
                           What instruction had God given His people concerning the
                        treatment of strangers? Lev. 19:34. What lies behind the words
                        "by chance" or "by coincidence"? The priest at a glance took in
                        what had happened and passed by on the other side. The
                        Levite at least went and looked at the victim! But he, too,
                        passed by on the other side. From their reactions, what do you
                        discover about the characters of the two religious officials? Did
                        they obey God's law? Deut. 22:4; Ex. 23:5. A man is more
                        important than a beast. Compare Isa. 58:7.
                           What principles do you find in the story which are applicable
                        to our conditions today?
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I afraid to share another's problems, or am I ready
                  to try to help all I can wherever the opportunity is brought

Is It Nothing to Thee?     LESSON 3                                 ❑   Wednesday

            Part 4      "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where
      LOVE POWER he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on
                     him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring
                     in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and
                     brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the
                     morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
                     gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of
                     him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come
                     again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, think-
                     est thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the
                     thieves? And he said, He that showed mercy on him.
      Luke 10:33-37 Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."

                          Who were the Samaritans? Jesus called a Samaritan a
                       "stranger." Luke 17:18. For an understanding of the conditions
                       during which their hositility with the Jews first developed,
                       read Josephus, Antiquities 9:14:3; 11:8:6; and SD A Bible Dic-
                       tionary, art. "Samaritans."
                          The Samaritan in Christ's story went to where the unfor-
                       tunate man was lying. Should we ever wait for the needy to
                       come to us for help? There is no substitute for personal con-
                       tacts. The Samaritan acted immediately—"when he saw him."
                       Our help must be timely.
                          He "had compassion." Are our acts of mercy accompanied
                       by a feeling of genuine sympathy for those we help? Or are
                       we patronizing and activated by baser motives? His service
                       to the victim of brutality was personal. He might have argued
                       that he lacked equipment, but instead he did what he could.
                       He poured in wine to cleanse and oil (Isa. 1:6) to soothe. He
                       ministered to the man's needs with his own hands and from his
                        own supplies, using his own beast (cf. 2 Chron. 28:15) to trans-
                        port the victim to a place of safety and comfort.
  THINK IT THROUGH Does Jesus always have some deficiency in our service
                    to make up? Is one who needs love or one who shows
                    love a neighbor? Did the lawyer get the point of the
                    story? The lawyer inquired, "Who is my neighbor?" Jesus
                    replied, "To whom should I be neighborly?" List oppor-

             Part 5        "And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise

                           To what time "when he [his lord] cometh" does this parable
                        apply? What factors lead you personally to conclude that we
                        are living in the "time" Christ had in mind? What should all
                        "good stewards" be doing? Whom do they represent? What
                        did Jesus mean by giving "meat in due season"? Why? Who
                        laid this duty on the steward? What is the "meat"? What did
                        Jesus indicate constituted the most important "diet" for His
                        disciples? John 6:53-58, 63.
                           How should those who are waiting for the second advent
                        of Christ be spending their time? What happens to the servant
                        who is not faithful in his watching? Luke 12:45-48. Over what
                        is Jesus going to set the faithful as rulers? Matt. 19:28. What
                        is suggested by the words "his heart"? Prov. 4:23. In what ways
                        did the servant "beat" his fellows? Isa. 58:4. With what may
                        the unwary become drunk? Rev. 17:2. Upon what basis did
                        Jesus say the sentences in the judgment will be handed out?
 THINK IT THROUGH When did I last give a Bible study? What do I consider is
                  "present truth"? Do I ever think, without actually saying
                  it out loud, that my Lord is delaying His coming? Am I
                   tempted to become more and more absorbed in the things
                  of the world instead of studying to give others "meat in
                  due season"? How may I prepare for my Lord's coming?

  SOMETHING NEW, is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
   SOMETHING OLD man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of
      Matt. 13:52 his treasure things new and old."

                              Who is represented by the "scribe"? What does Jesus mean
                           by "the kingdom of heaven"? Have I accepted the instruction
                           God gives? What are the treasures "new and old"? Why are
                           they termed "treasures"? What makes some of them "new"
                           and others "old"? "The Word of God includes the Scriptures

                           Old Testament are as valuable as those of the New. Christ

                           as He is today."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 126.
                              Christ often presented old truths to His hearers, but He
                           shed on them a new light. He did this by placing them in the

              Part 1       "Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The
     SIZE DOES NOT kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed,
            MATTER which a man took, and sowed in his field: which indeed
                       is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the

     Matt. 13:31,32 birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."

                            As in other parables the "man" refers first to our Lord
                        Jesus Christ and secondarily to human beings. "Sowing" sug-
                        gests scattering seed to gain a harvest. Christ sows, man sows.
                        This act is used with a larger meaning than it has in the preci-
                        sion of gardening. The seed is cast forth far and wide. What
                        universal law governs the sowing of the seed and the reaping of
                        the harvest? Gal. 6:7. How would you apply this to your busi-
                        ness ventures, your social contacts, and your missionary activ-
                        ities?
                            Among the Jews the mustard seed was proverbial for small-
                        ness (Luke 17:6), as it is among the Arabs (Koran, sura 31).
                        Christ uses the mustard plant because of its tiny seed and ulti-
                        mately large size. Its small seed might lead the thoughtless to
                        consider it powerless. It is not the beginning but the ending
                        that counts. The mustard seed possesses mighty potential to
                        multiply its size many times, becoming the "greatest among
                        herbs." It works extensively and visibly and outwardly.
 THINK IT THROUGH In what way does the truth taught by the parable of the
                   mustard seed apply to each human heart and also to the
                   growth of the Christian church in the world? Am I tempted
                   to think that size of beginning is important? If the seed
                   can change into a tree, can "faith as a grain of mustard
                   seed" remove my difficulties and help my transformation?

                       Read also 1 Cor. 5:6, 7.
                           Leaven works silently and unobtrusively. Unlike the mus-
                        tard seed, it works intensively from within, and its processes
                        are not seen by anyone. Leaven thus represents hidden principles
                        that alter our nature, our thinking, and our entire life. In the
                        Scriptures leaven may stand for both good and evil influences.
                        Christ gave His disciples warnings against three insidious con-
                        tacts. They should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees. What
                        was this? Luke 12:1.
                            What bearing may the leaven of the Sadducees have on our
                        lives? Matt. 16:11, 12. What did the Sadducees deny? This
                        philosophy would lead to certain negative attitudes. Can you
                        list some results in your life that might spring from this leaven?
                        Acts 23:8. The leaven of Herod (Mark 8:15) reflected that pol-
                        itic Edomite's attitude to life. What were characteristics of
                        Esau-Edom? Can we develop this philosophy today?
                            "As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from
                        within outward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that
                        the grace of God works to transform the life. No mere external
                        change is sufficient to bring us into harmony with God. There
                        are many who try to reform by correcting this or that bad
                        habit, and they hope in this way to become Christians, but
                        they are beginning in the wrong place. Our first work is with
                        the heart."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 97.
                            For the leaven to work, it must be kneaded into the dough.
                        As with the woman and the lost silver coin, this woman's
                         ministry is the quiet work in the home, of putting into the

                         the kingdom of God.
 THINK IT THROUGH Which kind of leaven am I choosing to place in my life?
                  Do I trust the transforming power of the invisible grace
                  of God in my life? Am I worried about how my children
                  are going to develop without making certain that the
                  true leaven is kneaded in?




  "In the Saviour's parable, leaven is       subdued. New thoughts, new feelings,
used to represent the kingdom of             new motives, are implanted. A new
heaven. It illustrates the quickening,       standard of character is set up—the

             Part 3        "And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man
     WHAT COUNTS        should cast seed into the ground; and should sleep, and
       IS GROWTH        rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow
      Mark 4:26, 27     up, he knoweth not how."

                            In this parable (unique in Mark) Jesus stresses the truth
                        that the man who sows the seed may not know the processes
                        by which it develops. Who is the "man," ignorant of the power
                        of growth and indifferent to the development of the seed? Is
                        he the same as the Harvester at the end of the story—Jesus?
                        Is Christ trying to show that there are things that He does
                        not know or is not overly concerned with, trusting all to His
                        heavenly Father?
                            While the farmer goes about his other necessary daily activ-
                        ities, the seed he has sown fulfills its function. He can do little
                        about it; "the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself" ("herself"
                        in Mark 4:28 is from the Greek root for "automatic"). This is
                        a comforting thought both for our own growth and for our
                        confidence in the mental and spiritual development of those
                        for whom we work. God has designed that the soil shall change
                        the seed. The missionaries, the teachers, the parents, who im-
                        plant the seed of righteousness in the fertile soil of the minds
                        of those with whom they have to do can take both courage and
                        warning from this.
                            This parable also has a personal message for us as individ-
                        ual disciples. Christ's responsibility is at the beginning, to sow
                        seed; and at the end, to reap the harvest. In between the soil
                        causes change. We accept the seed of the Word into our own
                        souls. With our eyes fixed on the Ideal, we may sometimes
                        wonder whether we shall ever be able to grow like Him. This
                        parable of the silent seed assures us that the transforming Word
                        will carry out God's design in our lives so long as we ra it do
                        its natural work.
 THINK IT THROUGH       After I have accepted the right principles of the kingdom,
                        do I worry unnecessarily about every little detail of my
                        spiritual progress, or do I leave it, as the husbandman
                        leaves the implanted seed, to develop under the Spirit's
                        care? See 1 Peter 5:7.

            Part 4      "And great multitudes were gathered together unto
 THE LAVISH SOWER Him, so that He went into a ship, and sat; and the whole
                     multitude stood on the shore. And He spoke many things
                     unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth
      Matt. 13:2, 3 to sow."

                          The sower left his home to do his work. What did Jesus
                       leave to come to the world—"the field"—to cast abroad the
                       seeds of truth? Christ's expression does not indicate that the
                       sower put delicate plants one by one in a hothouse, but that
                       He cast abroad the seed so as to cover every spot. This truth
                       of generous sowing is emphasized in the Scriptures. See 2 Cor.
                       9:6; Prov. 11:24-26. To whom are the illuminating principles
                       of the Word to be given? John 1:9.
                          "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might
                       have mercy upon all." Rom. 11:32. The Husbandman scatters
                       the gospel seed across all the areas of the field, that is, the
                       world. The sower may also represent the evangelist. The "sower"
                       is representative of all who scatter the seed of truth so as to
                       leave no part of the field unworked.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I doing my work as a sower in the portion of the field
                   in which Christ has placed me? Does Paul have anything
                   to say to me in Gal. 6:7, 8?

                           How did Jesus explain the meaning of the types of soil?
                       Luke 8:12-15.
                          "The seed sown by the wayside represents the word of God
                       as it falls upon the heart of an inattentive hearer. Like the
                       hard-beaten path, trodden down by the feet of men and beasts,
                       is the heart that becomes a highway for the world's traffic, its
                       pleasures and sins."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 44.
                           What hardens the heart to resist the seed's penetration? Heb.
                       3:13. Are you allowing this to happen to you? What crushes
                       the seed as it is trodden down? Why did Christ remark that
                       this kind represents those who do not understand? Matt. 13:19.
                       Does this type of man sense his danger? How quickly does the
                       evil one remove the seed? Mark 4:15. What is represented by
                       "fowls"? Luke 8:12, "the devil"; Mark 4:15, "Satan"; Matt.
                       13:19, "the wicked one."
                          "Many who make a profession of religion are stony-ground
                       hearers. Like the rock underlying the layer of earth, the selfish-
                       ness of the natural heart underlies the soil of their good desires
                       and aspirations. The love of self is not subdued. They have not
                       seen the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the heart has not been
                       humbled under a sense of its guilt. This class may be easily
                       convinced, and appear to be bright converts, but they have only
                       a superficial religion."—Ibid., p. 46.
                           Thorns are the work of Satan. "He [God] never made a
                       thorn, a thistle, or a tare. These are Satan's work, the result
                       of degeneration, introduced by him among the precious things."

                       the place of good judgment; lust, the place of true love.
 THINK IT THROUGH What things does Christ specifically mention as choking
                   the seed? Is the soil of• my heart unprepared by wrong

        Luke 8:8, 15   tience."

                          Much of the seed that came from the sower's hand had been
                       wasted. But now the story turns to seed that fell on good
                       ground. How do the three verbs in Christ's explanation fit into

                       yields to the conviction of the Holy Spirit. He confesses his

                       catch it away."—Ibid., p. 59.
                          What results may we expect when the gospel seed falls into
                       this kind of heart-soil? "The Word of God, received into the
                       soul, will be manifest in good works. Its results will be seen in
                       a Christlike character."—Ibid., p. 60. What accompanies his

                       culty and trial; but when affliction comes, the true Christian
                       does not become restless, distrustful, or despondent. Though we

Give a Man a Chance!         LESSON 5                                      ❑ Sunday

             Part 1       "For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is
     EVERYONE GETS an householder, which went out early in the morning to
          A BREAK hire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed
                       with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into
       Matt. 20:1, 2 his vineyard."

                            This parable was preceded by the incident of the young
                         ruler who approached the Master Teacher asking what good
                         thing he should do to have eternal life. Then came Peter's ques-
                         tion, "What shall we have therefore?" Matt. 19:27-30. In an-
                         swer to this question Christ showed the part played 'by grace
                         in the Christian life. Who does the "householder" represent?
                         John 15:16; Mark 3:13. What is his "vineyard"? Who are in-
                         cluded in the "laborers"? What is the "marketplace"?
                            All are called by the Master to work. They do not ask for
                         work. What covenant did the owner of the vineyard make when
                         he hired the laborers early in the morning? What is suggested
                         by the "early morning" of life? When the householder called
                         others at the third hour, what promises of reward did he make
                         to them? Matt. 20:3, 4. As he still needed help later in the
                         day, what did he do? Matt. 20:5-7.
                            What is meant by the "penny"? It was a liberal day's wage
                         and the daily pay for a Roman soldier. Did those in each group
                         "earn" their wages? To whom was it a gift? Rom. 6:23.
                            Do you think that all our activity, separated from Christ's
                         purpose in our lives, is "standing idle in the marketplace"?
                         What is the significance of the phrase "no man hath hired us"?
                         Where were they on the previous expeditions of the house-
                         holder to find laborers? On what basis does Christ reward those
                         who work for Him? Titus 3:5. How generous is He in His
                         rewards? Eph. 3:20.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I always comparing the rewards which come to me
                  in life with those of others? Am I tempted to indulge in
                  self-pity? Do I murmur against the "injustices" of life and
                  reproach God?

                     when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
                     they received every man a penny. But when the first came,
                     they supposed that they should have received more; and
                     they likewise received every man a penny. And when
                     they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
                     of the house, saying, These last have wrought but one
                     hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which
                     have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he an-
                     swered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong:
                     didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that
                     thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even
                     as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with
                     mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? So the
                     last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called,
      Matt. 20:8-16 but few chosen."

                            Do the laborers first called into service represent the Jewish
                        nation? Had they any just cause for complaint when the Gen-
                        tiles were called into the fold? They had been given what they
                        had agreed to work for. The cause of their grievance lay in
                        themselves—in their jealousy of those who worked but one
                        hour and received a full day's wages.
                           Did they exhibit the spirit of a hireling? "The Lord desires
                        us to rest in Him without a question as to our measure of re-
                        ward. When Christ abides in the soul, the thought of reward
                        is not uppermost. This is not the motive that actuates our
                        service."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 398.
                           Upon what does God measure our service? Do the mur-
                        murers remind us of the prodigal's brother? Did they murmur
                        at how much the eleventh-hour servants received or because
                        they themselves did not get more?
 THINK IT THROUGH What is my motive in serving the Lord? Do I work because
                   of my love for Him and my desire to see His work fin-

                           This is one of the most complex of Christ's parables. It has
                        at least two meanings. Its obvious import lies on the surface.
                        Settle difficulties out of court! Our Lord emphasizes that there
                        is an opportune time for this which should be seized.
                           Christ's parables reveal spiritual truths, and this parable
                        certainly does. Life is a "walk to the Judge with an adversary
                        by our side." What a picture! Does Satan accompany us to the
                        judgment? See Zech. 3:1-4; Rev. 12:10-12; 1 Peter 5:8.

                        English Bible render "agree" by the words "come to terms."
                        How did Jesus "come to terms" with His adversary in the

         BE BETTER      about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower,
                        and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far
         Matt. 21:33    country."

                          Read also Luke 20:9-19.

                           The Jews were familiar with Isaiah's touching parable of the
                        vineyard and the Lord's care for it. Isa. 5:1-7. The householder
                        planted the vineyard. Ex. 15:17; Ps. 44:2. The "hedge" set
                        around it represents the law that keeps evil out and righteous-
                        ness safe within. The "tower" portrays the sanctuary or tem-
                        ple—a place where the lookout watched and also a place for

                        tion to Prophets and Kings.
                           The vineyard was rented out to "husbandmen." Did it ever
                        belong to them?
                           What more could be done? the Lord asks. Isa. 5:4. Can you
                        think of anything? What a chance man has! God has done
                        everything possible for His servants that they may fulfill His
                        plans for them. See Ps. 84:11. God's leaving His vineyard to
                        His husbandmen demonstrates His patience.
 THINK IT THROUGH Do I ever tally up all that God has done for the best
                 development of my character? Can I suggest to my heav-
                 enly Father any good thing He has withheld from me?

               Part 5       "And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent
     GREEDY TENANTS his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive
                       the fruits of it. And the husbandmen took his servants,
                       and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
                       Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and
                        they did unto them likewise. But last of all he sent unto
                        them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. But
                        when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
                        themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and
                        let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and
       Matt. 21:34-39 cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him."
                           What is meant by the "time of the fruit"? "Fruit" represents
                         both character development and souls saved for the kingdom.
                         The fruit of the Spirit must be seen in the life. Gal. 5:22, 23.
                            Who were the "servants" sent by the owner of the
                         vineyard? See Heb. 1:1, 2; Jer. 44:4. They would include
                         prophets, judges, kings, and leaders in Old Testament times.
                         Who are they today? How were these messengers from God
                         treated? What details do Luke and Mark add to Matthew's
                         account? See Mark 12:1-9; Luke 20:9-16. Note Mark's terms
                         "wounded in the head," and "shamefully handled." Can you
                         think of Old Testament examples of this? See Jer. 20:1, 2; 37:
                         15; 1 Kings 18:13. And in the New Testament? See Acts 7:52;
                         1 Thess. 2:15. Compare Heb. 11:37, 38.
                            How do you regard those who would help you to present
                         good fruit for your Master? Has this response been found true
                         in each era of God's church?
                            Finally, whom did God send? See Mark 12:6; John 5:18.
                         Did the husbandmen recognize the position of this Messenger?
                         Compare Heb. 1:2. Does the parable accurately portray what
                         happened to the Son when He was sent to the vineyard? Com-
                         pare John 11:47-53. What is the significance of the fact that
                         Jesus was slain, "cast out of the vineyard"? Heb. 13:12, 13.
                         How was the husbandmen's plot carried out? What is signified
                         by their throwing Him outside of the vineyard?
 THINK IT THROUGH We are horrified in this story at the manner in which the
                  servants and the son were treated by the husbandmen.
                  But am I by my attitude and actions giving the same
                  treatment to His messengers and to Him?

             Part 6      "When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what
     WHAT WILL BE will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him,
     THE PAYOFF? He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will
                     let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall
                     render him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus saith unto
                     them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone
                     which the builders rejected, the same is become the head
                     of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous
                     in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of
                     God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation
     Matt. 21:40-43 bringing forth the fruits thereof."

                          What application can be made of the expression "when the
                      Lord . . . cometh," individually, nationally to the Jews, and
                      at the end of the world? The priests had been listening so in-
                      tently to the story that they did not immediately grasp its full
                      application. In reply to Christ's question, what sentence did they
                      pass on the wicked husbandmen? "Unwittingly they had pro-
                      nounced their own doom."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 295.
                      The kingdom was indeed taken from the Jews and given to
                      those who should bring forth its fruit—the Christians. The
                      prophecy of the Jewish leaders came to pass exactly! See Gal.
                      3:9, 29 for the role of the church.
                          In The Desire of Ages, pages 597, 598, we are told the story
                      of the rejected stone: "When the temple of Solomon was
                      erected, the immense stones for the walls and the foundation
                      were entirely prepared at the quarry; after they were brought
                      to the place of building, not an instrument was to be used
                      upon them; the workmen had only to place them in position.
                      For use in the foundation, one stone of unusual size and pecu-
                      liar shape had been brought; but the workmen could find no
                      place for it, and would not accept it. It was an annc yance to
                      them as it lay unused in their way. Long it remained a rejected
                      stone. But when the builders came to the laying of the corner,
                      they searched for a long time to find a stone of sufficient size
                      and strength, and of the proper shape, to take that particular
                      place, and bear the great weight which would rest upon it.
                      . . . The builders examined this stone. It had borne every test
                      but one. If it could bear the test of severe pressure, they de-
                      cided to accept it for the cornerstone. The trial was made. The
                      stone was accepted, brought to its assigned position, and found
                      to be an exact fit. In prophetic vision, Isaiah was shown that
                      this stone was a symbol of Christ."
 THINK IT THROUGH Have I ever brushed aside Christ's will for me because
                it was apposed to my desires, only to find later that He
                was the answer to my problems? What should I do to
                ensure that my spiritual eyesight is clear and discerning?

  FIELDS OF PARADISE kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed
         Matt. 13:24 good seed in his field."
                             Whom does the sower represent? Matt. 13:37. What is the
                          significance of this appellation? The seed that God sowed is the
                          only perfect seed. When Christ created the world, what was
                          His estimate of all He had made? Gen. 1:31. "Before the en-
                          trance of evil there was peace and joy throughout the universe.
                          All was perfect harmony with the Creator's will. Love for God

                             The field was ruined by an enemy's oversowing it with tares.
                          What is represented originally by the "field" and the "good
                          seed"? After sin entered the world, where did the Lord obtain
                          further good seed? Now "the good seed represents those who

                          the church of Christ in the world. The parable is a description
                          of that which pertains to the kingdom of God, His work of
                          salvation of men; and this work is accomplished through the

            Part 2   "But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed
  WHILE MEN SLEPT tares among the wheat, and went his way."
       Matt. 13:25

                           When did the enemy do his evil work in the field? Matt.
                       13:25, first part. He is called "The wicked one." Whose enemy
                       is he?
                           Today the devil takes advantage of every opportunity to
                       catch men off guard. Eve was off guard—spiritually asleep—
                       when she wandered from Adam's side and was tempted by the
                       devil in Eden. Her statement to God (Gen. 3:13) literally
                       means "The serpent caused me to forget."
                           In another illustration Jesus said, "Know this, that if the
                        goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief

                            Read the rest of the parable of the tares—Matt. 13:
                         26-30.

                            What custom helped Christ's hearers in the understanding
                         of this parable? "In the East, men sometimes took revenge
                         upon an enemy by strewing his newly sown fields with the
                         seeds of some noxious weed that, while growing, closely resem-
                         bled wheat. Springing up with the wheat, it injured the crop
                         and brought trouble and loss to the owner of the field."—
                         Christ's Object Lessons, page 71.
                            What were the first evidences that something was amiss? By
                         what may we recognize evil? Matt. 7:20. Who are represented
                         by the "tares"? "The tares represent a class who are the fruit
                         or embodiment of error, of false principles."—Ibid., p. 71.
                         Some Bible versions use the word "darnel" instead of "tares."
                         Darnel is a weed which until ripe resembles wheat. Can the
                         question of the origin of evil receive a more explicit answer
                         than Christ gave? Matt. 13:28, first part.
                            What course of action was recommended by the owner's
                         servants? Compare Luke 9:54. Why did the owner of the field
                         decide not to do as they suggested? Matt. 13:29. How does
                         his statement foreshadow what will occur at the end of time?
                         Matt. 13:30.
                            What is the difference between "the servants" and "the
                         reapers"? "I then saw the third angel. Said my accompanying
                         angel, 'Fearful is his work. Awful is his mission. He is the angel
                         that is to select the wheat from the tares, and seal, or bind,
                         the wheat for the heavenly garner. These things should engross
                         the whole mind, the whole attention.'"—Early Writings, page
                         118.
 THINK IT THROUGH Do I show impatience when the "tares" (in the church)
                are not cleaned out immediately, or do I patiently wait
                for the heavenly Owner to do the work of separation in
                His own time? Who will finally separate the good and
                bad?

                      empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh

                      of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be
     Matt. 12:43-45 also unto this wicked generation."

                           This parable is a warning to those who seem impressed with
                        the message of the gospel but who do not give themselves up
                        entirely to the control of the Holy Spirit. After their conversion
                        their lives and minds are empty -of heavenly principles. With
                        what was the mind decorated? An unoccupied house is in dan-
                        ger. It invites burglars. Vandals may break in and wreak havoc.
                        So with the one whose heart is empty of the influences of righ-
                        teousness.
                           "Christ shows that there can be no such thing as neutrality
                        in His service. The soul must not be satisfied with anything
                        short of entire consecration—consecration of thought, voice,
                        spirit, and every organ of mind and body. It is not enough that
                        the vessel be emptied: it must be filled with the grace of Christ."

                           With his defenses down, the last state of the man in this
                        parable was worse than the first. He then allowed every kind
                        of evil to control him. So today we see those who have at first
                        seemed favorable to the gospel turn back to become worse
                        than they were before they saw the light of the truth.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I allowing the Spirit of God to occupy my life, or is
                  my mind a dangerously empty house? With what should
                  I seek to fill my mind? Can a rich and full mind ever be
                  the result of cheap reading and entertainment and
                  empty talk?




   "There were many in Christ's day, as      surrender themselves to God daily, that
there are today, over whom the control       Christ might dwell in the heart; and

Satan's Stratagems-    LESSON 6                                           ❑ Friday

           Pa rt 6      "When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his
  TWO CHAMPIONS goods are in peace: but when a stronger than he shall
            WAR     come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him
                    all his armor wherein he trusted, and- divideth his spoils.
                    He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gather-
    Luke 11':21-23 eth not with Me scattereth."
                          Read also Luke 11:17-20.
                           This parable is about two champions, a strong man and•a
                        stronger man. In the spiritual picture presented in the Bible,
                        power to resist our foe results from:
                           1. Wearing the- whole armor of God. Eph. 6:11-18.
                           2. Obeying the Captain of our salvation.
                           3. Fighting to the end. 2 Tim. 4:7, 8; Rev. 2:10, last part.
                           This strong man appeared to have all these -qualities. He
                        was also "armed." From the very beginning there is in this-
                        "war" a king leader. Rev. 12:7. He has his own weapons. But
                        lack of accurate appraisal of the enemy, failure to rely on the•
                        General of God's army, always leads to defeat.
                           Leading a man to trust in himself is another of Satan's
                        devious methods. How does this take from us all our armor?
                        In what ways does Samson illustrate this perennial truth?

                        do the details of my daily life place me—with Christ or among
                        those who "scatter"? Satan traps us into laying down our

                         And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto

                         owed the king was staggering—"about $6,221,880 . . . , though
                         worth much more in purchasing power."—SDA Bible Commen-
                         tary, on Matt. 18:24. Christ emphasized that the man could
                         never repay such a debt. What ..do we owe our Master? Is it
                         ever possible for us to pay the debt we owe?
                            The king ordered the man and all he had to be "sold"' to
                         liquidate his debt. This was according to custom. What did the
                         debtor do before he begged forgiveness and pleaded for mercy?
                         What did •he show a willingness to acknowledge and to do?
                         How freely was he forgiven? What are the most important
                         requirements made of us in our indebtedness to Christ in order
                         to gain forgiveness? Who actually pays our debt? Isa. 1:18;

                          Finish reading-the parable.—verses 31-35..

                            This section of the parable covers a debt between one ser-
                        vant and - another. The ratio of the debts is about- half a million
                        to one! The forgiven servant was owed by his fellbw, one, hun-

                        than he himself had received at the hands of his-creditor. The

                        he himself had made to his king. Is it always right to press our
                        rights? Contrast the attitudes of the- two creditors—the king
                        and the servant. Why were the other fellow servants "very
                        sorry"? When they reported the matter, what was the feeling
                        aroused in the king? Does this have a lesson for us? Was.this
                         just?
                            What does Christ teach about- forgiveness? Luke 17:3. The

            SIMON?     which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat
                       in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of oint-
                       ment, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping, and
                       began to wash His feet with tears, and did wipe them with
                       the hairs of her head, and kissed His feet, and anointed
                       them with the ointment. Now when the Pharisee which
                       had bidden Him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying,
                       This Man, if He were a prophet, would have known who
                       and what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him:
        Luke 7:36-39   for she is a sinner."

                         Read also John 12:1-3.

                          The setting for this parable is the home of Simon the Phari-
                       see. There was no cordiality in his invitation to Christ. He
                       deliberately ignored the courtesy of giving his Guest water to
                       wash His feet! Do you get the impression that it was conde-
                       scension that led Simon to ask Jesus to his home? He was
                       certainly patronizing in his attitude to Mary, whom he regarded
                       as a sinful woman. How did he have such a clear knowledge of
                       her past? See The Desire of Ages, page 566.
                          Simon's Pharisaic pride was offended by Mary's show of
                       gratitude and affection. He still had some misgivings about the
                       identity of Jesus, for he said to himself, "If He were a prophet."
                       Luke 7:39. What other lessons besides the need for appreciation
                       and gratitude did our Lord wish to teach as He told the parable
                       of the two debtors?
 THINK IT THROUGH Is my eagerness to pronounce other people sinners caus-

What's Bothering You?      LESSON 7                                ❑    Wednesday

            Part 4      "And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have
       LOVE POWER somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say
                     on. There was a certain creditor which had two debtors:
                     the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
                     And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave
                     them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him
                     most? Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to
                     whom he forgave most. And He said unto him, Thou
       Luke 7:40-43 hast rightly judged."

                         By this story Christ sought to meet Simon's need for an un-
                      derstanding of forgiveness. What does His method reveal of
                      Christ's character? Ps. 18:35. Do we exhibit the same gentle
                      attitude in dealing with those in need? What was the ratio of
                      the two debts? Did the difference in the debts make any differ-
                      ence to the attitude of the creditor? Does God allow any dif-
                      ference in the "amount" of sins to affect His forgiving us? Is
                      He as ready to forgive the one who has sinned greatly as the
                      one who has sinned little? Ps. 103:3. What actually affects His
                      forgiveness?
                         "Jesus did not design to teach that different degrees of obli-
                      gation should be felt by the two persons, for each owed a debt
                      of gratitude that never could be repaid. But Simon felt himself
                      more righteous than Mary, and Jesus desired him to see how
                      great his guilt really was. He would show him that his sin was
                      greater than hers, as much greater as a debt of five hundred
                      pence exceeds a debt of fifty pence."—The Desire of Ages,
                      pages 566, 567.
                         Did Simon get the point of the parable? What was it that
                      won his heart? "Simon was touched by the kindness of Jesus
                      in not openly rebuking him before the guests. . . . Stern denun-
                      ciation would have hardened Simon against repentance, but
                      patient admonition convinced him of his error. He saw the mag-
                      nitude of the debt which he owed his Lord. His pride was
                      humbled, he repented, and the proud Pharisee became a lowly,

 THINK IT THROUGH How great do I consider my debt to the divine Creator?
                Do I ever try to brush it under the rug by calling atten-

                           This parable followed the question of the chief priests and'
                        the scribes concerning the authority by which Christ carried
                        out His works. It was not evidence of Christ's authority that
                        they needed—they knew what it was. But they desired a dec-
                        laration by Jesus Himself that He was the Messiah. With this
                        they hoped that they would be able to stir up the people and
                        procure His death. What was the significance of the question
                        Jesus asked them (Matt. 21:24, 25) concerning the baptism-of
                        John? Why did this question discomfit them so greatly? Be-

                           Jesus then told the parable we have just read. What was
                        "bugging" the first son when he rudely replied, "No, sir"? Why-
                        did he not wish to be about his father's business? What might

                        his own obligations. The second son said, "Yes, sir." Compare
                        Israel's reaction in Ex. 24:7. This boy talked a lot but did
                        nothing. Compare Isa. 29:13. What was "bugging" him? Who

                         immediately continued the discussion introduced at the end of
                         the story of the prodigal son. This was an account of events
                         which had• actually happened:
                            "With the prospect of discharge 'before him, the steward
                         saw - three paths- open to his choice. He must labor, beg, or
                         starve."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 367.
                            The steward's solution was to defraud his master to the
                         advantage of the master's debtors, so placing them under obli-
                        -gation to him-so that they in turn would be good to him. How
                          urgently did he act? His lord commended this "prudence."
                             Who are "the children of this world"? Who are "the children
                         of light"? The unfaithful steward was a picture of the Jews
                          themselves. To them had been entrusted the oracles of God, but
                        'they had used God's gifts, of which they were stewards, for

                           Did not the disciples know how to pray before this? They
                        must have been taught both in their homes and also in the
                        synagogues. What then made them ask Jesus to teach them
                        to pray? What was there about Christ's prayer life that made
                        them feel that their own praying was inadequate? They knew
                        the theory of praying, the form of words, and pious phrases;

                        something for Him that their prayers had never done for them.
                           "The Saviour's face was .irradiated with a celestial bright-

                           How did Jesus treat their request for instruction? Luke
                        11:2-4. He gave them a model prayer. It was not new to them,
                        for He had already given -it to them in the Sermon on the
                        Mount. "That which He has before taught them He repeats,

                              Jesus told this parable to illustrate the-lesson He desired His
                          disciples to learn concerning the motivation behind their
                          prayers. Jesus prayed for strength ,to help others in their -needs.
                          John 17:9, 20-23. What-should be our motive in praying? Eph.
                          6:18-20. It is significant that the importunate man in the par-
                          able asked his friend for bread with which to feed others. Who
                          is his unexpected guest?
                             .Bread in the Scriptures is a symbol of spiritual food. What
                          made the man so desperately diligent? Christ's word for "im-
                          portunity" means "shamelessness." Have we a supply of the
                          bread of life on hand to give to those who ask us? 1 Peter
                          3:15.
                              We must•. note that the selfish, lazy neighbor in the parable
                          does not represent the character of our heavenly Father: "The

                          of compassion, and He longs to grant the requests of those who
                          come unto Him in faith. He gives to us that we may minister

     WIDOW IN NEED men ought always to pray, and not to faint; saying, There
                      was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
                      regarded man: and there was a widow in that city; and
                      she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adver-
                      sary. And he would not for a while: but afterward he
                      said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard
                      man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge
         Luke 18:1-5 her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."

                          The emphasis of this parable went beyond praying. It under-
                       lined the thought "and not to faint." The judge had treated
                       the widow both unjustly and contemptuously. He delighted
                       in showing his authority. Although she had a just cause, he
                       drove her many times from the judgment seat. Finally her per-
                       sistence compelled him to give her a hearing.
                           Apparently some enemy was trying to wrest her money from
                       her, for her prayer was, "Avenge me of mine adversary." Who
                       is the enemy of God's people? 1 Peter 5:8. It is for deliverance
                       from the power of Satan and his agents that in this parable
                       Christ teaches His disciples to pray. A prophetic picture of the
                       victory which will result is given us by the prophet Zechariah.
                       Zech. 3 :1-5.
                           What expression did the judge use to describe the woman's
                       effect on him? It literally means "smite me below the eye";
                       figuratively, "beat me out," or "wear me out."

             Part 4      "And He spake this parable unto certain which trusted
          THE SNOB in themselves that they were righteous, and despised
                      others: Two men went up into the temple to pray; the
                      one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee
                      stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank Thee,
                      that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
                      adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the
        Luke 18:9-12 week, I give tithes of all that I possess."

                           What attitude did Jesus notice in some to whom He directed
                        this parable? The Pharisees were the conservative sect of the
                        Jews and were proud and boastful. They made a great display
                        of praying in public to demonstrate their piety.
                           With whom does Jesus say the Pharisee prayed? How far
                        did his prayers reach? For what does he give thanks? What
                        is his aim in praying? His prayer is entirely negative. He omits
                        any reference to the goodness or the mercy of His Creator.
                        Does he acknowledge his sin and need? How high was his
                        estimate of himself above his fellow human beings?
                           Notice what he said of the publican. What bearing to us
                        has Christ's warning against the philosophy of the Pharisees?
                        Matt. 16:6. Is self-congratulation ever in place?
 THINK IT THROUGH As I kneel to pray, what picture of my attitudes and de-
                  sires do the angels see? With whom am I talking? By
                  stressing the diseases of others do I make my health any

                          While the Pharisee stood where all could see and witness
                       his praying, the publican stood "afar off." What picture of his
                       relationship to God does this convey? So great was the sense
                       of his own sinfulness that he felt he was unworthy to mingle
                       with the other worshipers in the temple court.
                          In what other ways was his humility manifested? His was
                       a short prayer, but effective. What did his prayer reveal about
                       his understanding of God? Compare Ezra's prayer in Ezra 9:6.
                          "Overwhelmed with a sense of guilt, he stood as if alone
                       in God's presence. His only desire was for pardon and peace, his

                          "God be merciful"—the word "merciful" from the same root
                       as "mercy seat." See Rom. 3:25, where the word is "propitia-
                       tion." What did Christ say about the effectiveness of this man's
                       prayer? Do repetitions and oratory have any place in effectual

                          To what instances in his life would you apply this statement?
                       During his years with Christ Peter exhibited self-confidence.
                       He thought he was quite able to meet any temptation or test
                       which might come his way. What experience did he have that
                       showed how inadequate his self-confidence was? Mark 14:66-72.
                          In what words does the apostle Paul warn us about the
                       dangers of self-confidence? 1 Cor. 10:12. But Peter learned his
                       lesson. His experience in the court of the high priest engraved
                       the truth deeply on his heart, and he never again asserted him-
                       self or relied upon his own strength. What incident just before
                       our Lord's ascension shows how well Peter had learned his
                       lesson of trust in the Lord for strength? John 21:15-17.
                          "The once restless, boastful, self-confident disciple had be-
                       come subdued and contrite. Henceforth he followed his Lord
                       in self-denial and self-sacrifice."—Ibid., p. 154. How did Jesus
                       suggest to Peter that his victorious life might display daily
                       service to needy human beings? Why did Peter have to wait
                       for a terrible crisis before he learned his lesson? What aspects
                       of Christ's character does His treatment of His self-confident
                       disciple reveal?
  THINK IT THROUGH Is the subduing of self a daily business with me? Am I
                    waiting for some future time or great crisis in which to

                           What is the "wisdom" to which Christ refers? Is it possible
                       to escape the responsibility of building some sort of character?

                       32:4; 1 Cor. 10:4.
                           "Rock" is also representative of God's Word. His "Word"
                       is both incarnate in Christ and inspired in the Bible. "The word
                       of our God shall stand forever." Isa. 40:8. "The Word of God
                       is the only steadfast thing our world knows. It is the sure
                       foundation."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 148.
                           Christ's listeners knew well what Jesus was talking about
                       when He contrasted the two kinds of houses—those built on
                       sand, for in the valleys were many such, and others built on
                       rock. The houses built upon rock were unmoved by the violent
                       storms and floods that frequently visited the area of the lake
                       of Galilee. Did the fact that the builders were sincere and meant
                       well guarantee that they were safe from storm? What connec-
                       tion did Jesus make between hearing and doing? It was not as
                       easy to build upon the rock as on the sands of the riverbeds,
                       but it paid off in the end. So it may not be easy for us to build
                       our characters upon Christ and His Word, but it pays! Who

       Matt. 7:26, 27 that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it."

                            Sand is shifting, easy to arrange, and apparently docile under
                         our efforts. But it is unstable and easily moved again by some-
                         one else. It may be blown by the wind for miles. The man who
                         built upon the sand was sincere but stupid. He wanted the easy
                         and quick way. Is sincerity enough? We need sound common
                         sense and true knowledge in building a character house which
                         will survive the storms of life. Those who trust to themselves
                         to earn salvation are building upon sand. What other illustra-

                            The man who built on sand was in danger from: overwhelm-
                         ing rainstorms which cause washouts and waterlogging of fields;

                        things? Can I patch up my character by leaving some of my
                        sinful ways and adding a few new patches? Why must there
                        be completely new raiment? This parable shows us the need,
                        not for trying to patch up the characters we have, but for ob-
                        taining new robes—the righteousness of Christ. Peter was con-
                        tinually endeavoring to patch up the old garments of his
                        character. It was not until he accepted Christ's robe of righ-
                        teousness in its entirety that he became a true disciple of the
                        Lord Jesus.
 THINK IT THROUGH What are the functions of my garments? Do they only
                  cover my nakedness, or do they make me attractive to
                  others? Am I contenting myself with mere patchwork
                  when I might obtain a whole new garment of righteous-
                  ness for the asking? Should I be satisfied with rags when
                  there are available to me the most beautiful robes?

                          Wine bottles were made from the skins of goats. After being
                       stretched to their capacity they would harden with age. Then
                       they could not be repaired with new skin patches. They were
                       used also as containers for other liquids. What does the "new
                       wine" represent? Luke 22:20.
                          The product of the crushed fruit of the true Vine illustrates
                       certain aspects of our Saviour's mission. Can you add to these:
                       the new teaching of the kingdom of God, righteousness by
                       faith, the sacrifice of Calvary? Why cannot this new teaching

                       you get these? John 3:3, 5.
                          Christ was not able to work through the Jewish leaders of
                       His day—they were the old wine bottles—so He called upon
                       those who had not been educated by the rabbis and were not
                       members of the Sanhedrin to become educators for Him. "He

            Part 5      "For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth
 BUILDING A TOWER not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have
                    sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the

                          Read also verses 25-27.

                          What did Jesus mean by a "tower"? Was it a place of de-
                       fense, storage, lookout, or worship? 2 Sam. 22:3, 51; Prov.
                       18:10; Jer. 6:27; Hab. 2:1.
                          This parable shows us another problem that can bring dis-
                       couragement and ruin—a failure to count the cost. This story
                       was told during the last months of Christ's ministry. The
                       Pharisees and scribes had rejected Christ and condemned all
                       who followed Him. Some did not wish to incur their displea-
                       sure. But there were others who were carried forward by their
                       own eagerness. They apparently wanted above all things to
                       be followers of the Man who was different from any other
                       leader they had known. Christ wanted to warn these that there
                       was a price to be paid for discipleship, just as there is a price
                       to be paid for every good thing that we enjoy. The price for
                       success is energy, persistence, and wholehearted devotion. Can
                       you add to this list? In what words did He hint at this? Luke
                       14:26, 27, 33.
                          This parable has an application to any practical undertak-
                       ing, whether soul-winning projects or material buildings. Our
                       faith and activity must be coupled with common sense.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I at times carried away by enthusiasm, or do I quietly
                        sit down and count the cost of each of my enterprises?
                        Do I consider the reputation of the great Master Builder
                        should I fail? Is my problem a lack of mature forethought
                        and reckless and impulsive activity?

            Part 6     "And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the
 CHILDREN AT PLAY men of this generation? and to what are they like? They
                   are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
                   calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto
                   you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you,
                   and ye have not wept. For John the Baptist came neither
                   eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a
                   devil. The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and
                   ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a
                   friend of publicans and sinners! But wisdom is justified
      Luke 7:31-35 of all her children."

                            This parable has a lesson for those who are never satisfied
                         with what is done for them. Christ had often observed children
                         playing in the evening in the open areas of cities where the
                         stalls of the market had been dismantled for the night. The
                         fickle changeability of these young people was the point He
                         brought out. Some led out in the game of weddings while others
                         played funerals. The first cried, "Dance!" The second called
                         out, "Weep !" The wedding players were disgruntled at those
                         who would not play their game, while the funeral players felt
                         the same about the wedding children. "If you don't do what
                         I want, I won't play with you !" is the attitude depicted.
                            Christ compared the solemn message of the Baptist with the
                         "funeral" players, while His own happier messages were lik-
                         ened to the "wedding." The people had responded to neither
                         approach except by criticism. Few seemed genuinely satisfied.
                         His age was a childish, unreasonable one. John, many felt,
                         lacked the gentle, human touch. And Christ, they thought, went
                         to unnecessary extremes to be friendly with sinners! Do not
                         listen to either leader, they urged. Our generation, too, Jesus
                         might observe, is like a group of petulent, unpredictable chil-
                         dren.
 THINK IT THROUGH Do I ever childishly say, "If you don't— I won't play with
                   you!"? Do I always want my own way? Am I fickle or
                  steady, petulant or reasonable?

              Part 1     "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no,
         WATCHFUL not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but
         SERVANTS the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know
                      not when the time is. For the Son of man is as a man
                      taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave au-
                      thority to his servants, and to every man his work, and
      Mark 13:32-34 commanded the porter to watch."

                          What does Christ say about the day and the hour of His
                       coming? Matt. 24:36. Jesus here repeats the warning that no
                       one except the Father in heaven knows the exact time of His
                       coming; therefore it behooves all to be prepared constantly.
                       Does this suggest that Christ Himself does not know the time
                       of His advent? Is it wise, then, for us to try to predict this
                       event? At what period did all "time prophecies" come to their
                       end? Rev. 10:6, last part.
                          The "far journey" undertaken by the man in the parable is
                       Christ's return to His home in heaven. What is the "house"
                       that the man in the parable leaves to the care of his servants?
                       The authority Christ invested in the "servants" is the power of
                       the gospel, the message of salvation.
                          Everyone has been assigned his own task. The "porter" is
                       commanded to watch. The emphasis is on watchfulness in this
                       parable. The word "watch" occurs three times. What blessing
                       is pronounced on those who are watchful? Luke 12:37. How
                       may we keep awake? Our waiting for the Lord of the house-
                       hold is not to be idle waiting. Each is to do his appointed
                       work. What do you understand by "suddenly"?
 THINK IT THROUGH By my occupation, my choices, my interests, am I show-

                          God's longing for His children to inherit the kingdom will
                       do no good unless they, for their part, also want it with all

              Part 3     "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten
       RELIGION LIKE virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet
        A WEDDING the bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five
                      were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps,
                      and took no oil with them: but the wise took oil in their
        Matt. 25:1-4 vessels with their lamps."

                           Christ and the disciples were seated on the Mount of Olives
                        when He told this parable. Christ had just concluded Matthew
                        24. "Then" ties the two chapters together. Looking toward the
                        city, they could see a house all lighted up, with people gathered
                        expectantly, waiting for a marriage procession to begin. It was
                        the custom for the bridegroom with his friends (Matt. 9:15;
                        John 3:29) to leave his home and go to meet his bride and
                        bring her to his home, accompanied by her attendants and
                        relatives and friends. See Ps. 45:14, 15.
                           "The two classes of watchers represent the two classes who
                        profess to be waiting for their Lord. They are called virgins
                        because they profess a pure faith."—Christ's Object Lessons,

                        aspects of Christ's mission is portrayed by the coming of the

                        parable apply? What precautions (2 Peter 1:5-8) did the "wise"
                        virgins take that the "foolish" ones did not (2 Peter 1:9)?
                        "Oil" in the Scriptures is often used as a symbol of certain
                        aspects of the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Can you list some?

             Part 4       "While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and
  CRY AT MIDNIGHT slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
                       bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those
       Matt. 25:5-7 virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps."

                          The bridegroom seemed to be delayed in his journey to the
                       home of the bride; and as the hour grew late, the bridal party
                       and guests began to fall asleep. To what, spiritual conditions
                       do "slumber" and "sleep" point?
                          Then at midnight one who was watching raised the cry,
                       "The bridegroom cometh !" "Cometh" is a supplied word in
                       the text. We are to look to Jesus. His advent will fit into place.
                       Immediately all were wakened.
                          This is a twofold picture of the coming of the heavenly
                       Bridegroom. The first points to His coming to the sanctuary
                       (Dan. 7:10, 13, 14) to determine who will constitute the bridal
                       party. His second advent also is portrayed. The first cry "Be-
                       hold the Bridegroom" went out in 1844. The second is now!
                       We should notice that "the coming of the bridegroom was at
                       midnight—the darkest hour. So the coming of Christ will take
                       place in the darkest period of this earth's history."—Christ's

                           How may I gain a better appreciation of God? Will the
                       message of Rev. 14:6, 7 help? What condition of the church
                       is represented by the foolish virgins? Rev. 3:15-18. "The state
                       of the church represented by the foolish virgins is also spoken

           OH, WE        oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered,
       MEANT WELL!       saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you:
                         but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for your-
        Matt. 25:8, 9    selves."

                            Why was there no problem for the five wise virgins? When
                         had they taken the precaution of buying oil to replenish their
                         lamps? Where had they obtained this? The foolish girls cried
                         out, "Our lamps are going out!" (Greek). Where only could
                         they go to find oil? Zech. 4:6, 11-14.
                            In their predicament what did the five foolish virgins seek
                         to get from the others? Why could not the wise virgins comply
                         with the request and share their "oil"? -The reply, "Not so !"
                         is abrupt and final. What did they suggest that the young
                         women should do?
                            The "oil" also represents the character developed by the
                         indwelling Spirit. One person cannot develop character for an-
                         other. What -does the Bible teach about the impossibility of
                         transferring human goodness from one to another? Ezek. 14:14,
                         20; Jer. 15:1. To what occasions does this message apply?
                         "Character is not transferable. No man can believe for another.
                         No man can receive the Spirit for another. No man can impart

                         Read also Luke 13:26, 27.

                           The foolish set out on a vain mission to buy oil. This sug-
                       gests that it will be useless and too late to try to develop a
                       godlike character through a sudden burst of Bible study to
                       obtain the oil of the Spirit after the close of probation. While
                       they were gone, the bridegroom came, and the procession made
                       its way back to his home. By the time the five foolish virgins
                       returned, the ready ones had gone inside and the door was
                       shut. The foolish girls were too late!
                           What two periods of church history are portrayed by all

                       message, fulfill this part of the parabolic prophecy? How will
                       the end, the third angel's message and its rejection, fulfill it?
                       What is the "door," and what is meant by "the shut door"?
                       What were the foolish ones told, when they pleaded to be
                       admitted? Luke 13:24-30.

                       participate. Its light would fall on blinded eyes, its melody upon
                       deaf ears. Its love and joy could awake no chord of gladness
                       in the world-benumbed heart. You are shut out from heaven

               Part 1    "There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in
     ALL OR NOTHING purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
                      and there was, a certain beggar named Lazarus, which
                      was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed
                      with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table:
        Luke 16:19-21 moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."

                            Read verses 13-18.

                            Against how many Pharisaic characteristics did Christ direct
                         this parable of the rich man and Lazarus? It is one of the least
                         understood of all His stories. Yet it is rich in meaning for us
                         today. In it Christ contrasts two men who lived at different
                         levels of wealth and social position here on earth.
                            Through the parable Christ teaches that it is impossible for
                         men to secure the salvation of the soul after death, and that
                         every man is given sufficient light for the discharge of the duties
                         required of him.
                            The Pharisees despised what they considered to be Christ's
                         excesses; but their own covetous unbelief they ignored. To
                         show them that if a man rejected light on earth he might be
                         surprised by the hereafter, Jesus told this parable.
                            What significance do you see in the various advantages the
                         rich man possessed? Does he represent the Jewish nation?
                         They, like the rich man, were decked in the "purple" of royalty
                         and the "fine linen" of the priesthood. He lived in "jovial
                         splendor" (liberal translation of "sumptuously") daily. The
                         Jews believed that material prosperity was an index of divine
                         blessing and spiritual power.
                            Is there anything revealed by Christ to condemn this rich
                         man? Was he kind for tolerating the beggar near his home?
                         Is indifference to want a sin?
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I tempted to say when I am prosperous materially,
                  "The Lord has blessed me"? or to think when times are
                  hard, "I wonder why the Lord has not blessed me"? Are
                  material conditions necessarily • evidence of Heaven's
                  blessings?

           Part 2      "And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was
  SHOCKED BY HELL carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich
                    man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up
                    his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off,
                    and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father
                    Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he
                    may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my
                    tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham
                    said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst
                    thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but
                    now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And be-
                    side all this, between us.and you there is a great gulf
                    fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you
                    cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come
     Luke 16:22-26 from thence."

                          The Saviour used a belief widely held among the Jews to
                      teach a lesson. "In this parable Christ was meeting the people
                      on their own ground. The doctrine of a conscious state of
                      existence between death and the resurrection was held by
                      many of those who were listening to Christ's words. The Sav-
                      iour knew of their ideas, and He framed His parable so as to
                      inculcate important truths through these preconceived opin-
                      ions."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 263.
                          According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Abraham's
                      bosom was the place where the just were taken after death to
                      await eternal life in heaven.
                          To whom did the rich man pray? Why not to God? He
                      evidently felt that being a child of Abraham was more impor-
                      tant than being a child of God ! But Lazarus could not help
                       the rich man. The Jews pictured a "great gulf" between "Abra-
                      ham's bosom" and Hades, which separated Lazarus from the
                       rich man. Jesus desires us to learn from this that it is only in
                      this life that we have probation. There is no further chance
                      after death.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I tempted to think that selfish pleasure and enjoy-
                ment is the sum of happiness? Was the rich man's cry
                for help in his desperate situation genuine? Am I in-
                clined to turn to God In a crisis and to forget Him when
                all goes well?

              Part 3        "Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
         NO SECOND       wouldest send him to my father's house: for I have five
            CHANCE       brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also
                         come into this place of torment. Abraham saith unto
                         him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear
                         them. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one
                         went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And
                         he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the proph-
                         ets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose
       Luke 16:27-31     from the dead."

                            Realizing the mistake in being callous toward the poor and
                        suffering during his lifetime, and of justifying his conduct, the
                         rich man wanted his brothers to be warned not to follow in
                        his footsteps and receive the fate he had received. Abraham said,
                        "Son, remember." We either remember in time to correct our
                        mistakes; or, when it is too late, we remember in fear and
                        remorse.
                            "Abraham in his answer to this request is represented as
                        saying, Your brothers have been sufficiently warned. Light has
                        been given them, but they would not see; truth has been pre-
                        sented to them, but they would not hear."—Christ's Object
                        Lessons, pages 264, 265.
                            The message is clear: if we do not accept present light, we
                        shut off the source of future light. The Jews asked for some
                        spectacular sign or evidence, but they rejected even the resur-
                        rection of the real Lazarus later on. We have ample evidence
                        in the inspired writings. Let us take heed to it.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I allowing prejudice to keep me from accepting all
                the light of this message? If I refuse to study and follow
                the Scriptures, will I ever yield to other evidence? Am I
                expecting some spectacular revelation?

            Part 4      "And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our
       THANKS FOR faith. And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of
         NOTHING mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be
                     thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the
                     sea; and it should obey you. But which of you, having
                     a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him
                     by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit
                     down to meat? and will not rather say unto him, Make
                     ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve
                     me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou
                     shalt eat and drink? Doth he thank that servant because
                     he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
                     So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things
                     which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
       Luke 17:5-10 servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."

                          As the Twelve listened to Christ's challenging message, they
                       doubted the effectiveness of their spiritual powers and prayed
                       for an increase of faith. Theirs is a magnificent request we
                       should make daily.
                           Christ divided His answer to His disciples into two parts.
                       The first had to do with the amount and source of their faith.
                       The second covered the motive of service which was exhibited
                       in the exercise of their faith.
                          The heavenly seed contains the life principle which is capable
                       of vast and unpredictable results. What is the relationship in
                       which God purposes our faith shall be energized? Rom. 10:17.
                       Did the size of the seed used as an illustration (the mustard
                       seed is among the smallest) indicate that the disciples needed
                       more faith or a better understanding of their own worth?
                          "Those who labor wholeheartedly in the Lord's vineyard,
                       working to the utmost of their ability, are not the ones to set
                       the highest estimate on their own services. Instead of swelling
                       with pride and self-importance, and measuring with exactness
                       every hour's work, they compare their efforts with the Saviour's

                          What occasioned the telling of this parable? Luke 12:13,
                       14. How did Jesus reply to the man's request? Verse 15. What
                       factors do you think kept the two brothers from solving their
                       own problem? Christ's warning includes all covetousness. Why
                       did Christ not assume any responsibilities as an arbitrator in
                       settling business squabbles? Is this an example to the church
                       in religious matters? Compare John 8:3-11; Matt. 22:17-21.
                          What has the parable of the rich man to say of the folly
                       of making' worldly possessions the be-all and end-all of life?
                       What is the significance of Christ's word "things"? What does
                       Jesus tell us about the man that indicates the man's intelli-
                       gence?
                          As the wealthy farmer harvested his good crops and sur-
                       veyed his gains, what far-reaching plans did he make? Was
                       there anything wrong about such plans since there is no sug-
                       gestion that he made his gains by fraudulent means? But what
                       was basically wrong with him and his schemes? See Eccl. 5:10.
                       Had he forgotten the demands of Christian stewardship? In
                       the eyes of the world he was probably a sensible man, but see
                       Job 27:8. What is said, however, of the wisdom of the world?
                       1 Cor. 3:19. How does the Bible characterize a fool? Ps. 14:1.
                       A fool is one who leaves God out of his reckoning, as this man
                       left God out of his plans for the future. See Prov. 12:15.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I right in saying, "My soul," or does it belong to
                God? Is God in all my plans, or am I laying up treasure
                on earth instead of in heaven?

Day of Reckoning       LESSON 1                                                   Friday

           Part 6           "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her
    WEATHER VANE        branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know
                        that summer is near so ye in like manner, when ye shall
                        see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even
     Mark 13:28, 29     at the doors."

                           This short parable was given when Christ was answering
                        the question of the disciples concerning the signs by which
                        they and we would be able to recognize the destruction of
                        Jerusalem and the end of the world. What expression did Luke
                        add (Luke 21:29) to show that while Christ emphasized the
                        fig tree, He also included others? Fig trees abound in the Holy
                        Land, and Christ's listeners were familiar with the sight of buds
                        forming on the fig tree—heralds of the approach of summer.
                        What did Jesus mean by the phrase, "Ye see and know of your
                        own selves"? Luke 21:30. As we welcome signs of summer in
                        the natural world, so we are to analyze Christ's clues in the
                        world around us as given in Matthew 24, Mark 14, and Luke
                        21, as signs of the summertime of the earth when Christ will
                        appear.
                           On what do these "signs" focus? Matt. 24:33, margin. "We
                        are standing on the threshold of great and solemn events.
                        Prophecy is fast fulfilling. The Lord is at the door. There is soon
                        to open before us a period of overwhelming interest to all
                        living. The controversies of the past are to be revived; new
                        controversies will arise. The scenes to be enacted in our world
                        are not yet even dreamed of. Satan is at work through human
                        agencies. . . . A crisis is just upon us.

                        great emergency. . . . The program of coming events is in the
                        hands of the Lord. The Majesty of heaven has the destiny of
                        nations, as well as the concerns of His church, in His own

                  Gardener so as to bring forth much fruit? Am I satisfied
                  merely with budding and leafing? Do I discern the signs
                  of coming judgment? Do I believe He—Christ—is near?

           Part 1      "Then said He unto him, A certain man made a great

          GUESTS time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things
                    are now ready. And they all with one consent began to
                    make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a
                    piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray
                    thee have me excused. And another said, I have bought
                    five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee
                    have me excused. And another said, 1 have married a
     Luke 14:16-20 wife, and therefore I cannot come."

                           Christ told this parable while He was a guest at a feast in
                        the home of a Pharisee. What is the significance of the phrases,
                        "They watched Him," and He "marked" them? Luke 14:1, 7.
                        He desired to show the Jews that God's mercy was extended to
                        the Gentiles as well as to them, and also to point out that by
                        their attitude they were slighting the gospel invitation. What
                        lesson in true hospitality had been given to Israel of old?
                        Deut. 14:29.
                           How many are included in the invitation? What period of
                        world history is suggested by the term "at suppertime"? Who
                        are the "servants" who should repeat the invitation?
                           "None of the excuses were founded on a real necessity. The
                        man who 'must needs go and see' his piece of ground, had
                        already purchased it. His haste to go and see it was due to
                        the fact that his interest was absorbed in his purchase. The
                        oxen, too, had been bought. The proving of them was only
                        to satisfy the interest of the buyer. The third excuse had no
                        more semblance of reason. The fact that the intended guest
                        had married a wife need not have prevented his presence at
                        the feast. His wife also would have been made welcome."—
                        Christ's Object Lessons, page 222.
                           The excuses made by the guests in the parable are still being
                        made today. They represent, first, those who are absorbed by
                        their possessions; then, those who put their business first; and,
                        last, those who allow their relatives to stand in the way of their

                  and the invitation to take part in the Lord's service?
                  Which of these three is my excuse? Is there any reason

             Part 2       "So that servant came, and showed his lord these
         SUBSTITUTE things. Then the master of the house being angry said
       INVITATIONS to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes
                      of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed,
                      and the halt, and the blind. And the servant said, Lord,
                      it is done as thou host commanded, and yet there is
                      room. And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into
                      the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in,
                      that my house may be filled. For I say unto you, That
                      none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my
       Luke 14:21-24 supper."

                            How did the giver of the feast react when the servant
                         brought back his report? Whom did he then tell his servant
                         to invite? Who did the first invited guests represent? In what
                         ways did they react to the gospel invitation? What did Jesus
                         mean by the "streets and lanes of the city"? What is further
                         suggested by the terms "highways and hedges"? What did
                         Christ indicate by "my house"? By the "poor, and the maimed,
                         and the halt, and the blind" are represented those whom the
                         Jewish leaders despised, the common people of the land. Why
                         do men still take this attitude?
                            Since there were still places, after these had been brought
                         in, what did the giver of the feast tell his servant to do? Those
                         in the highways and hedges represent the ones outside the
                         Jewish nation. Christ stresses here that the "good news" was
                         to go to the Gentile world. To what extent is the gospel invita-
                         tion now to be given? Rev. 14:6.
                            "None of those men" points to so-called noble and wise
                         men, not to mankind in general. To what supper will these
                         "mighty men" be invited? Rev. 19:17, 18.
 THINK IT THROUGH What do I learn of God's character through His repeated
                 invitations? What do I understand is the "anger" of
                 God? Should it ever be compared with the anger of man?

                      lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him;
                      and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee,
                      Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take
                      the lowest room. But when thou art bidden, go and sit
                      down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee
                      cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher:
                      then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them
        Luke 14:7-10 that sit at meat with thee."

                           This story reminds us of the way in which the disciples con-
                        tended about who should have the best places at the Last
                        Supper. Luke 22:24-27; compare Mark 9:33-37. Jesus must
                        have often noted how this question of pride and protocol oc-
                        cupied the minds of the people. The most important seats at a
                        feast were typical of various status symbols men cherish. But
                        Christ sought to show that we obtain honor not by seeking
                        high places, but by being willing to take the lowliest place and
                        to do the humblest tasks.
                           What did Jesus teach about true greatness? Matt. 23:11, 12.
                        What illustration did He select to emphasize His lesson? Matt.
                        18:1-4.
                           "The principle here enunciated strikes at the very root of
                        pride, the desire to exalt oneself in the opinion of others; and
                        pride, in turn, along with selfishness, is the root of all sin. Jesus
                        Himself set the supreme example of humility (see Isa. 52:13,
                        14; Phil. 2:6-10)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Luke 14:11.
 THINK IT THROUGH What conclusion did Jesus draw? Luke 14:11. How do
                I feel when someone I know gets a better job or a raise
                in pay? Am I always comparing another's good fortune
                with my own conditions in life?

              Part 4      "And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used
      THE BEST MAN to fast: and they come and say unto Him, Why do the
                       disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Thy
                       disciples fast not? And Jesus said unto them, Can the
                       children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom
                       is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with
       Mark 2:18, 19 them, they cannot fast."

                           Christ's willingness to eat even at the homes of publicans
                        and sinners caused no small stir among those who considered
                        themselves more righteous. The Pharisees, as part of their
                        requirements, fasted regularly, some of them even on two days
                        a week. But Jesus and His disciples appeared to disregard this
                        custom entirely. When John's disciples asked the reason why,
                        how did Christ reply? Compare Matt. 9:14, 15. What is the
                        true fast commanded by the Scriptures? Isa. 58:6, 7.
                           "Here is set forth the very spirit and character of the work
                        of Christ. His whole life was a sacrifice of Himself for the
                        saving of the world. Whether fasting in the wilderness of temp-
                        tation or eating with the publicans at Matthew's feast, He was
                        giving His life for the redemption of the lost. Not in idle
                        mourning, in mere bodily humiliaton and multitudinous sacri-
                        fices, is the true spirit of devotion manifested, but it is shown
                        in the surrender of self in willing service to God and man."

                           Who is the "Bridegroom"? What is the difference between
                        the "bride" and "the children of the bridechamber"?
 THINK IT THROUGH What modern day applications do I find in God's recom-
                  mendation to "fast"? Does this mean going without food
                  for the body or going without "food" for the ego and
                  the carnal nature?

               Part 5      "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king,
           TOO LATE which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his
         TO CHANGE servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding:
                       and they would not come. Again, he sent forth other
                       servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I
                       have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are
                       killed, and all things are ready: come unto the mar-
                       riage. But they made light of it, and went their ways;
                       one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and the
                       remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully,
                       and slew them. But when the king heard thereof, he was
                       wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those
         Matt. 22:2-7 murderers, and burned up their city."

                             Who are represented by the "king" and the "son"? When
                          will this "marriage" take place? Who is the Bridegroom? and
                          the bride? What actually is the marriage? Has this any mean-
                          ing for us today? What second invitation was sent out? Matt.
                          22:8-10.
                             "In this parable, as that of the great supper, are illustrated
                          the gospel invitation, its rejection by the Jewish people, and the
                          call of mercy to the Gentiles."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
                          307.
                             Athough similar to the parable of the great supper, this story
                          teaches different truths. Like the former, it illustrated the re-
                          jection of the gospel invitation by the Jews and the giving of
                          the invitation to the Gentiles. "This was the message borne
                          to the Jewish nation after the crucifixion of Christ; but the
                          nation that claimed to be God's peculiar people rejected the
                          gospel brought to them in the power of the Holy Spirit."
                          —Ibid., p. 308.
                             How did those invited to the wedding treat God's servants
                          sent out to tell them that everything was ready?
 THINK IT THROUGH Can I show any more intense rebellion than by making
                  excuses? How do I treat the messengers of truth, both
                  dead and living? Do I welcome them and their message?

            Part 6     "And when the king came in to see the guests, he
       WHAT! NO saw there a man which had not on a wedding, garment:
  PROPER CLOTHES? and he saith unto him, Friend, how tamest thou in hither
                    not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
                    Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and
                    foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer dark-
                    ness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For
    Matt. 22:11-14 many are called, but few are chosen."

                         What group is represented by the guests? "The guests at
                       the gospel feast are those who profess to serve God, those
                       whose names are written in the book of life." — Christ's Object
                       Lessons, page 310.
                          What do we understand by the examination of the guests
                       conducted by the king? When does, this take place? "By the

                          What is meant by the "robe"? Rev. 19:8. "By the wedding
                       garment in the parable is represented the pure, spotless char-
                       acter which Christ's true followers will possess."—Ibid.
                          Where only can this garment of righteousness be obtained?
                       Rev. 3:18. In Eastern weddings the garment was provided by
                       the king. Whom did the king notice among the guests? "But
                       one man was clothed in his common citizen dress. He had re-
                       fused to make the preparation required by the king. The gar-
                       ment provided for him at great cost he disdained to wear."
                       —Ibid., p. 309.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I postponing obtaining the garment of righteousness
                   provided by my heavenly King, or do I think my own
                   robes of self-righteousness are good enough? Is there
                   any chance to change clothes once the King comes?

                           The setting of this parable was the lake of Galilee. Christ's
                        story conjured up a scene which was familiar to those brought
                        up by the waterside. The net was literally a "dragnet," one
                        pulled through the water by the fisherman. What is represented
                        by the "net" that is cast into the sea? What is suggested by the
                        sea? Rev. 17:15. "The casting of the net is the preaching of
                        the gospel."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 122. See Ezek. 47:
                        9, 10.
                           The great dragnet gathers in all kinds of creatures from the
                        sea, good and bad. Compare Matt. 22:10. At the close of his
                        day's work, the fisherman returns to the harbor to sort out
                        his catch. He then discards what is not of value. What aspect
                        of the kingdom of heaven does this sifting work depict? By
                        what means is the separation brought about? When is this
                        accomplished in the case of individuals and then in the case of
                        all mankind? Does God delight in this work of rejecting some
                        men? Ezek. 33:11. Has man a part to play? Matt. 4:19; Luke
                        5:10; Jer. 16:16.
                           "Throughout the period of probationary time His Spirit is
                        entreating men to accept the gift of life. It is only those who
                        reject His pleading that will be left to perish. God has de-
                        clared that sin must be destroyed as an evil ruinous to the uni-
                        verse. Those who cling to sin will perish in its destruction."
                        —Christ's Object Lessons, page 123.
                            To the "end" of what "age" or "world" did Jesus point?
                        Do you think Christ's emphasis was on "gathering" or "sep-
                        arating"? The work is of cleansing the kingdom from those
                        who defile it. This means that not all will be saved.
 THINK IT THROUGH Am I making good use of the probationary time God has
                 granted me that I may be chosen when the angels come
                 to do the work of separating the good from the evil? How
                 may I close my own probation before the general close

                           The parable of the ten virgins emphasizes personal prepara-
                        tion in waiting for Christ's return. The parable of the talents
                        lays stress on what His disciples should be doing as they work
                        in preparation for His advent. It also teaches the basis upon
                        which Christ separates His faithful and unfaithful servants. The
                        "man" is Christ returning to His Father. The entrusted talents
                        are the gifts to the church (Eph. 4:8-12) as well as natural
                        abilities.
                           Is Jesus your Lord today? John 20:28; Rom. 6:16-18. What
                        are some of His gifts? 1 Cor. 12:8-11. Are they only on loan?

                        Object Lessons, page 328.
                           The talents have to do with the riches of Christ lent to the
                        servants and not the fitness of His servants themselves. The

                       hast not strawed: and I was afraid, and went and hid
                       thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
                       His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and
                       slothful servant . . . : thou oughtest therefore to have
                       put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming
                       I should have received mine own with usury. Take
                       therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
                       hath ten talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be
                       given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that
                       hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
                       And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
       Matt. 25:24-30 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

                             What excuses did the man with only one talent offer? What
                         is pictured by Christ's phrase, "buried it in the earth"? Was
                          this man any worse than the unjust steward? Luke 16:1. Is
                          hoarding misusing? What are the "exchangers"? He was
                         "wicked" in relationship to God and "slothful" in his service
                          to his fellows.
                             "In this is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness
                          of their endowments excuses them from service for Christ. If
                          they could do some great thing, how gladly would they under-
                          take it; but because they can serve only in little things, they
                         think themselves justified in doing nothing. In this they err.
                         The Lord in His distribution of gifts is testing character. The
                         man who neglected to improve his talent proved himself an
                         unfaithful servant."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 355.
                             How does Christ stress the importance of little things? Luke
                         16:10. On what basis was the negligent servant reproved? What
                         were the results in His life for "time" and also for "eternity"?
                         What did the lord order to be done with the talent that had
                         been neglected? Was this fair?
                             "As in the natural, so in the spiritual world: every power
                         unused will weaken and decay. Activity is the law of life. . . .

                         Like the parables that have preceded this one in the twenty-
                      fifth chapter of Matthew, the parable of the sheep and the
                      goats has to do with the settling of human accountability at
                      the second coming of Christ. Why is Jesus to be the Judge?
                      John 5:26, 27. What is the "glory" of the Son's throne? Does
                      this picture of the judgment scene embrace more than merely
                      the Jewish nation and any particular age of history? What
                      should be the significance to us of the fact that there are only
                      two classes into which the nations of the earth are finally
                      divided?
                         Since every national barrier is broken down at the foot of
                      this throne, upon what basis are all nations finally judged and
                      separated? What place is there in this decision for doctrines and
                      beliefs? What of all the "gray" areas of conduct when even-
                      tually there will be only black and white, right and wrong?
                         Why does "right side," designated for the sheep, suggest
                      favor? Christ is spoken of in heaven as standing on the right
                      hand of God (Acts 7:55), and the elect are to be on the right
                      hand of Christ. What blessing is pronounced on those on Christ's
                      right side?
                         For how long has the kingdom been prepared for them?
                      What does this mean to you? Matt. 25:34.
 THINK IT THROUGH Are my thoughts, my words, my actions such that they
                  are preparing me so that Christ can accept me for a place
                  at the right hand of the Father? What does Christ's word

                     Then said he unto the' dresser of his vineyard, Behold,

                     find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
                     And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this
                     year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it

                          Read also Matt. 21:18-22.
                          What is represented by Christ's vineyard? Isa. 5:7. "The
                       generation to whom the Saviour had come were represented by
                       the fig tree in the Lord's vineyard—within the circle of His
                       special care and blessing."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 214.

                       love for the chosen people."—Ibid., p. 216.
                          What had John warned the Jewish leaders was to be laid
                       at the root of the fruitless tree? Matt. 3:10.
                          The cursing of the actual fig tree by Jesus is the sequel to
                       His parable of the fig tree. See The Desire of Ages, page 584.
                       The barren fig tree disappointed Jesus. Everything had been
                       done for it that the gardener could. It had developed only a
                       good showing of leaves. These normally should indicate that
                       the tree was laden with fruit. But on careful examination none
                       was found. So the people of Israel disappointed our Lord: Ev-
                       erything possible had been done for them, but they bore no fruit
                       in righteousness. "Christ's act in cursing the fig tree had aston-

             Part 6     "He . . . spake a parable, because He was nigh to
    THE SETTLEMENT Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom
                     of God should immediately appear. He said therefore,
                     A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive
                     for himself a kingdom, and to return. And he called his
                     ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said
                     unto them, Occupy till I come. But his citizens hated him,
                     and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have
                     this man to reign over us. And it came to pass, that when
                     he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he
                     commanded these servants to be called unto him, to
                     whom he had given the money, that he might know how
      Luke 19:11-15 much every man had gained by trading."
                          Read also verses 16-27.
                           Note carefully the circumstances which led to the need for
                        this story. The people expected "the kingdom" right now; but
                        Jesus told them He, the "nobleman," was to go away in order
                        to obtain the kingdom. Compare Mark 13:34; Phil. 2:9-11.
                            This parable is in some ways similar to that of the talents.
                        In one the servants received according to their abilities, in the
                        other each received equal opportunities. The Lord was leaving
                        responsibilities upon His servants.
                            The one-talent servant represents those who use their talents
                        for worldly interests. "Like the unfaithful servant they are
                        afraid that the increase of the talent that God has lent them
                        will be called for to advance the spread of truth; therefore they
                        tie it up by investing it in earthly treasures and burying it in
                        the world, thus making it so fast that they have nothing, or
                        next to nothing, to invest in the cause of God. They have buried
                        it, fearing that God would call for some of the principal or
                        increase."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 386.

             Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
     JUNE 27, 1970 • CENTRAL EUROPEAN DIVISION

    East and West—The Divided City . . . The Brandenburg Gate
. . . Air raids of World War II . . . The American Airlift . . . the
city with the most suicides. When someone mentions Berlin, scenes
and reports of these incidents and landmarks flash into our minds.
    Our members in Berlin are conscientious workers for Christ.
Taped telephone sermons, personal family visitations, brass band
evangelism, and Branch Sabbath Schools are just a few of the activ-
ities they have initiated in the city to entice souls for Christ.
     An - evangelistic center located in Berlin is one project of the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow. The new, modern building
will attract the masses of Berlin who otherwise might not hear of
Christ.
     Half of the citizens of Berlin are over sixty-five years of age. The
Seventh-day Adventist Church feels a responsibility toward these
elderly people. With the help of the overflow, a six-story retirement
home will be completed in a Berlin suburb.
     The Waldfriede Hospital needs funds for expansion and mod-
ernization. Without these additions, the hospital will lose its im-
portance and attraction among the people of Germany. The believers
in Central Europe are looking to their fellow believers in the Sab-
 bath Schools around the world to help meet these needs on June 27.
