          The Blessing of Daily Study
   "He who by faith receives the Word is receiving the
very life and character of God. Every seed brings forth
fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul by faith the
incorruptible seed of the Word, and it will bring forth a
character and a life after the similitude of the character
and the life of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—
Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His
hungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is
a personal Saviour. As they feed upon His Word, they
find that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys the
natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ
Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 391.
 "The neglect of the Word means starvation to the soul."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                       My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayer-
ful study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

Christ, the Answer to Man's Quest            LESSON 1                        ❑   Sunday

                Part 1      "At midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises
         LIFE'S GREAT    unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly
                QUEST    there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
                         the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors
                         were opened, and everyone's bands were loosed. And
                         the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
                         seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and
                         would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners
                         had been fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying,
                         Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. Then he called
                         for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell
                         down before Paul and Silas, and brought them out, and
                         said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said,
                         Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,
        Acts 16:25-31    and thy house."

                            Sooner or later life confronts every man, as it did the Philip-
                         pian jailer, with a choice between the way of life eternal and
                         the way of death from which there is no resurrection. Thinking
                         he had no alternative to certain death as prescribed by Roman
                         law, the jailer preferred death at his own hand. But he had
                         not reckoned with the transforming influence of Paul and Silas
                         on their fellow prisoners, and he now recognized the presence
                         of that supernatural power as the alternative that saved him
                         from physical death. Perhaps it would also save him from a
                         life that he had found meaningless, hopeless, and disappointing.
                         Thus it came to pass that the Philippian earthquake released
                         the jailer from the shackles that bound him—as it had already
                         released his prisoners physically—and made him a free man in
                         Christ Jesus.
                             What decisive act of faith did Paul commend to the
                         jailer as the key to release from a meaningless, hopeless,
                         and disappointing existence?
    THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways does my life experience resemble that
                         of the Philippian jailer?
                             What does belief in Jesus involve? How does belief
                         save a person?

Christ, the Answer to Man's Quest          LESSON 1                     ❑ Monday

              Part 2     "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-
        THE GIFT OF begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should
      INFINITE LOVE not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not
                      His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the
                      world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on
                      Him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is con-
                      demned already, because he hath not believed in the
        John 3:16-18 name of the only-begotten Son of God."

                           To believe in Jesus Christ as the world's greatest teacher
                        or its ideal man is not saving faith. There must be recognition
                        that Jesus the Christ is, indeed, God incarnate. This essential
                        fact of the Christian faith is the theme of John's Gospel: "In
                        the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
                        the Word was God." "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt
                        among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only
                        Begotten of the Father)." John 1:1, 14.
                           The union of Deity and humanity in the person of Jesus of
                        Nazareth is the very heart of the Christian faith, and without
                        this—to borrow the words of Paul—"then is our preaching
                        vain, and your faith is also vain." "Your faith is vain; ye are
                        yet in your sins." 1 Cor. 15:14, 17. Read verses 12-23.
                           But even to believe that Christ is, indeed, the God-man is
                        not, in and of itself, sufficient to save a sinner. "The devils
                        also believe" that—"and tremble." James 2:19. It is necessary
                        also to receive Him in a personal way into one's heart and life
                        as well as to believe in Him; this alone brings with it "power
                        to become the sons of God." John 1:12.
                           What must a person believe "about" Christ in order
                        that belief "in" Him may be effective for salvation?

 THINK IT THROUGH           What effect would a denial of the deity of Christ have
                        (a) on other facets of the Christian faith, and (b) on the
                        Christian's personal relationship to Christ?
                            Have I entered into that personal relationship with
                        Christ described in John 1:12, 13?

               Part 3      "I am the living Bread which came down from heaven:
    GOD'S PROVISION if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and
     FOR MAN'S NEED the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give
                        for the life of the world."
                           "Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath
                        eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. For
     John 6:51, 54, 55 My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed."

                             As physical food is essential to the nourishment of physical
                         life, so spiritual food is essential to the sustenance of spiritual
                         life. In this graphic figure our Lord affirms the close, vital rela-
                         tionship that is necessary if belief in Him is to bring salvation
                         —a relationship as vital as food to the body. Here Jesus again
                         affirms the sublime fact that He had come from God in heaven.
                         Christ lives in us, and we live in Him; as a result of this
                         mutual—felationship it will be our joyous privilege to live for-
                         ever.
                             It is becoming ever more popular among professed Christians
                         to believe that Christ was divine in the same sense that all
                         good men are—no more and no less. They hail Him as the
                         greatest teacher of all time and as the best man who ever lived,
                         but emphatically deny that He was in any special sense divine.
                         But if Jesus is not the God-man, then there is no forgiveness
                         of sin, no justification, no salvation, no eternal life, no home
                         in heaven. "If ye believe not that I am He, ye shall die in your
                         sins," Jesus warned. John 8:24.
                             Read John 6:25-59 thoughtfully, tracing the development of
                         thought in Jesus' remarks.
                             How did Jesus illustrate and explain the keystone truth
                         that He had come forth from God, and that eternal life
                         is possible only by receiving Him into the life?

    THINK IT THROUGH         On what sort of spiritual diet am I sustaining my Chris-
                         tian experience—one that is nourishing, or one that ap-
                         pears to be good food but from which the vital elements
                         have been removed? Am I starving spiritually?
                            What practical difference does it make whether I think
                         of Christ as the One who came from heaven to unite
                         humanity with divinity, or simply as a good Man and a
                         great teacher?

                           This conversation between Jesus and His disciples took place
                        toward the close of His earthly ministry, after they had had
                        ample opportunity to listen and to observe. They knew that
                        other people thought Him saint-like in character and were
                        willing to accept Him as a messenger sent from God. Did the
                        disciples merely reflect popular opinion, or had their more
                        intimate association with Jesus given them a deeper insight?
                           Peter summed up the consensus of his fellow disciples when
                        he answered Jesus: They knew Him to be the Messiah of
                        prophecy, very God in human flesh. This conviction, Jesus
                        pointed out, had been impressed upon their hearts by the
                        Holy Spirit as they heard Jesus' words and witnessed His
                        mighty works. Happy indeed the men in whom this conviction
                        is fixed! This sublime truth, this conviction, Jesus went on to
                        explain, is the great rock of truth on which He would build
                        His church. Matt. 16:18.
                            Read Peter's stirring affirmation of faith in Jesus as the
                        Christ, written thirty-five years or so later, as recorded in
                        2 Peter 1:16-21.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Of what two facts concerning Jesus were His disciples
                        fully convinced? How had they arrived at this conclusion?
                            If I had been in Peter's place, how would I have re-
                        sponded to Jesus' question as to who He really is?
                            Is my personal opinion about Jesus merely the reflec-
                        tion of what others say, or is this knowledge the result of
                        my own experience and conviction?

Christ, the Answer to Man's Quest            LESSON 1                   ❑   Thursday

              Part 5        "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,
          THE GREAT      and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and
         INVITATION      learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye
                         shall find rest unto your souls. For My yoke is easy, and
       Matt. 11:28-30    My burden is light."

                            By virtue of His personal knowledge of the Father and the
                         Father's will for men (Matt. 11:27), Christ was preeminently
                         qualified to reveal the Father to men. The wise and learned
                         of earth (verse 25) cannot do so because they have not known
                         the Father as He knows the Father. He speaks authentically
                         for the Father, and in Him we will find true rest of soul.
                            The rest to which Christ invites us is rest from our heavy
                         loads of sin. These heavy loads are the burden of sin and igno-
                         rance of God's divine love and will. But God made man to
                         enjoy the glorious freedom of sons (Rom. 8:21), and, chained
                         like a slave to the burden of sin, his soul cannot be at rest
                         until he finds release from the shackles of sin and enters into
                         the glorious freedom for which the Creator designed him. As
                         Augustine wrote in his Confessions, "Thou hast made us for
                         Thyself, 0 Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in
                         Thee."
                            To those who follow Him, Christ offers the yoke of loving
                         service. It is "easy" and "light," compared with the yoke of
                         sin. No burden, says the proverb, is heavy to a loving heart,
                         and genuine love for Christ makes it one's supreme joy to live
                         in harmony with His revealed will.
                            For further inspired comment on the rest of the soul in
                         Christ, read Hebrews 4:1-11.
                            What surcease from life's burdensome quest did Christ
                         offer those who come to Him in faith and submission?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Have I attained fully to the rest of soul the Saviour
                         offers me? Am I gladly wearing the yoke of joyful ser-

Christ, the Answer to Man's Quest           LESSON 1                         ❑   Friday

           Part 6       "This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus
   THE TWO DOORS Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And
      TO DESTINY it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit
                    is truth. For there are three that bear record in heaven,
                    the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three
                    are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth,
                    the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three
                    agree in one. If we receive the witness of men, the wit-
                    ness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God
                    which He hath testified of His Son. He that believeth on
                    the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that be-
                    lieveth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believ-
                    eth not the record that God gave of His Son. And this is
                    the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and
                    this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and
     1 John 5:6-12 he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
                            At the beginning of Jesus' public ministry the Holy Spirit
                        visibly acknowledged Him to be the Messiah, and a voice from
                        heaven attested Him to be the Son of God. To this event John
                        points as a witness to the deity of our Lord. "The blood of
                        his death" at the close of His life mission likewise provided
                        supernatural confirmation of His Messiahship. On both occa-
                        sions at least some of the bystanders witnessed these evidences
                        of divinity and were convinced. Read John 1:31-34; Matt.
                        27:54.
                            As we conternpAts these events in the life of Christ, the Holy
                        Spirit impresses our hearts, as it did the heart of John the
                        Baptist at the baptism and the heart of the centurion at the
                        crucifixion, that Jesus is indeed God's Son. We thus have a three-
                        fold witness concerning the deity of the God-man Jesus Christ.
                        It is our privilege to accept this witness, not only as a sublime
                        truth to be apprehended by the mind, but to be accepted also
                        into the heart and life. As we accept this witness, we enter
                        upon life eternal—by faith in Him. Read John 1:12.
                          To what threefold evidence of the divine sonship of
                        Christ did John point?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Am I fully persuaded by the evidence that Jesus is
                        what He claimed to be, the Son of God?
                          What does it mean to "have" the Son of God? Do I
                        "have" Him in this sense?

              Part 1       "In the beginning God created the heaven and the
       PARTNERS IN earth."
          CREATION         "And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after
                        Our likeness. . . . So God created man in His own image,
                        in the image of God created He him; male and female
     Gen. 1:1, 26, 27 created He them."

                            In decisive contrast to the polytheism of all other ancient
                         religious systems, the Old Testament stresses the fact that there
                         is but one true God. This sublime truth was set forth succinctly
                         in the great affirmation of Israel's faith: "Hear, 0 Israel: The
                         Lord our God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy
                         God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
                         thy might." Deut. 6:4, 5. Nevertheless, in a few select places
                         in the Old Testament there are clear hints of a plurality of
                         persons within the one true God.
                            Perhaps the clearest of these indications occurs in the crea-
                         tion record, where God communes with Himself, "Let Us make
                         man in Our image." Here the Old Testament, while not explicitly
                         identifying the promised Messiah as the divine Creator, pro-
                         vides for that more complete revelation later enshrined in the
                         New Testament, identifying man's Saviour as the One who, in
                         the beginning, created him.
                            It is fitting that the One who created man should be the
                         One to save and re-create him. Who could have a more per-
                         sonal and profound interest in man than the One who gave
                         him being and breath? Furthermore, the same creative power
                         that gave man being to begin with, was needed to restore him
                         to favor with God and to make him once more in the divine
                         likeness from which, through sin, he fell.
                            Read also Isaiah 48:16, and the SDA Bible Commentary
                         comment on this.
                            How does the inspired account of creation hint at the
                         sublime truth of a plurality of persons within the one
                         true God?

 THINK IT THROUGH            Why is the plurality of persons within the one true
                         God not as clearly set forth in the Old Testament as it
                         is in the New?
                             Does it make any difference to me personally that my
                         Redeemer is also my Creator?

    CREATOR AND darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His
 SAVIOUR ARE ONE dear Son: in whom we have redemption through His
                   blood, even the forgiveness of sins: who is the image of
                   the invisible God, the Firstborn of every creature: for by
                   Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
                   are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
                   thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
                   things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is be-
      Col. 1:12-17 fore all things, and by Him all things consist."

                            The New Testament repeatedly and consistently ascribes to
                         Christ the role of Creator of this world, and indeed of all
                         things. Read, for example, such passages as John 1:3, 10; Rom.
                         9:5; Heb. 1:1, 2. Awesome power was required to create "all
                         things." No less power was required in order to restore what
                         had been lost as a result of sin, and the sublime fact that the
                         work of salvation called for the personal sacrifice of the Creator
                         Himself exalts the work of salvation to the highest possible
                         level of importance.
                            The expression, "Firstborn of every creature," ascribes to
                         Christ priority in rank above all created beings. By virtue of the
                         fact that He is "before all things," in both time and rank, He is
                         superior to all other beings. "Firstborn" is a figurative expres-
                         sion based on the dignity and office of the firstborn son in a
                         family of Bible times. As Creator of all things, Christ's position
                         in the universe is unique and absolute. The greatness of salva-
                         tion can be properly understood only in terms of the greatness
                         of the Saviour, who alone could accomplish the task.
                            What sublime facts does the apostle Paul cite in exalt-
                         ing Christ as the Captain of our salvation?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Let us suppose that God had entrusted the work of
                         salvation to some lesser being. What would this tell me
                         about the character of God? About the nature of sin?
                         About the value He places on human beings?
                            What practical lessons are there with respect to my
                         own personal experience as a Christian in the fact that
                         Christ is both Creator and Sustainer of all things?

              Part 3        "The Lord is the true God, He is the living God. . . .
       CREATORSHIP       The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,

                         hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath
        Jer. 10:10-12    stretched out the heavens by His discretion."

                            When the prophets of old sought to draw a clear line of
                         distinction between the true God and all false gods, they always
                         came back to the fact that the true God had created the
                         heavens and the earth. The difference was not only one of
                         degree—with the true God greater than all other gods, so-called
                         —but of kind. He alone had the power to create ; they did
                         not. Turn to Ps. 96:3-5 for one of the finest Bible statements
                         of this sublime truth.
                            Isaiah looks with scorn upon those who make a graven
                         image and worship it as if it were God. The fact that it is a
                         man-made object proves that man is superior to it. On the
                         other hand, the true God made man as well as everything else
                         in the world, and this is conclusive evidence that the true God
                         is greater than man and that He alone deserves man's worship
                         and service. Read Isa. 44:6-20.
                            To deny that God created all things is to deprive the Chris-
                         tian religion of its validity and its power. It reduces Christianity
                         to a man-made religion like all other religions. Those who call
                         themselves Christians and yet reject the Bible account of crea-
                         tion have a structure of faith poised precariously in the tenuous
                         atmosphere of their futile imaginations, without any substantial
                         foundation. Salvation and the Christian faith are true because
                         their Author is the One who created and who sustains all things.
                            To what do the Bible writers point as the supreme
                         distinction between the true God and all false gods?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Is it possible to deny the Bible account of creation and
                         at the same time retain anything of value about the
                         Christian religion?
                            What kind of God does the Christian evolutionist wor-
                         ship?




   "The apostle Paul, writing by the          hand that sustains the worlds in space,
Holy Spirit, declares of Christ that 'all     the hand that holds in their orderly

               Part 4     "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
      JESUS CHRIST:   life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath
         TRULY GOD life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
                          "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath
                      given us an understanding, that we may know Him that
                      is true, and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son
  1 John 5:11, 12, 20 Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life."

                           Only the One who imparted life to man in the beginning
                        can impart eternal life to him now. No less divine power is
                        involved in the second gift of life than in the first. Unless I
                        believe that human life originally came from God, I have no
                        rational basis for believing that man can become eligible to
                        eternal life. Only He who made man is able to save man.
                           In this passage John declares his own absolute faith in
                        Christ. "The Son of God is come"—John knew that to be an
                        incontestible fact. 1 John 1:1-3. In the second place, John
                        knew Jesus Christ personally as the Son of God and refers to
                        this personal relationship with Christ as being in Christ. In
                        the third place, life eternal is in Jesus Christ, and the person
                        who, by virtue of his faith, is in Christ possesses eternal life
                        here and now. Recognition of the sublime fact that Christ is
                        truly God in the supreme sense of the word is the key to
                        eternal life.
                           By what line of reasoning did the apostle John come
                        to the sure conclusion that he and all other believing
                        Christians are already in possession of life eternal?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I possess eternal life now, or is it a future gift?
                        Is there a difference between eternal life and immortality?
                        Why is eternal life important to the Christian?

              Part 5      "God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love where-
        SALVATION with He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath
          REQUIRES quickened us together with Christ, (by grace are ye
     CREATIVE POWER saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us
                      sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the
                      ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His
                       grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus."
                          "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
                       unto good works, which God hath before ordained that
       Eph. 2:4-7, 10 we should walk in them."

                             In the beginning the Creator imparted physical life to the
                         lifeless form of Adam. Intellectually and morally Adam was
                         in the likeness of his Creator; but sin entailed moral death,
                         which eventually involved man in physical death as well. At
                         the appropriate time, however, the Creator Himself came to
                         earth, with the goal of re-creating fallen man in His own
                         glorious likeness.
                             In His new role as Saviour and Redeemer Christ set about
                         the task of creating men anew, morally, or "unto good works,"
                         as John expresses it. As the Creator formerly imparted life to
                         the lifeless form of Adam, He now imparted moral life to men
                         "dead in sins." He "quickened" them, that is, made them
                         morally alive again. As Christians "we are his workmanship,"
                         even as in the beginning Adam was His workmanship. Saly_atiqp
                         requires creative power no less certainly, and no less mighty,
                         than physical creation. The essential difference between the two
                         is that moral re-creation requires that human cooperation and
                         effort be united with divine power.
                            In what expressive words does John describe what
                         takes place in the experience of the individual sinner
                         when the Saviour restores Him to divine favor?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Why is it appropriate to describe the experience of
                         conversion as a creative act?
                            After this creative act has been accomplished, how is
                         a person different from what he was before?

              Part 6
      THE SABBATH            "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. . . . For
      WITNESSES TO       in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
      THE CREATOR        all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
         Ex. 20:8-1 1    the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

                            Having completed the work of creation in six days, God
                         ceased on the seventh day and set it apart as a memorial to
                         His creative work. Read Gen. 2:1-3. As we have already seen
                         (Jer. 10:10-12), the Bible points to the creative power of God
                         as the supreme evidence that He is the true God and as dis-
                         tinguishing Him from all false gods. A denial of the Bible rec-
                         ord of creation is a denial of the Creator Himself.
                            As a memorial to the great creative acts recorded in Genesis
                         1, the Sabbath becomes in a unique and superlative sense the
                         means ordained by the Creator to bind men to Him with a
                         knowledge of why He is the true God—His Creatorship. From
                         a theological point of view this is the primary significance of
                         the Sabbath. The person who remembers the Sabbath day in
                         the way God intended will never forget that "in six days the
                         Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is."
                         Every seventh day will remind him of that first seven days;
                         and, ever mindful of his Creator, the worshiper will be less
                         inclined to forget Him.
                             According to Ezek. 20:12, the Sabbath is likewise a "sign"
                         of the re-creative power of God in sanctifying men. It is thus
                         a memorial of the re-creation of man in the moral image of
                          God, as well as of the original creation of man in the likeness
                          of his Creator.
  THINK IT THROUGH          Of what two things was the seventh-day Sabbath de-
                         signed to be a perpetual memorial?
                            How can I and my family best utilize the hours of the
                         Sabbath to accomplish God's purpose that the Sabbath
                         be a memorial of His creative power?
                            Why would some other day of the week not memo-
                         rialize the work of creation as effectively as the seventh
                         day?

          Part 1    "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little
 FROM EVERLASTING among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He
                 come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose
       Micah 5:2 goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting."

                           This prediction that the Messiah was to be born in Bethle-
                        hem is given in the setting of His role as a royal Son of David
                        and heir to his throne. In prophecy (Isa. 9:6, 7; 11:1-4) and
                        by the people (Matt. 20:30; 21:15) the Messiah is acclaimed
                        as "the Son of David." It was thus appropriate, and signifi-
                        cant, that Jesus be born in the town of David, Bethlehem.
                           Micah refers to the Messiah by the cryptic pronoun "He."
                        The future ruler of Israel was to be a Bethlehemite; but it is
                        said of Him that His "goings forth have been from of old,
                        from everlasting"—long before the founding of Bethlehem.
                        The coming Messiah is here declared to have existed in the
                        long ago, prior to the "thousands [literally, 'the clans'] of
                        Judah."
                           Christ's eternal preexistence is reflected throughout the
                        Bible. The Old Testament gospel prophet Isaiah ascribes to
                        Him the title "everlasting Father." Isa. 9:6. Jesus in His in-
                        tercessory prayer spoke of the glory He shared with the
                        Father "before the world was." John 17:5. According to John
                        1:1-3, the eternal Word was God in the supreme sense of the
                        word in the most remote ages of eternity past, and as Creator
                        He necessarily preceded all created things. According to Col.
                        1:17, He was "before all things."
                            What information does the prophet Micah give con-
                        cerning the origin, heritage, birthplace, and future role
                        of the coming Messiah?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Why is it important that the Saviour of the world
                        should have preexisted from all eternity?
                           What reasons can you suggest as to why the Scrip-

             Part 2          "We declare unto you glad tidings, how that the prom-
        CHRIST, THE      ise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled
       SON OF GOD        the same unto us their children, in that He hath raised
                         up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm,
       Acts 13:32, 33    Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee."

                            Another cryptic prediction concerning the Messiah, in the
                         setting of His being heir to David's throne, occurs in Ps. 2:6, 7.
                         Reference here is specifically to the divinely appointed "king
                         upon My holy hill Zion," and in this context occurs the divine
                         announcement concerning the future King, "Thou art My Son;
                         this day have I begotten Thee."
                            The speaker is "He that sitteth in the heavens . . . : the
                         Lord." Verse 4. He addresses the future Messianic King as His
                         Son, a term which in ancient Hebrew usage stressed relation-
                         ship and character as well as filial descent. The speaker also
                         declares, "This day have I begotten Thee." If this be pressed
                         as a literal statement, of a father begetting a son in the literal
                         sense, there was necessarily a time before which Christ was
                         not, as Arius claimed sixteen centuries ago. But as we have
                         already seen (Part 1), such a conclusion would be in conflict
                         with the explicit statements of the Bible writers concerning the
                         eternity of Christ.
                            In Acts 13:32, 33 we have the inspired answer to the ques-
                         tion posed by Ps. 2:7. "This day" is the day of Christ's resur-
                         rection from the tomb, and the begetting referred to is not the
                         literal begetting of a son by a father, but the calling forth of
                         Christ from the grave. As Paul explicitly states in Col. 1:18,
                         Christ is "the firstborn from the dead." Read also Rev. 1:5,
                         where He is called "the first begotten of the dead." He was
                         "declared to be the Son of God with power, . . . by the resur-
                         rection from the dead." Rom. 1:4.
                            In what sense, and by virtue of what glorious event, is
                          Christ the "firstborn" or "begotten" of the Father?

 THINK IT THROUGH             Is the title "Son of God" a reflection of intrinsic rela-
                          tionship between the two members of the Trinity, or does
                          it reflect a relationship subordinate to the plan of salva-
                          tion and the incarnation?
                              What does the title "Son of God" mean to me, and
                          how does it help me to understand my relationship to
                          God?

             Part 3       "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
     GOD INCARNATE with God, and the Word was God."
                          "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,
                       (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only Begot-
        John 1:1, 14 ten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."

                            As applied to Jesus Christ, the title "Word" is unique with
                        John, in his Gospel and also in his epistles. Volumes have been
                        written in an attempt to plumb its depth of meaning.
                           A word is the verbal expression of an idea. The incarnate
                        Christ was a living demonstration, or expression, of the infinite
                        character and love of God for men lost in sin. John 3:16. He
                        came from heaven to 'earth to reveal the Father, and in His
                        sinless life, His tender ministry to the needs of men, and His
                        vicarious death on the cross He was expressing Heaven's love
                        for the lost human race. He did this in order that men might
                        believe and know God for what He really is, a gracious and
                        merciful Father, and thus find salvation from the power of
                        sin. John 17:3.
                            In the opening words of his Gospel, John affirms the absolute
                        deity and timeless preexistence of Christ; then he goes on to
                        say that this same divine Being became incarnate and lived
                        as a man among men. Divinity was shrouded in humanity; but
                        at times, notably on the mount of the transfiguration, the glory
                        of heaven shone through the mask of humanity.
                            The King James Version expression, "Only begotten," is a
                        mistranslation of the Greek, which is more accurately rendered
                        "unique," "only," or "one of a kind." John is not declaring
                        that, at some moment in remote eternity past, Christ came
                        into being by a process analogous to human fatherhood and
                        sonhood. Here he is declaring that the glory he and the other
                        disciples beheld in Christ was glory such as could be accounted
                        for only as the glory of Deity, and John offers this as absolute
                        proof that Jesus was indeed divine. Read 2 Peter 1:16-18.
                           What unique title does John use in introducing Jesus
                        Christ to his readers, and what sublime truths does John
                        give concerning Christ's preexistence and His mission to
                        earth?

 THINK IT THROUGH           What does the title "Word" mean to me, and how does
                        it help me better to understand and appreciate the love
                        of God and the Saviour?
                            Has the divine message from God penetrated into my
                        own heart, and has it found expression through my life,
                        so that others may also hear the Word and see it in and
                        through me?

           Part 4      "Unto the Son He [the Father] saith, Thy throne, 0 God,
  FATHER AND SON is forever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the
                    scepter of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness,
                    and hated iniquity; therefore God, even Thy God, hath
                    anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fel-
                    lows. And,, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
                    foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works
                    of Thine hands: they shall perish; but Thou remainest;
                    and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; and as a
                    vesture shalt Thou fold them up, and they shall be
                    changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
      Heb. 1 :8-1 2 fail."

                         The Bible presents Jesus Christ as the incarnate Son of God,
                      in His many-faceted relationship to the plan of salvation and
                      to the human family lost in sin. The Bible writers have little
                      to say about Him apart from His work on behalf of fallen
                      humanity. But here in the first chapter of Hebrews the curtain
                      of eternity is drawn aside as Inspiration gives us a brief glimpse
                      of the absolute, eternal relationship between the two members of
                      the Godhead we know as the Father and the Son. In awe
                      and wonder it is our privilege to listen in on this divine con-
                      versation between them.
                         Here the Father addresses the Son as God and attributes to
                      Him sovereign status. This was the "glory" that Christ shared
                      with the Father "before the world was" (John 17:5), and the
                      "all power" (Matt. 28:18) that was restored to Him at the
                      resurrection. When Jesus came to this earth, He emptied Himself
                      of this glory and power. (Read Phil. 2:7, 8.)
                         Inasmuch as the Scriptures are concerned almost exclusively
                      with Christ in His role as the Saviour of men, in which He
                      divested Himself of divine power and prerogatives (Phil. 2:5-8),
                      most of the statements about Christ in Scripture picture Him
                      in His role as a man among men, and thus subordinate to the
                      Father. These expressions of subordination are not to be con-
                      strued as reflecting the absolute relationship between these two
                      members of the Trinity.
                          Point out seven sublime truths concerning Christ and
                       His status in heaven as set forth in this declaration by
                       the Father.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How much does the Bible tell us about the absolute
                       relationship between Christ and the Father, and about
                       His status in heaven as Sovereign of the universe?
                          How can an insight into Christ's status in heaven
                       strengthen my faith in Him and my appreciation of His
                       love, and thus enable me to cooperate more effectively
                       with Him here and now?

                      and was made in the likeness of men: and being found
                      in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became
         Phil. 2:5-8 obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."

                           Literally in the Greek, the expression "made Himself of no
                        reputation" reads "emptied Himself." The Revised Standard
                        Version translation reflects the original more precisely. Christ
                        laid aside the prerogatives of Deity when He assumed humanity
                        and came to live as a man among men.
                           Christ was God, says Paul, and might rightfully have de-
                        clined, even temporarily, to relinquish His status of full equal-
                        ity. Instead, He "emptied Himself" of the "glory" and power
                        of Deity in order that He might take upon Himself "the form
                        of a servant" and "be made in the likeness of men," infinitely
                        inferior to the Father and subject to Him. He not only did so,
                        but became the most despised of men when He went to the
                        cross. Amazing love! What greater "emptying" could be imag-
                        ined—from ruling as sovereign of the universe, to being con-
                        demned as the vilest of criminals by wicked human beings!
                           He did it for us. If any passage of Scripture can help us
                        understand what Christ's mission to earth must have meant to
                        Him and to the inhabitants of heaven and the other worlds,
                        this is it. In love and gratitude let us bow our hearts before
                        Him, and purpose anew to live for Him as He lives for us. Let
                        us be willing to "empty" ourselves and to serve our fellowmen,
                        as He emptied Himself on our behalf.
                           What "mind" was in Christ as He looked down in com-
                        passion upon the human family lost in sin, and what did
                        this "mind" prompt Him to do?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Following Christ's example, what can I do to "empty"
                        myself?
                           What supreme example has come to my attention of
                        a human being humbling himself in service for his fel-
                        lowmen?

Christ, the Eternal One      LESSON 3                                       ❑   Friday

            Part 6         "Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
  THE ETERNAL ONE       eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and
      DWELLS IN US      holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and hum-
                        ble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive
           Isa. 57:15   the heart of the contrite ones."

                           No inspired affirmation of divine greatness and majesty ex-
                        ceeds this one in beauty and impressiveness. To say that God
                        inhabits eternity is more than a jeweled figure of speech. We
                        usually think of space being habitable, but why not time as
                        well? And if time, why not eternity? Space and time both
                        belong to God. Here we have a pen picture of God in the calm
                        and unhurried tranquillity of His reign as Sovereign of the
                        universe.
                           But, marvel of marvels, the Sovereign of the universe awaits
                        the faltering invitation of every contrite heart to dwell with
                        him, to inhabit his mind, affections, and life. How could He
                        be concerned about us fragile specks of cosmic dust, who have
                        strayed into sin and forgetfulness of God?
                           In similar vein Paul wrote: "I am crucified with Christ:
                        nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and
                        the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the
                        Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." Gal.
                        2:20. Today the True Witness to the Laodiceans makes the
                        same offer: "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any
                        man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him,
                        and will sup with him, and he with Me." Rev. 3:20.
                           Read also 1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 3:17.
                           What exalted privilege does the Sovereign of the uni-
                        verse offer those who are humble and contrite of heart?

 THINK IT THROUGH           What does it mean to be humble and contrite of heart?
                            In what ways will my thinking, conversation, and
                        actions be different from what they are if I measure up
                        to this requirement?

                Part 1      "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto
     THE GREAT I AM the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God
                         of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall
                         say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them?
                         And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and He said,
                         Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath
                         sent me unto you."
                            "I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto
                         Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by My name
      Ex. 3:13, 14; 6:3 JEHOVAH was I not known to them."

                           Calling Israel out of Egypt to be His chosen people, God re-
                        vealed Himself to them by a new name by which they were to
                        know Him. That name was Yahweh (incorrectly transliterated
                        into English as Jehovah). In Bible times a personal name was
                        significant in that it reflected a person's character, ideals, as-
                        pirations, or some great experience in life. The name Yahweh
                        (usually rendered in the King James Version as LORD, in capital
                        and small capital letters) is thought to be a form of the verb
                        "to be," and may be rendered freely into English as "the self-
                        existent One," "the Eternal," "the ever-living One."
                           This name, which occurs more than five thousand times in
                        the Old Testament, distinguished the true God from all false
                        gods. Because of the importance ancient peoples attached to
                        personal names, and because of the transcendent majesty of
                        the true God, Sovereign of the universe, the Jews eventually
                        came to regard the name itself with such sanctity that they
                        never took it upon their lips, and as a result knowledge of its
                        true pronunciation was eventually lost. Sometimes scribes, com-
                        ing to the sacred name Yahweh, would leave the space blank,
                        though usually they added the vowels of the ordinary word
                        for "lord" to the consonants of Yahweh, and read the name
                        as "Lord." This combination of the consonants for Yahweh
                        and the vowels for the Hebrew word for "lord," when vocal-
                        ized, sounds something like Jehovah. However, a Jewish reader
                        coming to the word always read "Lord," and never "Jehovah."
                            By what new name did God make Himself known to
                         Moses and the Hebrews when He summoned them out
                        'of Egypt to become His chosen, covenant people?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Why did God reveal Himself to Israel by a new name
                         when He summoned them out of Egypt to become His
                         covenant people?
                            In what ways can I express reverence for the various
                         names and titles by which I refer to God?

            Part 2        "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and
  BEFORE ABRAHAM       he saw it, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto Him,
        WAS, I AM      Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast Thou seen Abra-
                       ham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
                       Before Abraham was, I AM. Then took they up stones to
                       cast at Him: but Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the
                       temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed
       John 8:56-59    by."

                           For millenniums those who honored the true God had been
                       looking forward to the promised Messiah, and with earnest
                       longing the devout yearned for His coming. When Jesus came
                       in fulfillment of all that the prophets of old had written con-
                       cerning Him, those of contrite heart and spiritual discernment
                       recognized in Him this Promised One. Spiritual pride prevented
                       others from accepting Him. "He came unto His own, and His
                       own received Him not." John 1:11.
                           Present truth in Christ's day proclaimed Jesus of Nazareth
                       to be the Messiah of prophecy, incarnate. "Jesus is the Christ"
                       was the watchword of the early church (John 20:31; 1 John
                       5:1), their creed and confession of faith.
                           When, during the course of a heated discussion with the
                       leaders of the nation, Jesus referred to Himself by the sacred
                       name "I AM" (Yahweh), thus identifying Himself as the God
                       of the Old Testament, they took up stones intending to kill
                       Him on the spot for what they assumed to be blasphemy. For
                       a mere human being to make the claim would, indeed, have
                       been blasphemy. This, in fact, was one of the charges upon
                       which His enemies based his death warrant. Matt. 26:63-66.
                       Upon another occasion when they took up stones to kill Him,
                        they justified their proposed course of action with the explana-
                        tion "that Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God." John
                       10:33.
                          Account for the crisis that arose when Jesus declared,
                        "Before Abraham was, I AM."

  THINK IT THROUGH         Place yourself in the position of the people of Christ's
                        day. If a person who to all appearances was a human
                        being came claiming to be God, how would you react?
                        What evidence would you be willing to accept for such
                        a claim? What evidence did the people of Christ's day
                        have by which they might reach a decision with respect
                        to His claim?

                          John's title for the last book of Holy Writ is, "The Revela-.
                       tion of Jesus Christ." Rev. 1:1. He begins (verses 4, 5) by
                       ascribing to God the Father three expressions that express His
                       timeless eternity: (1) He "was" in all time and eternity past,
                       He "is" now, and He "is to come," or "will be," in all time
                       and eternity future. (2) He is the "Alpha and Omega"—the
                       "A" and "Z" as we would say—the first and last letters of the
                       Greek alphabet. (3) He is "the beginning and the ending," not
                       in the sense that He ever had a beginning or that He will ever
                       have an end, but in the sense that He existed in all eternity
                       past, before other beings and things, and that none will exist
                       after Him, inasmuch as He will never cease to exist.
                          John closes His revelation of Jesus Christ by ascribing these
                       same attributes to Christ, in a context where it is evident that
                       he refers to Christ. Rev. 22:13, 16.
                          The Greek expression translated "Him which is," literally
                       "the being [One]," is identical with the Septuagint translation
                       of the sacred name "I AM" in Exodus 3:14. Whether John's
                       omission of the timeless triad—is, was, and is to be—when he
                       applies the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, to
                       Christ in chapter 22, was intentional, we do not know. How-
                       ever, it is evident from such passages as John 1:1-3 ; 8:56-59;
                       10:33 and others, that John did, in fact, apply the sacred name
                       reflected in this expression, to Christ. Compare John 20:31.
                          By what expressions does John refer to the timeless,
                       eternal nature of God the Father and of Christ, and what
                       do these expressions tell us about both members of the
                       Trinity?

 THINK IT THROUGH         What if the God I worship were not eternal? What
                       difference does it make to me that He is eternal?
                          Are there any attributes of Deity that belong to one
                       of the members of the heavenly Trio but not to the
                       others?

             Part 4      "Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be
 THE ROCK OF AGES ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud,
                      and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized
                      unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat
                      the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same
                      spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that
      1 Cor. 10:1-4 followed them: and that Rock was Christ."

                           In Deut. 32:4 Moses refers to the God of Israel as "the
                        Rock." A rock aptly represents solidity, strength, endurance,
                        and security. Also, in Israel's wilderness wanderings, a rock
                        was the source of life-giving water. The metaphor "Rock" was
                        thus fraught with meaning and assurance for those who trust
                        in Him.
                            Writing to the Corinthians, Paul explicitly declares that the
                        Rock accompanying the people of Israel in the wilderness was
                        none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. They were under the
                        personal guardianship of the Almighty. In his valedictory
                        address to Israel Moses said of the Lord: "Be strong and of
                        a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them [the nations of
                        Canaan]: for the Lord thy God, He it is that doth go with
                        thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." Deut. 31:6.
                            In particular, Paul alludes to the smitten rock from which
                        streams of water poured forth for the wanderers in a dry,
                        desolate, and weary land. Like Israel of old, it is our privilege
                         to have that spiritual Rock with us as we journey through
                        life.
                           With what appropriate and meaningful figure of
                        speech does the apostle Paul sum up the tender watch-
                        care of the Lord for His people?

  THINK IT THROUGH         To what extent may it be that references to God in
                        the Old Testament focus particularly on the One who
                        later came to earth as the Christ?
                           In what ways can the figure of speech comparing
                        Christ with a mighty rock strengthen and encourage me

            Part 5      "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and
       THE WAY TO the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If
        THE FATHER ye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also:
                     and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.
                     Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it
                     sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long
                     time with you, and yet host thou not known Me, Philip?
                     he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how
        John 14:6-9 sayest thou then, Show us the Father?"

                          Jesus' mission to earth may be summed up by saying that
                       He came to reveal the Father. This Jesus accomplished by the
                       gracious words He spoke, by His tender ministry to the needs
                       of mankind, and above all by His own perfect life of conform-
                       ity to the eternal principles of heaven. He was, in and of
                       Himself, the perfect revelation of the Father. Sin had opened
                       a wide and deep chasm of ignorance and suspicion between
                       God and man; Jesus came to earth to build a bridge by which
                       we might find our way back to God. In fact, He was that
                       bridge. He is the way by which we can return to God, and
                       there is no other; "No man cometh unto the Father, but by
                       Me." Read John 17:3-8.
                          Down through the centuries men have sought to reach
                       heaven by many paths other than the one over which Jesus
                       pioneered the way—by self-righteous living, by philosophy, by
                       a form of religion without its transforming power, by wor-
                       shiping the works of their hands. But, one and all, these are
                       dead-end streets. "Neither is there salvation in any other: for
                        there is none other name under heaven given among men,
                       whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.
                           How did Jesus, on the night that He was betrayed,
                        sum up for the disciples the purpose of His mission to
                        earth?

  THINK IT THROUGH         In what respects is the figurative expression, "the
                        way," an appropriate description of Christ's role as the
                        Saviour of men?
                           May there be more than a passing connection between
                        what Jesus told His disciples in John 14:6-9, and the fact
                        that the early Christians referred to their religion as "the
                        way"? See Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:14.

          Col. 2:6-9 the fullness of the Godhead bodily."

                             Jesus is "the way" in which we are to "walk," that is, to
                          conduct ourselves. Like trees firmly rooted in the soil, we are
                          to be anchored to Him and to gain our nourishment from
                          Him. Read Psalm 1. Like a sturdy building, we are to build
                          and establish ourselves on Him as the foundation of our lives.
                             All that Jesus means to us is anchored to the fact that
                          "In Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." In
                          nature, in character, in divine attributes, in solicitous care for
                          the creatures of His hand, Christ and the Father are one. Christ
                          is God in every sense of the word, and this sublime fact is our
                          assurance and hope.
                             During the early centuries of the Christian Era a number
                          of heresies arose to trouble the church with respect to (1) the
                          nature of Christ as a divine-human being, and (2) His rela-
                          tionship to the other members of the Trinity. Among these
                          heresies were Docetism, Gnosticism, Sabellianism, Monarchian-
                          ism, Arianism, and Nestorianism. In a series of church coun-
                          cils from A.D. 325 at Nicea to A.D. 680 at Constantinople, the
                          church found its way through to the truth that Christ is God
                          in every sense, and that there is one God in three divine Persons.
                             The Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) declared: "We . .
                          confess .    . Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and

                             How shall we understand the repeated statements by
                           Christ while on earth, that of Himself He could do nothing

   WE HAVE FOUND ciples; and looking upon Jesus as He walked, he saith,
       THE MESSIAS Behold the Lamb of God! And the two disciples heard him
                      speak, and they followed Jesus."
                          "One of the two which heard John speak, and fol-
                      lowed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first
                      findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
                      have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
 John 1:35-37, 40-42 Christ. And he brought him to Jesus."

                            Four thousand years had passed since the first promise of
                         a Saviour in the Garden of Eden. Gen. 3:15. For centuries the
                         prophets had foretold His coming, and with earnest desire men
                         and women of contrite hearts yearned for the fulfillment of the
                         promises. Then one day, in the fullness of time, God sent forth
                         His Son into the world (Gal. 4:4), and a voice was heard
                         proclaiming that the Lamb of God had, at long last, appeared.
                            With what joy of heart the devout must have passed the
                         word from lip to lip, "We have found the Messias !" The day
                         of deliverance was at hand. The day for which all Israel hoped
                         had at last dawned. The promised Deliverer had come. Eager
                         expectation took possession of hearts and minds.
                            At the beginning of His ministry Christ was anointed by
                         the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38), thereby receiving Heaven's seal
                         of approval as the One sent by God to be the Saviour of the
                         world. The names "Messiah" and "Christ" thus express the
                         divine commission with which He came to this world.
                             By what meaningful symbols did John the Baptist
                         introduce Jesus to the throng that had come to hear him
                         speak, and how did some in the audience interpret John's
                         announcement when they reported it to their friends?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Why did John introduce Jesus to the listening throng
                         as "the Lamb of God"?
                            If Jesus had come in our time, how might He be in-
                         troduced in a way that would be meaningful to people
                         today, as the titles "Lamb of God" and "Christ" were
                         meaningful to the people of John's day?

                    Joses, and Simon, and Judas? and His sisters, are they
                    not all with us? Whence then hath this Man all these
                    things? And they were offended in Him. But Jesus said
                    unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his
    Matt. 13:54-57 own country, and in his own house."

                           John, Andrew, Simon, Philip, and Nathanael accepted Jesus
                        as the Messiah immediately and without question. With spir-
                        itual insight they saw in Him more than simply another human
                        being like themselves. To be sure, they were far from under-
                        standing all that was involved in Christ's mission to earth, and
                        in fact they had some very mistaken concepts about Him and
                        why He had come. But they did recognize and accept Him at
                        once for what He was, the Messiah.
                           Not so with the people generally, whose spiritual eyesight
                        was dim. Most people were impressed with His gracious words
                        and His miracles. Never before had they listened to such heart-
                        stirring messages, and they recognized in Him a power at work
                        far beyond human ability. But Jesus appeared to be another
                        human being essentially like themselves. They knew about His
                        human ancestry and were personally acquainted with members
                        of His family. "He came unto His own, and His own received
                        Him not." "He was in the world, . . . and the world knew
                        Him not." John 1:11, 10. The prince of this world had blinded
                        them with spiritual myopia; they could not see beyond the
                        material to the spiritual reality behind it.
                            Isaiah had foretold this spiritual blindness. Read Isa. 53:2.
                         Eventually a majority of people "went back, and walked no
                         more with Him"; but a few remained firm in their faith,
                        saying, "We believe and are sure that Thou art that Christ, the
                        Son of the living God." John 6:66, 69.
                            Into what dilemma did Jesus' return to Nazareth
                         plunge the townspeople? With what result?

 THINK IT THROUGH          List a number .of reasons why the people who knew
                        Jesus best were among the first to reject Him.
                           What practical lesson, if any, can I derive from the
                        saying, "A prophet is not without honor, save in his own
                        country"?

  "Toward the close of His ministry in      and healing all that were oppressed by

                      our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
         1 John 1:1-3 Christ."

                            One of the noteworthy aspects of the New Testament record
                         of the life and mission of Jesus is the absolute confidence its
                         writers reflect in Jesus as the promised Messiah and the Son
                         of God. Those closest to Him and best able to judge the validity
                         of the evidence He offered accepted it as conclusive proof of
                         His Messiahship. The last lingering doubt, even on the part
                         of Thomas, was dispelled. This certainty in what they be-
                         lieved gave convincing power to the message the apostles bore
                         as they went out to the world with the gospel story.
                            The evidence John cites is threefold: he had seen, heard,
                         and touched Jesus. He saw the miracles Christ performed, he
                         heard the gracious words of truth Jesus spoke, and by touch
                         he knew Jesus to be a real being and not a phantom, as the
                         Docetists of John's time claimed. John's account of events
                         was that of an eyewitness, and no one could shake his testi-
                         mony. Read also John 6:66-69.
                            What reasons did the apostle John give for his firm
                         conviction that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Son
                         of God?

 THINK IT THROUGH           What, to me, is the strongest evidence that Jesus was
                         what He claimed to be? On what is my faith based?
                            Can I be certain that my faith in Christ and in the Bible
                         as His message to men, is not a gross delusion?




   "In the terrible persecution that fol-    quence the story of the crucified and
lowed, the apostle John did much to          risen Saviour. He steadfastly main-

              Part 4    "We have not followed cunningly devised fables,
          FULFILLED when we made known unto you the power and coming
         PROPHECY of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His
                     majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and
                     glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the
                     excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
                     well pleased. And this voice which came from heaven
                     we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount.
                     We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
                     ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth
                     in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the daystar
     2 Peter 1:16-19 arise in your hearts."

                         Like John (see Part 3), Peter presents himself as an eye-
                      witness of the things he proclaimed concerning Jesus of Naza-
                      reth. He was there; he knew whereof he spoke. Whereas John
                      is content, in his epistle, to make a general statement to this
                      effect, Peter cites the outstanding incident in his association
                      with Christ that proved to him that Christ was divine—the
                      transfiguration on the mount. Read Matt. 17:1-8. With his
                      own eyes Peter had seen the celestial glory that radiated,
                      momentarily, from the person of Christ. With his own ears
                      he had heard the voice from heaven proclaiming Jesus to be
                      the Son of God. This, says Peter, confirmed the words of
                      the prophets of old and proved that the Messianic predictions
                      of the Old Testament had, indeed, met their fulfillment in
                      Christ.
                         To Peter, it was this correspondence between prophecy on
                      the one hand, and its fulfillment in history, on the other, that
                      provided conclusive, incontestable evidence of the Messiahship
                      of Jesus of Nazareth.
                          Sum up Peter's affirmation of faith in Jesus Christ as
                       the Messiah of whom the prophets of old had spoken.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Is the evidence to which Peter points attesting the di-
                       vine origin of Christ as valid and convincing today as it
                       was in New Testament times?
                          Is evidence of Christ's Messiahship that Peter and John
                       did not have available to us today? What is the most con-
                       vincing evidence we can give a doubting world today of

               Part 5       "Then He [Jesus] said unto them, 0 fools, and slow
        CONVINCING of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
           EVIDENCE ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to
                        enter into His glory? And beginning at Moses and all the
                        prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures
                        the things concerning Himself."
                            "And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn
                        within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while
                        He opened to us the Scriptures?"
                            "And He said unto them, . . . All things must be ful-
                        filled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in
                        the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning Me. Then
                        opened He their understanding, that they might under-
                        stand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is writ-
       Luke 24:25-27, ten, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from
           32, 44-46 the dead the third day."

                           How we wish Luke had reported the passages of Scripture
                        to which Jesus pointed the two disciples on the road to Em-
                        maus, in proof that His life and ministry, and especially His
                        recent death and resurrection, were indeed a fulfillment of
                        prophecy! What a Bible reading that would make! Perhaps
                        in the glory land we can ask Jesus for a repeat performance
                        of that Bible study, which led its recipients later to comment
                        to one another, "Did not our heart burn within us, while He
                        talked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the
                        Scriptures?"
                            How did Jesus lift the gloom from the hearts and
                        minds of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and
                        prepare them to understand and appreciate fully the per-

      CONVICTION purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
                      before the world began, but is now made manifest by
                      the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
                      abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality
                      to light through the gospel."

                      that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto
  2 Tim. 1:9, 10, 12 Him against that day."

                          John, Peter, and the other apostles were eyewitnesses to the
                       life and ministry of Jesus, and their conviction that He was
                       all that He claimed to be was absolute. But can others who
                       have not had the privilege of personal association with Jesus
                       be equally convinced? Those who listened to the disciples tell
                       about Christ, and all since then, have had to take the word
                       of the disciples for it.
                          The experience of the apostle Paul in accepting Christ, and
                       his role as the great foreign missionary of New Testament
                       times as well as writer of a major part of the New Testament,
                       prove that a person who is not an eyewitness can be just as
                       certain about the gospel record as the eyewitnesses themselves
                       were. Thus Paul's emphatic declaration, "I know whom I have
                       believed," is fraught with meaning and assurance to us today.

 THINK IT THROUGH         On what basis can I be as sure about Christ and the

      Isa. 7:14; 9:6, 7 justice from henceforth even forever."
                            The essential truth about Jesus Christ is the fact that, in
                         Him, divinity and humanity were united in one person. He
                         was God incarnate. This union was accomplished by providing
                         that a virgin should give birth to the Messiah. His divine
                         nature was in no way diminished by being united with human-
                         ity, nor was His humanity in any way diminished by being
                         united with divinity. The two natures were mysteriously blended
                         in one divine-human Person in such a way that each nature re-
                         tained its identity. Only thus could divinity enter directly into
                         the human experience. Only thus could His life be a perfect
                         example of what God would have us become. His death a

                         tee of eternal life.
                            The virgin birth of the Messiah as a human being with a
                         human mother, and His status as God, were both the subject
                         of prophecy. Both of these sublime facts are likewise attested
                         in the gospel record (Matt. 1:23; Luke 1:31-35) as having oc-
                         curred in the birth of Jesus.
                            At the same time, Christ's divine nature was veiled in His
                         humanity. He was tempted, and He overcame as a man, mak-
                         ing use of no attributes or powers not available to us. He
                         suffered and died as a man. Deity could not be tempted; Deity
                         could not die. But in the intimate association of the divine
                         and the human in Jesus Christ, Deity entered into close fel-
                         lowship with fallen humanity; and in Christ humanity, by
                         power from above, overcame temptation and triumphed over
                         death. Read Phil. 2:5-8; Heb. 2:14, 17; 4:15.
                            What sublime facts about the nature and person of
                         the coming Messiah were foretold by the prophet Isaiah
                         seven centuries before His coming?
 THINK IT THROUGH           Why was it necessary that the Messiah be divine? Why
                         must He also be a human being? By what divine provi-

             Part 2      "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I well
 THE SON OF DAVID raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall
                      reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and jus-
                      tice in the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved, and
                      Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name whereby
       Jer. 23:5, 6 •He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."

                          When He selected David to be king over Israel, the Lord
                       chose "a man after His own heart." 1 Sam. 13:14; Acts 13:22.
                       David made mistakes, some of them grievous indeed, but when
                       called to account for them he manifested a humble, contrite
                       heart and repented of his evil deeds. Read 2 Sam. 11:1 to
                       12:14; Psalm 51. Such a spirit "is in the sight of God of great
                       price" (1 Peter 3:4), and God is able to "dwell . . . with him
                       also that is of a contrite and humble spirit" (Isa. 57:15) de-
                       spite his mistakes. With God the attitude, the spirit, the intent
                       of the heart is more-important than the overt act because, when
                       a man has the right frame of mind and heart, divine power
                       can unite with human effort to transform the life.
                          With such a spirit, David became an able ruler of God's
                       people, despite his mistakes, and thus also a type of the Mes-
                       siah as ruler of all God's people throughout eternal ages. Ac-
                       cordingly, God promised to "stablish the throne of His king-
                       dom forever" (2 Sam. 7:13), a promise yet to meet its complete
                       fulfillment in the eternal reign of Jesus Christ as Lord.
                           What prophecy of Jeremiah is significant with respect
                       to the Messiah in His role as Lord over the people of God?

 THINK IT THROUGH          In what respects was David an appropriate prototype
                       of the Messiah? What connection is there between the
                       Messiah's being a son of David, and His being called

                            The time and place of Messiah's birth were both subjects
                         of prophecy. Micah foretold the place where He was to be
                         born, and Daniel the approximate time. Inasmuch as Messiah
                         was to be known as "the Son of David" and to sit upon the
                         throne of David, it was appropriate that he should be born in
                         Bethlehem, the City of David. But, though Jesus was to be
                         born in Bethlehem, Micah emphatically affirms His eternal
                         preexistence.
                            According to Daniel, Messiah was to appear at the close of
                         "seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks" of years, or
                         sixty-nine weeks of years (69 x 7), or 483 years "from the
                         going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jeru-

                         13), or 457 B.c. Four hundred eighty-three years from 457 B.C.

                         of Daniel in mind when He declared, "The time is fulfilled, and
                         the kingdom of God is at hand." Mark 1:15; compare Gal. 4:4.
                            In what words did the prophets foretell the place and
                         the approximate time when Messiah was to be born and
                         enter upon His ministry?

 THINK IT THROUGH            Why had inspiration specified the time and place of
                         Messiah's birth?
                             Paul declares that Jesus came "in the fullness of the
                         time."
                            In what sense was "the time" "full" when Jesus came
                         the first time?

              Part 4     "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the
     OBJECTIVES OF Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the
    JESUS' MINISTRY meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to
                     proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
                     prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable
                     year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God;
                     to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that
                     mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the
                     oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the
                     spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of
                     righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might
         Isa. 61:1-3 be glorified."

                             Jesus chose this passage of Isaiah as the text for His first
                          recorded sermon, in the synagogue of Nazareth at the begin-
                          ning of His Galilean ministry. After reading it, He announced,
                          "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Luke 4:21.
                          The theme of Jesus' message was, "The kingdom of heaven is
                          at hand" (Matt. 4:17), by which He referred to the kingdom
                          of divine grace in the hearts of men.
                             This was the "good tidings," the good news or gospel, that
                          Jesus brought to all who would listen. He came to proclaim
                          liberty to those whom Satan held captive in the prison house
                          of sin; there was freedom for all who wanted to escape. He
                          came to announce the "acceptable year" of salvation, the day
                          of grace for all who would accept it. Jesus came to bind up
                          those who, upon hearing the gospel, were brokenhearted over
                          their sins, to comfort those who mourned for the wrong they
                          had done, and to plant them as "trees of righteousness" in the
                          garden of divine grace. Compare Psalm 1.
                             In your own words, summarize Isaiah's prediction of
                          the nature of Christ's message and the purpose of His
                          ministry.

 THINK IT THROUGH            To what extent should I endeavor to make the objec-
                          tives of Christ's ministry the objectives of my own life?
                             How can I order my life so that it will follow more
                          closely the pattern of His perfect life of service for others?

Christ, the Messiah-2       LESSON 6                                    ❑    Thursday

               Part 5     "He was wounded for our transgressions, He was
        A VICARIOUS bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace
           SACRIFICE was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. All
                      we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every-
                      one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the
                      iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and He was afflicted,
                      yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb
                      to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is
                      dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. . . . For He was cut
                      off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of
                      my people was He stricken.... Thou shalt make His soul
                      an offering for sin. . . . By His knowledge shall My righ-
                      teous Servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniq-
                      uities. . . . He hath poured out His soul unto death: and
                      He was numbered with the transgressors; and He bare
                      the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgres-
         Isa. 53:5-12 sors."

                           The sublime beauty of Isaiah's word portrait of the suffering
                        Servant of God is a literary as well as a spiritual masterpiece.
                        Read from the preceding chapter Isaiah's introduction (Isa.
                        52:7-15) to the fifty-third chapter. There the Messenger of the
                        Lord bursts upon the scene like a courier arriving in haste with
                        good news—"good tidings" of "peace" and "salvation" (verse
                        7) addressed to all men everywhere (verse 10). He would
                        prosper as God's appointed Ambassador to earth (verse 13),
                        but would also suffer "more than the sons of men" are called
                        upon to suffer (verse 14).
                           Isaiah stresses the vicarious nature of Christ's sacrifice. In
                        one way or another this refrain is repeated again and again
                        in Isaiah 53. See how many times you can find this aspect of
                        Christ's sacrifice mentioned, and note the different forms in
                        which it is expressed.
                           What aspects of Messiah's sufferings and death are
                        graphically portrayed by the prophet Isaiah?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Why was it necessary for the Messiah to die on my
                        behalf? Could God not have devised some other plan?
                        How can it be fair for one person to suffer for another's
                        wrongdoing, and how can God accept Jesus' death in
                        place of the death I ought to die for my sins?
                           What hints can you find in Isaiah 53 of the resurrec-
                        tion and priestly ministry of Christ in heaven after His
                        ascension?



   "Christ was treated as we deserve,       in which we had no share. He suffered
that we might be treated as He de-          the death which was ours, that we
serves. He was condemned for our sins,      might receive the life which was His.
in which He had no share, that we           'With His stripes we are healed.'"—
might be justified by His righteousness,    "The Desire of Ages," page 25.

Christ, the Messiah-2      LESSON 6                                        ❑ Friday


               Part 6   "Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell; neither wilt Thou
  HIS' RESURRECTION suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption."
   AND ASCENSION        "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at My right
     Ps. 16:10; 110:1 hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."
                           The inspired writers of the New Testament have picked up
                        both of these passages from the Psalms and applied them to the
                        resurrection of Christ from the grave, and to His exalted posi-
                        tion in heaven following His ascension. Read Acts 2:25-32;
                        Heb. 1:13. Isaiah foretold that after Messiah's death. He would'
                        "see His seed," that is, "see of the travail of His soul" and
                        "be satisfied" (Isa. 53:10-12). He would "prolong His days,"
                        or live on after death. Having borne the iniquities of His people
                        in His death, He would "justify many" and make "intercession
                        for the transgressors."
                           In the Bible "my soul," as used in Ps. 16:10,. means "me."
                        "Soul" is often substituted for the personal pronoun and is
                        so translated in modern translations such as The Torah, a Jew-
                        ish version issued by the Jewish Publication Society of Amer-
                        ica, that reflects the best contemporary Jewish scholarship. The
                        word "hell" means the grave,, or abode of the dead. Speaking
                        on the Day of Pentecost, Peter placed the words of Ps. 16:10
                        in the mouth of Christ, as a prediction .that He would rise
                        from the dead.
                           The writer of Hebrews (Heb. 1:13) attributes the word's of
                        Ps. 110:1 to God the Father at the enthronement of Christ as
                        High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary. Read Heb. 2:1; 10:20-22.
                           In what cryptic word's does the psalmist foretell the
                        resurrection of our Lord and His exalted position in
                        heaven following the ascension?
 THINK IT THROUGH          How was the assurance that Jesus would not "see cor-
                        ruption" fulfilled in the experience of His death and
                        resurrection?
                           Is Christ's relationship to the Father and to the uni-
                        verse now any different from what it was before the
                        incarnation?




   "The intercession of Christ in man's      into the mysteries of redemption. The

   "Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren,
that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God,
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself hath

                                                      LESSON OUTLINE
  Sin came into the world as a result of       1. God's Concern for Sinners
Adam's transgression, and death as a result       John 3:16, 17
of sin. Read Rom. 5:8-10, 18. Man was
estranged from God, and in his perverted,      2. God With Us
sinful nature had no desire to be reconciled      Matt. 1:21-23
to God. Unless God took an effective ini-
tiative, the separation would be eternal.      3. Justification and Reconciliation
Thus it was that Deity stooped to take on         Rom. 5:8-10, 12, 18
the nature of fallen humanity, in order that
He might effectively represent God to us,      4. Our Great High Priest
and that in His human nature He might             Heb. 2:14, 15, 17, 18
represent our plight to the Father and rec-
oncile us to God. He came to this earth as     5. Jesus Intercedes for Us
God's ambassador of peace to fallen hu-           Heb. 7:24, 25

bassador at the throne of the universe.        6. In Time of Need
                                                  Heb. 4:14-16

                                                                                53

             Part 1      "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-
     GOD'S CONCERN begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should
       FOR SINNERS not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not
                      His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that
       John 3:16, 17 the world through Him might be saved."

                            How fitting that God in His mercy did not abandon the
                         human family to the results of its evil choice! How fitting that
                         deep in the heart of the Creator was a yearning for His erring,
                         earthborn children! How thankful we can be that while "to
                         err is human, to forgive {is] divine."
                            God's love for lost humanity consists in infinite compassion
                         for man and concern for his eternal happiness and well-being.
                         He might properly have sent His Son into the world to con-
                         demn the world for its rebellion, but He did not do so. Justice
                         would have approved of such a course of action, but mercy
                         not so. Though it appeared that all was lost, divine wisdom
                         knew that there was still hope, yes certainty, that some at
                         least might yet be saved. To all the universe, throughout all
                         eternity, the most sublime facet of the divine character is
                         revealed through the plan of salvation—mercy, the supreme
                         demonstration of love. This abiding confidence in the infinite
                         goodness of God will safeguard the universe against the plague
                         of sin ever breaking out again.
                            God provided a way of escape from the death grip of sin,
                         but divine wisdom provided that every man should make his
                         own decision as to whether he would accept the gift of infinite
                         grace. Satan made death inevitable by taking from man the
                         power of choice; Christ made life possible by restoring to man
                         the power to choose between death and life.
                            With what alternatives did the entrance of sin into
                         this world confront God? With what alternative did the
                         entrance of Christ into the world confront lost sinners?

 THINK IT THROUGH            How can God be strictly just, yet merciful at the same
                         time? Is God less just because He has chosen to be merci-
                         ful?
                            In the end, will the eventual exercise of divine justice
                         in any way diminish God's mercy? Are justice and mercy
                         perhaps two facets of the same divine attribute? Which
                         attribute?

              Part 2      "She [Mary] shall bring forth a Son, and thou [Joseph]
      GOD WITH US shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people
                      from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be
                      fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
                      saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall
                      bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,
       Matt. 1:21-23 which being interpreted is, God with us."

                           The names "Jesus" and "Immanuel" express the purpose of
                       the Saviour's mission to earth. "Immanuel" is a transliteration
                       of the Hebrew meaning "God with us." The name "Jesus" is
                       also from the Hebrew, and means "the Lord will save." In the
                       person of Jesus of Nazareth, God came into intimate associa-
                       tion with His people on earth. He was not content to be for-
                       ever estranged from them, but came to make peace. Think of
                       it! The infinite God desires the companionship of beings who
                       have revolted against Him! He came to be with us, to save
                       us from our sins and to qualify us for restoration to the family
                       in heaven.
                           Isaiah's prophecy that a young woman would bear a child
                       (read Isa. 7:14), which originally expressed God's purpose to
                       be with His people Israel in their confrontation with the
                       Syrian hosts, is clothed by the angel who came to Joseph with
                       the higher spiritual significance that, in our confrontation with
                       Satan and the hosts of evil, God came, in the person of Jesus
                       Christ, to be with us and to rescue us from his power. The
                       earlier, historical experience was fulfilled—filled with a fuller
                       meaning—when the Son of God took upon Himself the nature
                       of mankind.
                          What name and what title were given the Saviour by
                       the angel who appeared to Joseph, and how does he
                       explain their meaning?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Why do the Scriptures use so many different names
                       and titles in referring to Christ?
                          How did Jesus, in His person, life, and ministry, im-
                       part to various incidents and statements of the Old Testa-

   RECONCILIATION being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from
                       wrath through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we
                       were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much
                       more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
                          "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
                       and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for
                       that all have sinned."
                          "Even so by the righteousness of One the free gift
 Rom. 5: 8-10, 12, 18 came upon all men unto justification of life."

                           Paul argues the justice of God in accepting the death of
                       one person—Jesus Christ—on behalf of the entire human race,
                       on the basis that the entire race had fallen into sin as the result
                       of the wrong choice of one other person, Adam. If all men
                       could become sinners as a result of Adam's sin, then it is
                       right and proper that all men can become righteous through
                       the gift of divine grace in the person of Jesus Christ. "God
                       commendeth his love toward us, . . . while we were yet sin-
                       ners," by sending Christ to die for us.
                           If Christ died for us while we were still enemies of God,
                       with no desire to be reconciled to God, surely, having been
                       reconciled to God by that infinite sacrifice, we can with all
                       confidence believe that He will rescue us from death, which
                       is the result of sin.
                           As a result of Adam's sin all men inherited a sinful nature.
                       But by their own choice this sinful nature has involved all men
                       in sin.
                          In your own words, summarize Paul's argument about
                       the justice of God in granting divine amnesty to all re-
                       pentant sinners.

 THINK IT THROUGH         What is the difference, if any, between      r cil
                       and justification? Does one precede the other, or are they
                       simultaneous?
                          What evidence do I have that I, personally, have been
                       reconciled to God?
                          How does Christ's death on the cross reconcile us to

Christ, Our Mediator       LESSON 7                                  ❑ Wednesday

              Part 4       "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh
        OUR GREAT and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same;
        HIGH PRIEST that through death He might destroy him that had the
                       power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who
                       through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to
                       bondage."
                           "Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made
                       like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and
                       faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make
                       reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that He
                       Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to suc-
Heb. 2:14, 15, 17, 18 cor them that are tempted."

                           By taking upon Himself humanity, the Son of God identified
                        with the human race. For the duration of His mission to earth
                        He laid aside the prerogatives of Deity (Phil. 2:5-8) ; He "emp-
                        tied himself," as the Greek of Phil. 2:7 reads literally, and
                        came to live as a man, with a human body, a human nature,
                        and human frailties and limitations. In His confrontations with
                        the tempter He relied on the same help from above that is
                        available to us. He never performed a miracle to benefit Him-
                        self. There was no make-believe about His struggle with the
                        enemy ; He was tempted, and He suffered as He struggled
                        against His wily foe.
                           The Saviour chose to meet the tempter as we must meet
                        him, in order that He might be able to help us when we are
                        tempted. Now, as a merciful and faithful High Priest, He is
                        our representative before God, in order that He may recon-
                        cile us to God. He was made like us in all things, in order
                        that He might become our representative, in all things, before
                        the Father.
                            In what ways did Jesus identify Himself with human-
                        ity? Why?
 THINK IT THROUGH           Knowing all things, why could the Son of God not have
                         become "a merciful and faithful High Priest" and "make
                         reconciliation for the sins of the people" without a per-
                         sonal encounter with temptation?
                            Did Jesus meet temptation in His divine nature or in
                         His human nature?

             Part 5      "But this Man [Jesus], because He continueth ever,
  JESUS INTERCEDES hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore He is able
           FOR US also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
      Heb. 7:24, 25 Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them."

                           The writer of the book of Hebrews has been comparing the
                        priesthood of Christ with that of the ancient Levitical system.
                        Writing to the Hebrew people, who understood and esteemed
                        the Levitical system and priesthood, he sought to create in
                        their minds an understanding and appreciation of the infinite
                        superiority of Christ's priesthood and a desire for participation
                        in its benefits. The great advantage of Christ's priesthood, he
                        says, is its permanence and reliability. "By reason of death,"
                        the Levitical priests were prevented from continuing their
                        ministry. In contrast, Jesus "ever liveth to make intercession"
                        for all who "come unto God by Him." He is always accessible
                        when we need Him, and He is able to save "to the uttermost."
                           Human language reflects eternal realities imperfectly at best.
                        The word "intercession" may seem to imply that God the
                        Father is not kindly disposed toward us (compare John 3:16),
                        and that were it not for Jesus' persuasiveness He would deal
                        harshly with us, as we deserve. Not so. Sin separated the human
                        family from God, for sin cannot live in the sight of a holy
                        God. But God, who loves us with an everlasting love, does not
                        need to be reconciled to us; we stand in need of being recon-
                        ciled to Him.
                            Point out two great benefits that are ours through the
                         priestly ministry of Jesus Christ.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Whether in the ancient Levitical system or in Christ's
                         ministry on our behalf, why is a priest necessary? Why
                         can we not each one be his own priest before God?




   "Christ as High Priest within the veil   his lawful territory, and by His won-
so immortalized Calvary, that though        derful work in giving His life, He re-
He liveth unto God, He dies continually     stored the whole race of men to favor

   IN TIME OF NEED is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
                    hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest
                    which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmi-
                    ties; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
                    without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne
                    of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
       Heb. 4:14-16 help in time of need."

                           We have no reason for hesitation in approaching the throne
                        of grace. Those who fall into sin and are sorry need sym-
                        pathetic understanding, and the writer of the book of Hebrews
                        here assures all who read that they need have no fear of a
                        cold, harsh, severe reception when they return to God. Jesus
                        is "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" because He
                        knows from personal experience what it is to be tempted.
                           Furthermore, there is no point on which we can be tempted
                        that He did not experience, and no sin into which we may fall
                        for which His experience and sympathetic understanding are
                        inadequate. When we have sinned—literally, fallen short of
                        the mark at which we are aiming—we need forgiveness first
                        of all. But we also need strength and courage to go and "sin no
                        more," that is, to overcome next time where we fell short this
                        time. Read John 5:14.
                           As our High Priest, Christ provides for both of these needs:
                        (1) "We may obtain mercy," or forgiveness for our sins, and
                        (2) we may "find grace to help in time of need," that is, the
                        grace of Christ to enable us to overcome as He overcame. It is
                        the Saviour's purpose not only to forgive us our sins when
                        we confess them, but "to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,"
                        includin g the natural tendencies and weaknesses that lead us
                        into sin when we are tempted. 1 John 1:9.
                            What two great benefits may be ours when we come
                        to the throne of divine grace?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Is there any temptation I have to meet that Christ did
                        not have to meet when on earth?
                            What does it mean to "hold fast our profession"? How
                        is this related to the invitation to come to the throne of
                        grace?

             Part 1     "I am that Bread of Life. Your fathers did eat manna
  THE BREAD OF LIFE in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which
                    cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
                    and not die. I am the living Bread which came down
                    from heaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live
                    forever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which
       John 6:48-51 I will give for the life of the world."

                           Christ addressed these words to people who, the day before,
                        had been among the five thousand He fed miraculously and
                        who had then been ready to acclaim Him as the Messiah and
                        crown Him King of Israel. Read verses 14, 15, 22. They con-
                        ceived of Him as a political Messiah, however, and intended
                        to make Him their leader in overthrowing the Roman power
                        and liberating their nation.
                           In providing the throng with literal food, Jesus had been
                        ministering to a genuine human need. The people had come
                        from a distance to hear Him speak. They were hungry, and
                        there was nothing to eat. By this miracle Jesus sought to direct
                        their minds to the spiritual food He was offering them. Spiri-
                        tually, they were far from their Father's home, and their
                        vaguely felt spiritual hunger made them eager for the spiritual
                        food with which He provided them that day.
                           Both the literal food and the spiritual fare were from His
                        Father's table. Jesus gave them a taste of both, in the hope
                        that their desire for more would lead them back from the far
                        country, in which they were largely unmindful of spiritual
                        things, to their Father's home where there was plenty.
                             By what practical illustration did Jesus explain the
                         purpose of His mission to earth? To what two advantage;
                         of this did Jesus point their minds?

  THINK IT THROUGH          Why did Jesus, at this point in His discourse, refer to
                         the manna in the wilderness?
                            What similarities and differences are there between
                         the manna and the food with which Jesus had provided
                         them, and the spiritual food He sought to give them?
                            In what sense is Jesus' "flesh" the "bread" He offered
                         the people?

Christ: Servant of Man's Necessity         LESSON 8                      ❑ Monday


            Part 2      "When Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the sick of
     SINS FORGIVEN the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. But there were
                     certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their
                     hearts, Why doth this Man thus speak blasphemies? who
                     can forgive sins but God only? And immediately when
                     Jesus perceived in His spirit that they so reasoned within
                     themselves, He said unto them, Why reason ye these
                     things in your hearts? Whether is it easier to say to the
                     sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say,
                     Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? But that ye may
                     know that the Son of man hath power on earth to for-
                     give sins, (He saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say unto
                     thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into
        Mark 2:5-11 thine house."

                          Man needs not only food to sustain life, but physical heal-
                       ing as well, for disease often fastens upon him. The same is true
                       of man's spiritual life. He needs healing from the wounds
                       sin has inflicted, and from the virus of sin that infects his
                       life. As Jesus taught a spiritual lesson from the physical food
                       with which He had provided them (Part 1), He now draws
                       a lesson from the act of physical healing He is about to per-
                       form.
                          Only God can forgive sins. Had Jesus been merely a man,
                       the unspoken complaint of the scribes would have been justified.
                       He would have been guilty of blasphemy. But, because Jesus
                       was divine as well as human, He had the right and the power,
                       even on earth, to forgive men their sins. Read John 1:29;
                       1 John 1:7. The refusal of the scribes to recognize Jesus as
                       divine prompted the suggestion that His forgiving of sins was
                       an act of blasphemy.
                           In what incident, and by what means, did Jesus dem-
                        onstrate the nature of sin and forgiveness?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Read once more Mark's account of the healing of the
                        paralyzed man let down through the roof, looking for
                        points in the man's illness and his healing that illustrate
                        the nature of sin and Heaven's provision for release
                        from it.
                           What point in the narrative helps you most to under-
                        stand your relationship to God, and how to relate to sin
                        and divine forgiveness in your own life?

             Part 3        "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of
  MIRACLES ATTEST       His disciples, which are not written in this book: but these

                        the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
      John 20:30, 31    through His name."

                           Each of Jesus' miracles was His response to a real, imme-
                        diate human need. He never performed a miracle just to prove
                        that He could do so; and when Herod asked for one to satisfy
                        his curiosity, Jesus refused—even though this would, presum-
                        ably, have procured His release and averted His crucifixion.
                        Luke 23:8, 9. When asked for a "sign" (a miracle), which Jesus'
                        critics presumably offered to accept as evidence of His Messiah-
                        ship and of His authority for deeds such as the cleansing of
                        the temple, Jesus refused. Read Matt. 12:38, 39; John 2:18;
                        6:30, 31; Mark 8:11, 12.
                           Jesus' miracles were also a means of teaching spiritual truth.
                        For instance, the miracle of the loaves and the fishes taught a
                        lesson about spiritual food, particularly about Jesus Himself
                        as the Bread of Life. By the healing of the paralyzed man let
                        down through the roof, Jesus illustrated spiritual restoration.
                        By healing the man born blind, He taught the importance of
                        spiritual eyesight.
                           Most important of all, the miracles attested Jesus' Messiah-
                        ship and affixed to His message and mission the approval of
                        Heaven. He called on His disciples to believe Him "for the
                        very works' sake." Read John 14:10, 11. On the Day of Pente-
                        cost, Peter declared that Jesus was "approved of God among
                        you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by Him
                        in the midst of you." Acts 2:22.
                            How does John state Jesus' purpose in the many
                         miracles He performed?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Would the world be impressed by miracles today as
                         the people of Jesus' day were?
                            Should we expect miracles today? Under what circum-
                         stances and conditions might we expect God to work in
                         extraordinary ways?

                            In what words did Jesus set forth the voluntary nature

              Part 5       "The bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will
MANY REJECT JESUS give for the life of the world. The Jews therefore strove
                       among themselves, saying, How can this Man give us His
                       flesh to eat?"
                           "Many therefore of His disciples, when they had heard
                       this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?"
                           "From that time many of His disciples went back, and
John 6:51, 52, 60, 66 walked no more with Him."

                          At Jacob's well the year before, Jesus had presented salva-
                       tion as "living water" (John 4:10-14) ; now He refers to Him-
                       self as "living bread." As water and bread sustain the natural,
                       physical life, so Christ imparts and sustains the supernatural,
                       spiritual life. The former is temporal and must be continually
                       replenished, whereas the latter is permanent and results in
                       everlasting life. Read John 4:14; 6:51, 58.
                          Upon this occasion Jesus foreshadowed His death a year
                       later. The throng, which the day before had been ready to
                       crown Him King of Israel for salvation from the Romans (John
                       6:14, 15), began to realize that the salvation He offered was
                       personal salvation from the power of evil, and they refused
                       this living bread. Like Nicodemus dodging the import of
                       Christ's affirmation concerning the new birth, they professed
                       to take Christ's metaphor literally in order to make it appear
                       absurd. With this excuse the Galileans now rejected Christ, and
                       He terminated His Galilean ministry.
                          What excuses did the majority of the people who
                       heard Jesus' sermon on the Bread of Life give for their
                       refusal to accept it?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Do you think the people really understood what Jesus
                       meant about the living bread, and made an informed and
                       therefore responsible decision?
                          In what other ways is it possible to refuse the living
                       bread? Are there trends in my life that could eventually
                       result in my rejecting it?

Christ: Servant of Man's Necessity         LESSON 8                       ❑ Friday

             Part 6      "Then said Jesus unto the Twelve, Will ye also go
        THERE IS NO    away? Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom
       ALTERNATIVE     shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And
                       we believe and are sure that Thou art that Christ, the
       John 6:67-69    Son of the living God."

                          To the vast majority of those who had partaken of the
                       miraculous bread, and who the following day listened to His
                       sermon on the bread of life, it appeared unattractive; they
                       would have none of it. The rejection appeared to be unani-
                       mous. Only the Twelve, seemingly, were left. Would they
                       follow the crowd? Jesus placed the question to them directly,
                       in order to strengthen their faith.
                          Speaking for his fellow disciples, Peter asked in reply, "To
                       whom shall we go?" They realized that there was no real
                       alternative. A year later Peter and John declared, "Neither is
                       there salvation in any other: for there is none other name
                       under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
                       Acts 4:12.
                           Even though, like the twelve disciples, we may have been
                        following Christ for years, we shall do well to face up to this
                        question. To whom shall we go today? Is there anything else
                        worth living for? Are we accepting, and partaking of, the living
                        bread from heaven, or are we, in effect though perhaps not
                        directly, turning away from it?
                           Weigh carefully Peter's response to Jesus' searching
                        question. What understanding of Jesus' mission to earth
                        does this question, and Peter's own answer to it, reflect?

  THINK IT THROUGH         What experiences during his two and a half years
                        with Christ do you think prepared Peter to respond as he
                        did? How would you have responded had you been in
                        his place, and what reasons would you give for your
                        response, if asked?
                            To whom, or to what, would you turn as an alternative
                        to your faith in Christ?

                        itually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind
                        is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of
                        God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the
                        flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but
                        in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
                        Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
                        of His."
                            "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are
       Rom. 8:5-9, 14 the sons of God."

                           In Paul's writings "the flesh" includes all of the evil, natural
                        tendencies of human nature. Read Rom. 13:14; Gal. 5:16-24.
                        Though sins of intellect and pride are as heinous in God's sight
                        as any others, so many of what appear to men to be the grosser
                        sins are related to material things and to the physicSI nature.
                           With Paul, "the Spirit" is the opposite of "the flesh." To
                        be "in the flesh" or "after the flesh" is to let natural inclination
                        determine one's choices, whereas to be "in the Spirit" or "after
                        the Spirit" is to be governed by the principles of heaven. By
                        "the carnal mind" Paul means the natural desires and motives
                        of the unregenerate heart. Only those, he says, who have opened
                        their hearts and minds to the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ
                        are able to resist the temptations of the evil one; and those in
                        whom this experience has become a living reality God acknowl-
                        edges as His sons.
                           How does Paul describe the differences between a life
                         motivated by a desire to cooperate with God's will, and
                         one motivated by natural inclination?

 THINK IT THROUGH            Does a candid examination of my own motives and
                         conduct over the past week reveal any traces of "the
                         flesh," in the sense that Paul uses the expression?
                             Conversely, can I recall any specific instances in which
                         I chose to follow the leading of the Spirit of God instead
                         of following inclination in the opposite direction?

Christ: Transformer of Men         LESSON 9                                ❑ Monday


            Part 2     "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
   A TRANSFORMED God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
            MIND acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
                    And be not conformed to this world: but be ye trans-
                    formed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
                    what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of
       Rom. 12:1, 2 God."

                           The two great alternatives of life are: (1) to be "conformed
                        to this- world" by modeling one's life and conduct after the
                        pattern provided by those who live exclusively for this world
                        and what it has to offer, or (2) to be "transformed" by having
                        one's desires and motives altered to be in harmony with the
                        principles of heaven. There is no middle ground. A person is
                        in either one category or the other.
                           Our English word "metamorphosis," which is derived from
                        the same Greek word here translated "transformed," denotes
                        a basic, fundamental change in nature. This change is well illus-
                        trated in the metamorphosis of the butterfly through the stages
                        of caterpillar, pupa, and adult insect. No stage resembles any
                        of the others. At each change there is a complete metamorpho-
                        sis. When transformed by the grace of Christ, the life from that
                        point forward—despite mistakes—is oriented heavenward, the
                        exact opposite of what it was before.
                           This transformation, says Paul, comes about as the result
                        of God's mercy and of the human act here described as present-
                        ing oneself as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.
                           This sacrifice is made by an act of the will inviting the divine
                        Spirit to take complete and permanent control of the mind, the
                        affections, and the life. Thereupon the Spirit goes to work—
                        silently, persistently, continuously—to remold a person's de-
                        sires, motives, thoughts, words, and actions to correspond to
                        God's will. The goal is a life morally in God's image, after His
                        likeness, as in the beginning.
                            How is the fundamental change by which a person's
                        life is reoriented heavenward accomplished? Point out
                        four steps in this process.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Does the experience described in Rom. 12:1, 2 take
                        place instantaneously, or is it a process covering a long
                        period of time?
                           According to this passage of Scripture, what is the key
                        to a changed life? Do I have this key in my possession?

              Part 3        "Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except
            BORN OF a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
           THE SPIRIT into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh
                        is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Mar-
                        vel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The
                        wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
                        thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither
           John 3:5-8 it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit."

                             In conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus described the change
                         from being "in the flesh" to being "in the spirit" as a rebirth.
                         As there can be no physical life without birth, so there can be
                         no spiritual life without spiritual birth. As physical birth is the
                         beginning of physical life, so spiritual birth is the beginning of
                         spiritual life. Read John 1:12, 13 for John's further explana-
                         tion of this process, noting the steps and the means by which
                         it is accomplished.
                             As physical birth results in children that resemble their par-
                         ents, so to be born by the Spirit of God will result in children
                         who resemble their heavenly Father, whose wills are in harmony
                         with His. In a later conversation with the Pharisees, Jesus
                         charged them with being children of the devil because they
                         resembled him. See John 8:39, 44. If, as they claimed, they
                         were "Abraham's children," they "would do the works of
                         Abraham." Even so today, a person's moral profile is a sure
                         index to his spiritual ancestry.
                            What truths with respect to conversion did Jesus set
                         forth in His conversation with Nicodemus?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Why do you suppose Jesus discussed conversion in
                         terms of childbirth, rather than in the more abstract,
                         philosophical language with which Nicodemus was fa-

                         conversion is taught by Jesus' illustration of the wind?

              Part 4      "Put off concerning the former conversation the old
      THE NEW MAN man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
                       and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye
                       put on the new man, which after God is created in righ-
                       teousness and true holiness."
                          "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby
     Eph. 4:22-24, 30 ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."

                           The person who has been "born again" is altogether different
                        from what he was before, so different in fact that those who
                        know him best would not even recognize him from his manner
                        of speaking and acting. It is a matter of "off with the old and
                        on with the new"—as a person would cast aside a threadbare
                        garment for one that is new, attractive, and becoming.
                           In the English language in the days when the King James
                        Version was translated—the days just after Queen Elizabeth I
                        and William Shakespeare—the word "conversation" meant
                        "conduct" or "way of life." It is one's conduct, or way of life,
                        that determines whether the inner change to the garment of
                        Christ's righteousness has taken place. If there is no change in
                        the conduct, it is evident to all that there has been no true
                        change of mind and heart. Conversely, a changed life is proof
                        positive that the inner change has, indeed, taken place.
                           As we have seen (Part 2), the Spirit of God is at work in
                        the life of the person who exchanges the old way of life for
                        the new. But if, in desire and persistently in action, we cling
                        to the old, we grieve the Spirit of God and thereby prevent
                        Him from making the change.
                           How does Paul describe the "old" or unconverted man,
                        and the "new" or converted man?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Is the change of which Paul here speaks from the old
                        to the new instantaneous? In what aspects may it re-
                        quire more time? At what point in life is the process
                        complete?
                            How much of the old, shabby way of life have I re-
                        tained in my spiritual wardrobe for use when I may be
                        disposed to revert to it?
                           What does it mean to be "sealed unto the day of re-

                       ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the

     John 15:4, 5, 8 fruit; so shall ye be My disciples."

                           Paul warns against hindering the work of the Holy Spirit
                        in effecting a transformation of the life to conformity with
                        God's perfect will. Eph. 4:30. Christ here deals with the positive
                        aspect of the process of Christian transformation, under the
                        illustration of a branch remaining attached to the grapevine
                        out of which it grew and of which it is part. Everything de-
                        pends on maintaining that vital connection, or it will wither
                        and die. Unless a branch is nourished by the life-giving sub-
                        stances the vine provides, it is lifeless and fruitless.
                           The objective of the vinedresser in tending his vines is fruit;
                        the objective of Christ's solicitous care for us is the fruit of a
                        character that will be an honor to Him as Owner of the vine-
                        yard. It is the purpose of the heavenly Vinedresser to demon-
                        strate that His vines and His method of care are superior in
                        every way to all other vine stock and methods of culture. Under
                        His care every branch will produce prizewinning clusters of
                        grapes for exhibition on the great day of eternal awards.
                           In His metaphor making Himself the vine and His
                        disciples the branches, what aspects of the branch-vine
                        relationship does Christ specifically mention?

 THINK IT THROUGH           Mention at least three ways in which the vine con-
                        tributes to the ability of the branches to bear choice fruit.
                            How does a person "abide" in Christ? How can I tell
                        whether I am abiding in Christ?

 INDWELLING CHRIST live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who
                       loved me, and gave Himself for me."
                          "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffer-
                       ing, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:
  Gal. 2:20; 5:22, 23 against such there is no law."

                            In this description of his personal experience as a Christian,
                         Paul's thoughts, and the words in which he expressed them, soar
                         into the stratosphere of human experience. It all began when
                         Paul chose to follow his Master's footsteps all the way to the
                         cross. The apostle develops this aspect of Christian experience
                         more fully in the sixth chapter of Romans. Read especially
                         verses 3-11.
                             In the natural course of events nothing can be more final
                         than death. The same is true of the person who, in spirit and
                         in truth, yields mind and heart to the transforming power of
                         God's Spirit. He burns all bridges behind him. He does not
                         look back with wistful longing at the spiritual Sodom he has
                         left behind. His death to the old way of life is final, complete,
                         and all-pervasive.
                             Death does not occur so long as there is a spark of life—so
                          long as the least desire for the world and the flesh remains—and
                          unless death occurs there can be no resurrection. But when
                          death to the old does take place, the resurrection of which Paul
                          speaks is sure and certain, and the fruits of the Spirit are sure
                          to follow.
                            How is Christ's death, burial, and resurrection re-
                         peated in the experience of the Christian? In what ways
                         does the experience of the born-again Christian resemble
                         the resurrected Christ?

  THINK IT THROUGH          What does it mean to "live by the faith of the Son of
                         God"? Does this mean the same kind of faith He had,
                         or does it mean my faith in Him?
                            Spend a few moments inspecting the fruits of the
                         Spirit in your life, one by one checking over the nine
                         Paul specifically mentions. Which of the nine are already
                         ripe? Which are still small, hard, and green?
                            Which of your friends best represent the mature fruit

            Part 1       "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
     BLINDED MINDS in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds
                      of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
                      gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine
                      unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus
                      the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
                      For God, who commanded the light to shine out of dark-
                      ness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
                      knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
                      But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
        2 Cor. 4:3-7 excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."

                             The Creator's first act in preparing this world as a suitable
                          habitation for man was to command physical light to shine
                          forth and dispel the darkness that shrouded our planet. Read
                          Gen. 1:3-5. In like manner our hearts were spiritually dark, in
                          ignorance of the true character of God and His infinite purpose
                          for us. Compare Isa. 9:2. But Jesus brought the light of heaven
                          into this spiritually dark world; He was "the true Light, which
                          lighteth every man that cometh into the world." John 1:4-9.
                             The prince of darkness blinded the minds of those who
                          chose not to receive the true light, but closed their minds to
                          its saving rays. To reject truth is to choose darkness, and the
                          result is blindness of mind, heart, and soul. Jesus restored sight
                          to the blind and spiritual sight to their souls. He would per-
                          form this miracle for us today.
                              What two factors does Paul point out as contributing
                          to spiritual blindness? Conversely, what can restore spir-
                          itual sight? What is the real cause of spiritual blindness?

 THINK IT THROUGH             Which is the preferable state to be in—ignorant blind-
                          ness or willful blindness? Why?
                             Am I in danger of spiritual blindness? How does my
                          attitude toward truth affect my spiritual sight?

                      And then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord
                      shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall
                      destroy with the brightness of" His coming: even him,
                      whose coming is after the working of Satan with all
                      power and signs and lying wonders, and with all de-
                      ceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; be-
                      cause they received not the love of the truth, that they
                      might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them
                      strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they
                      all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
     2 Thess. 2:7-12 had pleasure in unrighteousness."

                          In words that cannot be misunderstood the apostle Paul
                       points out the basic cause of spiritual blindness on the part of
                       those who have had an opportunity to gain spiritual sight:
                       "They received not the love of the truth." The attitude we
                       take toward revealed truth is the crux of the matter. Do we
                       love truth wherever we encounter it, or do we resent it and
                       reject it because it reveals our imperfections and would require
                       us to change our beliefs and practices? There is no room in
                       heaven for those who do not love truth.
                          God does not force anyone to accept truth. But in resenting
                       or rejecting truth a man deliberately chooses to believe a lie.
                       The "strong delusion" God sends, or permits to come, upon
                       those who deliberately inflict spiritual blindness upon them-
                       selves, is to abandon them to their chosen attitude and fate.
                       This fate came upon literal Israel when God said, "Ephraim
                       is joined to idols: let him alone." Hosea 4:17. The same truth
                       is expressed in Ephesians 4:30, in the form of a warning against
                       grieving the Holy Spirit.
                           What is the role of the individual in coming to the
                        place where he stands eternally condemned in God's
                        sight? The role of Satan? The role of God?

  THINK IT THROUGH         Why does Satan rely on "signs and lying wonders" in
                        leading men astray?
                            In what way would Satan be most likely to succeed in
                        inflicting spiritual blindness upon me? Upon the church
                        today?

              Part 3      "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
     TEST THE SPIRITS whether they are of God: because many false prophets
                      are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit
                      of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is
                      come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that con-
                      fesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
                      of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye
                      have heard that it should come; and even now already
                      is it in the world."
                          "We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us;
                      he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the
      1 John 4:1-3, 6 spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."

                             No man will be condemned because he honestly believes
                         error, but for a knowing rejection of truth or for carelessly
                         failing to accept it. The difference between truth and error
                         is the difference between life and death, and, having equipped
                         every intelligent being with the ability to discriminate be-
                         tween truth and error, God requires that the faculties of the
                         intellect be used to seek truth, to incorporate it into one's store
                         of knowledge, and to apply it in making the decisions of life.
                             A sincere desire for truth is essential to the acquisition and
                         recognition of truth. A man is not likely to find that which
                         he is not looking for, or may, indeed, be trying to avoid.
                         Nothing so effectively blinds a man to truth as a distaste for
                         it because it is uncongenial or unwelcome.
                             In John's day the great issue between truth and error cen-
                         tered in the question as to whether Jesus Christ was truly God
                         incarnate in humanity. The Docetists claimed that He ap-
                         peared to be a man but was, in reality, only a phantom and
                         not truly human. Thus in John's day present truth centered in
                         recognition of the sublime fact that true humanity and true
                         divinity were united in the one person Jesus Christ.
                            What factors are essential in discriminating between
                         truth and error?

 THINK IT THROUGH            To what facets of truth might John have pointed had
                         he been writing to Christians today?
                             What difference does it make to me that "Jesus Christ
                         is come in the flesh," that He is truly man as well as truly
                         God? What difference does it make whether a man be-
                         lieves this or not?

   "In these days of peril we are not         deceived; for the Word of God gives
to accept everything that men bring to        us a test whereby we may know what
us as truth. As professed teachers from       is truth. The prophet says, 'To the law

              Part 4     "He saith unto them, But-whom say ye that I am? And
         PERSONAL Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
       CONVICTION Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto
                      him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: for flesh and blood
                      hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father which is in
                      heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and
                      upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of
                      hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto
                      thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever
                      thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and
                      whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
      Matt. 16:15-19 heaven."

                          John declared that Jesus Christ was truly a human being as
                       well as truly God. Confidently he wrote, "We are of God: he
                       that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth
                       not us." John and the other disciples knew personally that this
                       was true. Lesson 5. How could they be so sure?
                          In the passage here quoted, Matthew goes back to the origi-
                       nal confession of faith that Jesus of Nazareth was "the Son of
                       the living God." Upon that occasion Jesus immediately pointed
                       out to Simon Peter, spokesman for the group, that this great
                       central truth of the Christian faith could not be attained through
                       intellectual processes alone. It must come as a conviction in the
                       heart and mind that the evidence provides conclusive proof
                       that Jesus is the Messiah foretold by the prophets of old, and
                       moreover that He is the Son of God.
                          "Blessed"—happy—said Jesus, is the person who believes
                       this truth. True happiness in life comes through accepting it.
                          How can a person know with absolute certainty the
                       truth about Jesus Christ?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Upon what does my personal belief that Jesus Christ
                       is the Messiah and Son of God rest? Am I sure of this?
                       How can I be sure?
                           Do I have the joy of which Jesus spoke, the joy that
                       comes with the knowledge of who Jesus is and what He
                       can do for me?

                         its highest in perceiving this truth, which must come as a reve-
                         lation from God. Human reasoning about God is a precarious
                         compound of truth and error, and "the commandments of men"
                         —human requirements—are unacceptable to God as a valid
                         basis of worshiping Him. The traditions of men have always
                         been, and always will be, opposed to the truth God has re-
                         vealed about Himself.
                            The pretense of honoring God with one's lips is worthless
                         when a person's heart is far from God. Here Jesus emphasizes
                         the same truth expressed by Paul (Part 2), that the crucial
                         factor in knowing truth is to love it—to desire it, to accept it
                         with joy, and to cherish it. Not along with human traditions
                         and commandments, but exclusively and single-heartedly.
                            Here Jesus declares that true religion does not consist in
                         forms and regulations, but in accepting divine revelation. This
                         is especially true with respect to man-devised forms and regu-
                         lations that tend to obscure truth rather than make it mani-
                         fest. Man-devised commandments and traditions tend to exalt
                         man and to lead him to forget God or to minimize what God
                         has explicitly enjoined.
                             In what forceful language did Jesus distinguish be-
                         tween true and false religion?

                         to enter?

                            "Jesus saith unto him [Thomas], I am the way, the
                        truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but
                        by Me."
                            "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee
                        the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast
      John 8:31, 32;    sent."
      14:6; 17:3, 17        "Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy Word is truth."

                           Jesus not only came to reveal the great ultimate truth about
                        God and His infinite purpose for man; He was ultimate truth
                        incarnate—in action, lived out so that men of all time can see
                        it—not in theory but in practice. In such discourses as the
                        Sermon on the Mount He presented the theory also and placed
                        it on record in Scripture to accompany the demonstration of
                        truth He gave us in His perfect life.
                           The theory and practice of truth revealed by Jesus Christ
                        liberates fallen men and women from the bonds of ignorance
                        about God and from the shackles of their own sinful nature
                        and Satan's, power over their lives. Without this knowledge
                        and this power men are bound to collect the wages of sin and
                        the sinful nature that binds them. But by receiving Jesus Christ
                        as the infinite revelation of divine truth, and by believing that
                        He is the truth, they receive also "power to become the sons
                        of God." John 1:12. Sanctifying power liberates men from
                        the kingdom of error and death and opens to them the gates
                        of eternal truth and eternal life.

              Part 1     "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
     UNIVERSAL NEED being justified freely by His grace through the redemp-
                      tion that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to
                      be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His
                      righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
        Rom. 3:23-25 through the forbearance of God."

                           Deeply embedded in everyone's heart—unless and until it
                        is suppressed—is the awareness that he ought to be a better
                        person than he is. He is ashamed of himself for selfish and mean
                        words and acts, for doing to others as he would not want them
                        to do to him. Often his associates are more aware of his short-
                        comings than he is, and those who do not have a personal
                        interest in him may react negatively to him. If despite our
                        personal limitations we are thus aware of our own imperfec-
                        tions, how must others see us! How we need to see ourselves
                        as others see us and, most important of all, as God sees us!
                           Even the most nearly perfect man on earth, one who is hon-
                        ored and respected by all of his associates and especially by
                        those who know him best, is imperfect and in need of salva-
                        tion. Unless he avails himself of God's mercy, his very best
                        falls short of perfection. A gloomy prospect indeed ! But the
                        apostle hastens on to brighten the dark picture: All have
                        sinned, to be sure, but all can be made just by God's free grace,
                        which is available to us through Christ Jesus! Divine forbear-
                        ance is infinite, even as divine justice is infinite.
                            To what universal condition of the human race does
                         Paul point, and to what universal provision to meet that
                         need? What is necessary on our part?

 THINK IT THROUGH          In what major respects have I come short of the glory
                        of God during the past twenty-four hours? What is the
                        "glory of God," in this sense?
                           How can I know whether the experience of justifica-
                        tion has taken place in my life? Is it possible to retain
                        the status of justification if I fall into temptation again?
                        Under what circumstances will I forfeit this status before

             Part 2     "Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will
   ULTIMATE VALUES come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his
                     cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life
                     shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake
                     shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain
                     the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall
     Matt. 16:24-26 a man give in exchange for his soul?"

                           In these dramatic contrasts Jesus set forth the ultimate aims
                        of life. He who makes himself and his own interests first is
                        certain to lose everything. He who forgets himself and his
                        own interests will gain everything. Herein lies the great paradox
                        of Christianity. No man works more effectively against his
                        own best interests than the man who works for them exclu-
                        sively, but the man who lives most fully for God and his fel-
                        lowmen is working most effectively for himself.
                           A man may amass a great fortune and live in luxury, but
                        he must have life in order to enjoy his riches. To this funda-
                        mental truth the rich fool (read Luke 12:13-21), who had
                        amassed wealth sufficient to live in luxury the rest of his days,
                        seems to have been oblivious. That very night his life was
                        required of him. "Then," God asked, "whose shall those things
                        be, which thou hast provided?" The surest road to eternal
                        poverty is the road along which a man plods in pursuit of
                        material riches.

                        would they be? Be honest with yourself. How do these three
                        compare with what your conscience tells you you ought to live
                        for?
                           With what two supreme alternatives did Jesus confront
                        those who proposed to follow Him?

 THINK IT THROUGH          What is meant by "denying" oneself? How does a
                        person "take up" the cross of Christ?
                           If confronted with the threat of death, what would
                        you be willing to give in exchange for your life?

                    Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
                    acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
                    save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause
                    I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show
                    forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which
    1 Tim. 1:12-16 should hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting."

                         Out of the blindness that overtook Paul on the Damascus
                      road came first a glorious vision of Jesus Christ as the Saviour
                      of the world, and then a candid view of himself. He saw himself
                      as God saw him—a great sinner. Perhaps this candid view of
                      oneself is prime evidence that the gospel has penetrated one's
                      mind and heart with the realization that "in me . . . dwelleth
                      no good thing." Read Rom. 7:13-25.
                         This sense of utter need is prerequisite to a desire for the
                      gracious gift of salvation Christ offers to sinners. As Paul re-
                      flected on his past life, he could think of nothing for which
                      to commend himself; and this utter worthlessness of his past
                      life prepared him to appreciate to the full the gracious gift of
                      God in Christ Jesus. "God forbid," he wrote, "that I should
                      glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." Gal. 6:14.
                      At the time he had been sincere, but he had been so wrong.
                      Paul thought of his personal experience as an example of the
                      abounding grace of God. Paul was the worst possible prospect,
                      but divine grace had transformed him into a first-prize exhibit
                      of what God can do to make useless men into men of infinite
                      worth for Him and their fellowmen. And if God could do that
                      for him, says the apostle, surely He can do the same for anyone.
                          To what personal experience did Paul point as evi-
                      dence of the abounding grace of God for saving the worst
                      of sinners?

 THINK IT THROUGH         Is there any cause in my own past life experience for
                      applying Paul's evaluation of himself—"sinners; of whom
                      I am chief"—to myself? In the sight of God, is my own
                      past any less open to divine censure than was that of
                      Paul prior to his conversion? What extenuating circum-
                      stance in his former life did Paul mention?
                          What import does this have with respect to my present
                      attitude toward known duty?

Christ, Our Full Salvation      LESSON 11                            ❑   Wednesday

            Part 4       "[God] hath saved us, and called us with an holy call-
     GOD'S ETERNAL ing, not according to our works, but according to His own
          PURPOSE purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus
                     before the world began, but is now made manifest by
                     the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
                     abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality
                     to light through the gospel: whereunto I am appointed
                     a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gen-
                     tiles. For the which cause I also suffer these things: never-
                     theless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have be-
                      lieved, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that
       2 Tim. 1:9-12 which I have I committed unto Him against that day."

                           Paul's absolute confidence in the gospel and his absolute
                        commitment to it have thrilled and inspired all believers who,
                        like him, did not have the privilege of personal association with
                        Jesus during His earthly ministry. If Paul could be so certain,
                        so can we. To Paul, the logical response to this certainty, di-
                        vinely implanted in mind and heart, was to dedicate his ability,
                        life, energy, and fortunes without stint to proclaim the message
                        so that others might learn to know Jesus Christ as he did and
                        to share the same joy that had brought a depth of meaning
                        into his own life.
                            We did not deserve the infinite provision made for us.
                        Credit belongs wholly to divine grace. In fact, says Paul, the
                        divine purpose operating through Christ was in effect even
                        before the creation of this world, and thus before there was
                        any need for it. A man who foresees the needs of his fellowmen
                        and makes provision for them earns their eternal gratitude.
                        This being so much more true of God, says Paul, it should
                         inspire a like response to Him.
                            What facts about the plan of salvation gave Paul such
                         abounding confidence in Jesus Christ, and what aspects
                         of his personal response does the apostle mention?

  THINK IT THROUGH          Point by point, analyze Paul's response to the gospel.
                         To what extent is my response like that of Paul? Are
                         there ways in which my response ought to be more
                         complete?
                            Do you think Paul's summary of the purpose of Christ's
                         mission to earth, as stated in verse 10, is adequate? If
                         you were giving a brief summary of Jesus' mission to
                         earth, what would you add to Paul's statement?

    "The plan for our redemption was         throne. From the beginning, God and

            Part 5     "Take heed, brethren, lest there t. in any of you an

                   But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest

      Heb. 3:12-15 hearts, as in the provocation."

                           Eagerly expecting soon to reach the promised rest in the
                        land of Cannan, the liberated Hebrew slaves set out from the
                        land of their servitude. There they were to find "rest" from
                        the bitter slavery of Egypt, rest from the weary wilderness, rest
                        from being strangers in a land that was not theirs. Canaan was
                        to be their permanent home.
                           But upon reaching the borders of the Promised Land "they
                        could not enter in because of unbelief." Verse 19. They doubted
                        God's power to subdue the giants and the walled cities before
                        them.
                           As Christians we have set out from the land where we were
                        once bondslaves of sin. Our goal is the heavenly Canaan, where
                        we expect to find rest from sin and its baleful results. "If we
                        hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end,"
                        all will be well. The way may be long and weary and beset by
                        dangers of every kind; it may call forth every ounce of reserve
                        energy and fortitude. But if we persevere to the end, we will
                        enter the eternal "rest" that remains to the people of God. God
                        is able; let us persevere, in His strength overcoming the many
                        dangers that beset pilgrims of the heavenward way.
                           What supreme danger lurks along the way to the
                        heavenly Canaan, and what is necessary if a person is
                        to reach his ultimate objective?

 THINK IT THROUGH          How is a person's heart "hardened through the de-
                        ceitfulness of sin"?
                           What causes hardening of the heart?
                           How does my confidence in God today compare with
                        the confidence with which I set out on my heavenward
                        journey?

              Part 6     "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   PREDESTINED TO Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in

                      us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we
                      should be holy and without blame before Him in love:
                      having predestinated us unto the adoption of children
                      by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure
                      of His will."
                         "Having made known unto us the mystery of His will,
                      according to His good pleasure which He hath purposed
                      in Himself: that in the dispensation of the fullness of
                      times He might gather together in one all things in Christ,
                      both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even
    Eph. 1:3-5, 9, 10 in Him.

                          From our point of view as sinners saved by grace, the pur-
                       pose of the plan of redemption was to rescue us from the pit
                       into which the human race fell when Adam sinned. From the
                       point of view of the inhabitants of the unfallen worlds its
                       purpose is to reunify the universe, whose harmony was inter-
                       rupted by sin. The first makes possible the second.
                          The concept that God has arbitrarily accepted certain indi-
                       viduals and rejected others is the result of misunderstanding
                       this passage. God's original purpose was that "all men" be
                       "saved" and "come unto the knowledge of the truth" (read
                       1 Tim. 2:4-6), and that "whosoever believeth in Him [Christ]
                       should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. God
                       made provision for saving all men, but He coerces no one to
                       believe or to accept His gracious gift. It is those who accept
                       Christ and believe in Him who actually receive "power to be-
                       come the sons of God." John 1:12.
                           In what words does Paul set forth the twofold objec-
                        tive of the plan of salvation?

  THINK IT THROUGH         Inasmuch as God predestined the salvation of the
                        entire world, why will not all men actually be saved?
                           What practical application can be made, here and
                        now, of the ultimate objective of God to "gather together
                        in one all things in Christ"?

                         etches a clear outline of what the sometimes misused expres-
                         sion, righteousness by faith, means.
                            The key difference, as here set forth, is between working and
                         believing as the means by which to attain to righteousness,
                         that is, acceptance by God. The difference is between doing
                         something oneself to merit God's acceptance, or believing that
                         what Christ has done for him is acceptable in God's sight as
                         meeting the requirement of moral rectitude. Faith, then, is the
                         key factor in attaining to righteousness by faith.
                            The person who comes to God on the basis of faith in Christ
                         has his iniquities forgiven, his sins covered. Verse 7. Thereafter,
                         God no longer imputes sin to such a person (verse 8), but
                         considers him just, or upright. Verse 5. It is important to note
                         further that a man attains to this status, not on the basis of
                         anything he does, but on the basis of his faith in what Christ
                         has done for him. God imputes Christ's righteousness to him
                         as if it were his own (verse 6), that is, credits, or counts it to
                         him as his very own (verse 5), and in so doing justifies him.
                         The "blessed," or happy, state of such a man is mentioned
                         three times in verses 6 to 8.
                            Summarize in your own words the apostle Paul's
                         description of the status of a person before and after
                         he comes to Christ in faith, and the means by which the
                         change is accomplished.

 THINK IT THROUGH           In describing the experience of righteousness by faith,
                         why does the apostle say nothing about the Christian's
                         experience after God has accepted his faith in what Christ
                         has done?
                            How fully has the experience here described become
                         a reality in my own life?

           Part 2       "There is therefore now no condemnation to them
NO CONDEMNATION which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
                      but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in
                      Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
                     death."
                        "For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spir-
     Rom. 8:1, 2, 6 itually minded is life and peace."

                           Those who have been justified on the basis of their faith
                        in Christ Jesus stand before God without condemnation. The
                        charges against them have been dropped; there is "no con-
                        demnation." Here the apostle refers to the Christian experience
                        of such persons as walking: They do not stand still in the
                        happy experience of being declared free from the charges
                        against them in their former state as sinners, but they make
                        progress (walk) toward the destination God has marked out
                        for them. This walk is "after the Spirit," that is, they follow
                        where the Spirit leads them, not where their fleshly lusts
                        formerly led them. Read all of verses 1 to 6.
                           In verse 2 Paul contrasts "the law of the Spirit of life in
                        Christ Jesus" with "the law of sin and death." As here used,
                        the word "law" might better be translated "principle." It is a
                        fundamental principle that sin brings death, and another funda-
                        mental principle that faith in Christ results in life. In Christ,
                        says Paul, the higher principle of life in Christ transcends the
                        lower principle that sin results in death. Christ has provided
                        the antidote for effectively counteracting the principle that
                        sin brings death.
                           How does Paul describe the Christian experience of
                        a person who has been justified by faith in Christ?

  THINK IT THROUGH         With a modern court case as an illustration, compose
                        a modern parable based on this passage of Scripture.
                           To what extent am I walking as a Christian "after

                        ing "after the flesh"?

               Part 3      "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace
    AT PEACE WITH with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we
                 GOD   have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
                       rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
                           "And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of
                       God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which
                       is given unto us."
                           "But God commendeth His love toward us, in that,
                       while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
                           "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled
                       to God by the death of His Son, much more, being re-
 Rom. 5:1, 2, 5, 8, 10 conciled, we shall be saved by His life."

                            The "ungodly" (Rom. 4:5) are at war with God. The un-
                         regenerate mind "is enmity against God"; "it is not subject to
                         the law of God, neither indeed can be." Rom. 8:7. But Christ
                         came to earth as the "Prince of peace," with an embassage
                         of peace (Isa. 9:6) and reconciled us to God. 2 Cor. 5:18. God
                         does not consider the sinner an enemy, but a son held captive
                         by sin and brainwashed by the enemy. God loves the sinner,
                         but hates the sin that binds him. When a sinner repents and
                         is justified before God by faith, he is no longer an\ enemy;
                         then he is at peace with God.
                            One thus reconciled and at peace with God rejoices in hope
                         and God's love fills his heart. Rom. 5:2, 5. It was Christ's
                         death that effected reconciliation with God. Verse 10. To carry
                         through Paul's thought in verse 10, we would be reconciled
                         but without the prospect of life except for Christ's resurrection.
                         The fact that He lives again saves us from death. Read Romans
                         6:3-11. As Christ arose, so we rise from a moribund state in
                         sin to "walk in newness of life."
                           Point out at least four aspects of the experience that
                         comes to the person who has been justified by faith.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Except for God's initiative in providing salvation,
                         would men ever desire, or seek, reconciliation with God?

              Part 4       "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new crea-
     A NEW PERSON tore: old things are passed away; behold, all things are
                       become new. And all things are of God, who hath recon-
                       ciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us
                       the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in
                       Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing
                       their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us
      2 Cor. 5:17-19 the word of reconciliation."

                           The key concept in this passage is in the word "new." The
                        contrast between what a person used to be before finding
                        reconciliation with God, and what he is afterward, is evident
                        in every aspect of his life. He has new objectives to live for.
                        New impulses stir his life and, one by one, sweep away the old
                        desires and aspirations. New ideals replace the old. New emo-
                        tions swell in the heart. New traits of character take root and
                        grow to maturity.
                           As the newborn Christian sets out to mortify, or put to
                        death, his former desires and evil practices (Rom. 8:13), a
                        pitched battle ensues. No longer, in his inmost heart, does he
                        care for these things, yet he finds that the old thoughts, emo-
                        tions, habits, and practices must be resolutely put down. He
                        battles with one, marches on, and then battles with another.
                        One and all, he hates them (Rom. 7:15-25), struggles for
                        victory over them, and finds deliverance through Jesus Christ.
                        He is walking "after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:1) ; and resolutely,
                        by the grace and power of Christ, he subdues every un-Christ-
                        like trait of character, until he grows up in character, as well
                        as in name, to be a son of God.
                           What exhilarating, joyful experience comes to the per-
                        son who has been reconciled to God?

         BE YE HOLY      to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you
                         at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as obedient children,

      1 Peter 1:13-16,   holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because
               23; 2:9   it is written, Be ye holy; for. I am holy."
                             "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of in-
                         corruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth
                         forever."
                             "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an
                         holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth
                         the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness
                         into His marvelous light."

                            The person who finds righteousness by faith, who stands
                         justified before God, at peace with Him, and a new person in
                         Christ Jesus, is declared to be holy. Bible writers use the word
                         "holy" to describe a person or an object as set apart or dedi-
                         cated to the service of God. God is holy by virtue of His in-
                         trinsic righteous character as God; man is holy by virtue of
                         his relationship to God, never in his own right. Thus, Israel is
                         commonly referred to as a holy nation, not because its people
                         were uniformly upright and without moral fault, but because,
                         as a nation, they sustained a special relationship to God as the
                         one nation on earth dedicated to God as the instrument of His
                         divine purpose on earth.
                            As the apostle Peter here points out, however, the person
                         who enters into this relationship with God will reflect that
                         relationship in all his "conversation," that is, his conduct or
                         manner of life. Those whose lives are thus dedicated to Christ
                         constitute a "holy nation" like Israel of old. Furthermore, they
                         are a "peculiar people," that is (as the Greek reads) "Go  d's
                         own people," and as such they are His personal possession. A
                         privilege indeed!
                            How does Peter describe the special relationship that
                         exists between God and those who accept Christ as their
                         Saviour?

 THINK IT THROUGH           How does a person "gird up the loins" of his mind?
                         How would you express this in modern language?
                            Does a holy person ever make mistakes? Does God
                         consider a person who sins, holy? Or does a person lose
                         this status the moment he misses the mark?

        PERFECTION through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you
                     perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you
                     that which is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus
      Heb. 13:20, 21 Christ; to whom be glory forever and ever."

                            The Greek word translated "perfect" means "mature," "full-
                         grown," "that which has reached its objective." By this defini-
                         tion, a "perfect" Christian is a mature Christian. He has a
                         reasonably symmetrical understanding of his relationship to
                         God and to his fellowmen. He assumes the responsibilities of
                         Christian maturity, along with its privileges. He acts like a
                         mature person, spiritually, not with the irresponsibility that
                         sometimes characterizes childhood and youth. In his attitude
                         toward the various situations of life he is consistent, steady,
                         self-reliant, considerate of others.
                            It is the purpose of the mature Christian to order his life
                         in harmony with the divine will, to bring every aspect of his
                         life into harmony with that will. This is his steadfast objec-
                         tive, one toward which he works persistently and steadily.
                         When he misses the mark, he does not become discouraged and
                         let setbacks stop his progress toward his ideal. He may fall
                         into temptation, but he rises again.
                             In this lesson we have traced the experience of a person in
                         coming to Christ (Parts 1 and 2) and then his relationship to
                          God as a sinner justified by the blood of Christ. The person
                         who by the grace of God has complied with the divine will each
                         step of the way attains to perfection in Christ.
                            What is the goal of the born-again Christian, and how
                         does God look upon a life thus dedicated to reflect the
                         character of Jesus Christ?

  THINK IT THROUGH          How can a person be perfect, and yet be working
                         toward Christian perfection? (See "SDA Bible Commen-
                         tary" on Matt. 5:48 and on Phil. 3:12-16.)
                            At what point in his experience as a Christian does
                         he attain to perfection in the Bible sense of the word?

              Part 1    "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into
        A NEW AND the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living
        LIVING WAY way, which He hath consecrated for us, through the veil,
                     that is to say, His flesh; and having an High Priest over
                     the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in
                     full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from
                     an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
       Heb. 10:19-22 water."

                           The "new and living way" of which the author of Hebrews
                        writes is "new" in contrast to the "old" way operative under
                        the "old covenant," of approaching God through the ancient
                        sacrificial system. Read Heb. 9:1-15; 8:6-10; 10:1-12. It is
                        "living" in the sense that it does "take away sins," whereas
                        "it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
                        take away sins." Heb. 10:4. The ancient sacrificial system never
                        did take away sins, for it was a "ministration of death." 2 Cor.
                        3:6-8.
                           But to us in our day, when we come to Christ, His min-
                        istry in heaven on our behalf can also be "new" and "living"
                        —new because we have entered into a new experience and
                        relationship, and living because Christ's power to cleanse from
                        sin is a living reality in the experience of the born-again Chris-
                        tian.
                           The four prerequisites to this experience are simple and
                        clear: (1) "a true heart," that is, faith and sincere motives;
                        (2) "full assurance of faith," or complete confidence and trust;
                        (3) "our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience," that is, a
                        clear conscience, clear because we have made everything right
                        with God and with fellowmen whom we may have wronged,
                        and with a sincere purpose to cooperate willingly and gladly
                        with all that God may require of us; and (4) "our bodies"
                        have been "washed with pure water"—we have complied with
                        the outward sign of inward regeneration, baptism.
                           What four requirements are set forth with which those
                        are to comply who would enter upon the "new and living
                        way" Christ has opened for us?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Why does God specify "boldness" as one of the traits
                        He expects of those who approach the throne of divine
                        grace by the "new and living way"?
                           Is my conscience clear with respect to my past rela-

Christ, the Way to Heaven         LESSON 13                               ❑ Monday

              Part 2    "At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and
      UNION WITH ye in Me, and I in you."
             CHRIST     "I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth
                     in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:
                     for without Me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in
                     Me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and
                     men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they
                     are burned. If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in
                     you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto
                     you. Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much
  John 14:20; 15:5-8 fruit; so shall ye be My disciples."

                            The new and living way upon which the person enters who
                         accepts salvation in Christ requires a continuous living connec-
                         tion with Christ in order to maintain a healthy experience.
                            For those who have found the joy of salvation in Christ,
                         Satan has a new temptation—to stray from Christ, or to sup-
                         pose that one's present experience is enough to guarantee eter-
                         nal life. To many he whispers the subtle error, "You are a
                         Christian now. Your name is on the church books. You are
                         sure of heaven. Now you can relax and enjoy life." To others he
                         comes with a subtle variant of the same temptation: "Yes,
                         you're saved. Once saved, always saved. God's grace has re-
                         leased you from obeying God's commands. You can do as you
                          please without any worry. God is obliged, now, to let you into
                         heaven. From now on out He won't be concerned with what
                         you do or don't do. You're in!"
                             What vital facts with respect to discipleship did Jesus
                         illustrate by the brief parable of the vine and its
                         branches?

  THINK IT THROUGH          In a practical, literal sense, how does a person abide
                         in Christ? What is the difference between abiding in
                         Christ, and Christ abiding in us?
                            What points of comparison are there between the
                         parable and the experience of the Christian abiding in
                         Christ?

Christ, the Way to Heaven         LESSON 13                                ❑ Tuesday


            Part 3      "He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them,
    THE PATHWAY he it is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be
    OF OBEDIENCE loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest
                     Myself to him."
                        "If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My
                     love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments,
  John 14:21; 15:10 and abide in His love."

                            The modern mind resents the idea of having to comply with
                        any objective requirements, whether human or divine. It wants
                        to do only what it pleases. This attitude is a modern version
                        of the temptation Satan presented to Adam and Eve in the
                        Garden of Eden, a sophisticated manifestation df the spirit of
                        rebellion and defiance that has characterized Satan from the
                        first. As the apostle Paul says in Rom. 8:7, "The carnal mind
                        . . . is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
                            The "situation ethics" concept that permits a man to ratio-
                        nalize away his obligation to obey God at all times and under
                        all circumstances and to decide for himself that something
                        God has declared to be all wrong is, after all, all right, is of the
                        devil.
                            Situation ethics errs by placing love and commandment in
                        oppositon to each other, as if one could love God without
                        obeying Him. This is a modern version of the same charge
                        Satan made against God before being cast out of heaven.
                        In our scripture for today Christ declares that genuine love for
                        Him will be reflected in obedience to His commands. Love is
                        not contrary to the law of God, but the "fulfilling of the
                        law." Rom. 13:10. We are to "abide," or "continue," in
                        Christ's love by keeping His commandments.
                            What relationship did Jesus repeatedly affirm as ex-
                        isting between genuine love for Him and obedience to
                        His requirements?

 THINK IT THROUGH          Am I ever tempted to think that circumstances release
                        me from obeying God?
                           Are there circumstances under which a person might,
                        for example, make a purchase on the Sabbath, or dis-
                        obey his parents, or appropriate to his own use that
                        which belongs to someone else—and yet in so doing ac-

                        cumstances? How can a person know, under particular

                    toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God
      Phil. 3:10-14 in Christ Jesus."

                         On no other aspect of the Christian life does there seem to
                      be so much misunderstanding as on the point of Christian per-
                      fection. In part, this is because the English word "perfect" does
                      not accurately reflect the meaning of the Greek word from
                      which it is translated in the various New Testament passages
                      where it occurs. "Mature" more closely reflects the meaning
                      of the Greek word. It denotes an animal or a person who is
                      able to function effectively as may properly be expected of
                      him at the time; he is mature for his age and station in life.
                      In this sense, a child of twelve is mature when he conducts
                      himself as a child of that age should. But his perfection as a
                      twelve-year-old child does not mean that he has attained to
                      the mature attitudes, ability, and conduct that will be expected
                      of him when he is twenty-one. He is "perfect" as a child of
                      twelve; but, like Paul, he is still pressing toward the mark of
                      full maturity. For that matter, he should be growing in char-
                      acter, ability, and conduct throughout life.
                          There is, thus, an immediate perfection that all may have
                      instantly the moment they accept Christ and may retain con-
                      tinuously throughout life; there is also an ultimate perfection
                      to which they attain at the end of life's journey. The first is
                      relative; the second is absolute. God does not expect, nor does
                      He require, the sincere, earnest Christian to attain to ultimate
                      perfection before he reaches the end of life's journey; but He
                      does require him, like Paul, to be earnestly pressing toward
                       the mark of absolu te perfection in Christ Jesus. And God ac-
                       counts such a Christian perfect so long as he maintains this
                       attitude and relationship to Christ.
  THINK IT THROUGH        Should I expect to attain to a state of sinless perfec-
                       tion at any point in life prior to the close of probation?
                          If I fall unwillingly before the tempter, does God take
                       away from me the robe of Christ's righteousness until I
                       confess my sin and ask His forgiveness?

   "The steps of a Christian may at        He gains new victories daily, and comes

               Part 5     "Then said Jesus unto His disciples, If any man will
      A REWARD FOR come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his
         EVERY MAN cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life shall
                       lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall
                       find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the
                       whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man
                       give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall
                       come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then
       Matt. 16:24-27 He shall reward every man according to his works."

                           Christ here uses the words "save" one's life, "find" one's
                        life, and "reward" to express the ultimate goal of Christian
                        living. To this end He invites His followers to follow His
                        example, to deny themselves, to take up their crosses and fol-
                        low Him, and to lose their lives. The mature Christian does not
                        think of doing these things in order to earn the reward Christ
                        here promises. He now purposes to live in harmony with the
                        principles of heaven because it is in his heart to be in harmony
                        with those principles. It is by being in harmony with heaven's
                        principles now that we become eligible for the reward of life
                        eternal in that new universe. There, all will be perpetually
                        in harmony with God's will on the basis of an unalterable con-
                        viction that God's way is best.
                           It is one of the great paradoxes of life that no one works
                        more effectively against himself than the man who works ex-
                        clusively for himself. God will never forget those who forget
                        themselves by becoming so involved in their concern for others
                        that they neglect themselves for others.
                           What requirements did Jesus set forth to be met by
                        those who aspire to the reward of eternal life at His
                        coming?

 THINK IT THROUGH           How does a person "deny" himself in the sense in
                         which Christ uses the term?
                            In a practical way, what does it mean to "take up"
                         the cross of Christ?
                            What might a man "give in exchange for his soul"?

              Part 6      "When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and
       THE ETERNAL all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the
      INHERITANCE throne of His glory: and before Him shall be gathered
                      all nations: and He shall separate them one from another,
                      as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and He
                      shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on
                      the left. Then shall the King say unto them on His right
                      hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
      Matt. 25:31-34 prepared for you from the foundation of the world."

                           "The kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
                        world" is the original dominion over this earth granted to
                        Adam in the Garden of Eden but forfeited because of Adam's
                        sin. It is restored by virtue of the righteousness of the second
                        Adam. Read Rom. 5:12-19. In other words, the Creator's
                        original plan for this world, interrupted though it has been
                        by six thousand years of sin, will eventually be carried out.
                        When? "When the Son of man shall come in His glory." Christ
                        is now the Great Shepherd of the flock, but then He will sit
                        as man's righteous Judge and King.
                           An Oriental flock was often composed of both sheep and
                        goats. They would graze together, rest together, go about to-
                        gether. But there was a time of separation when each would
                        be called to fulfill its destiny, as determined by its inherent
                        nature as a sheep or a goat and by the product it had to
                        offer. In the same way our eternal destiny is determined by the
                        character we develop in this life, and by whether or not that
                        character qualifies us to inherit the kingdom God has prepared
                         for us from the foundation of the world.
                            In what expressive figures of speech does Christ set
                        forth the eternal reward of those who aspire to the prize
                        of eternal life in Christ Jesus?

 THINK IT THROUGH          A goat cannot help acting like a goat, nor a sheep like
                        a sheep. How then is it fair to condemn the goats in
                        Christ's parable of the kingdom? Is this not an arbitrary
                        act on God's part?
                           If Christ were living today, would He speak of the
                        future life as a "kingdom"? Would it be just as accurate
                        to picture the future life as a democracy?

            Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
SEPTEMBER 26, 1970         •       SOUTHERN EUROPEAN DIVISION

    On September 26 you will be asked to give a special offering, and
it is important that you know something about the projects to benefit
from your offering. Three different sections of the Southern Euro-
pean Division will benefit from the overflow of the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering: Yugoslavia in Europe, the Republic of Chad in
Equatorial Africa, and Malagasy Republic (Madagascar).
    The European project is the establishment of an evangelistic
center in Nis, the sixth largest city in Yugoslavia, where our work
has progressed very well. Since the end of World War II, more than
one hundred places of worship have been opened in Yugoslavia as
the result of the generosity of her own people. Authorization has
been obtained to build an evangelistic center in the city of Nis.
    In the Republic of Chad in Africa the authorities have asked
us to help them in establishing a dispensary with a maternity wing
in the southern part of the country. We have no Adventists here.
But now we may give these people the message of God's love.
    On the large island of Madagascar we have a secondary school
with 500 students but we could easily have 800 or 1,000. Unfor-
tunately we do not have the space. Therefore a part of the overflow
will be used to enlarge and improve this school. The carrying
forward of all these projects depends on the generosity of our
Sabbath School members around the world on September 26.



             Lessons for the Fourth Quarter of 1970
