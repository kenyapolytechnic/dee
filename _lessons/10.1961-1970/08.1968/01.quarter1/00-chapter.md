THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to
give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind,
a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."
—Steps to Christ, page 90.

             My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                             March 30, 1968
                       Southern European Division

    The Southern European Division is to benefit once more from a
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow the first quarter of 1968.
    The offering received at the end of the third quarter of 1965 amounted
to $88,198.16, of which 13 percent has been employed to purchase land and
build the first building for a new mission station in Abong-Mbang in
Cameroun, and 37 percent has been applied to establish new work among
the Bamileke tribe, who also inhabit Cameroun. The other half of the
offering is being invested with other funds in a new dormitory for the girls
attending the French Adventist Seminary at Collonges, France.
    This last offering, and others in the past as well, have been a great
blessing and have meant much to the various projects that have benefited
in Africa and certain parts of Europe, and we thank you for each of them.
    This year's offering is to go in full to Spain, and will be applied wholly
toward the construction of chapels. The time has now come when a greater
measure of liberty is being felt, and the golden opportunity is here when
God's people should consolidate their position in that country.
    The work in Spain was organized in. 1903 and has grown but slowly.
Civil war and many difficulties have retarded the glorious march of God's
servants with their message for this time. But in spite of so many obstacles
the work has progressed nicely during the past few years.
    Spain has a population of about thirty-two million. There are twenty-
one organized churches, and thank God they are all open and have govern-
ment permission. There are approximately 30,000 Protestants in Spain, and
Seventh-day Adventists are recognized as occupying third place among the
non-Catholic Christians.
    Spain has produced a very respectable and fruitful ministry with a total
of seventy-six active workers, including literature evangelists who are busy
bringing the message to its millions. Today thousands of Spaniards are lis-
tening eagerly to the spoken word of our evangelists, but it is a great prob-
lem to accommodate the people. As yet no public halls can be used, and the
whole evangelistic program may be carried out only in properly authorized
chapels. Therefore church buildings are a must, and the more we can build
the more the membership will grow.
    Now is the time to help Spain to erect these buildings, and hundreds,
yes, even thousands, will find their way into the ranks of God's remnant
people.
    Are you seeking to invest your means profitably? Then do it with a
glad heart and in a generous way by helping Spain to build its projected
churches, and we thank you for it.
