THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures.— . . If God's Word were studied as it should be,
men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability
of purpose rarely seen in these times."—Steps to Christ, page 90.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

                    Trials and Character Development

MEMORY VERSE: "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
   to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
   inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when His glory shall
   be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy." 1 Peter 4:12, 13.
STUDY HELPS: "The Ministry of Healing," pages 469-482; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
   pages 328-365; "Selected Messages," Bk. 1, pp. 336-339; "S.D.A. Bible Com-
   mentary."
STUDY AIM: To discover how One who is preparing to meet Jesus in peace at His
   coming can relate to trials in such a way that these experiences will contrib-
   ute to the development of character.

                               The Sin of Partiality

MEMORY VERSE: "For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
  after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: but God hath
  chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath
  chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are
  mighty." 1 Cor. 1:26, 27.
STUDY HELPS: "Counsels on Health," pages 228-230; "Testimonies," Vol. 2, PP.
   156-161; "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 376-389; "S.D.A. Bible Commen-
   tary."
STUDY AIM: To develop the principle that a man in whose heart the love of Jesus
   reigns will regard all men as of equal worth in God's sight-that he will mani-
   fest the same sympathetic interest in the needy poor as in the needy rich.

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                             September 28, 1968
                           Inter-American Division
    The Inter-American Division has been assigned the overflow of the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to be taken on September 28. This offering
will be divided equally between Andrews Memorial Hospital in Kingston,
Jamaica, and the Adventist Educational Center in Honduras.
    In the light of a changing economy, facilities at Andrews Memorial
Hospital are now outmoded and inadequate. In order to meet modern
medical standards we must abandon the old clinic building and erect a
new medical-surgical wing, which will house examining rooms, clinical
quarters, a more adequate operating room, and a new delivery room. It will
also provide for more bed patients, raising the• bed capacity from the present
47 to 125. There is also an urgent need to build a dormitory for the nurses
in training.
    The Adventist Educational Center in Honduras opened its doors in 1965.
Previously it was a self-supporting institution started by the late Dr. Joseph
L. Dewitt in 1962. Two years later it was turned over to the Honduras Mis-
sion as a donation. It is now being sponsored by the Adventist constituency
of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, with a total membership of about
13,00o. This new boarding school with very modest physical facilities is
attracting some of the finest young people in this part of Central America.
With 255 acres of ground, the Adventist Educational Center will be able
to expand to care for 45o students.
    The young people of Central America urge you to give generously for
their school at Pefia Blanca, and missionary doctors appeal to you to help
Make Andrews Memorial Hospital a representative institution.
