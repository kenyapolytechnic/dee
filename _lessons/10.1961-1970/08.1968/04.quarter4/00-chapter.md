          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON



       Senior Division, No. 294, Fourth Quarter, 1968
THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15 :16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath School lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very foundation,
and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 53.

           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                              December 21, 1968

                          The Middle East Division

    The Middle East Division reaches from "the shores of Tripoli" on the
west to the frontier of Afghanistan on the east, and from Istanbul on the
Bosporus to the Sudan border with Uganda. Parts of three continents are
included in this expansive territory that is peopled by over 130,000,000
inhabitants, more than 95 percent of whom are followers of the religion
of Islam.
    Our work among the peoples of the Middle East started near the turn
of the century. Growth has been slow during intervening years, and even
today the peoples of these lands remain largely untouched with the gospel.
For each Seventh-day Adventist there remains a non-Adventist population
of 51,755. This is by far the greatest challenge that faces the church today.
    Three special projects will be the recipients of our Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering overflow this quarter: one, an all-purpose gymnasium-auditorium
for the Middle East College; two, an all-purpose auditorium adjacent to
the Benghazi Hospital in Libya, where health education classes can be
conducted and recreational pursuits for the hospital personnel can be carried
on; three, an orphanage in the city of Amman, Jordan. Great numbers of
children in this area have been left orphans because of war and political
upheavals. As part of our Heaven-ordained task we are to give heed to the
needs of these fatherless children. Our believers in the Middle East are look-
ing to their brothers and sisters around the world for help on this coming
Thirteenth Sabbath.
