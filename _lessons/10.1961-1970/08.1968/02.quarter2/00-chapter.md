to the full assurance in his heart?

                                                   doctrine of justification often results in un-

                                June 29, 1968
                            Australasian Division
    Again this quarter the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will
go to one specific project; namely the remodeling and enlarging of the
Sydney Sanitarium and Hospital at Wahroonga, a suburb of Sydney,
Australia.
    Just before she returned from Australia to the United States at the turn
of the century, Mrs. E. G. White made a special visit to Sydney to view
the proposed site of the sanitarium which she had been urging the brethren
to build. As she viewed for the first time the eighty acres that fell away in
gentle slopes from a loo-foot eminence, set in lovely bushland, she ex-
claimed, "This is the place!"
    Within two years the Sydney Sanitarium and Hospital was built with
timbers that were imported from the United States. Through the years
the "San" has proved a wonderful blessing to the community and to the
church in its missionary activities at home and in lands afar. Ninety-six
graduates from this medical institution are at present serving in overseas
mission fields. Now, however, the central and original section of the Sani-
tarium has become antiquated and substandard, and its timbers are a ter-
rible fire hazard during the hot Australian summer months. The Nurses'
Registration Board now requires that the bed capacity be increased from
i8o to 30o in order for the institution to retain its registration as a nurses'
training school. Australia needs our graduates; the world field needs them.
You can help train them by supporting the rebuilding project with a
liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on June 29.
