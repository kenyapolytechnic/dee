                  THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page go.

                       My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                March 31, 1962, Southern Asia Division
      From its long list of urgent needs, the Southern Asia Division has
   chosen the following three objectives to benefit from the overflow of the
   Thirteenth Sabbath Offering:
      I. The opening of medical work in the Kerala Mission, one of the
   most congested areas in the whole division. So far we have been unable
   to provide a doctor for this area, but several of the young men from
   this field have gone to the Vellore Christian Medical College, and we
   hope now to be able to establish one of them in the work in his home
   field.
      2. A girls' dormitory for our training school at Falakata, Northeast
   Union.
      3. A headquarters building for the Pakistan Union. We are com-
   pelled to vacate the present rented quarters, and it is necessary to build
   our own.
      A liberal offering on Thirteenth Sabbath will be appreciated.
