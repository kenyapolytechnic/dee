                  THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
  "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.

                               The Prophetic Vision
MEMORY VERSE: "I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
  visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets." Hosea 12:10.
STUDY HELPS: "Early Writings," pages 13-20; "Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 58-61,
   21-35; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To show that (1) God uses visions and prophetic dreams to speak to
   the prophets; (2) physical phenomena sometimes attend the visions and
   help to substantiate faith; (3) there are varieties in modes of revelation, but
   the message is of the same divine origin.

                   The Prophet Delivers God's Message
MEMORY VERSE: "I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
   great voice, as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the
   last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
   churches." Rev. 1:10, 11, first part.
STUDY HELPS: "Selected Messages," b. 1, pp. 49-58; "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp.
   654-660; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To show that the prophet was a spokesman for God who bore oral
   and written testimony of what had been revealed to him in vision.

                     Integrity of the Prophetic Message
MEMORY VERSE: "As the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that will 1 speak."
   2 Chron. 18:13.
STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 534-536; "S.D.A. Bible Com-

LESSON AIM: To show (1) that the messages of the prophets are dependable, in
   spite of the fact that the writers were human and fallible, and (2) that the
   messages of the prophet were not molded by influences about him.

                             The Primacy of the Bible

MEMORY VERSE: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
   for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that
   the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
   2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
STUDY HELPS: "Selected Messages," b. 1, pp. 15-23; "The Great Controversy,"
   chapter 37; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To show (1) that the word of God is a trustworthy and infallible
   revelation of God's will, and (2) that when its purpose is understood and the
   manner of reading and interpretation is clear, and its message accepted, we
   shall find salvation in its pages.

                Place and Work of the Spirit of Prophecy

MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore He saith, When He ascended up on high, He led
   captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men." "And He gave some, apostles;
   and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
   for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying
   of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
   stature of the fullness of Christ." Eph. 4:8, 11-13.
STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," Introduction, pages vii-xii, trade ed.;
   pp. 9-14, missionary ed.; "Selected Messages," b. 1, pp. 24-39; "Patriarchs
   and Prophets," Introduction, by Uriah Smith; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
LESSON AIM: To show (1) that spiritual gifts are to operate in the church in the
   last days; (2) the relationship that exists between the Bible and the spirit of
   prophecy writings; and (3) to clarify the role of the spirit of prophecy in the
   remnant church.

                      A Gift That Guides and Guards

MEMORY VERSE: "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
   go: I will guide thee with Mine eye." Ps. 32:8.
 STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies to Ministers," pages 24-62; "The Abiding Gift of
    Prophecy," pages 330-369; "S.D.A. Bible Commentary."
 LESSON AIM: To show (1) how the divine enlightenment which came through the
    prophet served to guide and guard the Lord's people in Bible times, and (2)
    how "modern Israel" also has been divinely led and providentially guarded.

MEMORY VERSE: "Whereupon, 0 King Agrippa, I was not                  disobedient unto the

LESSON AIM: To show (1) our need of accepting the counsels          of the spirit of proph-
   ecy; (2) that certain guiding principles should guide us         in our study; and (3)
   that one's happiness and salvation may depend upon               his personal attitude
   toward this gift.
