                   THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—

                        My Daily Lesson Study Pledge

pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

                           Central European Division


   The articles in the Missions Quarterly this quarter present some of
the tragic needs of our churches and believers in Germany. War not
only took its toll in destroyed homes and church buildings, but it also
brought much hardship and financial difficulties to our believers.
   Since the war our believers have had to meet in attics, in out-of-the-
way places, and often in crowded rooms in their own homes. Such
conditions greatly hinder the advance of the message in Germany.
   Very few church groups have sufficient and proper church facilities.
Many meet in cold, dark, uninviting places. May our hearts go out in
behalf of the needs of our fellow believers in this needy field. With
proper help it can easily become a strong base and, as formerly, be
able to send forth its young people to mission fields.
   It is our privilege this quarter to help the leaders in that field to
build churches, and especially to build a representative church in the
city of Cologne on the Rhine River.
