This paper, slanted for junior-age folks, makes the Sabbath school lessons

         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page go.

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

          December 29, 1962, Southern European Division

    The Southern European Division has chosen three projects to bene-
fit from the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter.
They are:
    (t) A new mission station in the southern part of Angola, West
Africa, one of the mission fields of the Southern European Division;
(2) a new church and evangelistic center in Paris, France; (3) enlarge-
ment of the Phoenix School on the island of Mauritius, Indian Ocean,
another mission field of this division.
    Angola is at present one of our most promising mission fields in
Africa. Our work is well established in all parts of this field except the
southern section, and we are in need of a mission station there from
which to work for the people of that vast area.
    Paris is usually called "The City of Light." An evangelistic center
will be a lighthouse, sending the light of the gospel to the nine million
inhabitants of Greater Paris.
    For a number of years we have been operating a school on the
beautiful island of Mauritius, but it is no longer adequate to accom-
modate the 40o students who wish to attend. We must improve the
present buildings and construct another.
     Make your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering a real Christmas gift in
the name of Jesus. Whether the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is taken
in your Sabbath school on December 22 or December 29, be sure to
label your offering "Thirteenth Sabbath Offering," so that the South-
ern European Division will benefit from the overflow.
