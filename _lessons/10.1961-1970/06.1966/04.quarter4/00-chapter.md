 THE BLESSING- OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind ,and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
    "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
 study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
'to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
.God's Word were studied as it should' be, men would have a breadth of
 mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
 times:"---LSteps to Christ, page 9o.

             My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I

                         THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING •

                                 December 24, 1966

                              South American Division

       Pemphigus, or savage fire as it is commonly called in Brazil, is one
   of the most dreaded diseases of medical history. It is a living death,
   comparable only to leprosy. Ulcers and eczema, from the sole of the feet
   to the top of the head, with a continual burning sensation, make the con-
   dition of one with this disease most pathetic. We, as Seventh-day Adventists,
   are operating the only private hospital in Brazil, at Mato Grosso, for the
   treatment of this disease. This little hospital is one of the projects to
   benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow.
       One poor • sufferer, as he pulled back the blood-stained sheet that
   covered his head to prOtect it from flies, said, "Please thank the Adventists
   wherever they are for the wonderful help they are giving us. I was once a
   prosperous rancher with a fine family, but I am now become as Job. I have
   lost my family and everything I possessed because of this terrible disease.
   Now I hope to start life over again because of the good help of the
   Adventists."
       Won't you give a generous Christmas offering to help more of these
   poor sufferers, and also to help our needy hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil?
