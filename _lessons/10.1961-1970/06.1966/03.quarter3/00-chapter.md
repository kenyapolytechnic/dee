THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
  "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible.
If God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
times."—Steps to Christ, page go.

            My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

                             September 24, 1966

                             Trans-Africa Division

    It was in 1894 that a little band of missionaries arrived at Solusi and
opened the first Seventh-day Adventist mission station for non-Christian
people. The early years of work at Solusi were years of test and trial. But
out of those years of hard work, sickness, and sacrifice of life has come a
strong mission program, centered in a Christian college that has made an
impact on the Adventist Church that will be felt to the end of time.
    Solusi-trained students now fill many places of responsibility in the
work of the church in Africa in these trying times. This must be in-
creasingly true in the years ahead, but it will not be so unless this school
can be enlarged and strengthened to meet the growing needs. The over-
flow this quarter will help to meet some of the most urgent needs, which are:
   I. An adequate and dependable water supply.
   2. A suitable library.
    3. A science building furnished and equipped for teaching science on
the college level.
    Won't you come to the aid of Old Solusi at this critical time?
