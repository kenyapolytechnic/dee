 THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
    "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto
me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart; for I am called by Thy name, 0
Lord God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
    "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath
are invaluable. Let the Sabbath School lesson be learned, not by a hasty
glance at the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study
for the next week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration
during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a
treasure never to be wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study
of the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words,
while the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very
foundation, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.

            My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures,
I pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath
School lesson each day of the week.

of God. To cultivate all the attributes of

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                 June 25, 1966

                             Middle East Division

    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the second quarter
of 1966 has been assigned by the General Conference for the expansion of
God's work in Bible lands. Sixteen Eastern nations, on three continents,
representing five language groups, Arabic being the main one, make up
the territories of the Middle East Division. The future of the church and
the development of God's work in the Bible lands is dependent on Christian
education. The training of our youth and the preparation of laborers for
the Lord's harvest field is the most urgent and necessary work to accomplish
at this time.
    Through the blessings of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, the elementary
school in Iran, presently housed in rented quarters with meager facilities,
will occupy its new home. The academy, with the advantage of recent
recognition and accreditation, will be enlarged. This will provide more
space in the dormitory, additional classrooms, and larger provisions for
the dining room. This little "school of the prophets," located at the foot
of the great snow-covered mountains, will hold high the standards of
Christian education, and will mold our youth to be pillars in the church of
God.
