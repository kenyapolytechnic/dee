THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to
give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If
God's Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
times."—Steps to Christ, page 9o.

             My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                March 26, 1966

                           Inter-American Division

   You will not find a territory on the map called Inter-America, but to
Seventh-day Adventists there definitely is such a place! With headquarters
in Miami, Florida, United States, the Inter-American Division stretches as
far west as Lower California and Mexico; as far south as Colombia,
Venezuela, and the Guianas on the northern coast of South America; as
far east as the islands of the Caribbean; and as far north as the borders of
the United States of America.
   In this vast territory, comprised of 27 countries and numerous islands,
live TOO million people. There are 91 million Spanish-speaking people,
of whom 91,000 are Seventh-day Adventists; 41/2 million French-speaking
people with 26,000 Seventh-day Adventists; and 41/2 million English-speak-
ing inhabitants with 68,000 Seventh-day Adventists.
   To meet the challenge of this hour we feel the need of better trained
workers. Therefore, two major educational projects have been chosen to
benefit from the overflow this quarter. We believe that investing in Seventh-
day Adventist youth is the best investment we can make, for it pays large
dividends in a world torn by strife and nationalism. Therefore we solicit
the liberality of our people all around the world on the Thirteenth Sabbath
for a boarding academy in Venezuela and a secondary day school in the
French West Indies.
