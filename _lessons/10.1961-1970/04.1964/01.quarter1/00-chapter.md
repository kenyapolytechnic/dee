THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—

MEMORY VERSE: "I have surely seen the affliction of My people which are in Egypt,

MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
   the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the
   fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I
   come and smite the earth with a curse." Mal. 4:5, 6.

AIM: To present the unfolding of the Messianic hope in Daniel and certain of the
   minor prophets and to emphasize the fact that, just as John called the people
   to repentance before the first coming of Christ, there will be a great work of
   revival and reformation before the second advent.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                  March 28, 1964
                        SOUTH AMERICAN DIVISION
      The fleet of medical mission launches on the rivers of South America
   has become an established feature of missionary work in that great land.
      Thousands of people along the Amazon and its tributaries hail the
   coming of the mission launch as their only hope of receiving help for
   their many physical afflictions. It is also their only hope for hearing the
   gospel, for the launch workers preach and teach as well as heal.
      A part of the overflow this quarter will be used to help equip these
   mission launches better, so that they may do an even greater work than
   in the past.
      The rest of the overflow will be used to establish a boarding academy
   in the North Brazil Union, eighteen miles from the city of Belem at
   the mouth of the Amazon River, where a few years ago overflow funds
   helped to establish a mission hospital.
      Won't you give a generous offering on March 28 so that there may
   be a good overflow for these two worthy projects?
