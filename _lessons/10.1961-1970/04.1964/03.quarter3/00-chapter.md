THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the Word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
Word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.


           My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I pledge
myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath school

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                September 26, 1964
                                 Far Eastern Division
      The Far Eastern Division has almost 10 percent of the world's
   population, to percent of the world membership of the Seventh-day
   Adventist Church, and more than 53 percent of the world Sabbath
   school membership. However, the percentages fall lower when we
   speak of per capita wealth. For this reason, the Far Eastern Division
   is unable to build churches and institutions to meet the needs of the
   growing membership without outside help.
      With 300,000,000 people in this territory, the medical needs and
   opportunities are tremendous. This means hospitals and clinics. Of the
   eight publishing houses throughout the field, only one has ever received
   assistance from a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow.
      The fourfold increase in membership since World War II has in-
   creased the need for training schools.
      From the many needs in this great division, the following three
   projects have been selected to benefit from the overflow on September
   26: The North Celebes Training School; the Korean publishing house;
   and the Hong Kong hospital.
                    Lessons for the Fourth Quarter, 1964
       Sabbath school members who have failed to receive a senior Lesson Quarterly
    for the fourth quarter of 1964 will be helped by the following outline in studying
    the first lesson. The title of the lessons for the quarter is "The Epistle to the
    Galatians." The title of the first lesson is "Historical Background of the Epistle."
    The memory verse is Acts 20:32. The texts to be studied are as follows:
       Ques. 1. Acts 9:15.                        Ques. 8. Acts 15:30, 35.
       Ques. 2. Acts 9:19, 20, 22.                Ques. 9. Acts 15:36.
       Ques. 3. Acts 9:26-30; Gal. 1:15-21;       Ques. 10. Acts 15:41; 16:1, 6-8.
                 Acts 11:25, 26.                  Ques. 11. Acts 17:1, 5, 10, 13 ; 18:1, 4, 6.
       Ques. 4. Acts 13 ; 14.                     Ques. 12. Acts 18:22, 23.
       Ques. 5. Acts 13 :42-48.                   Ques. 13. Acts 20:29, 30.
       Ques. 6. Acts 15:1, 5.                     Ques. 14. Acts 20:28, 31, 32.
        Ques. 7. Acts 15: 6, 10, 11, 19, 20.
