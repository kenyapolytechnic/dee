               Introduction                             NoTE.—The psalm begins—like Psalm 1—

  In the Hebrew, this psalm is in the form
of an acrostic or alphabetic poem, consist-

each, marked by the regular succession of               NOTE.—"When a sheep strays from the

For the Hebrews, the psalm probably served
as a sort of ABC book, making it easy to
memorize and recall the truths contained
in it.
  Each of the 176 verses of the psalm (ex-                           "The souls in

                THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                               June 27, 1964
           Work Among the North American Indians
   For the first time in the history of the church, the overflow this
quarter is dedicated to work for the Indians of North America.
   There are about 650,000 Indians in scattered groups in the United
States and Canada, divided into some seventy-five linguistic families.
Adhering in the past to the most primitive forms of religion, comparable
to animism (the belief that all objects are possessed with an indwelling
soul), the Indian now responds to the gospel of Christ when it is
presented in kindness by those who have his best interests at heart.
   The "everlasting gospel" of the third angel's message provides reality
to the Indian's vision of his homeland. We cannot, and we must not,
fail in inviting them to the tremendous tribal gathering of the great
Chief of us all—Christ our Lord.
   To help accomplish this mission, the Sabbath schools of the world
are invited to contribute through the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on
June 27 toward a boys' dormitory at the Navajo Mission School at
Holbrook, Arizona; a medical mission boat to minister to the Indians
along the coast in British Columbia; and the Lumbee Indian Mission
School in North Carolina.
   We believe the advent believers in all lands will welcome this op-
portunity to extend a helping hand to this mission field in the midst
of the land that cradled the advent message and from which its beams
have reached "clear round the world."
