                     Justification by Faith, Not Works

LESSON HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Test of Discipleship;" "S.D.A. Bible

                THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                           December 19, 1964
                NORTHERN EUROPEAN DIVISION
   True, the Northern European Division is a home base, from which
missionaries have gone out to many parts of the world field. Why,
then, should we give an overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offer-
ing to this division? Because the Northern European Division has two
mission fields in Africa for which it is responsible—Ethiopia and the
West African Union—with a total population of 82,860,730. With this
great multitude of people, it is easy to understand that the calls for help
are many and urgent.
   To read the list of countries that make up the West African Union
Mission, it sounds as though one were reading the daily newspaper,
for these are some of the emerging nations of Africa that are frequently
in the news today. We cannot answer all their needs, but this quarter
our Sabbath school members around the world will have the privilege
of contributing toward three specific projects; namely, a girls' dormitory
at our Ede secondary school in West Nigeria, a boys' dormitory for
our college in West Nigeria, and a leprosarium in Sierra Leone.
   On December 19, or December 26, on whichever date the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering is taken in your Sabbath school, won't you give a
really sacrificial offering in the name of the Christ child, while the way
is still open for us to give to these needy mission fields of West Africa?
