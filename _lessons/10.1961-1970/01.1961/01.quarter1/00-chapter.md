          THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible.
If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
times."—Steps to Christ, page go.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, 43. 266.



                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
  As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my
Sabbath school lesson each day of the week.

must repent before he can heed the invita-
tion of Christ, 'Come unto Me, all ye that                     "MAKE THE VERY MOST OF

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                               March 25, 1961'

   The overflow this quarter goes to the Middle East Division. This is
a field that is always of-interest to Bible students, for it is the setting for
most of the Bible stories. There are twelve countries and more than
half a dozen territories in this division. One hundred million inhabit-
ants are divided into eight large groups, with the majority speaking
Arabic. Islam is the religion of the masses. It is a vast mission field
indeed.
   The special projects to benefit from the overflow this quarter are:
     1. Construction of a church and school in Jerusalem.
     2. Rebuilding of the Mercy Orphanage Home in Cairo, Egypt.
     3. A new industry for Middle East College.
   These are all worthy projects, and as you listen to the mission stories
from Sabbath to Sabbath, we believe that you will earnestly plan to do
all you can to help strengthen and advance the work of God in the old
Bible lands by a liberal offering on March 25.
