         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible.
If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these
times."—Steps to Christ, page 9o.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 266.


               My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
  As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my
Sabbath school lesson each day of the week.

 Jesus Gives Sight to a Blind Man

   1. What reason did Jesus give for
a certain man's blindness from birth?
John 9:1-3.

   NOTE.-"It was generally believed by the
Jews that sin is punished in this life. Every
affliction was regarded as the penalty
of some wrongdoing, either of the sufferer
himself or of his parents. It is true that
all suffering results from the transgression
of God's law, but this truth had become
perverted. Satan, the author of sin and all
its results, had led men to look upon dis-                     Official Opposition

              The Parable
  1. What facts concerning shepherds
and sheepfolds did Jesus use to make
clear His relationship to His people?
John 10:1-5.
                                                                    1'

   NOTE.—"The cross is in direct line with
the shining of the divine countenances, so
that by beholding the cross men may see
and know God and Jesus Christ, whom
He hath sent. In beholding God we behold
the One who poured out His soul unto
death. In beholding the cross the view is
extended to God, and His hatred of sin
is discerned. But while we behold in the
cross God's hatred of sin, we also behold
His love for sinners, which is stronger than
death. To the world the cross is the incon-

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                             September 30, 1961

   The overflow this quarter goes to the South American Division.
South America is a great continent of opportunity and contrast. The
overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering has helped this great
continent in many ways in the past, providing medical-missionary
launches to ply the network of rivers, buildings and equipment for
various schools, and many other things.
    This quarter we will again come to the aid of the River Plate
College. The work in South America is rapidly expanding, and the
River Plate College is expanding in an endeavor to meet the need for
trained workers. The old buildings, built forty years ago, have, in fact,
expanded almost to the breaking point. Five and six students are
crowded into one room. The time has come when new buildings and
equipment are imperative.
    We know our Sabbath school members around the world will rally
to the support of this school on September 30, as they have rallied to
other calls in the past. We thank you all heartily for your support.
