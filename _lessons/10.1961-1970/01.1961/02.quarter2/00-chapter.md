            THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The be'auty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page go.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with. humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 266.

  3. How did Noah demonstrate his
faith, and what was his reward? Heb.
11:7; Gen. 7:1.


  NOTE.—So strong was Noah's trust in God
that in a wicked generation he preached
righteousness. So strong was his faith in
God's word that He built the ark, putting
into it all he possessed, when as yet rain had
never fallen on the earth, for the earth, up
to this time, was watered by a mist. Noah
demonstrated that faith without works is
dead. James 2:20.

  4. How did Abraham first manifest
implicit faith in God? Gen. 12:1, 4;
Heb. 11:8.                                        `Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do
                                                  thou anything unto him: for now I know

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
           June 24, 1961, Southern African Division
   The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the fourth quar-
ter of 1956 amounted to $68,310. 70. This generous sum of money went
to the Southern African Division to provide better homes for African
workers. For this liberal offering, the workers all over Africa were
deeply grateful, for they were badly in need of better and more per-
manent housing.
   Now, four years and two quarters later, we have the privilege of
giving a helping hand to Africa again. This time the overflow will go
to another very worthy and very needy project—the training college
in the Congo. Too long have our schools in Africa been below standard
for the adequate education and training of national workers. The time
has come when this urgent need must not be put off longer.
   The training college is located at the site of our Gitwe Mission
Station, where we have been carrying on work for nearly fifty years.
The Congo Union is the largest union mission in the world, with
65,000 baptized members. To shepherd this large membership and to
win new thousands to Christ, it is imperative that our young people
be given an education that will be comparable to that of the people for
whom they work in this enlightened day in Africa. Won't you do your
best for this new school while there is still opportunity?
