## 1961 Quater 4
           THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "God designed the Bible to be a lesson book to all mankind, in childhood,
youth, and manhood, and to be studied through all time. He gave His word
to men as a revelation of Himself. . . . It is the medium of communication
between God and man."—The Great Controversy, page 69.
    "The Bible contains all the principles that men need to understand in
order to be fitted either for this life or for the life to come. And these princi-
ples may be understood by all. . . . But the most valuable teaching of the
Bible is not to be gained by occasional or disconnected study. Its great system
of truth is not so presented as to be discerned by the hasty or careless reader.
. . . The truths that go to make up the great whole must be searched out
and gathered up, 'here a little, and there a little.' Isaiah 28:10."—Education,
page 123.

               My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures,
I pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my
Sabbath school lesson each day of the week.

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                December 23, 1961, Far Eastern Division
      The overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter has
   been dedicated to three specific projects in the Far Eastern Division.
   They are: an evangelistic center for the nearly 4,000,000 people in the
   city of Djakarta, Indonesia; a Voice of Prophecy headquarters building
   at Bangkok, Thailand; and buildings at the Ayer Manis Training
   School in Sarawak, where national workers can be trained to carry the
   gospel to the tribal peoples of North Borneo and Sarawak.
      The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering has meant much to this division
   over the years, for the overflow has helped to start many new projects
   and to strengthen many that had already been started. Today the work
   is going very rapidly in every part of this great mission field.
      Let us make a real Christmas gift to missions by giving our Thir-
   teenth Sabbath Offering on December 23.
